Before we get into the nitty-gritty of these taxes in this week 's part two of the mini-series , it helps to first understand the structure of tax administration in Tanzania . <p> In brief , the Tanzania Revenue Authority ( TRA ) is the revenue service of Tanzania responsible for assessing , collecting , and enforcing various taxes of the Central Government , while the Zanzibar Revenue Board ( ZRB ) is responsible for administering domestic consumption taxes in the Zanzibar archipelago . <p> Tanzania 's 1997 Constitution recognizes the two parts of the Union , namely Mainland Tanzania ( formerly Tanganyika ) and Zanzibar ( also known as Unguja ) . <p> Consequently , there are ' union taxes ' , which are collected by the TRA ; and ' non-union taxes ' , which are collected by the ZRB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAT . <p> Union taxes are the income taxes imposed under the Income Tax Act , 2004 , and the customs duties imposed under the East African Community Customs Management Act , 2004 . <p> Non-union taxes are the domestic consumption taxes , including VAT and excise duties . VAT in Mainland Tanzania is administered by the TRA under the Value Added Tax Act , 2014 . In Zanzibar , VAT is administered by the ZRB under the Value Added Tax Act No. 4 of 1998 . <p> Import duty is a tax that is charged on imported goods . It is computed as an ad valorem rate on customs value ( i.e. CIF : Cost , Insurance and Freight ) of goods imported into Tanzania . As a member of the East African Community ( EAC ) -- which became a Customs Union on 1 January 2005 on the implementation of the East African Customs Union Protocol -- Tanzania agreed with other EAC countries on a common external tariff ( CET ) . <p> Under the CET , imports from non-EAC countries are subjected to the same import duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is collected before the goods leave the entry point into Tanzania and/or bonded warehouses . Tanzania is also a member of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , so the country implements two CETs -- one for the EAC and the other for SADC . Subject to meeting the Rules of Origin criteria , goods originating in SADC and EAC have preferential or nil import duty rates . <p> The Excise ( Management and Tariff ) Act , Cap 174 , provides for , inter alia , the collection excise duties in Tanzania . Excise duty is a duty that is charged on specific goods and services manufactured locally or imported into Tanzania on varying rates . Excise duty rates apply on specific or ad valorem basis . <p> One of the policy rationales for imposing excise duties is to tax selected goods deemed harmful to Tanzanian society in order to create an incentive to reduce negative externalities . Cigarettes , for instance , have a harmful spillover effect , for which no compensation is paid . <p> VAT is charged on both locally produced goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of VAT as well as the determination of the value of imports for the purpose of VAT is provided for under the Value Added Tax Act , 2014 , and the EACCMA 2004 . <p> The standard rate of VAT is 18 percent ; however , depending on the industry , there are numerous exempt supplies . VAT is payable on taxable imports at the time of importation , together with any payable import duty and customs duty . <p> It 's possible to defer the VAT payable for capital goods imported in Tanzania if the importer follows prescribed procedures . In respect of taxable imported services , a ' reverse charge ' mechanism applies to a recipient in Tanzania who must account for VAT on the services . <p> The mechanism applies where the taxpayer has exempt supplies of 10 percent or more out of total supplies . The fact that some supplies are exempt from VAT means that the TRA has to be vigilant to ensure that there is no dumping in the Tanzanian economy of such supplies . <p> Most imports to Tanzania are also subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent ( save for those items that are exempted under the Fifth Schedule to the EACCMA 2004 ) , and the customs processing fee of 0.6 percent of the Free on Board ( FOB ) value . <p> Charged and collected under the Railways Act , Cap 170 , the RDL applies on customs value of imported goods , and it is thought to be impacting the cost of imports into Tanzania . The costs cascade down the supply chain and affect the lives of wananchi . <p> **45;318;TOOLONG ...

@@61525232 <h> OPINION : Why we need a structured parliamentary diplomacy for Africa <h> Monday January 20 2020 <p> By Joel Okwemba <p> Foreign Policy is Public Policy . Foreign policy has hitherto been a prerogative of the Executive arm of government despite the globalized nature and complex interactions in the 21st century that demand creative solutions in maintaining peace and stability . <p> The Executive through Parliamentary bodies and committees allows the policies to be scrutinized in an effort to create harmony within government agencies . Constitutions in democratic states now demand that the State can not engage in Wars without the approval of Parliamentary bodies . This remains the foremost engagement on International Relations for most parliaments to date . <p> However , opportunities are abounding when it comes to : how Parliaments interact with Foreign Policy questions ; how Parliaments engage with the State on these questions ; how to create form and structure on Parliamentary Diplomacy ; and in the development of academic and theoretical literature on the Parliamentary Diplomacy theory in Africa . <p> Parliamentary Diplomacy also referred to as Parlomacy creates opportunities that are alternatives and complimentary to traditional diplomatic approaches that rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology has determined the nature of interactions amongst peoples , the diplomatic options should consequently evolve to meet this level for globalization . <p> Reflections on the Evolution of Parliamentary Diplomacy <p> Ancient history dating back to the Roman Empire , depicts an instance of parliamentary diplomacy , where the Roman Senate -- though on behalf of the Roman Generals sued for peace and sanctioned war with Philip V of Macedon after the failure of the Treaty of Phoenicia ( 205 BC ) . <p> However , the recollection of Parliament as formed today traces to The Magna Carta , signed on the 12th June 1215 ( AD ) by King John " Lackland " of England and a coalition of rebel barons written by the Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton . <p> The barons displeased with the rule of the King , demanded accountability , freedom and rights that cut across political , economic , social and cultural spheres of existence . Even though the process of acceptance by the King was not immediate , the barons ' efforts would show that the population had been enlightened and willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the 63 rules agreed included aspects of International Trade , Treatment of Prisoners of Wars . <p> Since then , developments in the relations between the Rulers and the Governed has metamorphosized to have greater representation of the public in law making through modern parliament and to the election of the ruling class by the population through the secret ballot , challenges notwithstanding . <p> The role of Parliaments having extended to enhancement of global relations and stability , both positively and negatively , is now accepted as an important move in the democratization of diplomacy . <p> A report sponsored by the International Parliamentary Union ( Beetham , 2006 ) distinguishes types of parliamentary cooperation as : technical parliamentary cooperation , inter-parliamentary cooperation and parliamentary diplomacy . This further put emphasis that parliamentary diplomacy is not just limited to parliamentary cooperation and is more institutionalized currently in parts of the world . It also precisely states that : <p> " A diplomat is an envoy of the executive branch and represents the positions of the state . Members of Parliament , however , are politicians who hold political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's official position on any given issue . This allows parliamentarians a margin of flexibility that is denied to the diplomat . They tend to bring a moral dimension to international politics that transcends narrow definitions of the national interest , particularly in their principled support for democracy and human rights . Time and again we have seen that this flexibility allows parliamentarians to debate more openly with their counterparts from other countries and to advance innovative solutions to what may seem to be intractable problems " . <p> The spirit of parliamentary diplomacy undoubtedly takes the role of ' Moral Tribunes ' on Foreign Affairs , the conscience of international politics , that takes a rather long-term approach by : building trust and understanding amongst peoples through dialogues ; sharing of experiences and expertise in key areas such as youth unemployment , conflict resolution , election monitoring , cultural dialogue , migration , economic issues ; as well as bringing balance between values and interests , usually having to take positions that cd be lesser of the two evils1 . <p> Senator Gabriel Elorriaga2 of Spain has enumerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international parliamentary organizations ; Bi-lateral parliamentary groups and in particular the so-called ' friendship groups ' ; International agreements between parliaments ; The activities of parliamentary foreign affairs committees ; Plenary sessions dealing with foreign policy questions ; Parliamentary participation in elections monitoring processes . The strength of parliamentary diplomacy is perceived when distinguishable from the executive diplomacy , noting that this can also considered a weakness owing to its sporadic manner which is deficient of continuity . <p> The Low Hanging Fruits for Africa <p> In view of the ambitions of the 21st Century Africans for a robust Pan-African Agenda and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement , the opportunities that can be harnessed include : Strengthening the independence of African Parliaments to not only compliment but also offer alternatives to executive diplomacy ; Structuring the form of parliamentary diplomacy in Africa through a consistency in activities , reporting and follow-ups ; and Enhancing research by Academia and Think Tanks on parliamentary diplomacy especially in the African Continent .

CRDB Bank Plc , Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2016 ( hereinafter , ' Africhick case ' ) , the Court of Appeal of Tanzania pronounced itself on the use of mortgaged property to fulfil the requirement to deposit security before a ' stay of execution ' can be granted pending the hearing and final determination of an appeal . <p> In essence , a stay of execution is " a momentary suspension of a court order ( encompassing rights declared in favour of the judgment creditor/decree holder " ( Kibuuka , Paul . " Stay of execution of the decree of a court " . The Citizen . Saturday March 9 , 2019 ) . In what follows , I provide some background details to the Africhick case . <p> Four years ago , in 2016 , CRDB Bank Plc , the Respondent , won a suit against Africhick Hatchers Limited , the Applicant , in Civil Case No. 97 of 2014 in the Commercial Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aggrieved with the High Court 's decision , the Applicant sought to challenge the decision by first filing a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Appeal of Tanzania . <p> The Applicant also filed an application for stay of execution for the purpose of ensuring that the Respondent bank does not execute the judgment and decree while the appeal is pending . In stay applications , there is a mandatory requirement for deposit of security before a stay of execution can be granted . To satisfy this requirement to furnish security for performance of the decree of circa 1.8 billion , the Applicant offered the same property which secured the loan advanced by the Respondent ; the mortgaged property was worth sh20 billion . <p> The decision <p> In another welcome decision , the Court of Appeal of Tanzania ( Justice Mmilla and Justice Mwangesi ) ruled in favour of the Applicant and granted a stay of execution of the decree . The Court of Appeal held that an encumbered property ( i.e. a property encumbered by a security interest e.g. a mortgage upon or against interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the referent of the dispute , and whose monetary value is higher than the amount of the decree can be good security for the purpose of obtaining a stay of execution . <p> Consequently , the Court of Appeal allowed the Applicant to use the same mortgaged property as security for grant of stay of execution of the decree passed against it -- and in favour of the Respondent bank -- by the Commercial Division of the High Court . The Court of Appeal arrived at this decision after considering that the mortgaged property , which secured the loan and was in the hands of the Respondent bank , was not subject of litigation . <p> In addition , the Court of Appeal observed that to meet the condition for giving security for the due performance of the decree , " the law does not strictly demand that the security must be given prior to the grant of the stay order " . Furthermore , the Court of Appeal observed that " a firm undertaking by the Applicant to provide security might prove sufficient to move the Court , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the Court sets a reasonable time limit within which the Applicant should give the same " . <p> Clearly , the Court of Appeal adopted a pro-business and balancing approach in pronouncing itself on the use of mortgaged property to fulfil the requirement to deposit security before a ' stay of execution ' can be granted pending the hearing and final determination of an appeal . In this case , the Court of Appeal had to balance the interests of the Applicant in granting the stay vis-a-vis the interests of the Respondent bank to receive its money following the issuance of the decree in its favour . <p> The dissenting judge ( Justice Mwambegele ) adopted a conservative approach , opining that the encumbered property ( mortgage property ) , regardless of whether its value is higher than the amount of the decree , can not be used as good security since the property is no longer the property of the Applicant until the loan has been settled fully . <p> The Court of Appeal of Tanzania , through this ruling in the Africhick case , has shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of thumb ? <p> Lilian Kyaruzi ( **29;1591;TOOLONG ) is a legal director in Isi-dora &amp; Company and an inter-national development enthusi-ast .

It further noted that the compact was relevant to Zimbabwe 's re-engagement agenda and the Transitional Stabilisation Programme ( TSP ) , which was introduced in 2018 as a blue print to turn around the economy . <p> But a crisis of governance and financial stewardship has long been stalking Zimbabwe , a Southern African nation that was once a model of economic success and democracy in Africa . Life has become difficult for its citizens who have to battle with a high cost of living and many things are in short supply from water to electricity to monetary currency , jobs , food and even political freedoms . <p> The report pointed out that Zimbabwe 's economic woes are multi-faceted -- a result of a combination of factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , political instability and fiscal mismanagement driven by corruption . <p> Cold reception for compact <p> Yet despite its relevance , the compact has failed to raise enthusiasm among Zimbabwean policymakers , and few economic stakeholders are aware of it , the study found , pointing out that the Zimbabwe government is desperate and preoccupied with finding a quick solution to the economic crisis . <p> The study also made a note that there is no reform culture among the custodians of reforms in Zimbabwe . <p> Besides , the country 's multilateral debt , estimated at over $8,2 billion , has prevented any potential inroads with the international organisations involved with the compact . <p> " Clearance of multilateral debt arrears : the sanctions rhetoric seems to have taken the centrestage ahead of reform implementation , " noted the study , adding that , " This behaviour has promoted corruption and stands in the way of reforms ; hence there is no CwA for Zimbabwe .

@@61678236 <h> Music industry shifting from copyright lobbying to radionomics <p> THAT there is a difference between old time dance music and the rapping generation has nowhere been underlined than in musicians moving into industry themselves , not just depending upon producers and market savvy entrepreneurs for their livelihoods . <p> A section of domestic artistes , who took part in the 2018 edition of the Sauti Busara festival in Zanzibar , appreciate spectators ' support after the artistes ' show . <p> There are still some soft voices being heard here and there , for instance the holding of a rather intensive ' estates general ' of the industry courtesy of Radio One and its associates mid last year on the subject . It was perhaps the last word said in that direction , and unlikely to come up for intense mention too soon . <p> The reason is that fortunes of musicians are more or less unpredictable in the sense that some are making good money , some even making plenty of money , while those on the wrong side of the market make a few coins , to get on with daily chores . As it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no formula to enable everyone to succeed , nor are there sorely difficult conditions where the majority is likely to fail . It is a matter of talent , the direction it takes and how the market welcomes it at that point , sealing the musician 's fate . <p> From what is apparent in the market , the more important hindrance of musicians ' development is their kind of audience , for instance how far they can compose hits , get a producer , place them online and earn significant amounts of money from such productions . There is an uneven transition from relying on attendance in music halls of invitations for ceremonies and directly accessing the market on line or hard copy via the cutting industry . Still the visibility of records being sold in the streets is low or declining , as youths select songs for flash discs or smart phones . <p> Selective purchasing of songs for routine accessibility instead of listening to random music from radio stations means that the competition is less between bands than between songs . This aspect has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercising music talent , for instance in live shows , where it is n't just one or other song but band or group image which matters more . Thus radios take a different role or sight aspect to musicians compared to the past , namely that they cease to be the market from which they ought to get a livelihood . <p> On the contrary , radios become publicity centers for productions of musicians , exposing them to audiences , often obtaining time to talk on their latest numbers and what intuition informs the numbers , etc . There is also a fan club aspect in such appearances , as interviewers or talk show hosts are keen about the people around this or that hip hop star in particular , so all the gossip matters that circulate in the grapevine or in tabloids are put on the table for extended discussion . This vocation is symbiotic in character as it enables otherwise starved FM stations win audiences while being a lifeline for artists to sell their works , their perspectives on life , etc . <p> That puts paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veteran music groups ' organizations in the city of Dar es Salaam , Dance Music Association of Tanzania ( CHAMUDATA ) , with culture and youth authorities in government . Just as regulatory authorities keep tabs on charges made to mobile phone users in purchase of airtime , similarly there were tabs being developed on the use artistes ' productions , and how much they ought to be paid . If such a proposition is taken far enough , that is , ' fair payment ' for use of the work of an artiste , it would singularly price them out of the market for lack of air time , as most radios live on a pittance , and hardly can afford to pay for music . <p> It is also evident that ability to earn money directly online has eased the pressure on the better placed local musicians , and thus any lingering pressure for keeping tabs on local radios and seeking ' fair payment ' for musicians will have a thinning base of supporters all the time . Thus when the past musicians estates general again raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , and the pundits favoring that approach were those drawn from the old school , dance music veterans , in the main .

While in the old days any talk on radio concerning music could be followed and enjoyed by the commonest of laymen , it is n't quite the case when online savvy performers are interviewed . Without being somewhat initiated in the industry , one quite simply loses his way .

Instead of looking for a better paying job , the daring young man chose to invest in the sector that many do n't find attractive . <p> Five years down the line , Obison 's success can only serve as a testimony that farming is not a job for those who have retired from employment like many think . <p> He in fact calls upon fellow youth to fully tap the potential in agriculture . Obison says instead of just complaining about lack of jobs , both unemployed youth and those employed should try their hands on farming . It does n't hurt earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are jobless , they can surely make a living through agriculture , says Obison . <p> You do n't have to be a villager to engage in agriculture . Neither is being a villager a sin for that is where we all originate from . There is no harm putting food at the table through farming . <h> Also Read <p> Unlike many who give the sector a blind eye , Obison was smart enough to see the potential in agriculture and is now happily reaping the benefits . The Dar es Salaam-based young entrepreneur started with cassava farming after quitting his logistics and supply job with a certain company in the city . <p> Having been raised in a family that engaged in farming and livestock keeping , Obison , who was born in the city did not find it difficult treading the same path . Since they lived in Makongo Juu , the family had a farm in neighbouring Goba , where they kept domestic animals . <p> Being the first born , Obison learned many things about animal husbandry . He participated fully in this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He learnt a lot from his parents , which later served as a benchmark for his entrepreneurship spirit . <p> " I saw the opportunity in agriculture because not a single day passes without people buying food as food is everything in everyone 's life .

Using his savings , he bought a Sh 3 million one acre farm in Mzenga village , Kisarawe District . <p> Cassava business was good as market was readily available , especially during the holy month of Ramadan . <p> He switched to vegetables after learning there was a huge market for vegetables in the city . He learnt that some farmers came all the way from Dodoma , Kibaigwa , Morogoro , Gairo and Chalinze to sell vegetables in the city due to high demand . <p> This made Obison look for farms in Rufiji and Mlandizi where he grew almost every kind of vegetables including , cucumber , string beans , eggplants , okla , squash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cauliflower , sweet corn and bell peppers . <p> Bright future in agriculture <p> Speaking about his customer base , Obison groups them into two .

I also supply to markets in Ilala , Temeke and Tegeta . " <p> Although his farming business has been successful , like many businesses , his also faces some challenges , the major one being bad weather . Although rain is good for his crops , it sometimes becomes a stumbling block due to poor infrastructure . <p> It costs him dearly when it rains as vegetables fail to get to the market on time and hence rot or get there in poor quality .

He is not yet done with buying farms as he plans to buy more land for agriculture in future . <p> Obison earns enough from his farming business to sustain his needs and those of his immediate family .

He advises that they should take it as any other income generating activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on business people who sell fake seeds , fertiliser and pesticides . He also makes a call to financial institutions to leverage conditions for issuing loans , explaining that farmers should be given concessional loans depending on the nature of their investments . <p> The government should also provide capital to young people interested in farming as the country has been blessed with enough land for agriculture , a big part of which is yet to be utilised . <p> He says if we for example use the youth in national service to invest in agriculture , the country will reap the benefit both financially and in terms of producing enough food for the nation and for import . The national service youth , he proposes that they can be engaged in various ways , as producers , marketers and any other skills they may have to produce enough for both local consumption and export . <p> " The government sends many youth to compulsory military training every year .

TOM Harrison , the ECB 's chief executive , has estimated that an entire season without cricket will cost the game in England and Wales " well in excess of ? 300 million " . <p> In a letter to PCA chief executive Tony Irish , seen by ESPNcricinfo , Harrison admitted that the ECB is " having to reset our future plans across the whole game in order to ensure its long-term survival " in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic , which threatens to wipe out much of the English summer . <p> The ECB unveiled an initial ? 61m support package on Tuesday night , aimed at ensuring both professional and recreational cricket can withstand the impact of the ongoing crisis . But with its reserves worth ? 11m in 2018-19 - down from ? 73m in 2015-16 - the potential cost of a season without cricket is a major concern . <p> As things stand , the season 's start has been pushed back to May 28 at the earliest , though that is little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the season might look like with possible start dates in June , July and August , as well as planning for games to be played behind closed doors . <p> In his letter , dated March 29 , Harrison described the ongoing pandemic as " the biggest challenge the sport has faced in the modern era " and admitted that " although the full extent and impact of the pandemic on cricket is as yet unknown , it is already clear that it will be extremely significant " . <p> " At the start of 2020 , cricket in England and Wales was in a very strong financial position , " Harrison wrote . " Our recent renewals of media rights contracts and commercial partnerships all but guarantee our revenues and provide a high level of relative security for the next five years . With this relative security , we have been able to build a strategy for growth , based on strong investment in our core , to grow cricket and thus secure our long-term future . <p> " This strategy has seen hugely increased investment and commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with substantial improvements both to the pay and the conditions under which professional cricketers are employed across first-class county clubs ( including raised salary collar and caps ) . <p> " We have also been clear that investment into grassroots cricket is critical to creating a sustainable sport , hence our commitment to recreational programmes , to reinvigorating cricket in schools , to the women 's and girls ' game and creating the next generation of volunteers . <p> " The investment , however , is fundamentally based on the proviso that cricket is played and thus the value proposition delivered to our broadcast and commercial partners . Whilst a range of scenarios is contemplated to account for lost matches or series across the term , a situation like the one we are facing is beyond the scope of any risk assessment and therefore has extremely serious consequences for the game 's revenues . With this public health crisis , and its likely impact on this coming season , we are thus forced to review every investment and every line of cost .

" You can normally make business models and forecasts where you might get a 15-20% fall in revenue , " he said . " But there are very few businesses that would put a complete drop in revenues to zero on a risk register . <p> " I do n't think there is a big enough reserves pot to anticipate this sort of challenge . And it is important to base any judgement on our reserves policy against the money that has gone into the network : we have a thriving network , a high-performing sport and well-paid players .

However , with the Government 's National Health Insurance Fund , more people than ever are now able to access treatment that previously was n't available to them . <p> While prevention of kidney disease through living a healthy and balanced lifestyle is the long-term goal , in the meantime , there is a growing acknowledgement and effort to improve access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it .

The EAC region largely depends on national parks and reserves , as well as wildlife conservancies that traverse the entire region . <p> Home to some of the beautiful wildlife sites in the world , the EAC region hosts a quarter of all protected areas in Africa and some of the greatest global concentrations of large mammals in both protected and non-protected areas .

These include employment opportunities in the hotels and other tourism related establishments , entrepreneurship in the form of sell of artifacts , and most importantly in some community 's benefit from revenue sharing schemes that have been established under the conservation areas . <p> The EAC has made major strides in putting up infrastructure in the region such as increased road connectivity between and within the Partner States , which has opened up tourism areas and enhanced access to tourist sites . <p> The EAC Deputy Secretary General in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism sector 's contribution to GDP in the region is estimated at 9 per cent , and an average of 20 per cent of export earnings .

The EAC partner states are therefore encouraged to undertake aggressive domestic tourism campaigns in order to stimulate demand for tourism goods and services by the domestic market . In addition , the EAC proposes strengthening market access for small and medium enterprises , local communities , women and youth by enhancing their marketing and promotion skills through digital platforms . <p> " As we re-think and re-engineer the tourism sector following the pandemic , we will continue putting a lot emphasis on the local communities to ensure that they optimally benefit from the tourism sector in line with the spirit of the EAC Treaty that puts the EAC Citizens at the centre " , said Bazivamo . <h> Top Stories <p> Mwanza Regional Commissioner , John Mongella ( 1st-R ) listening to GGML senior communication officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities at the ongoing third Mining and Technology Exhibition being held in the region .

My past relationships have failed and I have no desire to enter into a relationship or marriage anymore . " <p> What 's really happening <p> Human beings will mirror the people of their environment and will be affected by the environment they are in .

This is what brings about confidence or low self-esteem to individuals . <p> With that being said it 's correct to say that parents ' relationship has an impact on the outcome of children . <p> Social worker Zackayo Shigongo says , " There is no perfect family , because there are no perfect human beings , " adding , " This is to say stable and healthy families are obtained when both parents keep an effort to ensure that their partnership is withstanding all the perils and sailing to the undefined shore with harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although ideal families or stable families are the epitome and major goals in our societies , Mr Shigongo says family feuds , misunderstandings and conflicts are inevitable . <p> " Lack of resolutions while discussing the problems within a marriage leads to separation and eventually divorce . " he says . <p> Ms Shigongo adds , " Divorce just does not happen , it is a result of series of events and misunderstandings that graduate to physical and emotional violence such as battering , deprivation of marital needs , forceful sexual acts , exploitation and economic violence such as selling properties without consulting the other partner and deprivation of family basic needs can be some factors that will be observed in the journey of a falling home . " <p> Sociologist Julius Mbilinyi points out that most people get married for other factors other than love and this is why most marriages fail ; " People get married due to social , peer and religious pressure , " Mr Mbilinyi explains . <p> He adds that in the past , men were mostly being pointed fingers at for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chime in to the marriage problems . <p> " Exploitation reasons are also a factor in marriage failure , people enter marriage with a start goal and an end goal , they also tend to enter marriage with expectation and oblivious to dynamism .

These reasons lead to failure of so many marriages and in turn children become collateral damage and are affected either short term or long term , " Mr Mbilinyi says . <p> According to a study published by the American Psychological Association , children who are emotionally abused and neglected face similar , and sometimes worse , mental health problems than those who are physically or sexually abused . The study defined the following as psychological abuse by a parent or caregiver : bullying , terrorising , coercive control , verbal assault and threats , humiliation , overwhelming demands , shunning and/or isolation . <p> The study says that the hidden scars of this type of abuse can manifest in numerous ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of basic skills , difficulty forming relationships , withdrawal , destructive and harmful behaviour ( such as pyromania and cruelty to animals ) , alcohol or drug abuse , and in extreme cases , suicide . <p> A happy home to activism <p> Hannah Mwandoloma , 40 , a single mother turned activist and advocate of proper parenting started an initiative known as ' Funguka Na Hannah ' so as to spread awareness on parenting and parents ' relationships . <p> " This platform allows people , parents and children to open up on their challenges as well as discuss issues on parenting , " Ms Mwandoloma tells . <p> The founder has had a stable childhood and that is the reason she understands what exactly it takes to have a harmonious home for children and how exactly to deal with all the nooks that come with parenting . <p> Ms Mwandoloma lost one parent when she was young but as long as she remembers , both her parents stayed in harmony . <p> She recalls a stable , happy home and despite both her parents having children from previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her half siblings well . <p> Ms Mwandoloma believes that the relationship of parents has an effect on children because the first socialisation of a child begins with a parent . <p> " The parent 's impact on a child begins in the womb .

It is very important for people entering marriage to understand that there will be cultural and status dynamics within marriage , there will be changes either physically , emotionally or mentally , the sociologist and social worker explain . <p> Some factors like hormonal changes or different maturity stages have to be faced with understandings .

And digital networks have allowed people to stay in touch , and some businesses to operate , in the face of lockdowns and social-distancing guidelines . <p> Yet these technologies have also facilitated the spread of misinformation . Messages disseminated on WhatsApp claimed that people could self-test by holding their breath for more than 10 seconds , that " African blood and black skin prevent Covid-19 " and that inhaling steam or drinking alcohol could kill the virus . <p> Misinformation can be dangerous , as evidenced by hydroxychloroquine poisonings in Nigeria .

Misinformation , in other words , poisons the well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where messaging was often centralised and speech freedoms were limited in the first decades after independence , the Internet and social media provide individuals and organisations with new opportunities to share points of view and information that holds governments to account .
