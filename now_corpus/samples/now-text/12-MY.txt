Furthermore , 2011 has been an exciting year for the property market in Malaysia . Not every news can be considered as good news , though . <p> Let us go through these news which can be found the whole year of 2011 : <p> 1 ) MRT finally got off the ground <p> The government finally decided to integrate the capital city 's public transportation system by having the Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit ( KVMRT ) . <p> It is to be the final piece to the puzzle as Klang Valley public transport has always been fragmented . Launching it in July 2011 , Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said he hoped that it will finally solve the woes of the city dweller by allowing them to park their car from wherever they are staying and ride public transport to work . <p> News on the MRT project , among others were : Its alignment as to where the train will pass and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few heritage sites ; the issue of land surface acquisition vs. underground land for the projects which now were brought to the court of law by businesses in Jalan Sultan ( Chinatown ) , Jalan Imbi and Jalan Bukit Bintang ; the possibility land prices rising wherever the MRT will pass ; the issue of MRT Corporation getting involved in property development ; and whether the right companies were chosen to receive the contracts for the RM40 billion project . <p> It is good that the government has finally got its act together to launch the MRT . It is badly needed to help the Klang Valley grow outwardly and to create more connectivity in the urban areas of the Greater Klang Valley . However , except for area like Taman Tun Dr. Ismail , it seems that the land acquisition in places where there are already other public transport makes it overlapping and redundant . <p> 2 ) My First Home Scheme <p> My First Home Scheme was announced for houses between the price of RM100,000 to RM220,000 for first-time homeowner with the maximum price for this scheme was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 per cent housing loan scheme is provided by various financial institutions in Malaysia . The arrangement is for the first 10 per cent payment to buy the property to be guaranteed by Cagamas Berhad and has a maximum tenure of 30 years . Eligible for the Malaysia citizen below the age of 35 years old with household income of less than RM3,000 . <p> The scheme seems to attract very few applicants as financial institutions appear to be not too keen to promote it . The government should actually partner it with either PR1MA or SPNB so that they can easily sell their affordable houses . <p> 3 ) Perumahan Rakyat 1 Malaysia ( PR1MA ) <p> Launched in May 2011 and is known as 1Malaysia People 's Housing Scheme/Perumahan Rakyat 1 Malaysia , ( PR1MA ) . First time house buyer <p> Unlike the My First Home Scheme , the executor for this project is a new entity which acts very much like a housing developer . PR1MA identifies locations around Malaysia and build houses for people who fulfill certain criteria . <p> 1Malaysia Housing Program Corporation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be built by PR1MA itself and the other one is a joint venture between PR1MA and Sime Darby Property in Bandar Ainsdale , Seremban . The property is allocated to the masses through balloting . <p> The price of the houses in this scheme are between RM100,000 to RM220,000 . The criteria to be eligible for this scheme is that the applicant must be Malaysians who have never owned a house before ( first time homebuyer ) and has a household income of RM6,000 . <p> Some of the features for the houses build by PR1MA include the exemption of stamp duty , eligibility of 105 per cent loan from selected financial institutions with the 5 per cent to be utilised to pay insurance and legal fees and a lock-in period , where the housebuyers can not sell the house within the first 10 years of ownership . An Act of Parliament has been enacted for this scheme and was passed in early December 2011 . <p> Begun much earlier to build affordable houses for the government , at the end of 2011 SPNB can be seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prime Minister when the PR1MA bill was tabled in early December , PR1MA will concentrate to build affordable hosing in the urban area whilst SPNB will still build affordable housing in the rural area . <p> The statement by the PM is supposed to solved the problem on the overlapping functions of these two government agencies . <p> It was announced at the end of 2011 , SPNB had entered into an agreement with Bank Simpanan Nasional ( BSN ) which will provide financing for the 10,000 units of houses which SPNB had been tasked to build in 2012 . <p> The cost for the project was estimated at RM650 million with the government subsidising RM200 million of it and the balance will be financed with the housing loans provided . Each house is estimated to cost around RM65,000 . <p> For the past few years , SPNB has been offering affordable houses in a various categories which overlap what PR1MA has to offer . Among them were Rumah Mampu Milik ( Affordable Houses ) and Rumah Mesra Rakyat ( Rakyat-friendly Houses ) . <p> An example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shah Alam and the latter can be found in various small towns in Selangor , Sabah and Sarawak . SPNB is also the agency in charge to revive abandoned projects around the country and to act as the contractor to build more government quarters . <p> 5 ) 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) <p> Announced in 2010 as a fully government-owned sovereign wealth management fund with fingers in various pies which includes ; a joint-venture with PetroSaudi International Limited to invest in oil and gas and real estate which has since made 1MDB RM425 million profit through part divestment ; the building of Kuala Lumpur International Financial District ( KLIFD ) in the 30 hectares of the Imbi area bordering Jalan Tun Razak , Jalan Sultan Ismail and the MEX highway ; and the building of Bandar Malaysia at the current Sungai Besi airport which will offer affordable houses . <p> 1MDB was in the news at the end of 2011 due to the funding that they were said to have received from the government as subsidy at the tune of RM1.11 billion in Budget 2012 although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lack of work on KLIFD ; and the acquisition of the 495-acre land parcel which was the Royal Malaysia Armed Force ( RMAF ) Sg . Besi airport which will now be turned into Bandar Malaysia . <p> Highlights of 1MDB for the whole of 2011 were when opposition claimed that 1MDB seems to be getting funding which it does not need ; the tender process announced by 1MDB for major foundation work for KLIFD due to take off in early 2012 ; and when the price of houses at Bandar Malaysia was announced to be between RM220,000 and RM300,000 which is another affordable housing project by the government . <p> Depending on how you see it , there is a lot of overlap between the government agencies in providing affordable housing to the masses . <p> One other question which begs an answer is how will the government ensure that nobody will abuse the offer of so many affordable houses by various government-linked companies . There is also the issue about the term of ' affordable housing ' when the government raised the limit of My First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplating to raise the household income eligible for the scheme up to RM7,000 . <p> 6 ) Return of the mega property projects <p> At the start of 2011 , the mega property projects seem to have lost some steam due to the property slowdown . It seemed then that the days of the launches for mega property projects in Malaysia are numbered . <p> Then a few announcements in the second half of the year of 2011 which made headlines dispelled this notion . Some of these property developments were old news with new owners or new managements . <p> Some were new projects which seemed to have been planned a long time ago but were just recently launched in 2011 . Here are two of the most notables mega property project launches in 2011 . <p> One of it that made the news was the launch of a new mega development project by NAZA TTDI called KL Metropolis at where the Matrade building is now situated . Spanning 75.5 acres , it is envisioned itself as the new international trade and exhibition district . To be developed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 3 phases . The gross development value is estimated at RM15 billion and was launched by the Prime Minister in October 2011 . <p> SP Setia has also finally launched its long awaited KL Eco City in November 2011 , at a narrow piece of land formerly known as Kampung Haji Abdullah Hukum . Located opposite of the always busy Midvalley City , one can just imagine the hectic traffic situation of the area bordering Bangsar and the New Pantai Expressway , once it is completed . <p> It will comprise mixed-used commercial and residential properties which will be placed in a few towers within the 10.1 hectares of land . It is also said to be the first mixed-used commercial property to receive the currently sought after Malaysia Green Building Index ( GBI ) standard and will be completed in 10 years . <p> It seems that it is not the best of times to launch mega property projects with the end of the year 2011 on the Eurozone debts and the uncertainty of the financial crisis all over the world . Unless these developers have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell their properties . <p> 7 ) Real Property Gain Tax <p> The tax treatment on the disposal of property was changed in 2010 after the Real Property Gain Tax ( RPGT ) was given a holiday for a few years due to the lackluster property market condition as the world 's economy took a tumble . <p> When it was reintroduced in January 2010 , the tax treatment for RPGT was totally a different animal than what it was before April 2007 where RPGT was tiered according to how long you have owned a property . RPGT is calculated based on the profit you make when you dispose of a property at a maximum of 30 per cent within the first year of ownership but becomes zero per cent on the sixth year of ownership . <p> When it was reinforced ( the law was never abolished but was just put on hold ) in 2010 , the tax treatment for the disposal of property was given a flat 5 per cent tax from the profit you make if the sale was done within the first five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is collected also differs with 2 per cent of the transacted price to be paid before being refunded by Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri once it is checked and cleared . <p> Now , in 2012 , after it was announced in the 2012 Budget in October 2011 , the RPGT was changed again . Starting from January 2012 , RPGT will now be two-tiered . Within the same vein when it was reintroduced in 2010 , RPGT , which is taxed on any profit gained from the sale of a property will beat the rate of 10 per cent for any disposal below two years of ownership . Any property disposed after two years of ownership but less than five years will still have a 5 per cent levy but none will be levied after five years of ownership . <p> RPGT is good to curb speculation . The government should be moving back to pre-2007 RPGT calculation in the near future as the tiered RPGT had curbed speculation effectively . The government may also want to introduced more property tax such as property inheritance tax when the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new source of income for the government . <p> 8 ) Regulation for banks in giving out property loans <p> In 2011 , in order to slow down the overheating property market and to stop property speculator in damaging the affordable houses schemes , the government changed the rule on the amount of property loans . Bank Negara Malaysia made it into a rule that financial institutions can only gives out housing loan in the margin of 70 per cent for anyone who has more than two properties . Anyone who already owns two properties bought using housing loans will be limited to a margin of 70 per cent for his third property loan . However , his does not deter anyone who has cash to buy more than two houses and still speculate . <p> The rule had affected sales of properties in some ways . There was also news about the change of how loans related to household debt is going to be given out by banks in 2012 . <p> It was decided , in not so many words , the criteria on the margin of loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan will now change due to the way a housing loan application is calculated . On the table but not yet announced or implemented is the new rule where the calculation for an application of a housing loan will be based on nett income of a borrower and not the current usage of gross income . It may even mean that one person or one household with incomes below RM5,000 can now only own one property below the price of RM300,000 . <p> This rule will be in line with the promotion of affordable houses by the government though but will affect the business of housing development . In order to separate the genuine buyers with the speculators , housing loans can be separated from the nett income calculation so that it affect everyone 's credit rating . <p> These are all the news I consider worthy to be mentioned as the biggest property news in Malaysia during 2011 . Some are already being implemented and some are coming days .

@@4543236 Afghanistan <p> By Zan Azlee <p> Published : 2 January 2012 8:18 AM <p> Simantov in his one-room flat . -- Pictures by Zan AzleeJAN 2 -- ( Last week , I received news from my friend and fixer , Ahmad Bilal Raghbat , that his father , Abdul Baqi Raghbat , an adviser to the Afghan Ministry of Tribal and Border Affairs , was assassinated by the Taliban in his hometown of Kandahar . May God bless his soul . ) <p> I had heard rumours that there was a Jew , apparently the last Jew in Afghanistan , living in Kabul when I was planning my trip there . I knew that I had to make sure I meet this person . Pursuing the story about the last Jew was n't meant to be a scoop since it 's been reported before . <p> But what I was really interested in was to just meet him and listen to his story first hand and to shake his hand myself . So , when I finally arrived in Kabul , and all the 9/11 anniversary hype had died down , I told my fixer , Ahmad Bilal Raghbat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We walked around Flower Street where Simantov was reportedly living and started asking the people there if they knew of such a person . After a few false alarms , we finally found a restaurant owner who just pointed to a flight of stairs at the back . <p> We walked up one floor and marched through a narrow and dusty corridor . We arrived at a pastel-coloured wooden door . I knocked . A slightly overweight , middle-aged Caucasian-looking man opened the door . I asked him if he knew Zebolon Simantov . <p> " Yes , that 's me , " he said in Pashto , which was translated to me by Bilal . <p> Simantov with his best friend Abdul Shukor ( right ) . I was finally meeting face to face with Zebolon Simantov , the last and only Jew living in the entire Afghanistan . I introduced myself as a journalist from Malaysia and said that I would like to interview him on camera . He nodded and invited us in . <p> He lived in a single room which had a small television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattress tucked in a corner . We sat at the dining table as he served us some biscuits and tea . Then , right as I was about to start recording with my camera , he stopped me . <p> " To interview me , you need to pay me US$500 ( RM1,584 ) , " he said . <p> This caught me by surprise . As a journalist , I have always held on to the belief that paying for interviews is unethical . I told him that I 'm a freelance journalist from Malaysia and that I did n't have a lot of money . <p> Then , he would have to decline the interview , he replied . Apparently , journalists the world over , and especially those from Europe , pay him up to US$1,000 for an interview . Bloody rich Western journalists ! They were spoiling the market , I thought to myself . But I had come this far . So I thought it would n't hurt to negotiate a little bit . <p> I really did n't have a lot of money so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token fee of US$50 and that was it . He laughed at my pathetic offer and said that he would only settle for a minimum of US$300 and nothing less . <p> To cut a long story short , I spent half an hour haggling with the last Jew in Afghanistan over an interview price when he finally agreed to take US$100 from me . Simantov insisted that he be paid upfront before the interview and so I handed the money over . As soon as it was in his pocket , the show began . <p> He started taking out all his old Jewish artifacts , which included pictures of Jewish rabbis I did n't know , an old copy of the Torah and several loose pages of scriptures . He placed it all on the table in front of him and told me to ask him anything I wanted . <p> And so the story begins . <p> Sitting in his very simple one-room flat , Simantov explained that his family originated from Herat , a town in west Afghanistan , near the Iranian border . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish families in Afghanistan when he was a young boy , which was roughly 60 years ago . <p> " Jews have a long history in Afghanistan , around 1,500 years to be exact . But since the formation of Israel in 1948 , they have gradually moved away . And now I am the only one left , " he explained . <p> The Jews always had a good relationship with the Afghan Muslims in the country and there were never really any problems arising between the two religious groups . In fact , the Jews played a very important role in the country 's economy . <p> " My family and I had a business trading in carpets . So when the rest of the Jews started migrating , I stayed back because my business was doing well , " he added . <p> But , eventually as the Jewish population in Afghanistan started to dwindle , his family ( he has a wife and two daughters ) wanted to move to Israel . Simantov decided not to follow them and he continued to stay back to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an Afghan Jew . So I stay in Afghanistan , " he said , stressing really hard on the word " Afghan " . <p> He even stayed during the hard and extreme Muslim rule of the Taliban , which got me really interested in finding out more about his life during these years . I questioned him but he was adamant not to talk about the Taliban . <p> " Ask me anything but I will not talk about the Taliban years , " he said with an angry glare . <p> So even though I had paid him for the interview ( which , as a journalist , I still feel very guilty about ) , I could not persuade to him to talk about that period in his life . I had to just let go of the subject and move on to other things . I can only speculate that it must have been extremely difficult for him to not want to talk about it . <p> However , Simantov is very quick to express that he has a lot of Muslim friends . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , Abdul Shukor , was also there just hanging out and having tea . <p> " All my best friends are Muslims . But it really makes no difference , Hindus , Christians , Muslims , they 're all the same , " he said . <p> " Many foreigners come to this country and stay . They are German , American , British , but they can never be Afghan . It 's not important that Zebolon is a Jew . He is Afghan first , " added Shukor . <p> A framed menorah in Simantov 's room.Then , Simantov pushed his chair back roughly and stood up . I was startled and thought that I had somehow offended him . He grabbed a scarf and the copy of the Torah he had on the table . He kissed it a few times and put the scarf around his neck . Then he motioned me to follow him . <p> We walked out of his one-room flat and along the short corridor and we reached a locked door . Simantov took out a bunch of keys and unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked like a very dusty and bare synagogue . So this was what he wanted to show me . <p> " This used to be a busy synagogue . But now , I 'm the only who uses it , " he said . <p> The walls were adorned with what looked like very old Jewish scriptures and in the centre of the synagogue was a big worn-out framed picture of a menorah . Simantov opened a cabinet by a wall , and inside were stacks of old Torahs . He carefully took one in his hand and flipped through the yellow pages for me to see . <p> " I may be alone in Afghanistan but I practise my Judaism as best as I can . I even slaughter my own chickens so I have kosher meat to eat , " he said . <p> After looking around the synagogue for a short while , we walked back to his flat . Simantov seemed to have a very gruff personality . He was loud and did not speak as politely as most people . Maybe living far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ever consider moving to Israel . <p> He took out his Torah and flipped to a marked page . He pulled out a sepia-toned photograph and kissed it gently . Then he showed it to me . It was a photograph of his wife and two daughters , obviously taken quite some time ago . <p> " They ask me to move and stay with them all the time . But as I said before , I am an Afghan and this is my country , " he said softly . <p> Then he let out a loud laugh and changed the topic immediately . <p> " So , what about these Americans huh ? They come and occupy Afghanistan and just create more problems for us here ! " he said , back to his usual gruff self . <p> I smiled , turned off my camera , took a sip of the tea which Simantov had poured for me , winked at Bilal ( who was starting to look tired because he had been interpreting all this while ) , and listened for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part 5 of Zan Azlee 's " Guide to Afghanistan : The Adventures of a KL-ite .

@@4543240 <h> Finding Rambo in Afghanistan ! <p> By Zan Azlee <p> Published : 9 January 2012 9:59 AM <p> JAN 9 -- No matter how much I read and watch the news about Afghanistan , the one thing that always frames my perspective when it comes to the country is its Islamic extremism . And I know that this is how many people around the world perceive it as well . <p> So , during my time in Afghanistan , one of the issues that interested me was the fact that so much of the country 's culture had been suppressed , or even eradicated , by the Taliban during their rule . <p> Rambo is alive and well in Kabul ! -- Pics by Zan LeeAnd now that the United States has blown the Taliban out of political power , a lot of this culture , which was deemed haram by the Taliban , is making a comeback . I spoke to Ahmad Bilal Raghbat , my local fixer , about this and the first thing that came to his mind was movies . <p> " I love watching movies but during the Taliban time , cinemas were shut down , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of Kabul.After days of driving and walking around Kabul with Bilal , I noticed that there was actually quite a big cinema in the middle of the city right next President Hamid Karzai 's office . It 's called Ariana and you can hardly miss it due to all the brightly coloured movie posters adorning the walls on the outside . <p> So I asked Bilal if we could arrange for a meeting with whoever was running Ariana Cinema . He said it should be possible and true enough , after a cold call knock on the door of the cinema 's director , Kadirullah Amiri , we were granted permission to shoot inside . <p> " The cinema has a 50-year history , but it was destroyed during the war with the Russians and when the Taliban came to power , it was just abandoned , " he said . <p> The National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul.As soon as the Taliban left and foreign forces took control of the country , foreign aid , mainly from the French government , came in to rebuild the cinema . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cinema and Amiri is proud to say that it receives around 5,000 cinema-goers a week . <p> However , I noticed that a lot of the posters on the walls of the cinema were of very dated movies from India and Hollywood . There were even posters of old Rambo movies and Dolph Lundgren action movies ! <p> " We screen a lot of Hindi and American movies . And the popular movies with the local Afghans seem to be the old American war movies ! " laughs Amiri . <p> I guess the Afghans like to see their own country starring on the big screen . Who knows , they probably feel a sense of national pride as they see a young and buff Sylvester Stallone running around topless and firing bazookas at Russian communists in the mountains of Afghanistan ! <p> I meet one of the patrons of the cinema ( the movie that was screened that day was the Bollywood blockbuster " Krissh ! " ) as he was entering the building . He had a friendly and smiling face so I decided to ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and agreed to talk to me . <p> " The Taliban banned cinema when they were in power . What do you think ? Is cinema and movies un-Islamic ? " I asked quite directly . <p> " Well , the government censors most films that have sex scenes so I guess it is n't against Islam . But anyway , if they 're already showing these movies , we have an obligation to watch . Or else it would just be wasted , would n't it ? " laughed Mohammed Daud . <p> I laughed at his answer . It was obvious that Western cultural imperialism has already started taking strong root in Afghanistan after only 10 years of foreign forces occupying the country . Oh well , in a way , it 's " winning the hearts and minds " of the locals , definitely ! <p> Ismail Daud of the National Museum of Afghanistan.I thanked Daud and continued to walk the halls of Ariana Cinema together with Amiri . There was a big plaque on the wall near the entrance that thanked the French government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apt since France is usually considered the birthplace of film as an art . <p> " Look at the top of all the doors leading into the cinema hall , " Amiri motioned . <p> I was pleasantly surprised to see that each door was dedicated to a film icon -- Buster Keaton , Jean Luc Goddard , Satyajit Ray , and so on . I wondered if the Afghans who entered the cinema today actually knew who these names were . I also wondered how the Afghan film industry was . <p> " Unfortunately , the film industry here is almost non-existent . We do have several people making films but they 're all amateurs . They probably churn out one film a year . Hopefully , it will grow in the future , " explained Amiri . <p> After a good few hours spent chatting with Amiri and walking around the cinema , I thanked him and left . I had another appointment that day and it was also related to arts and culture . I headed for the National Museum of Afghanistan , which was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , we were greeted by Ismail Daud , an employee of the museum , who has been working there for the past 20 years .

There were idols and statues of Buddha , which was testament to Afghanistan 's pre-Islamic history , and also coins , armour , ornaments and daily utensils which painted a nice picture of the civilizations that had existed before in this region . <p> " The national museum was founded in 1919 but during the war , it was actually closed and made into a military base , " said Daud . <p> I expressed that I was amazed that a lot of the artefacts and even the building had not been damaged . <p> " Oh no . During the war , we managed to smuggle a lot of these valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taliban came , they actually destroyed a lot of the artefacts , especially the idols and statues which we are trying to restore , " he said . <p> Daud added that now the museum is open , they are actually slowly receiving back all the old artefacts that they had smuggled out of the country . Countries like Sweden and the Netherlands had played a role in their safekeeping and are now shipping them back to the museum . <p> An ancient artefact on display at the National Museum of Afghanistan.In fact , these same governments are also providing financial support to the museum so they can rebuild and also somewhat rebuild Afghanistan 's sense of culture and history . Now that the doors are open , the museum receives regular visitors like schoolchildren and even tourists and expatriates who are living in the country . <p> " The museum has a responsibility to preserve and promote Afghan history .

And after 20 years , I am finally in Kabul . This museum is great , especially for youth to learn about their country , " said Mehdia Bina , who plans to write a book about the Afghan people . <p> I 'm happy to see that after decades of war , and even if the violence has n't totally ended , Afghanistan still puts a certain priority towards their culture and history .

It 's called the Aventador J , and the folk at Sant ' Agata Bolognese are calling it the most uncompromising open super sports car in the company 's entire history . <p> The two-seater , technically based on the Aventador LP 700-4 , dispenses entirely with the roof as well as the front windshield , not to mention air-conditioning and the navigation system , but the 700 hp machine is fully-functional for road use . <p> Created by Centro Stile Lamborghini , the car was conceived as a " barchetta , " so in place of the classic front windshield there are two small wind deflectors , which effectively makes it the lowest car ever made by the company . It also requires that the occupants must have the right equipment for driving the car at speed , if one values one 's face , that is . <p> The J suffix for this one is derived from the sporting rules of the FIA world motorsport organisation -- its " Appendix J " defines the technical specification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alphabet is also an indirect homage to the one-off Jota of old . <p> The monocoque has a largely new design , including the incorporation of two safety bars behind the seats .

@@4548236 <h> Geneva preview : MINI Clubvan for trendy small businesses <p> This is the MINI Clubvan Concept that will be shown at Geneva , previewing a new van bodystyle for the fashionable small car . No surprise , as rumours of this new variant have been circulating for quite some time . <p> As you can see , the Clubvan is adapted from the elongated MINI Clubman . Some here might find such a car strange -- MINIs may be expensive toys here , but it competes in the regular supermini segment in Europe , and supermini based small CVs like the Opel Astravan and Peugeot 207 Van are common . <p> Next to those cars , the Clubvan is a stylish alternative for trendier , more premium businesses . MINI cites examples such as a fashion designer , art gallery owner , event caterer or photographers with bulky hardware . <p> The main things that differentiate Van from Man ( Gooners , are you thinking of RVP now ? ) are the closed-off load area behind the front seats and the opaque rear side windows . The load area reaches from the split rear doors right up to the partition grille behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interior 's depth , and load capacity exceeds the maximum achieved by the Clubman . <p> Six attachment loops recessed into the load compartment floor use elastic straps to hold items in place .

The walls , floor and roof of the load compartment are trimmed in anthracite-coloured cloth . <p> It 's based on the Clubman , so ClubVan retains the Clubdoor on the right-hand side , giving the option of accessing smaller items from the car 's side .

Like a few weeks ago when yet another stranger footed his dinner bill as a token of appreciation and encouragement . <p> " I was a fulltime journalist in the mainstream media for 30 years and I was never as well-known then as I am now , " Kee marvelled during an exclusive interview with FMT . <p> " I now write for the online media which you would think lacks the penetration of the mainstream media but yet more people are reading my articles .

One such situation is the decision to take legal action against those who are involved in " baby dumping " . <p> Can I clearly say from the beginning that every child has a right to life , even if the parents are not keen to have it . And that throwing babies away is a horrible act . <p> However , the authorities must understand why this happens . So far they seem not to listen to the many voices that have attempted to articulate the reason behind the activity . <p> The majority of individuals who resort to disposing of their babies are teenage Malay girls . Why do they do so ? For two major reasons . One , that some of them are shunned by their family/community and , secondly , that the religious authorities will take action against them . Who can they turn to for support ? If identified then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have worked with teenagers who have become pregnant know the difficult times they face when it happens . Sure they made a stupid mistake but we as society must not compound it by the gross lack of support and punitive action . <p> Imposing legal action against those who are involved will only result in greater attempts to hide , e.g. burying , and result in most of these babies dying . What we need is to extend grace to these confused and rejected young girls . If the government can not provide it , allow the NGOs to do so . But please stop the religious authorities from victimising these already traumatised teenagers . Sure they are wrong but please have compassion as a man/woman of God . <p> Taking this course of action will NOT increase the number of teenage pregnancies , contrary to the faulty opinion of some . Instead , many other teenagers can learn from their failure in our openness to accept the issues . Reducing teenage pregnancies can only be done by concerted measures to provide sex education and offer openness to dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> From my many surveys , more than 90 per cent of parents have never spoken to their children about sex or offered them sex education . I would appeal to parents that they are best suited to do this and not to shy away from it . The government must act urgently to provide wholesome and comprehensive sex education in schools . <p> Finally , can I quote the words of a compassionate man in the hope that it will inspire us to support pregnant teenage girls . Mahatma Gandhi said : " Power is of two kinds . One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love . Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment .

It was lunch break and Judge Mohammed al-Ghada noticed her sitting alone . He was horrified to learn that Nujood was only 10 years old . <p> Nujood Ali is a native of Yemen , a country where , in some areas , the average marriage age for females is reportedly 10 .

The United Nations reports that almost half of Yemen 's population of 20 million get by on under US$2 per day . Hence , marrying daughters off prematurely is the knee-jerk reaction in a convoluted attempt to improve the welfare of the rest of the family . Nujood was married off to Faez Ali Thamer , a courier in his 30s , in February 2008 . It was apparently a slew of unfortunate events at home that caused her father , Ali Mohammed Ahdal , a former street sweeper , to marry Nujood off . Not only was he broke with 16 hungry children at home , but one of Nujood 's sisters had also been raped and another was kidnapped . He feared that Nujood would be next . At that time , Faez promised the family not to touch Nujood until she reached puberty .

She was also constantly abused by her in-laws , who told him to hit her even harder every time he beat her . <p> Two months after the wedding Nujood was allowed to visit her family . Back home , she asked her parents to end her marriage but her pleas were rejected . Nujood , however , did n't stop trying to get her freedom : using the bread money from her mother , she travelled to Sana'a . Arriving in the capital , she went straight to the courthouse . <p> She knew that the courthouse was the only place she could go to get help .

@@4575231 <h> Anti-Lynas group turns attention to ' regime change ' <p> File photo of the walk by thousands of Himpunan Hijau supporters heading towards Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur last month . -- Picture by Choo Choy MayKUALA LUMPUR , Dec 31 -- Environmental group Himpunan Hijau says " bringing down the regime " will be its focus next year as it started this morning a protest drive convoy from Gombak here to Gebeng , Pahang to mark its last public offensive of the year against the controversial Lynas rare earth plant in Gebeng . <p> The convoy will converge at its base camp in Balok tonight as a display of strength and to usher in the new year , which it hopes will bring in positive change to its fight against what it sees as a " symbol of corruption " . <p> " After this , Lynas will not be our focus anymore . But to destroy the threat , we must look hard to prevent further corruption and abuse of power , " Himpunan Hijau chairman Wong Tack told The Malaysian Insider yesterday . <p> Their convoy was preceded by a 13-day march from Kuantan to Dataran Merdeka here last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an affiliate group Malaysian Youth Against Public Hazards . <p> The green movement had a humble beginning on October 9 last year when 5,000 concerned citizens came together in Pahang -- the home state of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak -- to lend their support against the plant which they believed was yet another example of the government putting profits before the people . <p> By their second gathering on February 26 this year in Kuantan , the small chorus of angry voices had swelled up to around 20,000 , and was regarded by many as a symbol of Malaysia 's burgeoning civil society . <p> Wong said Himpunan Hijau would try very hard to change the administration that allowed Lynas to set foot in Malaysia.On April 28 , Himpunan Hijau joined forces with the larger electoral reform movement Bersih , and was involved in clashes between the police force and demonstrators . <p> As the next general election approaches , Himpunan Hijau 's message will become more relevant to their audience as they push for systemic change -- by trying to change the administration that granted Lynas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . <p> " We will work hard to bring down the regime ... We will bring down the government , " Wong declared . <p> He admitted that it would be impossible for the group to dismantle the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant ( LAMP ) which had been given the green light to operate after a temporary operating licence ( TOL ) was granted . <p> However , the group explained that all it wishes is for Lynas to go through the proper and legal procedures in setting up a rare earth plant instead of " taking the back door " , and hopes that the winning government will force Lynas back to square one . <p> " We were never against Lynas coming , we were never against rare earth , we just do n't want them to go through a short cut , " Wong asserted . <p> " When they are 100 per cent ready , 100 per cent safe , and comply with the regulations 100 per cent , they can go on . Why does Malaysia have to take all the risk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia , Wong stressed that Himpunan Hijau will not be sitting idly with regards to Lynas . <p> " The operation in Balok base camp will continue , " he said , giving the example of car blockades that they have started to stop shipments of materials from ever getting in or out of the plant . <p> Himpunan Hijau will also be working with international environmental groups to boycott HSBC , the British multinational banking and financial services which allegedly financed Lynas . <p> " We will call for people to cut off their service with them , " explained Wong . <p> The group demonstrated against the bank 's branch in Jalan Mahkota , Kuala Lumpur last week . <p> Despite their still unfinished struggle which comes to peak with the convoy , Wong declared that their fight had been very successful . <p> " This is a powerful dark force that we 're dealing with , a multinational corporation working with the local power through collusion . It is a big challenge for ordinary citizens , " he said . <p> He highlighted the fight against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to finally end , and compared it to the current fight against Lynas which had only been going on for more than a year . <p> The power plant in Lahad Datu , Sabah was finally scrapped in February last year after Chief Minister Datuk Musa Aman said that the federal and state governments had agreed that coal would not be used as a source of energy for Sabah . <p> " When we started the campaign , 97 per cent of LAMP was complete , and they predicted that by the end of the year it will be in production . <p> " Today , although it has started operation , it has still not started its production yet , " Wong said proudly . <p> Most of the politicians , Wong said , have totally forgotten the citizens and do not have the interests of the people on their agenda any more . <p> " Whatever we said , people did n't listen . Whatever we did , people did n't notice , " Wong said , arguing that the public has now taken notice of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle ... And now we 're very close to victory , " declared Wong . <p> Around 10,000 cars and motorcycles are expected to turn up today for the Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan Anti-Lynas Protest Drive . <p> The protest will start at the PAS headquarters in Taman Melawar , Gombak at 8am , and arrive two hours later at the PAS office in Chegar Mendang , Bentong . <p> They will later move to Gebeng and camp out at the Himpunan Hijau anti-Lynas blockade base camp in Balok for a final rally before counting down the new year . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .
