@@4571233 <h> Climate change and Bangladesh <p> Photo : Quddus Alam / driknewsFaruque Hasan , Uttara , Dhaka <p> The latest World Bank report on climate change has warned Bangladesh of being one of the worst sufferers , saying that by 2100 the sea level will rise by up to 3 feet . The sea level rise will cause water scarcity and falling of crop yields , which will exacerbate hunger and poverty in Bangladesh according to the report . The report has also mentioned that the cities located in Bangladesh ( and in some other countries ) will become highly vulnerable due to the sea level rise . The Germany-based organizations , Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics , prepared the report for the World Bank . <p> The World Bank and the German organizations do not know a very vital information that Bangladesh is an active delta . And due to that the lands of Bangladesh is rising 5 ( five ) millimetres , on average , a year . So by the year 2100 , the lands of Bangladesh will rise 20 ( twenty ) inches or almost two feet . Not only that , every year Bangladesh gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of erosion and accretion from the sea along its coastline . It means the coastline of the country will go forward quite a few miles from the present position pushing the sea back . So from the viewpoint of climate change , the picture of Bangladesh is not as gloomy as said by some international organizations . At present Bangladesh may not be as rich as the western countries ( before the colonial rule it was the richest country in the world ) , it does not mean that the country should always be made an example of any gloomy picture by the international organizations . I have no doubt about the good intention of the World Bank , but their report must be based on reality . It is not Dhaka but cities like New York , London , which are vulnerable due to sea level rise as the lands of those cities are not rising .
