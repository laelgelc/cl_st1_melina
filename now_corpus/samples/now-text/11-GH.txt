@@1793232 <h> 14TH FEBRUARY , A DAY OF SEX OR LOVE ? <p> You do not need to celebrate Valentine 's Day to feel the air that blows on 14th February . It 's contagious . ' Love is in the air ' . So the saying goes . Those who can not feel it in the air , can at least see it from the over commercialization of love products in the media , the red decorations of most public centers and special gift items designed for this purpose . <p> I find the lingerie shops most attractive ! On this day people go to unimaginable lengths such as spending a lifetime savings or taking a loan to make the occasion a groundbreaking one for their special one . For example , it is estimated that about 1 billion Valentine 's Day cards are sold each year around the globe , America alone spends $12.2 billion on chocolate , $359 million on cut flowers , and $2.4 billion on diamonds . <p> Do the arithmetic 's for those who spoil with mansions and latest editions of vehicles . <p> Again , 14th February is a terrible time to be single . Whilst many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Valentine 's celebration , those who are on the verge of break-up , defer it until after the month of Love . There are those who help their situation by partaking in blind dates . As for those who are still not lucky , stories abound about how single women and men , who for fear of stigmatization from their environment buy gifts and mail it to themselves during this season . At least they also had something . <p> Not only that , Valentine 's also provides the opportunity for people to engage in sex orgies , particularly of the dangerous kind : anal , same-sex , group sex , including dangerous sex positions and the use of health threatening aphrodisiac . As if that is not enough , from office tables , private video rooms , beaches and nightclubs , to the back of cars , etc people ride themselves to orgasms-saying so many things which are not very audible . <p> Indeed it a season of sex for most . Virgins are shredded on this day and many married people and those in committed relationships cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over familiarization that long relations come with and engage in reckless sex with anybody who has been on the waiting list ; boss , ex-lover , office colleague or ' the next available buss , ' after all as the Akans put it literally , ' any dirty water can quench fire ' The shortage of condoms during this season says it all . <p> Nevertheless , given the international hype that Valentine 's Day enjoys , the heavy investments that corporate bodies place on it , and the great length that individuals go to pull all those surprises , which make their VALS smile larger than their faces , I ask simple . Exactly what do you mark when you celebrate ' Valentines ' day ? I mean you ! <p> To be blunt , do you celebrate your success in sleeping with somebody 's husband or wife or the innocent girl who believes you are going to marry her but you only know she is as good as a sex toy ; a platform for sexual experiment ? Is it the celebration of your new catch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , etc ? Maybe it 's a celebration of your new promotion , which gives you the opportunity to lay all the young women who work under you or those who come to you for help ? <p> What next after the wild sex on Val 's day ? Where was your wife , husband , boyfriend or girlfriend when you were busily panting for breath in the middle of another woman 's thighs ? What will be the future for you and the one you shared the Valentine 's Day with or it does not matter since the sex , money , the social status , or the privileges , maybe good ? <p> Lest I am misunderstood , I am not against Val 's day . Far from that , I wish it were celebrated every day . My concern is that the motives should be realigned . That whilst it is not possible to celebrate love everyday because we have other genuine commitments , the opportunity that 14th February presents married couples and dating partners to celebrate their love once every year must not be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when Valentine 's Day is celebrated to reward the hardworking efforts of wives , husbands , boyfriends and girlfriends . Vals day should be a moment to idolize your partner for his or her decency , sacrifice and dedication to make things work . Unlike others , he/she did not abandon you to start a new relationship when the going was tough . In our generation when the quest for material wealth , social recognition and independence is a matter of life and death , we need to reward those who still made marriage life a priority . A Person who suffered your foolishness gladly and did not find cheating attractive , at a time when decency and faithfulness to ones partner is branded as naivety deserves to be celebrated in the month of love . <p> Finally , we need to celebrate marriages and thriving relationships not because it been entirely a success story during the years under review , but because irrespective of those moments of anger , hurt , fatigue and financial difficulties , the partners found reason to stay together : reasons that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be destroyed by perhaps occasional moments of indiscretion on the part of your partner . <p> My interest in encouraging partners to work and achieve a healthy relationship despite their challenges is not selfish . In fact , the consequences of failed relationships or reckless sex lives do not only affect the individuals who are immediately associated with it . It has telling implications on the extended family and the country as a whole . An example will suffice . <p> During this 14th February , I am not sure of how many men will accept a Vals day ' one-night-stand ' pregnancy but I am sure it will force many women to dropout from school , stop their work , or be banished from their dependants . Again it is possible some of these unprepared mothers can still make it in live and keep their dreams alive but my sympathy is really with those whose otherwise bright future will be distorted by this process . I do n't want to even consider those who will die in the process or how to repair the crack this makes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born out of such ' moments of madness ' . <p> Whilst there may be an exception to the rule , I am sure we can not explain the history of street children , armed robbery , illiteracy , poverty and many of the challenges that government is confronting without understanding the consequences of reckless sex . On another platform , we can discuss sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV , to prove that when private individuals decide to be reckless about sex and relationship , the punishment is shared by the whole nation . <p> We may also discuss the many that get psychologically affected in the process , those who vow never to marry again because of being taken for granted in a relationship , those who either seek revenge on all women or all men because of bad encounter with a woman or guy who mistreated them and hurt them severely . We may also trace the link between bad leaders in the country or bad bosses in the office and the bad state of their married life . It should also be interesting to demonstrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family life they had growing up . <p> Indeed there is nothing as beautiful as sustaining a healthy relationship that leads to marriage , one that grows generational families that are prosperous and happy . After all , if the country is an aggregation of the nucleus family , then a happy and successful family makes a happy nation . What is the point in becoming a successful , politician , musician , etc without a happy family to celebrate your success with or standby you in moments when friends and associates are not there . We need a family to bequeath our legacies and care for us when we are old and unattractive . <p> In this season of love , remember it a great thing to be loved and even greater for another to feel loved by you .

Most importantly , we were taught to be Christ-like in our actions . To tell the truth , I loved going to church on Sunday mornings . It meant that I could put on my nicest attire ! Apart from its religious centeredness , the church was like a family gathering . People came , ate and sang together . It was sheer fun ! In fact , the brotherhood and sisterhood--present amongst the believers , was admirable . Yes , their love for one another equally enviable . I was a curious child with so many unanswered questions ! Some of the questions , when I asked them , were often met with silence . Folks would simply stir at me in disbelief and awe . I meant no offense !

Sometimes , some of my questions caught her off guard . Luckily , others were fully answered to the brim . All in all , she never discouraged me from searching . Perhaps , she knew that I would find the answers to the questions someday . Bless her heart ! Currently , I am practicing no religion . I consider myself a traditionalist !

The school which is about 10 kilometers from both communities has witnessed sad and disturbing decadence because of its location which has led to the vandalization of some prominent section of the school structure such as the introductory technology workshop , the auditorium or school hall , the library , Physics and Chemistry labouratory etc . <p> According to the Principal of Special Class and Dean of Studies of the school , Sir Godwin Chidi Amadi said , " The school is not well located , in fact it is isolated . Most of the science apparatus and spacemen for practicals have been vandalized because of lack of security . The introductory technology which was well equipped has been vandalized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of vandalization . From late 80 's till now security in and around Amala/Ntu Secondary School has been dreadfully permeable as there is no fence or barricade or security guard to monitor and protect school property or keep at bay vandals who access the school from many entrance and exit points " . <p> At present , the school has lost its former attraction , appeal and cynosure . During its formative years -- 1976 to 1985 , Amala/Ntu Secondary School was a reference point in stellar academic and sports competitions as its students made nice grades and bagged many laurels . This performance was hinged on dedication to work and training and retraining of teachers who worth their salt in various endeavours . But today the reverse is the case . This is evidenced in poor performance in sports competitions , interschool debates and Senior School Certificate Examination . <p> Formerly , the footpaths in the school were well maintained by regular sweeping and periodic weeding and cutting of grass on these paths . Today , these footpaths have been encroached on by elephant grass . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaken by grass , shrubs , weeds , herbs and trees .

Because of the challenges of poor results recorded in past Senior School Certificate Examinations , nonchalant attitude to work and academic on the part of teachers and students , limited classroom seats , poor environment for learning , delay payment of salary of teachers which gives rise to strike , inadequate teaching materials and personnel , long distance trek by students , vandalized library , labouratory and introductory technology workshop among others , have led to the exodus of students from Amala/Ntu Secondary School to mostly nearby private schools . <p> The above situation has occasioned a drastic depletion of students ' population in the school who should have helped to keep the bushy compound clean by periodic weeding and cutting of elephant grass . As of the time this writer visited the school , the total number of students from Junior Secondary School ( JSS ) to Senior Secondary School ( SS ) was put at 137 with the exception of SS2 that has no student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Total Student Population in Amala/Ntu Secondary School : May 2011 <p> JSS 1 12 8 Boys 4 GirlsJSS 2 29 16 Boys 13 GirlsJSS 3 48 33 Boys 15 GirlsSS 1 11 6 Boys 5 GirlsSS 2 - - -SSS3 37 18 Boys 19 GirlsTotal 137 Students 81 Boys 56 GirlsPreviously run as a boarding and day school , today the school operates as a day school no thanks to insecurity that pervades the place . From 1976 to mid 80 's , the now dilapidated girls ' hostel has the capacity of accommodating one hundred and fifty students while the abandoned , uncompleted and ramshackle boys hostel is estimated to house three hundred students . Male students at the time made use of alternative hostel referred to as calakuta . Apart from the male and female hostels , there are also teachers quarters that have four separate 3bedroom bungalows , principal quarters and kitchen section , all have falling apart . The only structure that is worth looking at is the Jss block that was renovated by Universal Basic Education in 2007 . <p> For those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general atmosphere that pervades the area is that melancholy and desolation of a school by previous administration in the state . <p> With various degrees of challenges staring Amala/Ntu Secondary School in the face , it is now the responsibility of the newly inaugurated government of Governor Owelle Rochas Okorocha , who is education friendly to save the school which is on its last legs from total collapse . <p> An urgent affirmative action should be taken by well-meaning old boys and girls of Amala/Ntu Secondary School as the Imo state government can not do it all alone . <p> No contribution towards rebuilding and restoring the lost glory of the school is too little .

@@1802240 <h> October was Breast Cancer Awareness Month <p> In many countries around the world , October is Breast Cancer awareness month . Breast cancer is the leading cancer in Ghana at 15% according to sources from Korle Bu Teaching hospital ( KBTH ) . In a study at this hospital in 2007 , Dr Clegg Lamptey found that 57% of those who presented with breast cancer had advance cancers with average tumor size about 6x7 centimeters . Another interesting finding by his and two other studies- ( Mammocare and Komfo Anokye teaching hospital ) is that compared to a country like USA , the age of developing breast cancer was younger in Ghanaians- average age is between 40-49years compared to 60 years in the USA . In a joint Kumasi/USA study , the type of breast cancer found in Ghanaian women were similar to those found in African American women , however , the Ghanaian women had cancers which tended to be locally advanced . All this information shows that Ghanaian women need to take personal measures so that there is early detection and treatment of this terrible cancer . Information or knowledge is POWER , and so it is important to be informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BEST PROTECTION . <p> WHAT IS BREAST CANCER ? ( BC ) Cancer is a disease which is causes by normal cells becoming abnormal and growing out of control . It can occur in every organ of your body and if it occurs in the breast it is called Breast cancer . Cells growing fast form a mass called a tumor . Not all tumors are cancers . Some are benign or not cancerous . The cancerous ones are also known as malignant because they can spread to other parts of the body . <p> SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER Early stages of breast cancer may not show any symptoms or signs . As it grows symptoms may include A new lump or mass in the breast . ( That is why it is important to know what your breasts feel like ! ! ) Changes in the skin , size or shape of the breast Discharge from the nipple not associated with breast feeding Flaky , red , or swollen skin on the breast A nipple that starts discharging blood , or is very tender or turns inwards ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unexplained pain in breast or nipple that does not go away . ( Pain is not a common symptom of breast cancer unless it has spread ) <p> WHO GETS BREAST CANCER ? All women are at risk but more so those above the age of 40years . There are also certain factors which affects your risk of developing breast cancer . Some of these one can not do anything to change , but there are others that one can influence . <p> WHAT RAISES A WOMAN 'S CHANCE OF GETTING BC ? ( Risk Factors ) Although these have been discovered , some women with some of these risk factors do not develop breast cancer , and some women who get breast cancer have no apparent risk factors . There seems to be a combination of inherited factors ( genetics ) and environmental factors that lead to this and many other diseases . Some of these factors include Being a woman Getting older ( Over 50years ) Have had previous breast cancer Have never had children or had your first child after age 30 years Started your period or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Having close family relatives- mother , sister , daughter who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer Have been treated with radiation therapy to the breast or chest in the past Have used hormone replacement treatment for more than 5years ( Used to treat menopause symptoms ) You are overweight You drink alcohol daily Being physically inactive Have a genetic condition involving mutation of genes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . Some of the above conditions you can not personally change but others you can influence by life style changes . For example to prevent breast cancer you can Stay healthy by maintaining a healthy weight Exercising regularly and staying physically active Avoid the use of Hormone Replacement therapy ( HRT ) . Find other ways of treating menopausal symptoms Limit the amount of alcohol that you drink PRACTICE EARLY DETECTION by taking CONTROL of your breast health . When breast cancer is picked up early , the 5 year survival rate is more than 98% . The American Cancer Society- a trusted organization has recommended the following screening methods <p> At Age 20 years : You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good to find out how this is done by talking to your health provider , it is usually done in the shower , lying down or standing in front of a mirror . If you are taught , then you can be comfortable doing this by yourself . <p> Between 20-39 years Have a health professional do a clinical breast exam ( CBE ) on you every 3 years or even sooner . This is a breast exam done on you by a trained health provider . <p> Age 40 years and above : Have yearly clinical breast exams and mammograms . If you can not afford a yearly mammogram you can stretch it to every 2 years . It takes about two years for a tumor/mass to grow big enough to cause symptoms for women in their 40s , but for women in their 70s it may take four years . Even then , 10% of all breast cancers may not be detected by a mammogram . If a mammogram is abnormal , or your breast is dense , a doctor may recommend ultrasound or MRI of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a low dose x-ray of your breasts that is able to detect small changes or lumps which are too small or too deep to be felt by you . They are safe , quick and may just be mildly uncomfortable due to the fact that your breasts will be squeezed between two plates of the machine . The squeeze is important to flatten the breast tissue and give a good reading . <p> TIPS FOR A BETTER MAMMOGRAM When you go for the mammogram make sure you wipe off any powder , cream or deodorant from under your arms and your breasts as these may interfere with the mammogram Drink sufficient water to keep you well hydrated before the exam If your breast gets tender during your monthly period/menses , then the best time to have a mammogram done may be one week after your period ends . Let your doctor know of any symptoms or problems you have before the exam If your last mammogram was done at a different place or you have a copy of your previous mammograms , then take them with you so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> REMEMBER , MAMMOGRAMS LEAD TO EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER , AND EARLY DETECTION LEADS TO EARLY TREATMENT WHICH LEADS TO HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS . A few women have told me that they do not want to get a mammogram because they would rather not know they have breast cancer . I think that is acting like the proverbial ostrich who sticks its head in the sand but the rest of the body is exposed . When breast cancer is discovered late , it may have spread to other parts of the body and the cancer cells strangle the other cells in other organs or parts of the body , causing a lot of pain for the victims . It is not a pleasant situation to be in . It is a painful death . To avoid all this and have your piece of mind , get a mammogram done . There are several health facilities and free standing radiological imaging centers available in Accra , Kumasi , Cape Coast and other regional capitals .
