Richie McCaw will helm the World Cup final . His assistant at Twickenham on Sunday will be Nigel Owens , the experienced Welsh official . <p> OK , so Owens , aged 44 , a veteran of 67 test matches , has been officially named as the man in charge , but it is an appointment that should put joy into the heart of every All Blacks supporter and fear in the soul of the Wallabies . World Rugby has gravely blundered by giving the final to Owens , a man who has serious form with both New Zealand and Australia . <p> The All Blacks love the man . Fox presaged the announcement by saying : " Nigel is clearly the best referee in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will make the odd error . But one of the key things he does , apart from communicating incredibly well with players , is that he lets the breakdown breathe . And that 's really important . If you want to get a good contest and spectacle . " <p> Of course Fox thinks that Owens communicates incredibly well with the players . The Welshman has a respect for McCaw that at times in the past has bordered on sycophancy , like when he shook the All Blacks leader 's hand twice in the immediate aftermath of one test match . Given his track record it is hard to imagine Owens keeping McCaw onside on Sunday . <p> Owens refereed the previous match between these two teams when the All Blacks thrashed Australia 41-13 at Eden Park . The way he spoke to both captains that day was remarkable . When McCaw made a complaint , Owens said : " I 'll have a look at the next one , OK . " <p> DAVID ROGERS/GETTY IMAGES <p> Referee Nigel Owens shows he 's not afraid to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia captain Stephen Moore asked for clarification on two separate occasions , Owens said : " Back you go " and " Off you go " . <p> In that match Conrad Smith twice played the jumper in the air and did not receive a yellow card . In a previous match against England refereed by Owens , Ma'a Nonu committed two professional fouls , pulling back James Haskell off the ball and preventing England from taking a quick drop-out . Owens did not produce a card . <p> But of course Louis Picamoles got a yellow card for what amounted to little more than a facial rub of New Zealand 's captain in the quarterfinal of this World Cup . New Zealand were in danger of running up 70 points that day . Their rugby was quite beautiful , but it is not Owens job to stand and admire . He let a couple of things go that he had no business ignoring . <p> There are many sides who will say they dread Owens being put in charge of the All Blacks . Australia will say it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forgetting the try Owens awarded to Aaron Cruden at Twickenham almost exactly a year ago when he failed to ground the ball over the line . Ireland will say it . <p> The men in green long remember the end to that fateful match when Owens coached McCaw back onside and then penalised the Ireland player for not staying on his feet as he fell into the hole that McCaw had left . It was a quite extraordinary piece of reffing . <p> Now some may argue that McCaw has earned such mana and I have much sympathy for that point of view . McCaw 's humility in public and utter dignity on the rare occasions that New Zealand have lost mean that many officials are almost proud to have refereed the man . <p> I have argued for a couple of years now that McCaw 's greatest contribution to his team since the last World Cup is his captaincy . He is a colossal leader off the pitch . And once the game is under way McCaw 's influence on referees is undeniable . Even staunch Republicans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palace and McCaw commands similar respect once he is on a rugby pitch . <p> But it is a huge problem for Michael Cheika and one that I am quite sure he is aware of . One of the biggest problems he had when he took over was the lack of leadership and respect in the team . There has been the ' toxic ' era of Robbie Deans and the Di Patston farce of Ewen Mackenzie 's time as coach . <p> The rugby team has had as much continuity as Australia 's government who have had five prime ministers since 2011 . Since the last World Cup the Wallabies have been captained by James Horwill , Will Genia , David Pocock , Ben Mowen , Michael Hooper , Nathan Sharpe , Stephen Moore and Dean Mumm , in no particular order . The contrast with the All Blacks continuity in their chain of command could scarcely be greater . <p> Cheika has brought back respect by making Moore , who is old school , his leader . The appointment has come with a huge upside , but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of talking round referees . From Pocock 's wide-eyed amazement to Moore 's polite nag , they lack Richie 's mana . <p> And they really , really lack it with Owens . Australia lost to Argentina when Owens was in charge and they could n't score a point against the All Blacks in 2012 . When playing outside Australia under Owens , the Wallabies have not won in six attempts . The Green and Gold website calculates that Australia scores an average of 10 fewer points than under other refs and concedes almost four more penalties than the opposition . Cheika 's biggest challenge this week is to make plans for Nigel . <p> In contrast the All Blacks have won 12 matches in a row with Owens in charge . Or should I say Richie.

It 's the culmination of a lot of hard work from second- and third-year students , and the six performances this year offer a very entertaining mix , especially for lovers of classical ballet . In previous years , the NZSD has put more contemporary dance on the menu , but the mixture in tonight 's programme was equally welcome . Paquita , the grand-pas , kicked off the evening , choreographed by Anna-Marie Holmes after Marius Petipa . The students showed immense promise , and we would n't be surprised to see many of them dance professionally in ballet before long .

The idea behind the dance was to show cell division , phagocytosis and metamorphosis , translating the microscopic to human size . The beauty came from the fluid movement unusual shapes that we form with our arms , legs and hands when they are put together en masse , and we 'd go so far as to say this was the cleverest dance of the evening .

Bradley 's notes indicate that the dance was in two parts : the first created a mutual understanding between them ; the second conveying ' exhaustion suspension apology and defeat ' . It began in darkness , with orange-hooded , androgynous dancers huddled in a group . Abrupt movements , angular , backwards steps conveyed a confusion , as though the society that had been formed was suddenly devoid of structure or rules , feeling like the aftermath of war .

It is not an easy ballet but we could n't fault either Wright or Gan . Playing the game of contrasts in the programme , the contemporary As It Fades , originally commissioned by T.H.E Dance Company of Singapore and created by Kuik Swee Boon in 2011 , was an energetic performance , and showed what the dancers were capable of , with strong , purposeful movements , accompanied by the strings in Max Richter 's ' Jan 's Notebook ' and ' November ' , which painted a world struggling to understand itself .

As the performance ended , the Richter score did not feel out of place in a bleak science-fiction film from the turn of the 1970s , with credits rolling as a dancer walked off-stage into the darkness , making us wonder what lay beyond the abyss . It was very clever , and got us ready for the final performance . That final performance was Concerto , an abstract ballet choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan after he joined the Deutsche Oper in Berlin , with a musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich ( many audiences will know his work not from ballet but from the theme tune of Reilly : Ace of Spies ; this was his ' Piano Concerto No. 2 in F ' ) , that premi ? red in 1966 , staged here by Lynn Wallis and coached by Stephen Beagley .

Damian McKenzie is another gem . <p> Is it any wonder Chiefs coach Dave Rennie preferred Damian over older brother Marty in the 23-18 victory against the Blues tonight ? At 19-years-old this kid has the goods ; those crucial time and composure elements all first five-eighths need . <p> In a game dominated by giants , being one of the smallest blokes on the park did nothing to deter him . Commitment he had in spades , on one occasion crunching Charles Piutau before sprinting back to make the clearance kick . Then he was there to save a try with Tevita Li steaming on to Ihaia West 's nudge . <p> At another stage McKenzie was ready to go toe-to-toe with rookie Blues centre Hamish Northcott .

Brodie Retallick , Aaron Cruden , Hosea Gear , Liam Messam , Seta Tamanivalu , Ben Tameifuna and Tim Nanai-Williams are all expected to return next week . <p> With Cruden running the water in Albany it would appear McKenzie merely kept the No.10 jersey warm . His time will come , though . On the big stage debuts do n't come much better than this . He certainly outshone West . His only fault was kicking away too much ball in the second spell -- and a couple of misses off the tee . <p> Rennie wo n't be shy to reward his new talented playmaker with further opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will , likewise , be pleased with his contribution . <p> " He was great , " Rennie said of McKenzie . " He 's had his issues goal kicking in the trials but he was outstanding tonight . He 's confident and such a tough little bugger . He put in a lot of tackles tonight . He carried courageously . It was a nice start for him and good to know we 've got another strong candidate at 10 . <p> " He 's the type of kid that if he misses a shot at goal it 's not going to bother him . He 'll still challenge the line and use people around him . He 's put on about two kilos so he 's massive now . He 's very similar to Aaron , maybe a tad quicker . " <p> It 's a huge year for Williams , too , as he tries to break up the All Blacks midfield combination of Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith . Tonight was an impressive start . <p> Fresh off his farcical boxing win , the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sydney last week , he produced a first half highlight package , ending with 58 metres . Williams laid on a try for Bryce Heem after effortlessly catching Brad Webber 's box kick and flicking out one of four superb offloads to his speedy wing .

That and the returning brigade are scary prospects for the rest of the competition .

Kleiner , which said 20 per cent of its partners are women , stated it 's committed to diversity . <p> For some , the case placed on trial the world of venture capital firms that line Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park , California .

After further deliberations , jurors came back and affirmed their decision , this time with a 9-3 vote in favour of Kleiner on that claim . <p> The panel considered a timeline to guide its deliberations , said juror Steve Sammut , 62 .

@@3192231 <h> Rack n ' Ruin <p> On:PlayStation 4 <p> Imagine a top-down action-adventure game like The Legend of Zelda . Now , take the familiar hack-and-slash combat , and swap it out for screen-filling projectiles , the likes of which are more at home in shoot-'em-ups like Raiden and Ikaruga . Top it all off with gorgeous , vibrant hand-painted visuals , fantastic music , and a fun , light-hearted story following a demon 's quest to corrupt the world , and you have Rack n ' Ruin . All the pieces are here for a truly spectacular game . <p> You play as Rack , a demon serving under the demon lord Ruin . Rather than go from world to world enslaving people so that Ruin can have minions , Rack would rather just destroy worlds entirely - much to Ruin 's frustration . The game open 's after Rack 's latest destructive adventure , with Ruin giving him one last chance to do his job properly , or else . Or else what , I 'm not really sure - something villainous and evil , I presume . <p> And so , as Rack , you 're sent to a nameless medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area to area , finding and opening portals to the demon world along the way . The locals are n't just going to hand over their realm , though , so you 'll have to deal with various threats - knights , wizards , strange beasts , the usual - as you go about your demonic business . Despite it being your goal , corrupting a zone only makes things worse , as it corrupts all the local critters in the process , turning them into much more powerful , demonic versions of themselves . <p> Fighting is , at times , one of the best things in Rack n ' Ruin , particularly when you 're fighting some sort of powerful spellcaster who likes to fill the screen with spells that you 'll need to weave between while shooting fireballs of your own . <p> More often than not , though , it 's a point of frustration . Aside from the aforementioned wizards , most enemies are pretty plain and prefer to simply rush you down and overwhelm you with numbers . These fights are tiresome , plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not careful ( or just unlucky ) , sending you back to a checkpoint that in all likelihood is ages away . Rack is well equipped for the intricate bullet-hell dances that the game is sold on , but these encounters are surprisingly few . Instead of being something exciting and rewarding , combat is , with some exceptions , just an annoying obstacle that gets in the way of exploration . <p> That adventure element is far more rewarding . In true Zelda style , the world is open-ish , but with an upgrade-based progression system that keeps you on a somewhat linear path . To start with , you 'll have very few abilities , and by extension , only a few places will be accessible . Go to those locations , explore dungeons , and slay bosses , and you 'll get new tools that aid your exploration . A boomerang can be used to hit out-of-reach switches for example , while an ice sword can freeze enemies and let you use them to activate pressure plates . <p> This is a setup that has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rack n ' Ruin puts it to good use . Where it slips up is with how easy it is to get lost . There 's no minimap of any sort , aside from inside dungeons , despite the fact that many of the overworld zones are very labyrinthine . The game is also pretty vague about telling you what to do next , which would be fine if not for the frequent , tedious enemy encounters making it a real chore to just explore until you find what you 're looking for . <p> Rack is well equipped for the intricate bullet-hell dances that the game is sold on ... <p> Dungeons themselves are another beast entirely , filled with some truly brain-bending puzzles that you 'll either love or hate . I generally enjoy puzzle games , but Rack n ' Ruin 's dungeons are so devious that I found them frustrating , and generally relied more on trial and error than actual problem solving . Again , the issue of annoying enemies rears its head - just as with overworld exploration , your dungeon raiding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plentiful in dungeons , and packed more tightly into compact spaces , so expect to die often - sending you right back to the entrance , to start over . <p> When you finally complete a dungeon 's puzzle , you 'll find yourself face-to-face with one of the game 's massive bosses . These are where the shoot-'em-up esque battle system really shines ; the trial-and-error , pattern recognition style of Zelda bosses blends perfectly with bullet-hell shooter mechanics . The only problem is that most bosses are quite difficult , demanding a few attempts as you learn their attack patterns and movements , but their massive health bars mean that each try takes a rather long time . <p> So , in terms of gameplay , Rack n ' Ruin is full of great ideas that work really well when they work , but stumble more often than the live up to that potential .

The stunning visuals are all backed up by equally exceptional music that has a strong Nightmare Before Christmas ( or Danny Elfman ) feel . <p> Rack n ' Ruin is a game with a lot of potential , but one that does n't quite live up to that .

@@3192235 <p> There are hundreds of different types of health insurance policies available in New Zealand , which can make it hard to know which policy suits you best -- particularly when you do n't know what you might end up using your health insurance to cover . <p> Comparison websites for example often place emphasis on the dollar amount that policies will cover up to , like $300,000 per year for surgical procedures . But really this tells a very small part of the story . These upper limits are illusionary benefits for consumers . As the largest most experienced health insurer , we 've never had a claim close to $200,000 let alone $300,000 . <p> In the last two years Southern Cross has funded 362,000 surgical procedures and just four members had a surgical claim above $100,000 . Even though these four claims account for just 0.001% of all those paid -- this $100,000 limit is frequently touted as insufficient and a major downside of Southern Cross policies . For this reason alone , the business is considering increasing it . <p> We set our limits based on industry knowledge . We pay 72% of the country 's health insurance claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare actually costs and what people actually claim for . Our policy benefits and limits are constructed with this knowledge in mind . <p> Policy limits aside , what I think is more telling when comparing insurers and the ' value ' they offer is how much they pay out in claims . <p> During the year ending June 2014 , for every dollar Southern Cross received in premium income , 90.4 cents was returned to members in claims for healthcare services . Though we do n't believe in profiting from Kiwi 's poor health - in the same time period , our for-profit competitors paid only 63.2 cents on average for every dollar they collected in premiums . Clearly , Southern Cross members are getting better value for every dollar of premium paid . <p> One of the other bug bears of Kiwis with health insurance is feeling like they are being sprung with payments above their policy limits that they did n't expect . And that 's something we are addressing through our Affiliated Provider programme . <p> Affiliated Providers are surgeons , specialists and facilities that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed prices , and who take care of the prior approval and claims processes for members . <p> And it 's worth pointing out that Southern Cross is n't the first to do this . We are following a pretty well-trodden path . Contracting with providers is utilised by insurers in Australia , America , the UK and also by the ACC . <p> The Affiliated Provider programme has been running for 17 years , and now accounts for more than 40% of all claims costs . We 're aiming to grow this to 60% next year . <p> With the Affiliated Provider programme a member knows up-front how much , if anything , he or she has to pay towards their care and they can be confident that prices are capped at a reasonable rate . This typically means no more than 20% co-pay on a shared-cover plan and no payment for those on comprehensive policies . <p> A person 's health and vulnerability should n't be exploited to provide profits for shareholders ; we are proudly a member-based not-for-profit insurer . <p> Our members are at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best value in healthcare that New Zealanders can receive .

@@3192240 <h> Understanding KiwiSaver can be eye-opening <p> But by dint of joining up to KiwiSaver , people become exactly that , with their capital being deployed into some of the most red-blooded corporates around the globe . <p> supplied <p> Binu Paul , founder of the SavvyKiwi , KiwiSaver advice business <p> It 's hard to know what KiwiSavers think they are invested in . <p> Binu Paul from SavvyKiwi , a subscription service that aims to help people pick the best fund for them , does n't think many have a clue . <p> Paul 's business takes him frequently into companies to speak to their workforces , and in his experience , there are three distinct groups of KiwiSavers . <p> The first , rather small group , perhaps 2 to 5 per cent , are " reasonably clued up about where their funds are invested " . <p> These are people who correctly know that their KiwiSaver contributions go into funds and these funds invest in a mix of cash , fixed-interest bonds from governments , local councils and companies , property , and shares in listed companies . <p> And they grasp that while some of these bonds and company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others will be companies based in the United States , Europe , Britain and other regions of the world . <p> The middle 40-50 per cent by Paul 's estimate know their money goes into a fund , but do n't really understand what a fund is , or what it invests in . <p> This group has the education to understand KiwiSaver , but is gripped by inertia , Paul believes . " It 's not because they do n't understand that KiwiSaver is a big deal . They do . I believe that the fact that the money gets taken out of their salary results in an ' out of sight , out of mind ' attitude . " <p> Many have n't even actively decided to join KiwiSaver . It just happened to them when they changed jobs . They have become unwitting capitalists . And , he adds : " It 's psychology . It is something that 's too difficult . It 's rocket science . " <p> Actually , it 's not , as British journalist John Lanchester , author of How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . <p> He just read the financial pages of newspapers . " Every time I did n't understand a term or idea , I tried to find out what it meant , " he says . <p> " The other 45 per cent or so do n't even understand their money goes into a fund , " Paul says . <p> When he asks people where KiwiSaver money is invested , he gets various responses . <p> " The best answer I got was , ' the Inland Revenue Department debits the money from my salary , and when I retire , it gives it back with a bit of interest ' . " <p> Paul paints a gloomy picture , and it 's clear there is a pretty deep pool of ignorance . A survey by the Financial Markets Authority last year found 42 in every 100 people wrongly thought KiwiSaver was " guaranteed " so you could n't lose money in it . <p> Paul says it is not hard to find out where your money is invested . <p> There 's lots of information available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QDS ) each KiwiSaver scheme provider is compelled to publish . <p> These are produced using a standard template , and are all available on KiwiSaver scheme websites . To find one , just type in the name of the KiwiSaver fund you want to see , and the words " periodic disclosure statement " . <p> These show a very clear break-down of where much of your money is invested . <p> The categories are : cash , New Zealand fixed interest ( another word for bonds ) , international fixed interest , New Zealand and Australian equities ( another word for shares ) , international equities , listed property ( companies which own property and are listed on a stock exchange ) , and unlisted property ( that is the direct ownership of property ) . <p> There is also the mysterious " other " category , which may represent investments in the likes of commodities and hedge funds . <p> Taking , for example , AMP 's Conservative KiwiSaver Fund at the end of December , the QDS shows that of each $100 in the fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , $22.74 was invested in New Zealand bonds , $22.72 in international bonds , $4.90 in Australian and New Zealand shares , $10.01 in international shares , and $4.52 in listed and unlisted property . <p> The remainder is in " other " investments , namely " infrastructure " and commodities . <p> QDS also show the top 10 individual investments , which in the AMP Conservative fund 's case are all New Zealand government bonds and New Zealand bank deposits and bonds . <p> The great thing about the QDS is it allows people to compare any KiwiSaver fund to any other KiwiSaver fund on a like-for-like basis . <p> For those who want to delve deeper , there is the annual disclosure statement for each fund . This contains a complete list of the fund 's investments . <p> But at this point things can become bewildering . <p> The AMP fund has more than 2500 different investments , from British property companies to Israeli banks to German pharmaceuticals companies to American soft drinks makers . <p> Paul says that most KiwiSavers will get no benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in the list many reasons to switch into an ethical fund . <p> Instead , most KiwiSavers should focus on the key investment decisions . <p> These are : How much do I need to be contributing to KiwiSaver to achieve my retirement goals ? , Which type of fund should I invest in ( cash , conservative , balanced , growth , or aggressive ) ? , and what level of fees am I comfortable with ? <p> John Body , managing director ANZ Wealth , says : " Fund choice is one of the most important decisions for KiwiSaver members but it 's clear that many members are not aware of what type of fund they are in . " <p> In November last year , ANZ Investments surveyed nearly 2000 members from a range of KiwiSaver providers and asked them to name their KiwiSaver fund ; 36 per cent did not know what type of fund they were in . <p> Body said : " Over the past month we 've been calling KiwiSaver members in default funds to discuss them making an active choice about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moved to make an active choice of fund . Overall members were receptive to these calls , with many expressing that they 'd been meaning to consider their fund choice , however had n't gotten around to it yet . This indicates that members are beginning to understand the importance of fund choice , and are making active choices when prompted to do so . " <p> For the person willing to follow Lanchester 's journey to learning how to speak money , or in this case to speak KiwiSaver , there are plenty of places to start asking questions . <p> It might just mean that the next time Sky City is in the news , or a naughty Swiss bank is fined for helping wealthy foreigners dodge tax , it 'll seem that much more relevant .

Arriving at Te Whaea , you 're aware something is different : instead of the waiting area that you 're accustomed to , there 's blackness . The auditorium , meanwhile , has become the new waiting area , with TV screens showing the final-year students ' faces in the centre , and the tables moved within . As the show started , we were escorted to the catwalk above the plaza , where the show takes place.Wind over Sand ( See below ) gives you a different perspective as we viewed this from above , or on the stairwell , and there was some getting used to seeing a performance while standing . However , this did n't detract from the enjoyment at all , and , as it turned out , Wind over Sand was simply a prelude to the cleverer and more entertaining numbers that were to follow . Audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there , but would have had the same appreciation we did . Felix Sampson , one of the class of ' 15 , motioned us comically to come down from the stairs , surrounding the stage , where Jadyn Burt danced to Exhibit : J , using a single box as her prop , positioning herself on each side as she explored it . Seated at what would be our vantage points for the rest of the evening , Samuel Hall and Jag Popham began their number stood at different corners of the set , one motioning ever frantically while the other stood still . Without Regard contrasted movements and styles as the pair moved closer on stage . Another seamless segue , as bright lights shone from the end of the building , and we were into Volume , set to Planningtorock 's ' Public Love ' , with the notes asking , ' If you could live in that place every day ? Think of the possibilities . ' But , like some of the performances in Karst , those possibilities had a catch , the choreography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish for . ' ( Manifest ) the Subliminal , similarly , strikes at the idea of balance , with backgrounds moving , essentially reiterating that the universe is structured the way it is for a reason . Upset that balance , and there is chaos . Loscil 's ' Esturine ' , with its repetitive rhythms and crackles contributed to an airy , almost lonely effect.Fragile Mortalities was the first number that blended visual effects as each dancer brought out a television screen with their face on it , looking cheerful , yet each began revealing their insecurities more and more , performing their internal collapses . In a similar world of paranoia , You Are My , set to the Harry Roy arrangement of ' You Are My Sunshine ' saw cheer erupt each time the music started , but the despair soon strikes one dancer , then more and more , in different forms ; words displayed at the back of the set disintegrated from hopeful to hopeless . At this point , one wondered if this reflected concerns students had about their lives in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeitgeist , and more focused on the future than those who have settled in their careers ? The 79 Bonnie Special brought the mood up slightly with the background video showing what appeared to be an old cassette-recorded programme . A tribute to New Zealand singer Connan Mockasin , using his song ' Do I Make You Feel Shy ? ' , this was a comedic take , with Georgia Rudd donning a silk gown and shades , and lip-synching into a microphone , perhaps telling a tale of fleeting fame and the low-rent world that some inhabit , thinking they are on the A-list . Again , it seemed to be on the pulse of where popular culture is , in what might be deemed a post-reality-show world . Such shows still air , but in terms of the cycle , are they beyond maturity ?

Sampson narrates the piece , joking about Rossi and providing personal details about him , and the two come to dance in unison . Only in Istanbul is described as ' A rigmarole ' in the programme notes , and the description fits : the movements are expert , but the story culminates in ' Istanbul , Not Constantinople ' and the entire cast reemerges for Absent Ritual , a number that leaves Karst on an upbeat , positive note . Te Aihe Butler 's music , which is at the fore in Absent Ritual , actually comes through in many of the numbers , and is the effective , unseen uniting force behind Karst . It deserves special mention . Taken together , one does have to ask : where are society and culture today ? Are we in times where we are leaving some of our citizens behind ?

Photo by Stephen Jaquiery . <p> Rob Halcrow argues any further housing restraints by the Government or Reserve Bank will damage the regional housing market and make no difference to Auckland . <p> Much discussion has been bandied around regarding house price rises , particularly in Auckland and Christchurch . <p> Since I joined my father 's real estate business in Auckland 50 years ago , the same discussions took place regularly although price fluctuations were not confined specifically to Auckland and Christchurch . <p> After the Auckland Harbour Bridge was opened in 1959 , and into the 1960s , tens of thousands of basic houses were built in the Auckland region . <p> They were financed through State Advances at an interest rate of 3% and deposits were obtained by capitalising on the Family Benefit . <p> In many cases no cash deposit was required . <p> To a lesser extent , the same type of housing was built all over New Zealand under the same terms and conditions . <p> After five or 10 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for various reasons , one of them being the owners were not particularly house-proud and the properties became run down . <p> This is when the ' ' do-up ' ' people emerged , who started to buy up these properties , give them a lick of paint and paper , possibly new carpets and drapes , a little landscaping and a general tidy-up . Get hold of the real estate agent and flick it on . <p> Buying cost $3000 , expenses $500 , selling for $3900 , profit $400 . Good money in those days as the weekly wage was around $50 . <p> These were the first of the quick-flick speculators , and such was the extent of activity that in 1972 the Labour government of the day brought in the Property Speculation Tax Act . <p> Some of the taxes were up to 90% , which subsequently saw virtually all properties being bought and sold by these people taken off the market . <p> The result ? <p> Not hard to guess . <p> It then created a shortage of that first-home-buyer type of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply and demand . <p> House prices doubled in no time at all . <p> The Property Speculation Tax was repealed in 1976 . <p> A capital gains tax , stamp duties or other punitive measures will not reduce house prices , quite the contrary . <p> These taxes have not kept prices down in Australia and other countries . <p> Some political parties blame immigration for increasing prices . <p> During the Labour-Coalition period 1999 to 2007 , house prices in New Zealand doubled , and this was at a time when net emigration was 20,000 to 30,000 a year . <p> The problem was still supply and demand . <p> The supply is so short in Auckland , the issue has been building up for years , that demand will increase prices . <p> People who buy with the intention of selling quickly for a profit are liable for income tax . <p> There is legislation in place so the IRD can tax these people . <p> Conversely , the supply and demand situation can make house prices go down . <p> People may leave districts when industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Places like Westport may see a downturn when the cement works close , although some areas there could be popular as ' ' lifestyle ' ' destinations . <p> Property owners who are landlords do not use their properties the same as speculators . <p> They mainly have the properties long term , primarily because tenants prefer a secure tenancy . <p> This also gives landlords the opportunity to do repairs and maintenance over an extended period which can also fit in with cashflows to pay for such work . <p> Landlords in Auckland and Christchurch will have had property values rise to such an extent they will be tempted to sell . <p> Whether they will be subject to tax will depend on their intent when buying the property , although there is now also the specific tax for investment houses in Auckland sold within two years . <p> Landlords in the regions have not seen any major gains in property values over the past seven years . <p> In Wanganui , Manawatu and Southland , there has been a slight decrease in values over that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to run their business in a careful and cautious manner . <p> Fortunately , interest rates remain relatively low . <p> There has been talk from the Reserve Bank to make banks categorise residential property lending as a separate asset class and hold more capital against the loans , as it believes these types of loans have a higher chance of default . What does this mean ? <p> It is not exactly known yet , but you can bet that it would , for a start , mean higher interest rates . <p> Any increases in costs , particularly in the regions where values are static , can only result in one outcome - higher rents . <p> The Government and the Reserve Bank have a problem with rising Auckland and Christchurch house values . <p> But that problem is with supply and demand only . <p> Christchurch house values are stabilising as supply is increasing . <p> With adequate supply in the regions , values are only , on average , up about 7% since the Global Financial Crisis . <p> Any further restraints that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional housing market and make no difference whatsoever to the Auckland market . <p> * Rob Halcrow is president of the North Otago Property Investors ' Association . <p> I agree with that actually .

You will be able to jump , bounce off of walls , have platforms fall out from underneath you , and bounce on various creatures ' heads to defeat them . Adventures of Pip lives up to that . It reminds me of playing Super Mario Bros at my grandmother 's house when I was younger and even has deadly elevator obstacles that I have n't experienced since my Sega days . <p> What TicToc Games has created though is a truly endearing , if incredibly frustrating platformer that is different enough from other games of its kind to be interesting rather than mind numbing . It will introduce a newer generation of gamers to " old school " platformers while providing older gamers a blast from the past . <p> Pip is a single pixel in a multi-pixel world where status is based off of the amount of pixels you have to your name . There is no way Pip could be any more of an underdog than a single pixel out of millions upon millions in his world . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pixels he is made from by defeating creatures embedded with power from the bitstream . <p> He has the ability to flick between forms as he needs , with the single-pixel Pip ironically often being more useful than any other version . Each form has its advantages and disadvantages depending on what you are trying to accomplish . It is a great mechanic to play with and one that makes the game much more enjoyable , especially when you are required to change form mid jump , or even mid boss fight . <p> It does n't take long to familiarise yourself with the controls , despite the fact that they are slightly unusual . Symbols hover above treasure chests , reminding you of which button to push and small picket signs along the way give you pictograms of what you need to do to overcome each new obstacle . The rest is up to you , and sometimes creative thinking is needed to combine all of your knowledge of the game together to pass the later stages and especially boss fights . <p> Combined with the powers buyable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to complete each stage . Though some of these do feel like cheating . Using an invulnerability power up to run across spikes or lava is a completely legitimate strategy , but it does take away from the normal challenging platformer experience . <p> To go with this great idea and great mechanics though is a subpar story and rather poor writing . The basic plot is the underdog rescuing the Princess from the villain . Adventures of Pip tries to be subversive and play with the tropes of rescuing the damsel in distress : the Princess will not fall in love with the hero and the villain genuinely believes she is bettering the world by making every pixel equal rather than just wanting to kidnap the Princess for the sake of it . But these elements are thrown in quite haphazardly as if they were an afterthought . <p> Creative thinking is needed to combine all of your knowledge of the game together to pass the later stages <p> Not to mention that almost every line of dialogue tries to be witty . Tries , but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miss , and leaves you feeling as if something is just slightly off kilter about the dialogue . One thing done very well , though , is Pip . He is a surprisingly likeable character despite his lack of defining physical characteristics and complete lack of dialogue . <p> Visually , Adventures of Pip is stunning . With bright colours , an endearing art style , and creative looking monsters and characters there is always something to keep you interested . The different environments for each level are paired with appropriate musical scores that enhance the experience . The music for the boss fights is similar in feeling to the music played when you first defeat the Pok ? mon league , and leaves you feeling just as accomplished . Especially since it can take a few tries to beat a boss fight , each time figuring out a new trick to help you succeed . <p> Dying and learning is a main aspect of the game . It can lead to a lot of frustration , especially if platformer games are not your preferred style of game to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishment in clearing a stage . Adventures of Pip is a throwback to the days when you needed practice and a fair amount of luck to finish a game , because you did n't even know what strategy guides were , let alone how to get your hands on one . Expect a bit of rage quitting , though . <p> The nostalgia , the beautiful design , and the amazingly fun ability of flicking between forms battles against a basic , overdone plot and poor writing . Overall I enjoyed Adventures of Pip for its novel aspects and sighed my way through the parts that let it down . If I could go back in time I would definitely play Adventures of Pip again - frustration , failed witty comments and all - though I 'm not so sure I will play this game again anytime soon .

Graham Brazier was 63 when he suffered a heart attack in the Bay of Island , later passing away at an Auckland rehabilitation facility . <p> With his band Hello Sailor Brazier produced the first New Zealand record album to go gold back in 1977 . <p> Brazier lived the rock and roll lifestyle to its full -- good and bad , creative and destructive . <p> At the 2013 sentencing for assaulting his partner , the judge noted he had " long-standing dependency/addiction to substances " . <p> He also lived a life which intermeshed legend and myth -- according to whom you believe he was either invited to join the Doors or had his music ripped off by American retro rockers the Knack . <p> Myths aside , Brazier was absolutely captivating on stage - head tilted , lips pouting and left hand quivering with the electricity that seemed to pour out of him . <p> I first saw him live at the Terminus in Timaru , home town of the original Dance Exponents with whom Brazier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live at Mainstreet " . <p> A few years later I saw him play the Gladstone in Christchurch where I got to photograph him pre-gig for a student newspaper . <p> Brazier felt at home in the regions and played to packed audiences when he took Sailor on the road . <p> The provinces are also giving Jetstar a warm reception at the moment with the recent news they are expanding their services from the main hubs to target heartland New Zealand . <p> The low cost carrier has won private and public support with the news it 's bringing five more aircraft into New Zealand and will provide new connections to Napier , New Plymouth , Nelson and Palmerston North . <p> With initial promotional fares of just a few bucks and improved ability to operate national businesses from regional towns , the announcement has gone down well . <p> Given these four new destinations will interconnect with the current five metropolitan hubs the total effect of new possible travel routes is n't trivial . <p> Not only will consumers and regional businesses get a better deal and better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new locations fit in well with the current popularity for " short break " style getaways . <p> And if the effusive support from provincial mayors and regional tourism organisations is anything to go by , you can guess the new destinations will be tipping in some resource to make sure the new access is utilised . <p> It 's also been refreshing to see the self-effacing humour in the television commercial that Australian-owned Jetstar is using . <p> The amusing clip features an Australian announcer who clearly is n't the sharpest pencil in the case displaying well scripted ignorance of New Zealand geography . <p> Joking aside , Jetstar faces two challenges to make a fist of this latest opportunity -- one from without and one from within . <p> The external challenge will simply be getting sufficient bums on seats . <p> While promotional pricing and aggressive advertising will help ensure the initial seats are full , if the public do n't continue to respond over the medium term then the maths simply wo n't work . <p> No-one has confirmed how long the new provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to pull the pin if the necessary numbers are n't reached . <p> However the bigger challenge is from within . <p> Not so long ago the Jetstar brand was synonymous with terrible customer service and worse public relations -- even their public relations advisers fired them . <p> Everyone seemed to have a story of cancelled flights , dreadful customer service and diabolical communications . <p> And the ( then ) chief executive did n't help by robotically repeating a single sentence to the media . <p> Rather than just annoying time-poor business people , Jetstar seemed to have an uncanny ability to target the disabled . <p> The cut price airline repeatedly refused to board wheelchair-bound customers . In one memorable case rather than talk to the customers , the Jetstar staff rang the customers ' boss , effectively treating them as mentally disabled rather than physically disabled . <p> It subsequently emerged that Paralympics New Zealand had major issues with the company on a separate issue , when six of an eight-member team were turned away . <p> A Google search quickly brings thousands of customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protest website which diarises individual fail stories and charts the worst destinations and the worst ports of origin . <p> So this latest expansion of service by Jetstar is n't just a chance to grow its local business , it 's also a great opportunity to rebuild the brand . <p> Thirty years ago after taking his photograph , I asked Brazier how he felt when he went out on stage each night . " I just try not to bugger it up , " he told me . <p> Pretty good advice for Jetstar right now I reckon . <p> Mike " MOD " O'Donnell is a professional director and international growth manager .

@@4883236 navigating redundancies of employees on parental leave <p> JESSIE LAPTHORNE <p> Last updated 05:00 , December 4 2015 <p> 123RF <p> Devastating a young family by making someone redundant while they are on parental leave is technically legal but the bar for it is set high for the employer . <p> OPINION : Q : One of my staff members is on parental leave and the company will be going through a restructure while she 's on leave . Her position is likely to change or be terminated completely . Is this legal ? How do I navigate the issues involved here ? <p> A : The short answer is , yes -- provided that the redundancy is genuine , and there is no prospect of appointing the person to a role which is vacant and substantially similar to their role -- it is legal to make an employee on parental leave redundant . <p> In doing so , you would , still need to carry out a full and fair consultation process . On this point , it is important to note that the bar for what is expected , particularly in terms of redeployment to another a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves an employee on parental leave . <p> So beware -- this process can be extremely difficult to navigate your way through unaided , and if things are n't done correctly you may face claims for a breach of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act and discrimination . <p> There is a presumption that an employee 's role will be kept open for them while they are on parental leave except in limited circumstances . <p> Employers are not allowed to dismiss employees during their period of parental leave except if their role genuinely becomes redundant after they have been told their job can be kept open , and where there is no prospect of being able to appoint them to a role which is vacant and is substantially similar to their role . <p> The first point to note about this exception is that the redundancy situation must be genuine . <p> If the restructure is being used as ' smokescreen ' to exit the employee from the business , then the employee is likely to be able to successfully challenge their dismissal . <p> It also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role could be kept open . <p> So the exception wo n't be available if you were already considering a restructure before giving this notice . <p> Assuming that this process is sincere , it is critical that you engage in meaningful consultation with the employee about the proposal to restructure . <p> Importantly , employers have an obligation to consult before any decision has been made about whether to go ahead with the proposal . <p> Even though it may seem inappropriate , you are required to contact the employee during their parental leave to discuss the proposal . <p> If you wait until they are due to return to work to raise the matter , the likelihood is that the decision will have already been made and the consultation process will be nothing more than lip service to procedural requirements , leaving you open to legal action . <p> Consulting with any employee affected by a proposed restructure needs to be managed sensitively . This is especially so when someone is on parental leave . You may want to factor in some adjustments to the consultation process to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employee on this . <p> Whilst face-to-face redundancy consultation meetings are normally recommended , you may like to offer the employee the opportunity to do this over the phone , if it 's more convenient for them . <p> Either way , do n't forget to offer them the opportunity to have the assistance of a support person . <p> Once you have explained the proposed restructure and the reasons for it to the employee , you need to ask them for their feedback including any questions or alternative solutions they might want to put forward . <p> Remember , the employee may have also been giving some thought to what they would like their role to look like on their return , and they could be open to returning to work part-time or even doing a different role . <p> Any feedback or suggestions put forward need to be genuinely considered before making your decision about how to proceed . <p> If you decide to go ahead with the restructure , you then have to look for suitable redeployment opportunities . <p> There is more complexity when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onus is on the employer to show that there is no prospect of appointing them to a vacant position substantially similar to the role they held before going on leave . If there are n't any vacancies at that time , rather than giving the employee notice of termination , it might be appropriate to retain the employee and re-assess when the period of parental leave is coming to an end . Whether you should do so will depend on the prospect of a role becoming available . <p> As I said , this is a very tricky area of the law . Each case will depend on the circumstances and no one case will be the same . <p> Jessie Lapthorne is an employment lawyer and associate at Duncan Cotterill.

And in an age when change is speeding up , it could well come under increased threat . <p> All sports clubs and other organisations can do , if they are to have a future , is to adapt as well as build on their residual strengths . <p> Human beings have fundamental needs to be part of groups and communities , to belong , and it must be hoped this can be fostered in new ways and old . We will all , as individuals and communities , be the healthier for that . <p> This editorial is quite accurate . I myself belong to only one club and would like to belong to a number of others in which I have interest . However I work 50 hours a week ( not complaining - it 's worth it ) and have a family to spend time with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However it 's not all doom and gloom .

@@4926236 <h> The US Congress and the Omnibus Military Bill <h> The Permanent War State : The US Congress and the Omnibus Military Bill <p> Binoy Kampmark <p> " The funding to continue the war against ISIL is an authorization of force against ISIL , albeit a quiet one , designed not to attract public attention . " Jack Goldsmith , Lawfare , Dec 17 , 2015 <p> Money is raining down on the US military complex in the $1.15 trillion spending bill that was unveiled on Wednesday by various leaders of Congress . Of that portion , a good $572.7 billion is set aside for Pentagon expenditure . ( These figures tend to be deceptive in themselves , given the notoriously unreliable accuracy of defence accounting . ) <p> The portions , roughly broken down , come to $58.6 billion for so-called Global War on Terror/Overseas Contingency Operations ( GWOT/OCO ) funds , $111 billion for procurement , which comes to $17 billion more than actual expenditures for the 2015 fiscal year , and $49.8 billion for R&amp;D -- $13.7 billion more than 2015 ( Defense News , Dec 16 ) . <p> House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers ( R-Ky. ) pressed his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects conservative priorities in both funding and policy -- including support for critical areas such as our national defence , halting many harmful regulations , and trimming wasteful spending . " <p> The overwhelming message here was placed on security , even if there were also very public utterances on the issue of Puerto Rican debt and an end to the ban on crude oil exports . There was less concern about funding ongoing civilian operations -- the stress , rather , was on the issue of entrenching the state in what could only be described as a deeper war footing . <p> Democrat mainstays , despite facing opposition within their own ranks on various parts of the bill , were similarly eager to get it to pass , which it ultimately did . To not pass it would be irresponsible , suggested Whip Steny Hoyer ( D-Md. ) while minority leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) was insisting that differences be worked out . <p> The Omnibus bill contains a few sneaky provisions . All in all , this forms a standard tactic : a weighty volume of 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and importantly , not debated with any degree of thoroughness , let alone awareness . In the case of such matters as continued authorisation of force , this is a notable point indeed . <p> Rogers claims , for instance , that the bill " includes funds to combat the real-world threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) . " Some analysis on this suggests that the funds will issue from the OCO funding pool , a practice that has been previously suggested by the Obama administration . In November last year , President Barack Obama proposed amendments for the Department of Defense ( DOD ) and the Department of State and Other International Programs to fund Overseas Contingency Operations . These included " $5.6 billion for OCO activities to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) -- including military operations as part of Operation Inherent Resolve . " <p> The legal overview of this by legal commentators such as Harvard University 's Jack Goldsmith suggests that Congress will effectively authorise the use of force by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , given that section 8(a) ( 1 ) of the War Powers Resolution suggests that congressional authorisation for the use of force " shall not be inferred from any provision of law ... , including any provision contained in any appropriation Act , unless such provision specifically authorises the introduction of the United States Armed Forces into hostilities " . <p> Quibblers will see this differently , but it seems clear that a bit of legal acrobatics has been done here to effectively engage the US in deeper involvement in overseas conflict without broader public debate . At the very least , it suggests that the war machine should continue uninterrupted by the intrusiveness of public discussion . <p> A memorandum opinion for the US Attorney general from the Justice Department regarding continued authorisation for military operations in Kosovo in 2000 is a case in point . The opinion regards it as given wisdom that " Congress may express approval through the appropriations process " in the area of war making . <p> It doing so , it takes a rather flexible view about the War Powers Resolution framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the framers of the Constitution of the United States and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities " and " continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations . " <p> Section 8(a) ( 1 ) of the War Powers Resolution is effectively neutered , as , according to the Kosovo memorandum , it " does not bar later Congresses from authorizing military operations through appropriation " as a later Congress can not be bound by the will of a previous one . In any case , one should try as best to see a direct intent on the part of Congress to authorise such force . <p> An open door in the bill is thereby allowed for the introduction of US armed or military forces into hostilities against Iraq and Syria , or into their respective territories . While the public face of the Obama administration is set against the formal deployment of US combat personnel on the ground , the infrastructure is very much there to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those legal channels . <p> The permanent state of war the US finds itself is not merely set to get deeper at the operational level ; it is set to be further legalised , at least in the eyes of Congress , in a surreptitious way . Fine , and importantly informed scrutiny , is set to further abate . <p> The Paris climate agreement is an extraordinary achievement . It codifies the long-term goal of keeping global temperature increases below 2 ? C. It also sets a more ambitious aspirational target of capping global warming at 1.5 ? C degrees ... More&gt;&gt; <p> How , in a global metropolis like New York , do you write about immigration as a problem to be solved ? And yet immigration is a hot button issue among those fighting to break away from the unruly clump of starters in the race for Republican nominee .

" A statement issued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Campbell , chief of US-led forces in Afghanistan , apologised . More&gt;&gt; <h> ALSO : <p> The question was one of timing .
