' People familiar with Goonewardena 's ' surprises ' -- such as hiring scantily-clad Brazilian dancers to perform at the fundraiser he organized in Los Angeles in 1999 for UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe -- braced themselves . <p> This time , he staged a ' Hollywood ' version of Sri Lankan Independence Day , with two non-Sri Lankan emcees and performers injecting ' American showbiz ' into the inherently staid and decorous event . With the exclusion of the cultural show that included traditional Sri Lankan dance and musical items , the event was a self-promoting blitz , not unlike a Kim Il Jung celebratory bash . The experience has left many in the community bitterly complaining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one individual , showcase his friends and business partners , and undermine the very thing they came to celebrate . " Everything that was about Sri Lanka took a backseat . Sri Lanka happened to be an accident at this event . Seems like he the consul general has an inferiority complex about his own culture , " said Ms. Sumudu Hewamadduma , financial controller at a leading Southern California firm who , together with her five-year old daughter , participated in the cultural event . <p> Medini Ratnayake , head of the non-profit Serendib Foundation which has produced the Independence Day cultural show for four years , was angered enough to dash off a complaint to President Rajapaksa in which she called the consul general 's behavior ' disgraceful , ' the community 's experience ' painful , ' and subtly urged a recall of the diplomat by calling on the Sri Lankan leader to bring about a ' resolution beneficial to the Sri Lankan American expatriate community in Southern California . ' <p> Ratnayake , who undertook the grueling responsibility of organizing a show that featured 175 performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind-the-scenes details which indicate a struggle between her group and the consul general over his ignorance of protocol and his lack of enthusiasm for Sri Lankan culture . During initial planning discussions , the consul general had not been enthusiastic about Sri Lankan cultural items . Finding them ' too slow and boring , ' he proposed spicing up the event with Latin American dancers . The proposal was dropped only after Serendib to withdraw from the event altogether . Ratnayake said it took a similar threat to elevate President Rajapaksa 's Independence Day message to the community to its due place -- immediately after the religious ceremonies . <p> Initially , the President 's message was to be superseded by the launching of the ' official website ' and of a giant ( 60 x 40 ft ) Sri Lankan billboard near the Los Angeles International Airport . Although touted as attracting ' thousands of Americans , beckoning them to visit Sri Lanka ' in reality , the billboard is hardly visible to passing motorists on Century Blvd . Los Angeles resident Kirula Hettigoda who drove with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times before spotting it . Its skyline choking with ' the blight of billboards , ' Los Angeles has a ban on new billboards since 1992 . Is the Sri Lankan billboard legal ? Does it have a valid safety permit ? In whose name ? The consul general has refused to answer such simple questions . <p> The cultural event was delayed by an hour while speakers paid tribute to Goonewardena , and when it did get started , they were made to feel like intruders , say both Ratnayake and Hewamadduma . In addition to sending ' hurry up ' messages backstage , the consul general arrived in person to hasten the exit of the Lankan performers , telling the producers to stop the performance because the ' Hollywood ' performers were getting antsy to get their show on stage . Ratnayake says the consul general thought so little of the Sri Lankan performers , he did not even mention them in his speech and the names of only two of the 17 groups that participated made their way to the special souvenir . " To our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture 2 days before the event were included in the program booklet , " Ratnayake added . <p> Hewamadduma described the consul general 's slighting of his own community and culture as being analogous to the host of a party throwing out his furniture because he 's ashamed of it and then borrowing a neighbor 's furniture just to impress the guests . " We were like the furniture he 's ashamed of , " she said . <p> Another major complaint is that some attendees were humiliated and embarrassed when they arrived at the venue : those holding red invitation cards , the consul general 's inner circle , were admitted to an exclusive reception where there was food and drink and even goodie bags , while the rest ( including Sri Lankan artistes and long-time community activists ) became ' second class citizens , ' left standing outside or directed to enter through a back door . However , the phenomenon of the ' inner circle , ' based on social class and privilege , is nothing new in Los Angeles and other Sri Lankan expatriate communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red and blue cards . <p> Notably , there was one speaker who stayed on course -- Congresswoman Judy Chu ( D -- CA 32nd ) who paid a short but generous tribute to Sri Lankan democratic institutions and the country 's success in winning the war . In contrast , Oceanside mayor Jim Wood made it apparent that he was there to talk about his friend . ( Goonewardena had once donated $1000 to the mayor who , without the city council 's knowledge , conferred on him the title of ' Honorary Mayor . ' ) After making small talk about the year of his birth coinciding with the year of Sri Lankan independence , Wood launched into a spiel , trying to make the audience believe in the magnanimity of ' my friend Jeff ' who , according to him , gave up his business in the US after the tsunami and returned to Sri Lanka just to engage in charity work . Wood credited the consul general with building 2 medical clinics and 2 playgrounds , getting military helicopters to distribute food to the tsunami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected . ' <p> Egregious Claims <p> The mayor 's pitch was bested by Goonewardena ( who failed to even ' ayubowan ' his compatriots ) generously patting himself on the back with the egregious claim of having made ' a tremendous difference in the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and the US ' ( an apparent reference to his numerous paid photo ops with the ' American political hierarchy ' as he calls it ) . He also took the opportunity to talk about phone calls he gets from Sri Lanka from his ' mom ' and about his hotels being fully booked for months to come . Then he launched into an incredible story , describing his experience as a special negotiator for the government after being summoned by Mahinda Rajapaksa , then prime minister , and given the herculean assignment of bringing peace . " Jeff , please go to the north and build relationship with the terrorists . sic " Goonewardena then took off to Killinochchi where he says he met with all the LTTE leaders except Prabhakaran . The LTTE top brass took a liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five times . He went on to build a 10-acre playground in the Tiger stronghold ! The Tigers wanted him to carry a message to Rajapaksa : that they wanted the north and they were not prepared to lay down their arms ( no kidding ! ) . He bravely refused to carry such a message to ' my prime minister . ' Soon after that , he received an email from the Tigers telling him not to return to Killinochchi . " The Tigers killed my uncle and aunty , Mr. &amp; Mrs. C.V . Gunaratne and also my cousin , ' he claimed . This is a slight variation of the story he narrated when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors invited him , as a new member of the local consular corp , to introduce himself . In that story , the LTTE killed three of his uncles . <p> Fallout <p> Fallout from the infamous Independence Day event continues to roil the community . Much of the blame is being apportioned to GOSL . <p> " Definitely people in charge of the Foreign Service are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current CG has no qualifications to be in this position , " said Long Beach resident Asela Indraratne , a manager at Exxon-Mobil . <p> Echoing that opinion , Saliya Ukuwela , a businessman living in Orange County , said " Surely there are some basic qualifications that a diplomat being sent to a place like Los Angeles must have ? <p> Ven . Aparekke Punyasiri , Chief Incumbent of Maithri Buddhist Meditation Center , Sun Valley , said diplomats mirror the governments they represent . " What 's happening in Los Angeles shows that the government has no direction . They do n't know where they 're going . " <p> Fueled by Goonewardena 's public boasts of having associated with the president for more than 20 years and of being a ' Senior Advisor ' to him , the common belief is that Goonewardena was hand-picked by President Rajapaksa to be consul general . <p> And he would have people believe that he took the Los Angeles appointment almost as a favor to ' Mahinda aiyya . ' <p> Next stop UN ? <p> But for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goonewardena first came to the attention of the Sri Lankan community when an Orange County newspaper published an interview with him about a restaurant he operated at the time .

On the way to SL he would be stopping at the White House to present to President Reagan a " small 22-carat gold and ivory elephant , encrusted with sapphires , rubies and other precious stones , " and then zipping across the Atlantic to Buckingham Palace to present the same gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not get elected to parliament , was " to become the ambassador to the United States or the United Nations . " <p> That was 1988 . He is now in a high-profile diplomatic position , just 3000 miles and a 5-hour plane ride short of those ambitions . Goonewardena has ceased being a mere source of comic relief . With the possibility of that Plan B hovering in the background , the only person laughing is the consul general .

@@4081234 <h> April 5th events and the 1978 constitution <p> " What the 1971 uprising in fact showed was a great discontent spread throughout the country , particularly among the younger generation . Large numbers of youths showed willingness to support a call for rebellion , even without any convincing theory or practical , organizational structure to convince them of the validity of the political thought and strategy of the JVP . " <p> by Basil Fernando <p> ( April 05 , Hong Kong , Sri Lanka Guardian ) April 5th has significance to Sri Lanka due to the JVP uprising of 1971 . The word uprising has been used for this event by way of an exaggeration . The exaggeration came mainly from the then-government and its propaganda machinery , supported also by UNP , who were the main opposition party , in unleashing unrestrained repression to suppress whatever that was taking place . It is this massive suppression that is being justified by the use of the word ' uprising ' for what happened in 1971 . <p> The events of 1971 do not compare in significance in any way with the 1953 hartal , which was in fact a mass uprising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That uprising came as a result of a call by several political parties , led mainly by the Lanka Samasamaja Party , as a protest against the increase of the price of rationed rice by the UNP government , whose Minister of Finance was JR Jayawardene . The 1953 uprising virtually shattered the political arrangements of the country and the impact of this great event has not yet been properly grasped . As compared to this , what happened in 1971 was a few activities by groups of young rebels who were loosely organized and who believed in taking up arms against the state . However , between the idea of making an armed uprising and the actual performance , there was a vast gap . Perhaps that was due to the exposure of the attempts to make hand bombs in a few places . The government , which was alerted , immediately went into action , granting license to kill anyone who was suspected of having any kind of a connection with the JVP . <p> In the first days that followed there were large numbers of killings after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 10,000 . Some even give the figure as 21,000 . Due to the intervention of many persons , the government was persuaded to declare an amnesty for those who surrendered . Literally thousands of young persons surrendered , mostly at the encouragement of parents who just wanted to ensure that they would be kept alive . <p> At the inquiry before the Criminal Justice Commission , the Attorney-General stated in court that the existence of the uprising will be taken as a presumption , and that therefore there was no need to prove the existence of an uprising . The defence did not challenge this position . Perhaps it was to the advantage of the JVP leaders to appear as leaders of a great uprising . Some of the JVP leaders cashed in on this , comparing themselves to the heroes of the 1918 and 1948 rebellions . <p> What the 1971 uprising in fact showed was a great discontent spread throughout the country , particularly among the younger generation . Large numbers of youths showed willingness to support a call for rebellion , even without any convincing theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity of the political thought and strategy of the JVP . In fact , there was hardly any kind of political thought , going by the famous five lessons and the lengthy answers given by the JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera during the interrogation relating to the April 5th events . That long document that consisted of his statement to the Criminal Investigation Division showed enormous confusion about a strategy for Sri Lanka , but also about the history of revolutionary movements , and particularly about Marxist thought and history . <p> The repression of the JVP in 1971 had its impact felt on the political events that were to follow later . All who took to arms in the south and in the north and the east expected the worst by way of repression and therefore were themselves willing to take to the most brutal forms of violence . The nature of the violence that took place in the 1980 's and after in Sri Lanka can only be fathomed by understanding the nature of the repression that was unleashed in 1971 . <p> The greatest advantage of 1971 fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jayawardene . This party had had an ignominious defeat in 1970 , when the coalition parties won a massive electoral victory with more than 2/3 majority in parliament . This was to be reversed in 1978 , when the United National Party won over 80% of seats in the parliament . One of the major reasons for that victory was the political confusion that followed the 1971 April events . <p> JR Jayawardene , one of whose main ambitions in life was to crush the labour movement in Sri Lanka , utilized this event to maximum use by supporting the coalition government to take whatever repressive action without posing any limits as an opposition party . He saw that his aims would be best served at this point by supporting the coalition government rather than by opposing it . <p> With the easy victory won in 1978 , JR Jayawardene proceeded to displace the basic democratic system itself by giving himself powers and legally destabilizing the system of checks and balances . It can be said that the greatest beneficiary of the 1971 events was JR Jayawardene . His political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and the notion of the separation of powers . When such a drastic change was proposed in form of 1978 constitution there was hardly any serious discussion within the country . The nation is still trapped by this political scheme and all attempts to escape from it have failed . Subsequently , JR Jayawardene 's own party fell victim to Jayawardene 's scheme . <p> The way the repressive forces within Sri Lanka used the 1971 April events needs far closer study and analysis . <p> ( W.J.

@@4081236 leadership vacuum <p> Kumar Sangakkara has sought to allay fears that there will be a vacuum left in the leadership of the Sri Lankan team after his resignation from captaincy by saying that there was no dearth of men who could take up the role . " I think we have Tillakaratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews . We have Lasith Malinga and Upul Tharanga for the shorter versions , " Sangakkara said . " We have enough candidates to pick from . " <p> Given that the coach 's position is also currently vacant , Sangakkara said that this was the right time for a change of captain .

" <p> Sangakkara , along with Mahela Jayawardene , has been the face of Sri Lankan cricket over the past few years , and he seamlessly took over the captaincy from Jayawardene in 2009 . Sangakkara felt that the mantle of Sri Lankan cricket now rightfully belonged to the younger generation and that is where the new leader would have to come from . " If you really look at our side , me and Mahela , we are , maybe , a few remnants of a past era . New blood has come in and a lot of younger players have stood up and have been counted . So I think now it 's their time , it 's there future and they need to make sure that they carry this team forward . <p> " If I had stayed in the job for another year , maybe a year-and-a-half , the new thinking , the freshness would n't have been there .

And whether we had gone out of the first round of the World Cup or whether we had gone all the way , it would n't have mattered , this decision would have still stood . <p> " We announce it now because I leave for the IPL tomorrow and I need to make sure that the selectors have enough time . " <p> Muttiah Muralitharan was the first person in the team to know about Sangakkara 's decision , even before he had conveyed it to de Silva .

Malinga ( more injury problems than Matthews ) &amp; Tharanga do not bear considering . Why not wait a couple of years more &amp; then let Matthews ( injuries attended to ) to take over for WC 2015 ? <p> Thanks Sanga &amp; your good friend Mahela for the effort put into to build on what Arjuna , Aravinda , Murali &amp; Vaas ( amongst several others ) did , &amp; for the memories ! <p> MaxG9 <p> skhurram.com on April 6 , 2011 , 9:04 GMT <p> Kumar Sangakkara ! <p> You have always been on top of my " Gentlemen playing cricket " list .

Cricket is heading to a new era where the dominating power has shifted towards India and 3 young captains leading 3 crucial test teams ahead of the Test Championship ! Way to go ! Looking forward to it ! <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 8:44 GMT <p> Sanga ... noble decision , at a time where aging cricketers demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years back . However , please be open to take over the leadership if it falls vacant again 2 years later from now . Remember the rest of the team other than You Mahela , and Murali are still finding their own roles in the team , and are pretty new to the whole scene . <p> Leading a subcontinent team while still learning the ropes of how to survive in the team is not a joke . Having said this the appointment of captain needs to be decided by the administration and you being the professional you are , have left it to them . You Mahela could have held on to these positions till the cows came home , and you very well deserved to do it too . But you have told the world that the Sri Lankan cricket captaincy is not some thing that you get to keep but its some thing you earn through merit year in year out ... WELL DONE SIR , we salute you ! ! ! <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 8:25 GMT <p> U r the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway i wish Angelo Mathews as a next captain , because he is very young and talented . <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 7:49 GMT <p> i think , mahela should hold the leadership until next world cup . till mathews and tharanga get some more experience <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 7:45 GMT <p> may be can change vise-captaincy to grow someone as a captain ... but Sanga should lead 2015 world cup i guess <p> @ Sujan Rao . U may be kidding . If Dhoni ( with 54 Test 166 ODI to date ) can be a captain 3 years ago , why cant Dilshan with 66 tests and 203 ODI s. and he was in international arena since 1998 and i cant understand u telling not experienced enough . but i prefer Mathews as we want a long time character to lead the team . <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 7:05 GMT <p> so his he gon na play till next world cup nad support the team <p> RajithaS on April 6 , 2011 , 7:01 GMT <p> Continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only two players I can think of that are must players . Players that MUST be in the team . That is Dilshan and Angelo Mathews . We all felt Angelo 's absence in the WC Finals . But of these two players if I 'm not mistakes Dilshan has already captain the side once or twice and he just did not show any captaincy material . We need a cool guy for the job . We need people like Arjuna , Mahela and Sanga . Personality also goes a long way in a good captain . I do n't know whether Angelo has those qualities since we have n't seen him captain yet . But all I can say is that Dilshan does not seem to have those qualities . <p> RajithaS on April 6 , 2011 , 7:00 GMT <p> A very wise decision by Sanga . These are the sort of people we need in the team.Players that think abt the country and not abt each other . He lead the team that beat Ausies in Ausies in a series for the first time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's bit with the bat by being the third highest scorer of the entire tournament . So give it up on a high . Great ambassador for sports all across the globe . Sanga knows that by the time the next world cup comes around in 2015 , he will be 37 . And at that age he would have lost he 's touch at least a little and therefore he 's place in the team is not guaranteed . A captain has to be somebody who is a sure player in the side . No matter what the situation is the captain has to be a player who is a must in the team . Like Mahela and Sanga was the last 4-6 years . But by 2015 Sanga and Mahela might not be must have players in the side . So great move by Sanga . <p> KarthikCricketFan on April 6 , 2011 , 5:52 GMT <p> Proud of sanga ! !

Are u kidding me ? u r just tired after the campaign.Thats all.Not for this foolish IPL , u could take some time and come fresh.Please Sanga , work with someone new as ur deputy for one year and then resign.Having Mahela VC for world cup is great , but the new captain should first have been VC , di=ont u think ? <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 4:26 GMT <p> Yes , I respect his views . But as Sujan Rao aptly put it there is no successor in-waiting ( Dilshan is older than Sanga &amp; the rest are too young ) . Those who will like to see SL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere is no reason for Sanga to step down until a a good replacement is in place . Only hope is SL Cricket will ask him to go on til a good replacement is found and Sanga acceeds . After all ICC Expert Panel selected Sanga as the ICC World Cup Team ! NJ . <p> Rashadhi on April 6 , 2011 , 4:22 GMT <p> When I heard this I was shocked , but looking at the reason you are mentioning , I am proud to be a Sri Lankan . Still I am thinking Sanga should captain the team for 1 year or so with new vice captain ( Dilshan or Mathews ) , after that the vice captain can continue as captain . Which will be a good decision for the SL cricket . <p> on April 6 , 2011 , 4:18 GMT <p> Do nt give up the captaincy sanga ..

Sanga could have stayed on till the next world cup when he 'd be 37 years old . Having too many ex-captains in the team makes it hard for the new captain . Anyway , i hope the Sri Lankan team overcomes these issues . <p> hirunda on April 6 , 2011 , 0:55 GMT <p> I Believe this is a perfect decision to make time wise . The team can build itself up from where Sanga left with a new rebeliant attitude .

I think its such a positive attitude to have faith in the next generation of players early enough and mould them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready " . All the best for the next leader and all the best for Sanga . We will miss Murali , Vass , Sanath along the way and they are quiet big shoes to fill .

There 's this report that was commissioned by the UN about war crimes , I think , final stage of the conflict .

TONER : Yeah . I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have encouraged the Sri Lankan Government to engage in a process of accountability and to also use this panel of experts and their expertise , obviously , to address some of the questions . <p> Inner City Press : The government 's already kind of condemned the Panel , and I wonder whether the U.S. thinks this Lesson Learnt and Reconciliation Commission that the government set up itself -- was that sufficient ? Or are you looking for more -- <p> MR . TONER : And again , I think that we believe that the Lessons Learnt commission and Reconciliation commission were good steps . But we believe also that the UN Panel of Experts is a useful asset and should be taken advantage of by the government . <p> As appeared online : <p> Report of the UNSG 's panel of experts on accountability in SL <p> April 15 , 2011 , 6:24 pm <p> Allegations found credible by the Panel <p> The Panel 's determination of credible allegations reveals a very different version of the final stages of the war than that maintained to this day by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued a " humanitarian rescue operation " with a policy of " zero civilian casualties " . In stark contrast , the Panel found credible allegations , which if proven , indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law were committed both by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE , some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity . Indeed , the conduct of the war represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace . <p> Specially the Panel found credible allegations associated with the final stages of the war . Between September 2008 and 19 May 2009 , the Sri Lanka Army advanced its military campaign into the Vanni using large-scale and widespread shelling causing large numbers of civilian deaths . This campaign constituted persecution of the population of the Vanni . Around 330,000 civilians were trapped into an ever decreasing area , fleeing the shelling but kept hostage by the LTTE . The Government sought to intimidate and silence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of threats and actions , including the use of white vans to abduct and to make people disappear . <p> The Government shelled on a large scale in three consecutive No Fire Zones , where it had encouraged the civilian population to concentrate , even after indicating that it would cease the use of heavy weapons . It shelled the United Nations hub , food distribution lines and near the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ships that were coming to pick up the wounded and their relatives from the beaches . It shelled in spite of its knowledge of the impact , provided by its own intelligence systems and through notification by the United Nations , the ICRC and others . Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by Government shelling . <p> The Government systematically shelled hospitals on the frontlines . All hospitals in the Vanni were hit by mortars and artillery , some of them were hit repeatedly , despite the fact that their locations were well-known to the Government . The Government also systematically deprived people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and medical supplies , particularly surgical supplies , adding to their suffering . To this end , it purposely underestimated the number of civilians who remained in the conflict zone . Tens of thousands lost their lives from January to May 2009 , many of whom died anonymously in the carnage of the final few days . <p> The Government subjected victims and survivours of the conflict to further deprivation and suffering after they left the conflict zone . Screening for suspected LTTE took place without any transparency or external scrutiny . Some of those who were separated were summarily executed , and some of the women may have been raped . Others disappeared , as recounted by their wives and relatives during the LLRC hearings . All IDPs were detained in closed camps . Massive overcrowding led to terrible conditions , breaching the basic social and economic rights of the detainees , and many lives were lost unnecessarily . Some persons in the camps were interrogated and subjected to torture . Suspected LTTE cadres were removed to other facilities , with no contact with the outside world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite grave danger in the conflict zone , the LTTE refused civilians permission to leave , using them as hostages , at times even using their presence as a strategic human buffer between themselves and the advancing Sri Lanka Army . It implemented a policy of forced recruitment throughout the war , but in the final stages greatly intensified its recruitment of people of all ages , including children as young as fourteen . The LTTE forced civilians to dig trenches for its own defenses , thereby contributing to blurring the distinction between combatants and civilians and exposing civilians to additional harm . All of this was done in a quest to pursue a war that was clearly lost ; many civilians were sacrificed on the altar of the LTTE cause and its efforts to preserve its senior leadership . <p> From February 2009 onwards , the LTTE started point-blank shooting of civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone , significantly adding to the death toll in the final stages of the war . It also fired artillery in proximity to large groups of internally displaced persons ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near IDPs or civilian installations such as hospitals . Throughout the final stages of the war , the LTTE continued its policy of suicide attacks outside the conflict zone . Even though its ability to perpetrate such attacks was diminished compared to previous phases of the conflict , it perpetrated a number of attacks against civilians outside the conflict zone . <p> Thus , in conclusion , the Panel found credible allegations that comprise five core categories of potential serious violations committed by the Government of Sri Lanka : ( i ) killing of civilians through widespread shelling ; ( ii ) shelling of hospitals and humanitarian objects ; ( iii ) denial of humanitarian assistance ; ( iv ) human rights violations suffered by victims and survivors of the conflict , including against the media and other critics of the Government . <p> The Panel 's determination of credible allegations against the LTTE associated with the final stages of the war reveal six core categories of potential serious violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ii ) killing civilians attempting to flee LTTE control ; ( iii ) using military equipment in the proximity of civilians ; ( iv ) forced recruitment of children ; ( v ) forced labour ; and ( vi ) killing of civilians through suicide attacks . <p> Accountability <p> Accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law is not a matter of choice or policy ; it is a duty under domestic and international law . These credibly alleged violations demand a serious investigation and the prosecution of those responsible . If proven , those most responsible , including Sri Lanka Army commanders and senior Government officials , as well as military and civilian LTTE leaders , would bear criminal liability for international crimes . <p> At the same time , accountability goes beyond the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes that have been committed ; rather it is a broad process that addressed the political , legal and moral responsibility of individuals and institutions for past violations of human rights and dignity . Consistent with the international standards mentioned above , accountability necessarily includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accountability also requires an official acknowledgment by the State of its role and responsibility in violating the rights of its citizens , when that has occurred . In keeping with United Nations policy , the Panel does not advocate a " one-size-fits-all " formula or the importation of foreign models for accountability ; rather it recognizes the need for accountability processes to be defined based on national assessments , involving broad citizen participation , needs and aspirations . Nonetheless , any national process must still meet international standards . Sri Lankaapproach to accountability should , thus , be assessed against those standards and comparative experiences to discern how effectively it allows victims of the final stages of the war to realize their rights to truth , justice and reparations . <p> The Government has stated that it is seeking to balance reconciliation and accountability , with an emphasis on restorative justice . The assertion of a choice between restorative and retributive justice presents a false dichotomy . Both are required . Moreover , in the Panel 's view , the Government 's notion of restorative justice is flawed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Government policies and their failure to protect citizens from terrorism for genuine , victim-centred accountability focused on truth , justice and reparations . A further emphasis is clearly on the culpability of certain LTTE cadre ; the Government 's plan , in this regard , contemplates rehabilitation for the majority and lenient sentences for the " hardcore " among surviving LTTE cadre . The Government 's two-pronged notion of accountability , as explained to the Panel , focusing on the responsibility of past Governments and of the LTTE , does not envisage a serious examination of the Government 's decisions and conduct in prosecuting the final stages of the war or the aftermath , nor of the violations of law that may have occurred as a result . <p> The Panel has concluded that the Government 's notion of accountability is not in accordance with international standards . Unless the Government genuinely addresses the allegations of violations committed by both sides and places the rights and dignity of the victims of the conflict at the centre of its approach to accountability , its measures will fall dramatically short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Government has established the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as the cornerstone of its policy to address the past , from the ceasefire agreement in 2002 to the end of the conflict in May 2009 . The LLRC represents a potentially useful opportunity to begin a national dialogue on Sri Lanka 's conflict ; the need for such a dialogue is illustrated by the large numbers of people , particularly victims , who have come forward on their own initiative and brought to speak with the Commission . <p> Nonetheless , the LLRC fails to satisfy key international standards of independence and impartiality , as it is compromised by its composition and deep-seated conflicts of Interests of some of its members . The mandate of LLRC , as well as its work and methodology to date , are not tailored to investigating allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , or to examining the root causes of the decades-long ethnic conflict ; instead these focus strongly on the wide notion of political responsibility mentioned above , which forms part of the flawed and partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to date demonstrates that the LLRC has not conducted genuine truth-seeking about what happened in the final stages of the armed conflict , not sought to investigate systematically and impartially the allegations of serious violations on both sides of the war , not employed an approach that treats victims with full respect for their dignity and their suffering , and not provided the necessary protection for witnesses , even in circumstances of actual personal risk . <p> In sum , the LLRC is deeply flawed , does not meet International standards for an effective accountability mechanism and , therefore , does not and can not satisfy the joint commitment of the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General to an accountability process . <p> Other domestic mechanisms <p> The justice system should play a leading role in the pursuit of accountability , irrespective of functioning or outcomes of the LLRC . However , based on a review of the system 's past performance and current structure , the Panel has little confidence that it will serve justice in the present political environment . This is due more to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In particular , the independence of the Attorney-General has been weakened in recent past , as power has been more concentrated in the Presidency . Moreover , the continuing constitution of Emergency Regulations , combined with the Prevention of Terrorism Act in its present form , present a significant obstacle for the judicial system to be able to address official wrongdoing while upholding human rights guarantees . Equally , the Panel has seen no evidence that the military courts system has operated as an effective accountability mechanism in respect of the credible allegations it has identified or other crimes committed in the final stages of the war . <p> Other domestic institutions that could play a role in achieving accountability also demonstrate serious weaknesses . Over three decades , commissions of inquiry have been established to examine a number of serious human rights issues . While some have served important fact-finding goals , overwhelmingly these commissions have failed to result in comprehensive accountability for the violations identified . Many commissions have failed to produce a public report and recommendations have rarely been implemented . The Human Rights Commission of Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability , but the Panel still has serious reservations and believes that the Commission will need to demonstrate political will and resourcefulness in following up on cases of missing persons and in monitoring the welfare of detained persons . <p> Other obstacles to accountability <p> During the course of its work , the Panel observed that there were several other contemporary issues in Sri Lanka , which if left un-addressed , will deter efforts towards genuine accountability and may undermine prospects for durable peace in consequence . Most notably , these include : ( i ) triumphalism on the part of the Government , expressed through its discourse on having developed the means and will to defeat " terrorism " , thus ending Tamil aspirations for political , autonomy and recognition , and its denial regarding the human cost of its military strategy ; ( ii ) on-going exclusionary policies , which are particularly deleterious as political , social and economic exclusion exclusion based on ethnicity , perceived or real , have been at the heart of the conflict ( iii ) the continuation of wartime measures , including not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentioned above , but also the continued militiarisation of the former conflict zone and the use of paramilitary proxies , all of which perpetuate a climate of fear , intimidation and violence ; ( iv ) restrictions on the media , which are contrary to democratic governance and limit basic citizens ' rights ; and ( v ) the role of the Tamil Diaspora , which provided vital moral and material support to the LTTE over decades , and some of whom refuse to acknowledge the LTTE 's role in the humanitarian disaster in the Vanni , creating a further obstacle to accountability and sustainable peace . <p> An environment conducive to accountability , which would permit a candid appraisal of the broad patterns of the past , including the root causes of the long-running ethno-nationalist conflict , does not exist at present . It would require concrete steps towards building an open society in which human rights are respected , as well as a fundamental shift away from triumphalism and denial towards a genuine commitment to a political solution that recognizes Sri Lanka 's ethnic diversity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Tamils as the foundation for the country 's future . <p> International role in the protection of civilians <p> During the final stages of the war , the United Nations political organs and bodies failed to take actions that might have protected civilians . Moreover , although senior international officials advocated in public and in private with the Government that it protect civilians and stop the shelling of hospitals and United Nations or ICRC locations , in the Panel 's view , the public use of casualty figures would have strengthened the call for the protection of civilians while those events in the Vanni were unfolding . In addition , following the end of war , the Human Rights Council may have been acting on incomplete information when it passed its May 2009 resolution on Sri Lanka . <p> Recommendations <p> In this context , the Panel recommends the following measures , which it hopes as a whole , will serve as the framework for an ongoing and constructive engagement between the Secretary-General and the Government of Sri Lanka on accountability . They address the various dimensions of accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action by the Government of Sri Lanka , the United Nations and other parties . <p> Recommendation 1 : Investigations <p> A. In light of the allegations found credible by the Panel , the Government of Sri Lanka , in compliance with its international obligations and with a view to initiating an effective domestic accountability process , should immediately commence genuine investigations into these and other alleged violations of the international humanitarian and human rights law committed by both sides involved in the armed conflict . <p> B. The Secretary-General should immediately proceed to establish an independent international mechanism , whose mandate should include the following concurrent functions : <p> ( i ) Monitor and assess the extent to which the Government of Sri Lanka is carrying out an effective domestic accountability process , including genuine investigations of the alleged violations , and periodically advice the Secretary-General on its findings ; <p> ( ii ) Conduct investigations independently into the alleged violations , having regard to genuine and effective domestic investigations ; and <p> ( iii ) Collect and safeguard for appropriate future use information provided to it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , including the information gathered by the Panel and other bodies in the United Nations system . <p> Recommendation 2 : Other measures to advance accountability <p> A.

The Government of Sri Lanka should investigate and disclose the fate and location of persons reported to have been forcibly disappeared . In this regard , the Government of Sri Lanka should invite the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to visit Sri Lanka . <p> C. In light of the political situation in the country , the Government of Sri Lanka should undertake an immediate repeal of the Emergency regulations and modify all those provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act that the inconsistent with Sri Lanka 's international obligations , and take the following measures regarding suspected LTTE members and all other persons held under these and other provisions : <p> ( i ) Public the names of all of those currently detained , whatever the location of their detention , and notify them of the legal basis of their detention ; <p> ( ii ) Allow all detainees regular access to family members and to legal counsel ; <p> ( iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their detention in court ; <p> ( iv ) Charge those for whom there is sufficient evidence of serious crimes and release all others , allowing them to reintegrate into society without further hindrance . <p> D. The Government of Sri Lanka should end state violence and other practices that limit freedoms of movement , assembly and expression , or otherwise contribute to a climate of fear . <p> Recommendation 3 : Longer term accountability measures <p> While the current climate is not conductive to an honest examination of the past , in the longer term , as political spaces are allowed to open , the following measures are needed to move towards full accountability for actions taken during the war : <p> A. Taking into account , but distinct from the work of the LLRC , Sri Lanka should initiate a process , with strong civil society participation , to examine in a critical manner : the root causes of the conflict , including ethno-nationalist extremism on both sides ; the conduct of the war and patters of violations ; and the corresponding institutional responsibilities . <p> B. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement of its role in and responsibility for extensive civilian casualties in the final stages of the war . <p> C. The Government of Sri Lanka should institute a reparations programme , in accordance with international standards , for all victims of serious violations committed during the final stages of the war , with special attention to women , children and particularly vulnerable groups . <p> Recommendations 4 : United Nations <p> Considering the response of the United Nations to the plight of civilians in the Vanni during the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka and the aftermath : <p> A. The Human Rights Council should be invited to reconsider its May 2009 Special Session Resolution ( A/HRC/8-11/L. 1/Rev. 2 ) regarding Sri Lanka , in light of this report . <p> B. The Secretary-General should conduct a comprehensive review of actions by the United Nations system during the war in Sri Lanka and the aftermath , regarding the implementation of its humanitarian and protection mandates . <p> The Panel 's report and its advice to the Secretary-General , as encapsulated in these recommendations , are inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil society in Sri Lanka .

@@4199230 <h> Did Christianity exist in ancient Sri Lanka ? <p> By Rajitha Weerakoon <p> The discovery of a Nestorian cross engraved on a rock in Anuradhapura and another unearthed in Sigiriya some years ago led Prof. Senarath Paranavitana to speculate whether Kasyapa and any other Lankan kings were Christians and whether the crosses had been erected at Christian burial grounds . Deeper digging revealed Sri Lanka 's interlude with Nestorianism in early history which was due to the the country 's geographic location -- being at the crossroads of trade between the East and the West and also a bustling international centre of commerce attracting traders , navigators and explorers . Persian traders among them brought to Sri Lanka Christianity of the Nestorian sect . <p> Persian traders who arrived in the island had settled down along the west coast around Mantai ( present Mannar . ) Some had even advanced as far as Anuradhapura , the capital seat of ancient Sri Lanka . According to well-known voyager A.D. Cosmos , surnamed Indicopleusies , a community of Persian traders who were Christians had settled down in Sri Lanka by the 6th century . <p> Cosmos , a Greek trader from Egypt , who later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ' Topographia Christiana ' that Sri Lanka called " Sieldiba " by the Indians and " Taprobane " by the Greeks had a community of Christians who were chiefly resident Persians . They had a Christian church in the 6th century . " Even in Taprobane , an island in further India where the Indian sea is , there is a Church of Christians with clergy and a body of believers . They served the Christian Persian traders who had settled in the country and there was a Presbyter who was ordained in Persia with a Deacon and a complete ecclesiastical ritual . " <p> Even before Cosmos , the Persian biographer , Zadoe too documented that Persians adopted the Nestorian heresy towards the end of the 5th century . <p> These Persians who were devout Nestorian Christians even proceeded from Sri Lanka along the spice route taking the religion with them . History records that they were the first to take Christianity to China . What is Nestorianism as opposed to Christianity as we know of now ? According to the Encyclopaedia it is " a Christian sect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Constantinople for about four years from 428-431 AD . Nestorius maintained that there were two people in Jesus Christ and placed strong insistence on His human nature . He denied that Mary could be called the Mother of God since only the human nature was born of Her . " <p> The Nestorian doctrine , therefore , was condemned at the time as heretical . But due to the missionary zeal of its followers Nestorianism was carried far and wide to the East and the Near East and the followers were numerous especially in India and Persia . After being banished from the Roman Empire , the Nestorian Christians found asylum in the kingdom of Persia where they set up a mighty medical institute in the 7th century from where they spread their medical knowledge to India , Sri Lanka and China . Persian traders who had become followers of the faith brought the doctrine with them to Sri Lanka during their trade missions . Some of the traders proceeded further . <p> Emperor Tai-tsung of China whose empire extended up to the Caspian Sea received Nestorian missionaries from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , Nestorianism , however , gradually lost its clout with the establishment of the traditional Christian faith . It is documented that by the 16th century , large numbers of Nestorians joined the Roman Communion . Remnants , it is however said , are still found in the East . <p> In Sri Lanka , evidence is scarce of the presence of Nestorianism . Even if there was any , it is unlikely to be documented in any historical chronicle , especially the Mahavamsa . If there existed any Persian churches , these may have been destroyed along with other Nestorial missions in Asia after the 13th century . Or , they would have died a natural death . Although the Nestorian presence in Sri Lanka has been recorded by several foreign historians , Sri Lankan historians maintain that it had not spread among Sri Lankans . These may have been probably due to the fact that Buddhism gained ground .

Does agriculture have a significant contribution to make to the Sri Lankan economy now that its relative importance in GDP has declined ? The answer is indeed , yes . Agriculture has a very significant contribution to make to the country 's development despite the increased contribution of other sectors to GDP . Yet that role is somewhat different to what it was in the earlier stage of development when agriculture was the predominant economic activity . <p> Agriculture is no longer the dominant source of generating surpluses for economic growth . Industrial exports , access to international capital , savings of nationals working abroad , foreign aid and grants are other sources of generating investment capital . These sources would no doubt play an increasingly important role in the economic growth of Sri Lanka in the coming years . Yet , it would be a fundamental error if the significance of these sources for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slow rate of agricultural growth in the last two decades has been responsible for retarding the rate of economic growth . Had agriculture performed better , export earnings would have been higher , import needs less and inflationary pressures could have been more contained through lower food prices . <p> Export crops <p> Tea , the country 's main agricultural export fared badly since the mid sixties till the mid 1990s . Tea production that reached 225 million kilograms in 1968 declined since then till 1990 when it barely exceeded the 1963 production of 233 million kilograms . Since then there has been a trend of increasing production . Yet , in 2005 even the production of 317 million kilograms was only 40 per cent more than the production 40 years before . In the intervening period , especially between 1968 and 1990 , tea production was sluggish . Fortunately there have been gains in tea production in recent years with smallholder tea cultivation contributing significantly to increased production . Last year tea production reached 329 million kilograms . Yet productivity on tea estates is still low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential yields . <p> The performance in rubber was particularly disappointing . Rubber production declined since the late 1960s and early 1970s when it was around 273 million kilograms to an all-time low of 86 million kilograms in 2004 , which was only 32 per cent of what it was in 1970 . Production has increased since then to 104 million kilograms in 2006 that was still only 38 per cent of the production thirty years ago . With booming prices there has been a spurt in production . In 2010 the country produced 153 million kilograms of rubber . Yet this is only 56 per cent of the output in the 1970s . Rubber is now not only an export commodity but a significant input into industry with 70 per cent of rubber production being used in local industry . Therefore the decreased production of natural rubber has reduced export earnings as well as its use in domestic industries for manufactured exports . <p> Coconut production has not kept pace even with the increase in domestic consumption resulting in a lower exportable surplus on the one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 2010 coconut production of 2317 million nuts was nearly 20 per cent less than what it was in 1997-2000 . Production trends in minor export crops are also disappointing . Minor export crop production in 2000 was only 43 per cent of the production in 1963 . The increase in other crops has been only about 5 per cent in the last decade . <p> The exportable surplus of agricultural produce by and large displayed a declining trend owing to production declining over the years . This meant that agricultural export earnings did not continue to contribute significantly to foreign exchange earnings . In 2005 , agricultural export earnings contributed only 18.2 per cent of total export earnings . In 2010 they contributed 25 per cent mainly due to increased international prices . However , this figure is deceptive as industrial exports have high import content , unlike agricultural exports . Therefore the relative contribution of agricultural exports is higher than that suggested by this comparison . <p> The decline in agricultural export earnings implies the country lost possible gains in growth both directly and indirectly . Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have contributed to increased foreign exchange resources for investment and reduced the foreign exchange constraints to domestic investment . Conversely , increased production and exports of agriculture could contribute significantly to growth . This is especially so as the yields in tea and rubber are below the yields in most producing countries . Increases in yields of tea on estates , that currently have a much lower level than that of Kenya or India and smallholdings , could make a very useful contribution . Similarly , rubber yields are extremely low in comparison with countries like Malaysia and Indonesia . <p> Food crops <p> The performance in food crops has also been inadequate especially in the 1990s . Increased rice production contributed significantly to meeting the increased demands of food in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s , when population growth was high . Between 1950 and 1970 paddy production increased by over three-fold ( 352 per cent ) , thereby saving funds for the import of rice . In contrast , between 1981 and 2000 , paddy production increased by only about 32 per cent . However since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for rice is more or less met by domestic production thereby saving foreign exchange . In 2010 paddy production increased to 4301 thousand metric tons . This has been especially significant as international food prices have increased substantially in recent years . Wheat imports are related to paddy production , as the two commodities are close substitutes . Other food crops increased four fold between 1960 and 1980 . In contrast , between 1990 and 2000 subsidiary food crop production declined by 60 per cent . Had food crop production continued its earlier increasing trend , the import costs of the country would have been reduced significantly . In 2010 , food import costs were 12 per cent of total import expenditure . Rice imports were insignificant , but sugar , wheat , milk and other food imports were high . <p> Increase food production <p> It would be prudent for the country to increase food production to save foreign exchange expenditure . This is particularly so as current yields of paddy and other food crops are much lower than their potential yield levels .

Agricultural growth contributes significantly to alleviation of rural poverty , increasing incomes , increasing employment opportunities and household food security . Since about one third of households in Sri Lanka are rural and derive incomes directly or indirectly from agricultural activity , the level of agricultural production and the productivity of crops have an important bearing on economic conditions , especially the capacity of a sizeable proportion of households to access adequate food . Increases in agricultural production , especially an increase in agricultural productivity , would enhance incomes and improve the food security of rural and poor households . <p> Concluding reflections <p> The country should place a far greater emphasis on agriculture than it does today . Increased agricultural production can boost overall rates of economic growth ; it can increase access of the poor to food supplies and increase income and employment opportunities of rural producers . This is important inasmuch as the bulk of the rural population lives in the rural sector . Increased agricultural production means improved food availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directly farm households would have more income , especially the subsistence farm households . Indirectly farm households would have greater access to food through increased incomes . Urban households too would benefit because of the likelihood of lower food prices . A strategy to enhance agricultural production is an equity approach to economic development and addresses the problems of poverty . <p> While overall economic growth and diversification are important factors in reducing poverty and ensuring national food security , agricultural development has a vital role to play in ensuring food availability at household level . Sri Lanka must look to development of industry and services for siphoning off of surplus population from rural areas . Agriculture and rural incomes would benefit by such siphoning off of excess labour from rural areas . It is not a case of either industry or agriculture . What is needed is a balanced and forceful thrust in all sectors of the economy without neglecting agriculture . <p> The challenge facing the country is to revive and restore agriculture , increase production and reduce the gap between current yields and the realistic potential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework to support a more productive and commercialized agriculture .

Military hardware expenditure could be brought down and fresh recruitment of personnel should be minimal . <p> If the expenditure on defence can be brought down from about 4 per cent of GDP by even 1 per cent of GDP , then its burden on the public finances could be eased significantly . The defence expenditure to GDP ratio declined from 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2010 . However this decline in the ratio was due to the growth of the GDP and not as a result of a reduction in expenditure . In 2011 , defence spending was originally estimated at Rs.214 billion or 3.4 per cent of forecasted GDP for 2011 , but it was increased by Rs. 20 billion to build a new defence headquarters , taking the share up to about 3.7 per cent . Although the war is over , defence expenditure has increased from Rs. 190 billion in 2009 to Rs.234 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure owing to purchases of military hardware declining . <p> Losses in public enterprises <p> Public enterprises such as the Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) , Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC ) , Sri Lankan Airlines , Mihin Air and other state enterprises , are incurring huge losses and thereby increasing public expenditure . Without reforms of these public enterprises an important means of expenditure cuts would be unavailable . In the past the privatization of loss making enterprises , such as the estates , provided both relief to public expenditure as well as revenue from the privatization proceeds to offset the deficit . <p> This option is no longer available due to the government 's policy of not privatizing public enterprises . Conversely , the government has increased expenditure by purchasing shares of loss making enterprises . In this policy context , the government must take measures to reform public enterprises and reduce their losses . There is an inadequate thrust to restructure and reform loss making enterprises . In 2010 the government transferred Rs 12.4 billion to loss making enterprises . This was a decline from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would increase this year owing to heavier losses . While cutting this expenditure on losses of government enterprises is important to make a dent in the fiscal deficit , it should not expand public ownership to incur further losses , such as in Sri Lankan Airlines . Salaries <p> Other public expenditure such as salaries of public servants and pensions , subsidies such as for fertilizer and Samurdhi payments are not likely to be reduced . In fact the salaries bill may once again increase due to both salary increases and further recruitment . Increasing unemployment among the educated youth would probably result in another wave of public service recruitment . The government resisted both these in the Budget for 2011 due to fiscal stringency and the need to keep government expenditure down . How long it could hold out is left to be seen . <p> Unproductive expenditure <p> Although the government has been conscious of the need to restrain public expenditure , such as the increasing of salaries , there are continuing high expenditures on unproductive activities . The curtailment of wasteful expenditure is vital to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal management . Even in the case of economic infrastructure projects , there is doubt that these have been on a basis of economic priority and productivity . Infrastructure development that does not contribute to economic productivity should be reduced and even eliminated . <p> Increasing revenue <p> There has been an improvement in revenue collection . The increases in imports and trade activities have generated higher revenues . Revenue collection has increased due to the increase in imports by lowering tariffs . Although this has increased government revenue , it has worsened the trade balance . In fact the yawning gap between export earnings and import expenditure is a concern . Increasing government revenue is an important means of fiscal consolidation . Much is expected in this direction from tax reforms in the last budget . <p> The revenue to GDP ratio of 15 per cent is below levels of countries with Sri Lanka 's per capita income . Tax avoidance and tax evasion are important reasons for this shortfall in revenue . The expectation is that tax reforms would significantly reduce past fiscal slippages and increase revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax base and more effective tax collection are expected to achieve higher revenue collection that would reduce the fiscal deficit . Increasing revenue depends very much on the realistic nature of the tax reforms , the administrative capacity of the Department of Inland Revenue and the honesty of its officers . <p> Summary and conclusions <p> The road to the realization of a reduced fiscal deficit is not an easy one . However , containing the fiscal deficit is vital for stabilization of the economy and economic growth . Inflationary pressures generated by large fiscal deficits increase the cost of living and cause severe hardships , especially to the lower wage earners , pensioners and fixed income earners . This in turn leads to strikes with demands for higher wages and industrial unrest . Wage increases enhance the costs of production and reduce export competitiveness . The depreciation of the currency to restore export competitiveness would lead to further inflation and increased hardships to people . Large fiscal deficits lead to borrowing and in turn to huge debt servicing costs . The massive public debt and crippling debt servicing costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regrettably , there have been no signs of fiscal prudence . The government continues to spend on unnecessary and wasteful expenses . It requires a strong resolve on the part of the government to undertake reforms and to spend public money carefully . Reform of public institutions and reduction of wasteful government expenditure are as much needed as efforts to increase revenue .

@@4297236 <p> Sri Lanka has been witness to some odd sights , featuring Ricky Ponting , so far . No longer the centre of attention , Ponting was seen running out with drinks during the tour match in Colombo . After the teams had travelled down to Galle , he could be seen quietly reading a newspaper at the as the sun grew weary at the team 's beachside hotel . Worries about team performance and the wider issues of Australian cricket appeared the furthest things from his mind . <p> Handing over the responsibilities of captaincy has clearly agreed with Ponting , who is happily adjusted to the role of senior pro and top-order batsman . He speaks when spoken to , which means quite often in the case of his successor Michael Clarke , and also the young batsmen who are vying for a place at No. 6 - Usman Khawaja and Shaun Marsh . As the only member of the current team to have played Tests in Sri Lanka , seven in all , he has plenty of wisdom to pass on . <p> " What I 've been talking to the guys about is making sure they get the defensive part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , starting is always the hardest , " Ponting said . " But it tends to be even harder in these conditions when you 're facing a lot of spin bowling and there are a lot of guys around the bat . Your first 20 balls become the most critical here . <p> " As you can see you can have 250-run partnerships , then you can lose three or four wickets on top of each other as well , and that 's because it is difficult to start . That 's what I 've told the guys . At home we tend to practice a lot of big shots against spin because there 's not much in the wickets and you tend to use your feet a lot and run down the wickets . Whereas here , I think it 's the other way - you 've really got to work on your defensive side of batting and through the course of an innings , if you make a hundred , you might play four or six big shots for the innings . " <p> Ponting 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut of Rangana Herath , the most senior of the home side 's spin bowlers . Herath had played in a warm-up match against the tourists , and Ponting can remember the shock of receiving his first carom ball . Now that Muttiah Muralitharan has retired , Herath 's crafty variations will be critical to Sri Lanka 's attack . <p> " From memory , I reckon we might have played him in a tour game as well before those Tests ; that was where we first got to see this thing the carom ball , " Ponting said . " I must admit facing it for the first time I was like , ' what was that , where did that come from ' ? But over the years now , even in the Twenty20 game and the one-day game we have played against him , and the guys picked it up pretty well . But he 's a quality spinner - he played well in England for Sri Lanka and we 'd expect that he 'd be in their starting XI for the first Test . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bat for Ponting , who doubts he will spend much time at all in the slips even though his battered finger , fractured during the Ashes then nursed grimly through the World Cup , has improved visibly . Instead he is likely to be employed by Clarke as a predatory presence in front of the bat , either looking for run outs or bat-pad catches . <p> " I think the way it 's structured at the moment it 'll probably be Michael at second slip and Shane Watson at first , and over here we probably wo n't have three slips for too long anyway , " Ponting said . " I 'll probably end up at bad-pad , Michael will probably have me in there somewhere I reckon when the spinners are bowling . I 've always liked being involved in every ball basically . That 's the way I 've always approached fielding , if there 's one little chance floating around through the course of a day 's play , I want to make sure I have some impact on the game . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges the difference Clarke appears to be making in the role . The pair have different personalities , and Clarke 's buzzing demeanour so far seems nicely suited to a team that is younger and less sure of itself than the one Ponting took to Sri Lanka on his first tour as captain in 2004 . <p> " He 's started really well . We 're continuing on with a lot of the things that have worked for us over the years , " Ponting said . " But He 's putting his touches on some of those things and no doubt we 're doing things slightly differently , because different personalities will deal with things and handle things in different ways . But he 's been very proactive and the results are coming . To have the ODI series win here against a side that competed in the World Cup final was a really good start for him as the full-time Australian captain . <p> " We 're chatting a lot out in the field and even leading up to games on how players are going and tactics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of my stuff on him , but just waiting for questions to be asked . I think the whole structure we 've got around the group is working really well and I 'm just happy to be playing my little part in it all .

Taylor was a pretty good captain but the problem was that for at least half his career he really was n't one of the two best openers in the country and so should n't have been picked , but dropping a NSW captain was and probably still is close to impossible . <p> VinodGupte on August 30 , 2011 , 7:36 GMT <p> good luck , punter . you are among the best batsmen of all time . i hope you score big hundreds on this tour . i am an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runs as well . hope this tour is your turnaround story . <p> HEARTOUT on August 30 , 2011 , 6:13 GMT <p> Wel wel wel wel ....... this is a true picture of how cultural diffrence b/w east and west prevail ............. u would never seen Inzemam , Saachin and your heros to carry water bottles for your younger players ............. you are creating an impression that no matter what you do for your country you will remain an ordinary person and you need to anything to stay in the side ........... shame on cricket Australia ...................... PONTING ITS BETTER YOU SHOULD GET RETIREMENT BEFORE YOU DO SUCH JOBS .............. <p> anver777 on August 30 , 2011 , 5:43 GMT <p> Unlike before , these days Ponting is very much down to earth man ..... u can imagine that when u see this photo .... <p> PaddyRasta on August 30 , 2011 , 2:34 GMT <p> I truly admire Punter 's selfless professionalism , spirit for the game and wanting to be there to mentor young players . This appears to be lacking in other aging cricketers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would you ever have seen Gangully or Tendulkar carrying the drinks for their team ? I do n't think so ! Good on you Punter for showing everyone that you are a team man/mate . <p> ozgod1 on August 30 , 2011 , 1:54 GMT <p> What 's wrong with carrying the drinks . They probably did n't make him do it , he probably volunteered . He 's a team bloke and unlike some " seniors " in other teams he 's not too up himself to play the role of a waterboy . Sets a good example for the others in the side . <p> Reggaecricket on August 30 , 2011 , 1:07 GMT <p> Arguably one of the most disliked Cricketers at home and abroad since Douglas Jardine ! <p> Carrying the drinks out is no biggie , though . That 's an OZ for you ... a trait to be admired . <p> Ayo4Yayo on August 30 , 2011 , 0:24 GMT <p> LOL Very well suited for the man .

Do you think , seeing as he is the ex-captain and most senior &amp; experienced player in either side , that a journalist might actually want to ask him a question ? <p> PradeepR on August 29 , 2011 , 22:05 GMT <p> This is sad . The Australian team should show him more respect and spare him these kind of activities . He is a legend and should be treated as such . <p> landl47 on August 29 , 2011 , 21:37 GMT <p> Ponting is a great batsman and fielder and I salute him for his attitude in being prepared to do anything to help the side . He was n't even an average captain , in my view , but no-one could ever say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days as a player he enjoys the game a bit more than he seemed to at times when he was captain . @popcorn : I 'll say categorically that if Ponting is still in the side in 2013 , Australia will not regain the Ashes . Their side in 2013 will need to be better than the 2010/11 side and if Ponting is still good enough to make the team , it wo n't be . <p> on August 29 , 2011 , 21:15 GMT <p> enough respect Rick i hope some fellow senior players in the zim team will take lessons from veteran of more than 150 Tests . <p> Mcgrath-Dravid-Flintoff on August 29 , 2011 , 19:35 GMT <p> this is really himble of him but a guy like Ponting should not carry drinks . can you imagine a mafia boss cleaning toilets ? quite pitiful <p> 5wombats on August 29 , 2011 , 17:18 GMT <p> @popcorn ; OMG . You have used the words " humility " and Ponting in the same sentence . It 's very odd , but this article uses the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughable . With all these recent pronouncements from Ponting - it 's perfectly clear that he 's gagging to be the centre of attention . <p> on August 29 , 2011 , 16:43 GMT <p> Ricky- I must admit that I began to hate you a bit after the last series India played with you guys in Australia-but , your humility &amp; no-nonsense approach comes as a very pleasant surprise .. <p> My best wishes to you ; do well for yourself , and yet again show the world what you are capable of .. Bless you ! ! <p> KarMani on August 29 , 2011 , 16:05 GMT <p> All the best Punter . I may never have followed all of your matches nor been a big supporter of your attitude at times in the field but I definitely have a huge respect for your fighting spirit . If there was a crunch game - Punter would deliver ! ! ! I also got the Kahuna " RP " bat in your respect . Hope to see a few magical innings from you before you call time on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15:27 GMT <p> At last , at least , one non-Indian Legend agrees that it is n't easy to bat on these wickets and that these are not dead wickets but spin friendly wickets , needing a different skill set . Hats off to you Mr. Ponting for saying the obvious . How I wish the myth that these wickets are batting paradises never made circles . <p> on August 29 , 2011 , 14:42 GMT <p> OOhhhhhh ..... wht d helll hpn to Ponting ? ? ? ? ? ? ? He was a great Captain ...... not only a captain but also a talented batsman ...... Plz do n't ......... <p> WalkingTripod on August 29 , 2011 , 14:26 GMT <p> As a Pom I have a grudging respect for Ponting . Great batsman , consummate pro and clearly enough humility to withdraw back into the ranks without making a big fuss . However Popcorn , there are very good reasons why he is n't given as much credit as you think he deserves , and I 'm sure you well know those reasons . For the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst Warne , McGrath , Gilchrist , Hayden and Punter himself were in the team and they still would 've won all those matches . The clear concensus , even amongst Aussie ex-players and pundits is that Waugh , Taylor and Border were all better captains and most do n't think Ricky was much better than average . By all means declare your man-love for the fella ( I 'm sure I would be if he were English ) but do n't fling yourself overboard . <p> on August 29 , 2011 , 14:20 GMT <p> it is a part of game but respect senior player like ponting.ponting is the one of the best player in world no one is batter than him as a player as human being <p> tavitayya.mudda on August 29 , 2011 , 13:31 GMT <p> All the Best Ricky ! ! ! ! <p> I am sure you will rock like the way you did in 2004- 2008 .
