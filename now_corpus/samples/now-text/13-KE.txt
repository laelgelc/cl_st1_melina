@@1826232 <h> Wednesday , January 23 , 2013 <h> Alcoholism , a merry go round named denial <h> In Summary <p> Alcoholism is a family disease . As the alcoholic is busy drinking , the family and many significant others are affected by the consequences . Here , we would like to address everyone directly or indirectly involved in the life of a person who is suffering from the ' disease ' of alcoholism . By means of an imaginary play , we will demonstrate how people in the life of an alcoholic perpetuate the ' illness ' and consequently hamper recovery , and , at the end of it all , we will suggest steps the family and friends of the alcoholic can take towards a personal programme of recovery . A male or female alcoholic may appear in the starring role . Our writer , Machura Kamau , has chosen a male for this performance . Read on ... <p> Advertisement <p> By MACHURA KAMAU <p> Setting the stage <p> Dependent but acts otherwise <p> Alcoholism is a tragic three-act play in which there are at least four characters , the drinker and his family , friends , co-workers and even counsellors may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely appears in one person set apart from others ; it seldom continues in isolation from others . <p> One person drinks too much and gets drunk and others react to his drinking and its consequences . The drinker responds to this reaction and drinks again . This sets up a pattern of blame and denial , and eventually the downward spiral that characterises alcoholism . We must look not at the alcoholic alone , but view the ' illness ' as if we were sitting in the audience watching a play and observing carefully the roles of all the actors in the drama . <p> As the play opens , we see the alcoholic as the star of the First Act . He does all the acting while others react to what he does . A male between the ages of 30 and 55 , he is usually smart , skilful and often successful in his work , but his goal may be far above his ability . <p> We see that he is sensitive , lonely and tense . He is also immature in a way that produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent way in order to deny this fact . He also denies he is responsible for the results of his behaviour . From the dependency and denial comes the name of the play , A Merry-Go-Round Named Denial.For him to act in this way , others must make it possible . <p> The alcoholic has learnt that the use of alcohol makes him feel better . To him it is a blessing , not a curse ; his medicine , not a poison . For a few hours , it floats away his troubles ; it melts away his fears , reduces his tension , removes his loneliness and solves all his problems . <p> Act One <p> Drinking too much , too often is not a matter of choice , it is the first sign of alcoholism <p> The play opens with the alcoholic stating that no one can tell him what to do ; he tells them . This makes it very difficult for the family to talk about drinking and its results . <p> Even when the drinking is obviously causing serious problems , he simply will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one seems to hear what the others are saying . On both sides , people say one thing yet do another . <p> This is why it is necessary to see the play to understand alcoholism . To observe the alcoholic alone , to need a scientific description of the illness or to listen to the family 's tale of woe is only a small part of the drama . The key word in alcoholism is denial . Again and again people do what they say they will not , or deny what they have done . <p> Denial is refusing to see the reality of the disease , and can come in many forms -- minimising or belittling the drinking , blaming others except yourself , producing alibis or excuses , stone-walling or giving cunning answers to evade the extent of one 's drinking , among others . <p> Early in the First Act , the alcoholic needs a drink , so he takes one . He drinks hard and fast , not slow and easy . He may drink openly , but more likely he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of other actors in the play . <p> This is the first part of the denial , hiding the amount he drinks . But it proves to us that he knows he is drinking too much . He drinks more than others , more often than others , and above all , it means far more to him than to others . <p> Drinking too much , too often is not a matter of choice , it is the first sign of alcoholism . <p> Repeated denial , by hiding the bottle and drinking alone , reveals how important alcohol has become in helping the alcoholic feel better . After one or two drinks he can not stop , he has lost this ability . <p> After a few more , we see a profound change in the alcoholic . He reveals a sense of success , well-being and self-sufficiency . He 's on top of the world and may act as if he were a little god . Now he is right and everybody else is wrong . <p> There is no one way all alcoholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible ; they are not responsible . They are apt to ignore the rules of social conduct , sometimes even to a criminal degree , of which driving under the influence is a clear example . If a sober person acted this way , we would consider him insane . If drinking continues long enough , the alcoholic creates a crisis , gets into trouble , ends up in a mess . <p> This can happen in many ways , but the pattern is always the same ; he is a dependent who behaves as of he were independent , and drinking makes it easy to convince himself this is true . Yet the results of his drinking make him even more dependent upon others . <p> When his self-created crisis strikes , he waits for something to happen , ignores it , walks away from it or cries for someone to get him out of it . Alcohol , which at first gave him a sense of success and independence , has now stripped him of his mask and reveals him a helpless , dependent child . <p> Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is in a fix himself <p> In this act , the alcoholic does nothing but wait for and expect others to do it for him . Three others in the play act out their roles and the alcoholic benefits from what they do . He does little or nothing , everything is done for him in the Second Act . <p> The Enabler <p> The first person to appear is one we might call the Enabler , a ' helpful ' Mr Clean who may be impelled by his own anxiety and guilt to rescue his friend , the alcoholic , from his predicament . He wants to save the alcoholic from the immediate crisis and relieve him of the unbearable tension created by the situation . <p> In reality this person may be meeting a need of his own , rather than that of the alcoholic , although he does not realise this himself . The Enabler may be a male outside the family , perhaps a relative ; occasionally a woman plays the role . <p> It is also played by the so-called " helping professionals " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many have had little , if any , of scientific instruction on alcohol and alcoholism , which is essential in such specialised counselling . Lacking in knowledge , they handle the situation in the same manner as the non-professional Enabler . <p> This denies the alcoholic the process of learning by correcting his own mistakes and conditions him to believe that there will always be a protector who will come to his rescue , even though the Enabler insists they will never again rescue him . They always have and the alcoholic believes they always will . Such rescue operations can be just as compulsive as drinking . <p> Act Two : The Victim <p> Colleagues step in for the hung-over workmateThe Victim <p> This is the next character on stage . This may be the boss , the employer , the supervisor , a business partner or at times a fellow employee . The victim is the person who is responsible for getting the work done if the alcoholic is absent due to drinking or is half-on and half-off the job due to a hangover . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has worked in the company for a long time . The alcoholic has become completely dependent on this repeated protection and cover-up by the victim ; otherwise he would not continue drinking in this fashion . <p> He would be compelled to give up drinking or give up the job . It is the victim who enables the alcoholic to continue his irresponsible drinking without losing his job . <p> Act Two : The Provoker <p> The wife , caught in the game , makes the situation worse <p> The third character in this act is the key person in the play , the spouse or the parent of the alcoholic , the person with whom the alcoholic lives . This is usually the wife or the mother . She is a veteran at this role and has played it much longer than others in the Act . She is the Provoker . <p> She is hurt and upset by repeated drinking episodes , but she holds the family together despite all the trouble caused by drinking . In turn , she feeds back into the marriage her bitterness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of provocation . <p> She controls , she tries to force the changes she wants , she sacrifices , adjusts , never gives up , never gives in , but never forgets . The attitude of the alcoholic is that his failure should be acceptable , but she must never fail him ! <p> He acts with complete independence and insists he will do as he pleases and he expects her to do exactly what he tells her to do or not to do . She must be at home when he arrives , if he arrives . This character might also be called the Adjuster ; she is constantly adjusting to the crises and trouble caused by drinking . <p> The alcoholic blames her for everything that goes wrong with the home and the marriage . <p> She tries everything possible to make her marriage work to prove he is wrong . She is wife and housekeeper and may , in addition , feel compelled to earn part of the bread . <p> She attempts to be nurse , doctor and counsellor . She can not play these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without adding more guilt , bitterness , resentment or hostility to the situation which is already almost unbearable . Yet the customs of our society train and condition the wife to play this role . No matter what the alcoholic does , he ends up at ' home ' . This is where everybody goes when there is no other place to go . <p> Act Two is now played out in full . The alcoholic , in his helpless condition , has been rescued , put back on the job and restored as a member of the family . This clothes him in the costume of a responsible adult . As everything is done for him and not by him , his dependency is increased and he remains a child in an adult suit . The results , effects and problems caused by drinking have been removed by others . <p> They have cleaned up the entire mess made by the alcoholic . The painful results of the drinking are suffered by persons other than the drinker . This permits him to continue drinking as a way to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well aware of the truth he denies <p> Act Three begins in much the same manner as Act One , but something has been added by the first and second acts . The need to deny his dependence is now greater and must be expressed almost at once , and even more emphatically . The alcoholic denies he is an alcoholic , denies that alcohol is causing him trouble . He refuses to acknowledge that anyone helped him -- more denial . <p> He denies he may lose his job and insists that he is the best or most skilled person at his job . Above all , he denies he has caused his family any trouble . <p> In fact , he blames his family , especially the wife , for all the fuss , nagging and problems . He may insist that his wife is crazy , that she needs to see a psychiatrist as the illness and the conflict gets worse . The husband often accuses his wife of being unfaithful , of having affairs with other men , although he has no reason for these accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their drinking . The memory is too painful . The wife never forgets what the husband does . The husband may not remember what he did while intoxicated , but he never forgets what his wife tells him he did or tried to do . <p> The real problem is that the alcoholic is well aware of the truth he so strongly denies . He is aware of his drunkenness . He is aware of his failure . His guilt and remorse have become unbearable , he can not tolerate criticism or advice from others . Above all , the memory of his utter helplessness and failure at the end of the first Act is more than embarrassing . It is far too painful for a person who thinks and acts as if he were a little god in his own world . <p> In time , the family adjusts to their way of living together . The alcoholic may deny he will drink again and others in the play may vow never again to help him . The Enabler says he will never again come to his rescue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . The Provoker , whether wife or mother , tells the alcoholic they can not live together under these conditions . <p> What is said is completely different from what everyone has done and will do again . The Enabler , Victim and Provoker have said this before but did not carry it out . The result is that the alcoholic 's sense of guilt and failure is increased , he is challenged in every aspect and all this adds to his heavy burden of tension and loneliness . His mental pain is made unbearable , especially by the changed attitudes and actions of the other members of the cast . There can be only one sure way for him to relieve his pain , overcome his guilt and sense of failure , and recover a sense of worth and value . <p> However , if Act Two is played out as described , it is inescapable that in Act Three the alcoholic will drink again . This is his one sure means of relieving all pain , solving all problems and a sense of well-being . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the knowledge of what will happen if he drinks . Also , always in the back of his mind is the hope that this time he can control it and reap the great benefits he once did from drinking . So the alcoholic begins to drink again . <p> What happens when those associated with the alcoholic determine to create a change in the alcoholic 's life ? <p> Recovery <p> Advice is good , but also fatal if given wrongly <p> Recovery begins in Act II <p> A planned recovery from alcoholism must begin with the person in the second Act . They must learn how people affect each other in this illness and learn the most difficult part -- that of acting in an entirely different fashion . <p> New roles can be learned only by turning to others who understand the play and putting into practice their insights and knowledge . If Act Two is rewritten and replayed , there is every reason to believe the alcoholic will recover . He is locked in by his illness , others hold the key to the lock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of solving his problems , but if we unlock the door , he will be free to come out . If the alcoholic is rescued from every crisis , if the boss allows himself to be a victim again and again , if the wife acts as the provoker , there is not one chance in ten that the alcoholic will recover . <p> He is virtually helpless , he himself can not break the lock . He may recover if the other actors in the play learn how to break his dependency on them by refusing to give in to it . The alcoholic can not keep the merry-go-round going unless the others ride it with him and help him keep it going . <p> It is not true that an alcoholic can not be helped unless he wants help . It is true that there is almost no chance that the alcoholic will stop drinking as long as other people remove all the painful consequences for him . <p> The Enablers and the Victims must seek information , insight , and understanding if they plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become active in a counselling and therapy programme if she is to make a basic change in her life . <p> The Enablers <p> The Enabler is a person who feels he must not let the alcoholic suffer the consequences of his drinking when he can easily prevent this by a simple rescue operation . To him it is like saving a drowning man . But this rescue mission conveys to the alcoholic what the rescuer really thinks : You can not make it without my help . The Enabler thus reveals a lack of faith in the alcoholic 's ability to take care of himself , which is a form of judgment and condemnation . <p> The role of the professional Enabler -- clergyman , doctor , lawyer or social worker -- can be most destructive if it conditions the family to reduce the crisis rather than use it to initiate a recovery programme . When the family turns to professionals to deal with alcoholism before the anti-social behaviour has become obvious , the family may be told that this is not alcoholism and that there is nothing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alcoholic turns to such people who help in the reduction of his crisis , this again keeps the merry-go-round going . <p> The family , which was told initially that there was no signs of alcoholism , is taught that the only way to deal with it is to remove the symptoms , rather than to deal realistically with the illness . <p> Initiating Recovery <p> If a friend is called upon for help , this should be used as an opportunity to lead the alcoholic and the family into a planned programme of recovery . Specific help is available in rehabilitation centres like Jorgs and Asumbi Treatment Centres , among others . <p> The alcoholic learns how to stitch back the values he has violated through drinking and how to build on his self-esteem . The alcoholic further learns that alcohol damages the mind , alters the attitude and changes his behaviour . The first step towards healing is accepting that one has a drinking problem and working on breaking the denial walls . @ @ @ @ @ @

Some people may argue that it is not a physical commodity but many still insist that it has both merit and appeal . The fact that most people appreciate music is evidence of its value .

The mobile phone music provider gives them free scratch cards which they can use to sell their music . In such cases , the artist is free to keep 100% of the profit from the cards . On the other hand , corporate music selling deals made through Mdundo only gives them 30% of the sales . Exclusive deals with Mdundo can earn the artist up to 50% of sales . <p> Local Musicians versus United States Artistes <p> According to a Music Salary Guide from the Berklee College of Music , Vocal Artists should not earn anything less than KES 13,000 per gig .

" <p> He explains that water from Cameroon 's Chari River -- which , fed by its tributary , the Logone , provides over 90 percent of Lake Chad 's water -- is being diverted to irrigation projects in the surrounding area . <p> Meanwhile , dams built along the Jama'are and Hadejia Rivers in northeastern Nigeria are " partly responsible for the shrinkage " , he says . <p> LCBC 's Abdullahi adds that population pressure is also stretching the lake to breaking point . <p> " Forty years ago , the population within the Lake Chad area was about 17 million .

My question is , does this problem occur in all diesel cars from the UK such as the Audi A6 or Audi A8 , and what is your take on Chevrolet Captiva , Nissan Qashqai , or KIA Sportage ( all 2006 models ) in relation to local diesel ? What other problems should one be aware of when purchasing them . <p> I want a comfortable off-road vehicle with maintenance , fuel cost , and resale value in mind . <p> Peter Kimani . <p> The issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects any diesel engine fitted with a DPF and complying with Euro III emissions standards and above . <p> The Chevy Captiva is a fresh alternative to the usual Japanese and Korean diet of crossover utilities . I especially like the 3.0L petrol version , though the 2.2L diesel is not too shabby either . <p> South Africa gets both models , so I am sure the diesel version will not present too many problems . <p> If it does , then just get rid of the DPF ( at extra cost ) . And it has that American face so you can lie to yourself that you are driving a Suburban , like Tony Soprano . <p> I am not a particularly big fan of the Nissan Qashqai because ; <p> 1 . I do not like the way it looks . <p> 2 . It is underpowered -- at least the versions offered in our showrooms seem that way , and , <p> 3 . It does not know what it is . Well , what is it ? Why would I bypass an X-Trail to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car is , I do not want to imagine the diesel equivalent . <p> KIA : If you followed my explanation on DPF , I said Hyundai will NOT bring their diesel engines over here . <p> KIA is an extension of Hyundai ( in Korea at least ) owing to mergers and takeovers and whatever other financial manoeuvres are involved that result in things like Renault-Nissan and DaimlerChrysler and whatnot . So the Hyundai thing applies here also -- just get a petrol if you really want something from the land of Internet addicts . <p> When purchasing ex-UK cars watch out for rust , mostly because they salt the roads in winter to prevent them from icing over . Thus , check the undercarriage , suspension , brakes , and steering components for signs of rust . <p> Hi Baraza , <p> I recently survived a near-fatal accident on Thika Road after ramming an unmanned , broken-down lorry with no lifesaver sign . My car was subsequently written off . <p> I want to buy a C180 Mercedes but do not know the difference between the Japanese and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentioned that it has a supercharger . I want a 1800cc car that is not turbocharged . <p> Kindly let me know what a supercharger in this car means and which make -- Japanese or UK -- is best for Kenyan roads . <p> Regards , Musa . <p> First off , my deepest sympathies concerning your near-fatal accident . It is good that you are still with us . <p> The major differences between Japanese and UK Mercedes ' would be spec levels , which , in a word , is the amount of kit and equipment available to the customer . <p> The Kompressor Benz is supercharged , not turbocharged , so buying one will not go against your desires . Just out of curiosity : Why do n't you want a car with a turbo ? <p> A supercharger is a forced-induction device used to pump more air into the engine than normal , just like a turbocharger . <p> The difference is that a turbocharger uses the momentum of exhaust gasses to run while a supercharger is driven by a belt which is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence it saps some of the power that it is creating . <p> The ideal Benz for Kenyan roads is the one sold by DT Dobie , but between UK and Japan .... get an ex-UK . The British model may have clocks running on miles instead of kilometres ( the conversion factor is 1.06093 kilometres to the mile ) , but the Japanese car will have things labelled in Japanese , which will be difficult to fathom . <p> Now , a quick question . I noticed that the Toyota Mark X 2005 2.5L quite easily reaches the indicated top speed of 180Km/hr , yet still feels like it can do more . What happens when it reaches 180Km/hr ? Does it stop accelerating automatically , cut fuel , or is the speedometer just cosmetic beyond that ? <p> Thanks in advance , <p> Koome . <p> There is fuel cut-off at 180 Km/h for all JDM ( Japanese Domestic Market ) cars because of a gentleman 's agreement among those manufacturers . A good number of those cars will top 200 easily but they have been limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed governor which can be removed ( the governor in this case is a code in the ECU software , rather than a physical device , like in Kenyan PSVs ) . <p> So , in a way , the numbers beyond 180 ( if they are there , which I find unlikely for JDM cars ) are both cosmetic -- in that the car will not exceed 180 straight from the shop , and not cosmetic -- if your car is powerful enough and you get rid of the speed limiter . <p> Your description is a bit vague , but I will try and see if I can help . <p> There is a tool on autobazaar.co.ke that I use to calculate import costs of a motor vehicle . The required fields are vehicle make , model , YOM ( year of manufacture ) , and cost . <p> I typed in Toyota -- Pass -- 2008 -- $3,300 . There is also a field for typing in the current exchange rate between the dollar and the Kenyan shilling . For that conversion , I used a Sh84.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cost of Vehicle : Sh279,510 KRA Taxes : Sh373,377 <p> Total Cost : Sh652,886 <p> Note : Values are exclusive of freight and clearing costs . <p> Hi Baraza , <p> Thanks for your weekly advice . I own a Toyota AE91 with a carburettor engine that is in good shape but with the current fuel prices , I am thinking of going for an EFI engine.My worry is ; <p> 1 . Is this convenient or should I sell it and buy a new car ? <p> 2 . Can a VVT-i engine fit on my car ? <p> Regards , Arnold . <p> 1 . If the swap is in the name of saving fuel then the venture is not worth it . How much more fuel does your carburettor-equipped car burn compared to an equivalent one with EFI ( electronic fuel injection ) ? Get an approximate figure . <p> Now compare this figure with the cost of getting a new EFI-equipped engine , an ECU ( engine control unit ) , a wiring harness , plus the cost and fuss over installing all this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of dilemma concerning buying-selling/replacing a car in the name of saving money . Using the figure above ( difference in fuel costs ) , compare with the extra cost of the new car -- buying price of new car minus what you get after selling the old one . How do these numbers stack up ? There are indirect benefits to getting a newer vehicle , one being that it will last much longer than the current one . <p> You may have to get a new vehicle if the carburettor in your current one is causing sleepless nights . <p> 2 . There are many VVT-i engines . The one in the Harrier will obviously not fit , but I believe the one in the NZE could ( 1300-1500cc ) . <p> Hi Baraza , <p> I have a year 2000 Platz . Sometimes after driving the car , stopping , and switching off the engine , if I touch the car body -- with my fingers or my skin -- as I exit , I feel a needle-like pricking or mild electric shock . The car runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing it . What is the cause and does it have a negative effect on the car ? <p> Thanks , <p> Your suspicions are right : what you are experiencing is a mild electric shock . This electricity is not from your car 's electrical system , so do not start pulling wires looking for a short circuit , a naked wire , or flux leakage in a coil or point ; it is something called static electricity . <p> This is best demonstrated in the following ways : <p> 1 . Rub a plastic ruler or pass a plastic comb through your hair several times , then place it about a centimetre from a piece of paper . Watch the plastic " attract " the paper like a magnet2 . In a dark room , take off your sweater really fast . You may ( or may not ) notice tiny " sparks " . <p> Both are examples of the effects of static electricity . Lightning ( from the sky ) is also caused by static electricity ( but the magnitude of the charge is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity on the car body is caused by the vehicle " brushing " against the air , much like the ruler or comb in the first example . <p> This causes positively charged particles to line themselves up along the body . By touching the body , you are grounding ( also called earthing ) this charge by acting as the earth ( electrically neutral receptacle ) or a conduit for the charge to reach the Earth ( planet ) . <p> This is also why people get struck by lightning . The unfortunate fellows act as conductors for the massive positive charge in the clouds to reach the Earth . <p> Here is an interesting fact : it is generally assumed that the Earth is electrically neutral , hence the use of terms like " earth " or " ground " to describe an electrically neutral destination for charged particles , but in reality the Earth itself has a massive negative charge that can not be calculated . <p> If you are struck by lightning , it is because you are covered in a negative charge induced by contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds can not help but be attracted to you . <p> The static electricity present on motor vehicle bodies is the reason you see ( mostly fuel ) trucks having chains dangling off the body -- typically on the bumpers or off the frame chassis . <p> These metallic chains act as conduits for the static electricity to be grounded safely . If not , this will happen : <p> 1 . The passengers may get " zapped " the way you were as they exit the vehicle . Sometimes the electrical charge accumulates to levels high enough to cause discomfort ( but not injury or fatality ) . <p> 2 . If the above happens , there is usually a small spark that is the electrical charge jumping from the vehicle body to your own body . Imagine the vehicle in question is a fuel truck . On a hot day . It is surrounded by fuel fumes . Then you have a spark . Somebody say " BOOM ! ! " . <p> Dear Baraza , I have two questions for you : <p> 1 . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highlighting its strengths and weaknesses as compared to two or three similar vehicles ? <p> 2 . What would be the benefits of modifying the exhaust system of a 2005 Subaru Legacy GT Spec B Wagon to include larger-bore tail pipes other than enhancing the aesthetics or increasing noise production levels ? Would adding a dump valve do anything for the power output ? <p> Regards , <p> Eric . <p> 1 . I was supposed to drive a Nissan Skyline in the past two weeks , but the arrangement fell through , an occurrence that has been repeating itself with alarming frequency in recent times ... If ( not when ) , I eventually drive a Skyline , then for sure the review will be there . <p> 2 . Larger-bore tail pipes are mostly aesthetic . And for noise . For performance-enhancing changes , you need to increase the diameter of the entire length , starting from the down pipe through to the tail pipe , while removing the catalytic converter in the process ( or replacing it with a high-flow cat , which is very costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have money , you can replace the headers too . <p> The dump valve does not affect power output . It just increases turbo life by reducing wear and minimising risk of damage by compressor surge . <p> I would like your opinion on which is the better between a Toyota Landcruiser VX ( petrol 4.7L and diesel 4.2L engines ) and Nissan Patrol ( 4.2L Turbo Diesel and 4.7L Petrol engines ) I would like a car I can use for work , travelling and off road cruises . <p> Which one is suited to the Africa 's rugged terrains ? How do these cars compare on the following grounds : Power , speed , comfort , stability , off road use and ease of maintenance ( not prices but accessibility to spare parts etc ) <p> Thank you . <p> Regards , <p> Aryan <p> Apparently there is a new Nissan Patrol out , but I have only seen one on the road . One . And that was on the road , I do n't even know if DT Dobie has them in stock . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . <p> Power : The best is the petrol-powered Landcruiser VX 4.7L at 314hp , mostly because it has clever VVT-i and it is turbocharged . The 4.5L turbo-diesel is not half bad either . <p> The Nissan Patrol 's best is the 4.8L GRX with 28Lhp ( no match for the VX , though the current model uses 5.6L engines which I doubt we will get , until smaller engines are available ) . <p> Speed : See above . The VX petrol rules . The Nissan Patrol does struggle a bit with its weight , low power , lack of forced induction and breeze-block aerodynamics <p> Comfort : Ahem ... VX , again . It is stable , smooth and well optimized . The Patrol is floaty and wobbly and bouncy , like a ship in a less-than-calm seaStability : see comfort above . That roly-poly chassis of the Patrol can be treacherous if you try to keep up with a VX when the going gets gnarly . <p> Off-road use : Would you believe it , but these vehicles are evenly matched . Some say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhat true ( the underpowered engines were the weak link in an otherwise perfect setup ) but take it from me : these two vehicles will keep going long after any competition has fallen by the wayside . <p> If the going gets extreme enough to split these two on ability , I am yet to meet the driver skilled enough to get to that point . This one is a tie . <p> Ease of maintenance : There is a reason why the car in front is always a Toyota , and that is because spares are everywhere . Drive a Toyota and you should NEVER ever worry about spares availability . <p> I expect to hear from you about how life with your new VX is ; because the VX is what you will buy .... I think . <p> Hello Baraza , <p> I have a Premio which has served me perfectly for almost five years now . Recently I have noticed oil like stuff in one of the plug holes and my mechanic advised that the seal valves were leaking hence needs repair . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car , my worry nonetheless is that opening up the engine to fix the problem may even create bigger trouble like loss of compression in the engine . So question is ; <p> 1 . How much more would I ignore the leakage ? <p> 2 . Would the Process of fixing it compromise the entire performance of the engine ? <p> 3 . Would you recommend such a move ? <p> Kind regards , <p> Impressed reader . <p> 1 . No more . Repair immediately . Never ignore an engine problem hoping it will " go away " : it wo n't . More so problems involving oil or leakages . You are headed for huge oil bills and a misfiring engine when the plug electrodes get coated with oil and ca n't provide a spark <p> 2 . No it will not if the job is done properly . Repairs are supposed to optimise performance for an otherwise ailing engine .

@@1849236 <h> Syria and a possible UN approach to chemical weapons <p> The UN would likely play a key role in verifying and overseeing an effort to put Syria 's weapons under international control . But the UN Security Council can only work if the two remaining superpowers put their backs into it . <p> Events surrounding Syria and chemical weapons have moved quickly in the last few days . As the United States appeared to be moving to a possible military action against the Assad government , an opportunity opened for a peaceful resolution . Perhaps as a result of prior discussions between Presidents Obama and Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary of State Kerry , Russia proposed that Syria put its chemical weapons under international control ( for eventual destruction ) to foreclose any military action . Syria quickly agreed . Then on September 10 , Syria 's foreign minister admitted that the country had chemical weapons by agreeing to reveal their location , to stop producing them , to open its sites to UN inspection and to join the Chemical Weapons Convention . Until then , the Syrian government had refused to admit it had such weapons . <p> Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in an hour-long TV interview in English . Taped before the Russian proposal became public , Assad denied his government used the chemical weapons on August 21 , asserted that the war was being prolonged by outside interference including outside fighters he said were Al Qaeda and stated his openness to a political settlement between Syrians . He also warned of possible repercussions -- in the region and for the US -- to an attack on Syria . Throughout he appeared calm and measured . This , plus the new Russian proposal , took the air out of President Obama 's efforts to gain Congressional approval of US military action . Indeed , it seemed already clear that approval by both houses of the US Congress was unlikely . President Obama addressed the American people on the evening of the 10th and made his case for the moral and practical necessity of sending Syria ( and the world ) a message that the use of chemical weapons was unacceptable . But he also bowed to reality by asking Congress to postpone any vote while the possibility of a diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their findings . He added that the option of military force remained and that any agreement on disposing of Syria 's chemical weapons would have to be verifiable . <p> The UN would likely play a key role in verifying and overseeing an effort to put Syria 's weapons under international control . The Russian proposal envisioned a limited role for the UN Security Council in the form of a statement by its president . The US , UK and France want more robust UNSC action in the form of a resolution -- under Chapter VII of the UN Charter -- authorizing the use of force if Syria does not comply in a timely manner . France reportedly drafted a version of such a resolution that would demand Syria " declare locations , amount and types of all items related to its chemical warfare program " and order it to " unconditionally destruct , remove or render harmless , under international supervision ... all chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents ... manufacturing facilities and ... all means capable of delivering chemical weapons . " It also would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court and affirm the possibility of further actions under Chapter VII " in the event of non-compliance . " <p> Russia has made clear it will not accept a Chapter VII resolution and that the approach to peacefully dispose of Syria 's chemical weapons can only work if the threat of military action is taken off the table . The US , UK and France want something beyond a UNSC presidential statement . An acceptable compromise would seem to be a Security Council resolution under Chapter VI which allows for the peaceful resolutions of disputes with the consent of all parties . As Syria seems to be consenting , this should be acceptable to Moscow . As it would be binding under international law and authorize the UN role , it should be acceptable to Washington . Kerry and Lavrov will meet on September 12 and perhaps they might agree on such a compromise .

President Putin probably did not make his offer to help President Obama . He may have wanted to break the cycle of bad news about his heavy-handedness at home by showing himself to be a peacemaker .

@@1856232 <p> The roots of Fytolab originated in the seventies within the union branch Gewasbescherming ( plant protection ) of Gent University . The focus on protection means residue analysis started an independent private laboratory on 1 July 2000 . Carine de Clercq , general manager of Fytolab , tells about the developments of the last few years . <p> " From the fruit and vegetable sector the demand came for a laboratory to analyse the residue of protection means . Therefore , we came to be the stimulus of the sector . About 60% of our samples are fruit and vegetables and in addition we also serve other large groups . Many orders in fruit and vegetables we handle are for Belgian auction houses . Belgium is known for its pre-harvest control system of leafy vegetables . This is a pre-harvest control at the grower , therefore before harvesting . In this way he knows whether to start harvesting after receipt of the result . At the end of the nineties from Germany came the complaint that the Belgian lettuce contained too many residues . Therefore the auction house devised and started this system . This preventative system has finally become law in Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of Belgian lettuce goes to Germany . " <p> Technology " An important development during the last years is definitely the technology . When we started as Fytolab we had small methods with 10 or 20 protection means and these we analysed up to 0.5 or 0.1 ppm ( parts per million ) . To-day we have extensive methods , multi-residue methods , in which many hundreds of means are contained and the boundary often goes to 0.01 ppm . The technology has made it possible to research more and more and deeper . This last category is most important because of the lower environment tax and toxicity . " <p> What is the profit to the client ? " It is a fact that we can measure lower all the time . 0.01 ppm may be compared to a crossbar of 40 cm on the circumference of the globe . We look for and find that we can already do quite a lot at the moment and that will be developed further . Nevertheless we have to ask ourselves , whether it is sensible to go further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with laboratories , which say we measure everything at 0.001 ppm . This is really exaggerated , because it does not help the client . Who benefits from this and are we still busy with food safety and good agrarian practice ? With this I therefore wish to limit ourselves as laboratories to 0.01 ppm . This with the exception of the lower specific legal requirements of for instance baby food . As a laboratory we are part of ring testing and we check our quality and performance amongst each other . We analyse then up to 0.01 ppm and only 50% of the laboratories are successful . The conclusion is then : should we not all be measuring up to 0.01 ppm , well before there are people who claim that they can go a lot lower . " To distinguishFytolab has distinguished itself because of operational excellence . Reliability in all departments is central in this : reliable in results , speed and reliable support . Quality only becomes noticeable to clients in the long run . Speed is an important factor . When we started analysing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pre-harvest controls were already quicker . That took two days . Now we even have a speed-service of 8 hours . In addition we still have an important stream of patterns , which are dealt with between 24 and 36 hours . Very often there are emergencies in the 8 hour service . Therefore these samples are dealt with in a separate system . The importance of speed increases in the fruit and vegetable sector . More and more companies work with positive release . This means that one waits for the results of the analysis before a product is marketed or processed . It is essential that everything is done with the same quality and reliability . No harm should ever be done to either of these . Speedy service is also important for import products and perishable goods such as strawberries . " <p> Residue checks pesticides " In addition to analysis of protection means Fytolab also handles more controls of mycotoxins . These are toxins produced by certain fungi and are often found in coffee , meat and grain . Therefore the fruit and vegetable sector is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already since its start noticed a positive trend in connection with residues , namely the percentages have clearly decreased . Few problems are apparent with West European products . European studies show that most excesses come from import products from outside Europe . In Europe there is the MRL-legislation , which shows the limit for good agrarian practice . The legislation and the application of the good agrarian practice and the controls on these are still missing in many countries . Fytolab has two laboratories abroad , namely in Bulgaria and in Colombia . And this allows us to see how things go in countries like these . " <p> Carine mentions that their field as a laboratory gets bigger all the time . " Every year something new appears . At the start of this year we had the nicotine crisis with the mushrooms and this summer the perchlorate matter with vegetables . But residue analysis takes place in a riper market all the time . " Of course products have to be controlled , but if we want to grow we must also direct ourselves towards other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody knows where a product comes from . Therefore a wide scope finding means whichever are allowed , are required at he other side of the world . In order to assist our clients fully we will start next year with a completely new method : the high resolution LCMS . This method supports exporters as well , who are involved in other legislation outside Europe . " <p> Consolidation " Residue analysis will still remain important for a long period . Consumers still regard protection means residues as high risk . Nevertheless it is clear that the ' laboratory market is consolidating . Laboratories either are taken over or merge . It is a challenge not to be dragged along by the general pressure on price , because with many the result is that the quality deteriorates . Reliability and quality remain central with us . Also being international is an important pillar . In France and the Netherlands we are already rather active , but we will still strengthen this in the future . We will also in addition to Bulgaria and Colombia open other branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Today it is a challenge for a laboratory to be quick and to retain the quality . All this at a cost efficient price . Our mission is to strengthen the activities of our clients and for our clients it is important that our name and good reputation do not stop at the borders . The quality is to be at the same level in all Fytolab laboratories and today I can guarantee this " Carine de Clercq concludes .
