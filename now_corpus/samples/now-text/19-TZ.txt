This is despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of youth are graduating every year with the numbers stacking . <p> With this reality , the Kenyan government is planning to buy 64 buses from South Africa to use in the Bus Rapid Transport System ( BRTS ) in the country whose transport system is chaotic . <p> The importation from South Africa comes just months after Isuzu East Africa launched two high-capacity buses with a speed limit of 60kph and passenger capacity of between 62 and 100 . <p> Isuzu said that the buses were locally assembled specifically for Kenya 's BRT system . <p> In response to the Transport secretary James Macharia statement last week over the importation of the buses , the Kenya Association of Manufacturers ( KAM ) says that the government has erred in procuring the buses from outside the country yet the vehicle manufacturers have the capability and capacity meet the government 's demand . <p> In a statement , KAM said manufacturing , as a key pillar in the big four agenda for the country means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent provision of jobs to citizens can not be understated . <p> " In our endeavour to grow the sector at 35 per cent per year to achieve the desired 15 per cent GDP contribution by 2022 , the Buy Kenya Build Kenya Strategyshould be rigorous and should prevail for both the short and medium term , " said the statement adding , " This is especially so for products that can easily be manufactured within the country . " <p> KAM says that as the largest procurement entity in the country , the government , where possible , ought to direct its spending on locally manufactured goods with a view of supporting the big four agenda . <p> " Currently , the manufacturing sector 's contribution to the GDP is 8.3 per cent , with a registered growth of 0.2 per cent growth in 2017 . Favouring imports over local content , as seen in the recent importation of 64 Bus Rapid Transport ( BRT ) buses , bypassing our local bus assemblers and bodybuilders , goes against the agenda to boost the sector 's ability to provide employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic goals . " <p> The Association states that the Local Vehicle Assemblers have a production capacity of 34,000 units per annum , which makes them capable of producing the required number of high occupancy buses for the project . <p> " It is also worth noting that engaging local assemblers to deliver these buses means a shorter lead-time for delivery when compared with those being imported . Additionally , locally assembled buses have been tested and proven in the Kenyan market , where they are known for their durability and low maintenance cost . Local engineers have the knowledge to design and engineer these buses for local operating conditions . " <p> Subsequently , a well-established aftersales network for parts , maintenance , service and repairs for local buses already exists to ensure the success of the BRT system . <p> " We also need to consider that many apprentices locally will be trained under this project in order to sustain an up-to-date , functional system . " <p> The local bus Complete Knock Down ( CKD ) kits attract 0 per cent import duty and excise duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than imported buses-which would attract 25 per cent import duty and 30 per cent excise duty . <p> KAM says that at the moment , Kenya is a twin deficit economy . <p> " This means it has both fiscal and current account deficits . A current account deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports . Clearly , importation of the BRT vehicles risks exacerbating the current account deficit which has been worsening over the years , as well as , stifling government 's efforts to industrialize under the big four agenda . " <p> It adds , ' If we are to realize the desired goals in the big four agenda , it has to be demonstrated through commitment to the 40 per cent local content procurement regulation , especially in critical infrastructural projects and decisions . " <p> By so doing , KAM says this will , in turn , encourage further investments in the sector by both local and foreign investors , increasing government revenue and more importantly offering productive jobs . <p> Macharia said last week that the government plans to buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fabricators " failed to meet the required specifications " . <p> In November last year , the EU committed a Kshs5 billion grant towards the Sh9.6 billion BRTS which will have five corridors including the Mama Lucy Hospital-Donholm to the CBD , Limuru-Kangemi-CBD-Imara Daima -- Athi River to Kitengela road , Rongai , Bomas-CBD-Ruiru-Thika- Kenol-Murang'a , the Ridgeways-Kiambu road-Balozi-Imara Daima and Tala-Njiru-Dandora -- CBD-Ngong road . <p> Macharia said they are yet to establish the total amount of money to be spent on the buses estimating that each would cost Kshs25 million bringing the total cost of the 64 units to about Sh1.6 billion . <p> The Exchange is a financial journal published by Mediapix Limited , a public relations , news and communications organization with its African headquarters in Tanzania and sister operations in Canada , the United States and The United Arab Emirates .

@@60409235 <p> Both his parents were killed months earlier in one of post-independence Africa 's worst instances of bloodshed , the Liberian civil war . <p> Johnson spent the following 27 years searching for a safe place to settle and trying to leave the ghosts of the conflict behind . One day - at the beginning of October - he arrived in Niger , having survived a week-long , forced trip through the Algerian desert <p> " We 've been gathered in buses , travelling from town to town without food , obliged to walk for 30km in the Sahara with a gun to our heads , and packed like animals in a truck until we reached Agadez , " he recalled . <p> The convoy carried a total of 279 people , rounded up in police operations all over Algeria . <p> Johnson 's forced trip was one among dozens of mass expulsions of migrants organised by Algerian authorities in 2018 , attracting international criticism over the country 's treatment of sub-Saharan citizens , often abandoned in the desert , hours away from the closest border post in Niger . <p> ' Terrible year ' <p> " 2018 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by the biggest number of arrests and deportations ever , " human rights activist Fouad Hassam told Al Jazeera . <p> A member of the Algerian League to Defend Human Rights , Hassam assisted some migrant workers in the city of Oran , his hometown in north-west Algeria , and has received threats for his work . <p> " Civil society actors and NGOs have been attacked for defending migrants , " he said over the phone . <p> " But this is only a part of the collective paranoia that rules our country : activists , bloggers , journalists , unionists or artists are seen as a menace , and migrants as well . " <p> One of the first expulsions of migrants , he explains , was triggered by a fight between some sub-Saharan workers and locals in the suburbs of Algiers two years ago . Security forces arrested 1500 sub-Saharans , deporting hundreds to the border with Niger . <p> " From that moment on , things only got worse : your skin colour was a crime , " Hassam said . " No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deported anytime , only for being black . " <p> Johnson says he experienced that persecution firsthand . <p> " I knew that Algeria was unsafe , " he recounts , " but after endless travels , I could finally work as a daily labourer in construction sites , earning something to fulfil my dream , which is to reach France . " <p> ' Journey through hell ' <p> In the years preceding , Johnson lived in Mauritania , the Ivory Coast and Sudan , where he tried unsuccessfully to cross the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia . He headed to Algeria after a dramatic passage through Libya , where he was detained and tortured by armed men . <p> " In Algeria , I had to hide , but at least there was some work , " he says . His European dream was interrupted abruptly one night in Algiers . <p> " On our way back from work , the police took all the blacks to a barracks . They did n't check our documents and the next morning , they threw us in a bus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten hard . " <p> Johnson says it was a journey through hell . He and his companions were insulted and beaten at every stop . " They told us it was a punishment for being in the country , and that we never have to come back " , he said . <p> During one of the stops of his convoy , he says a Liberian woman " was raped in turn by three agents inside a police facility and forced to dance naked in front of them " . One man " died of internal bleeding , after being kicked all over his body " . <p> " We buried him with our own hands in the desert , " he says , his voice trembling as he recalls those moments . <p> George Oldman Harris , another Liberian who made the same journey a few weeks before him , shakes his head as Johnson speaks . <p> " I know very well what it is like , " he said . " Algerians deported me five times since I entered the country in 2013 . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a common purpose : making some money in order to avoid going back to Liberia " empty-handed " . <p> Like hundreds of other refoules ( ' the rejected ones ' in French ) , as they 're called in Niger , they pass their days walking in the city 's busy market squares looking for opportunities and a place to lay their heads . <p> Rights groups slam ' racial profiling ' <p> Transit centres offered by the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) are packed with people demanding to return to their home countries through the UN agency 's voluntary return programmes . <p> " As push-backs continue , we 're submerged by requests , but we ca n't open a new centre overnight , " an IOM official told Al Jazeera . <p> " These summary expulsions are justified by referring to a 2014 agreement between Algeria and Niger , but in reality , we are facing enormous violations of international norms and human rights , " Amnesty International researcher Debora Del Pistoia said . <p> According to a note sent to Al Jazeera by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document was a " declaration of intent " and not a formal pact . Its aim , the note says , was to restrict cases for push-backs to Niger of Nigeriens who were forced into begging in Algerian cities <p> " But among the deportees , there are refugees and asylum seekers registered in Algeria and people from all over West Africa , who were detained and deported illegally , " says Del Pistoia . <p> Amnesty International 's campaign , " Forced to leave " , launched on December 20 , calls on Algerian authorities and their partners to immediately stop these practices and avoid any form of racial profiling . <p> Asked for a comment by Al Jazeera , the Algerian interior ministry did n't respond . <p> During a conference on global migration earlier this month in Morocco , Minister of the Interior Noureddine Bedoui said Algeria respects the rights and dignity of migrants but had been through " a huge and continuous arrival of migrants and had to take measures to reduce it " . <p> According to Del Pistoia , statements by top Algerian officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 that migrants were " a source of criminality , drug and other plagues " contributes to " a climate of xenophobia , where black migrants become the scapegoat for Algeria 's internal problems " . <p> Data collected by Amnesty International shows a sharp increase in collective expulsions from Algeria to Niger : from 1,340 people in 2014 , 9,300 in 2017 to 26,000 in 2018 - 40 percent of whom were abandoned in the Sahara and forced to walk for hours to reach Assamaka , Niger 's first border post . <p> Among people expelled to Niger in 2018 , UNHCR counted 77 who were registered as refugees in Algeria , and as such , should be granted special protection . <p> Moreover , at least 3,100 people were expelled to Mali through the year and abandoned in desert areas controlled by armed groups <p> In Niamey 's Wadata square , around the Grand Marche or in the alleys of the crowded Katako market , deported migrants , carrying all their belongings in backpacks , are a common sight . <p> " You 'll see many with mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Johnson , who is hoping to make some money from the city 's construction boom in view of the 2019 African Union summit . <p> Going home seems then to be the only option left , with a hope that " George Weah , our new president , will respect his promises and bring Liberia out of the war 's heritage " .

@@60409240 <h> Alcohol consumption : Why non-communicable diseases are increasing <p> AS the government struggles to control non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) , health experts have warned the public to desist from things that could cause such diseases including excessive alcohol consumption . <p> effects of too much alcohol drinking <p> They said NCDs have become the most silent killer diseases in recent years , especially with the surge of alcohol consumption in the country . <p> Alcohol is sold from bars to shops and groceries where younger children are exposed to drinking behaviour . <p> Chairman of the Tanzania Public Health Association ( TPHA ) Dr Mashombo Mkamba said alcohol consumption can lead to stomach cancer among numerous other diseases . <p> He said it can also lead to mouth cancer , pharyngeal ( upper throat ) cancer , oesophageal ( food pipe ) cancer , laryngeal ( voice box ) cancer , breast cancer , bowel and liver cancer , among many diseases . <p> " The problem starts from the mouth and goes to aesophagus that blocks the food path , which finally affects the stomach , " he said . <p> The expert said at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , about 89 per cent , consume local brews which are harmful to their bodies and can lead to cardiovascular diseases as well . <p> He named other diseases associated with alcohol consumption as diabetes , saying its consumption tends to increase body weight that disturbs the body mass index ( BMI ) . <p> " An increase in BMI is also a risk to the body because the amount of insulin that will be produced will not be sufficient to supply sugar in all parts of the body in order to provide energy to the body . As a result sugar will come out through urine and cause a person to lose energy and start to shrink , " he said . <p> He said high blood pressure will automatically lead to other illnesses including stroke and kidney failure and cardiovascular disease . <p> According to the expert , alcohol consumption is very dangerous to the human body because it is the cause of most unforeseen diseases that kill someone slowly for some years . <p> " A person with a drinking behaviour will come to realise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while it is already too late for commencement of treatment , " he said . <p> He also pointed out that liver cirrhosis disease is also a result of alcohol consumption because it occurs when one drinks heavily for a long time and the body starts to replace the liver 's health tissue with scar tissue . <p> The expert said the government incurs huge costs in treating a patient with alcohol problems when it comes to surgery of the kidney , dialysis and transplant , as well as heart surgery , whose costs could be used to fund other development activities . <p> Impact of alcohol on unborn babies <p> He said when a pregnant mother develops an alcohol drinking behaviour , she will automatically affect her baby because the drink will go to the child through the umbilical code that transports nutrients from the mother to the baby . <p> The expert said when a mother starts to drink when she is three-months pregnant , the baby will be affected in terms of its growth , brain , thinking capacity , body joints and other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . <p> " Even worse , babies born with the defects of alcohol live miserable life with no capacity to perform well academically as well as engaging in any socio-economic activities , " he pointed out . <p> According to him , diseases associated with alcohol do not appear at once when the baby is born , but they live with them for their entire life . <p> " Local brews which lack quality certification and are consumed by the majority of people in rural areas are the most dangerous because one can not measure their alcoholic content , " he said . <p> Deaths related to alcohol <p> Reports by the Tanzania Network Against Alcohol Abuse ( TAAnet ) show that deaths related to alcohol consumption were far more than those caused by Tuberculosis , HIV/AIDS and diabetes combined . <p> A World Health Organization ( WHO ) report released last year shows that low-income countries including Tanzania suffer from a huge burden of diseases caused by alcohol consumption compared to developed countries . <p> The report added that daily consumption of alcohol at 33 grammes is equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer in general , saying alcohol consumption causes more than 200 diseases . <p> Apart from health-related problems , alcohol also has a lot of social-economic problems to individuals and the society in general . <p> The network further insists that alcohol use has brought a lot of negative impact to the people , especially youths , calling for responsible institutions and the government to take effective measures to arrest the trend . <p> The WHO proposes that in order to control the impacts caused by alcohol consumption , there is a need for capacity building and imparting of scientific skills among policymakers . <p> " As stakeholders , we will be happy to see policymakers work to find solutions to the problem by coming up with alternative methods and skills that will address poor alcohol drinking behavior , " TAAnet said . <p> Tanzania is among countries that do not have a policy or guidelines on alcohol consumption , unlike neighbouring countries such as Zambia , Kenya , Malawi which have such guidelines in place . <p> TAAnet recommends the authorities to revisit the law and come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with putting a warning on bottles showing the risks associated with the use of alcohol with a view to reducing the consumption rate . <p> " We believe that if there will be a strong policy to control the harmful use of alcohol , men will be responsible and stop excessive drinking behavior that at last causes gender violence . Instead they will focus on development activities in their society and nation at large . <p> " Reduction in excessive use of alcohol will facilitate the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) on health that include reproductive and child health , communicable and non-communicable diseases , mental problem and toxic injuries , " it said . <p> President John Magufuli witnesses exchange of sales of maize agreement between National Food Reserve Agency acting Chief Executive Officer Vumilia Zikankuba and World Food Programme Resident Representative Michael Duncan at State House in Dar es Salaam yesterday .

Both Vanuatu and Dominica have suffered through multiple and consecutive climate-fueled extreme events in the past years . <p> In the space of a few hours after making landfall at 9 pm on September 18 , 2017 , Hurricane Maria caused destruction costing $1.4 billion , or 226 percent of Dominica 's GDP .

Grants and loans were made available . But even so , only a fraction of the loss and damage suffered was addressed . <p> But despite this new awareness and action around climate change loss and damage , and despite the global climate conferences and heartfelt generosity , humanity continues to avoid the key issue : Those who gain from the activities that created climate change are not the ones directly suffering its consequences . <p> This simple statement lies at the heart of the problem we now face , and unless we respond to this , we can not embrace a better direction of travel . The solution lies not in science , nor institutions , but in the most straightforward interplay of morality , economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables of the equation have failed . Climate change is not a freak of nature . It is human-made , as human-made as power and greed . If the consequences of climate change were felt disproportionately by those who have contributed to it , it would have stopped long ago . These are the facts . <p> Most countries accept the ' polluter pays ' principle - those who pollute should pay the cost of that pollution . It is a golden nexus of morality , economics , and environmental policy . Presently , however , it is the battered and suffering in the paths of hurricanes and cyclones - not the polluter - who pay . <p> Take the insurance model championed by many industrialised countries and agencies . Island states on the front line are being asked to take on additional insurance against the future losses and damage of a climate change caused by others . Surely our main response to human-made climate change can not be to try and make it easier for those on the receiving end to pay for the damage ? <p> Imagine if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those who were hit by other people , and those that did the hitting paid nothing . Right now the communities paying for climate change are mostly the poor , who live in the world 's most precarious places . This is untenable , indefensible and reprehensible . We need a different approach than the traditional insurance model . <p> We call upon countries and the international institutions to establish a meaningful loss and damage funding facility paid into by those who have contributed to climate change , with payouts that go quickly to those who suffer the direct consequences of climate disasters . <p> The idea of taxing the fossil fuel industry is an economically sensible approach , and a moral approach . This industry has spent decades fueling climate denial while making profits . In 2017 alone the top six oil companies made $134 billion in profit . A climate damages tax should be established forthwith . <p> We will only stop climate change by making those who contribute to it pay for it . More talk , more conferences , more insurance where the victims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . <p> We need to end the mismatch between those who gain and those who lose . This is what an international community serious about halting climate change must do . <p> From the countries on the front line , whose very existence is threatened , from the vanguard of those protecting our common Earth , we urge you to do this . And we hope your feet are swift . Other legal options for addressing loss and damage are not off the table if multilateral international approaches to continue to fail us .

Climate change threatens the enjoyment of a wide range of rights including those to water , food , health , culture , development , a healthy environment , and life itself . <p> And it exacerbates gender inequality and other forms of discrimination . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report published this October warns that if we fail to urgently and massively scale up climate action , the 1.5 ?

It is now in our hands to reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions . In 2015 countries have already committed , through the Paris Agreement , to pursue all efforts to keep global warming below 1.5 ? C above pre-industrial levels , and to implement action to tackle climate change in a way that respects and promotes human rights . <p> Now , at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) , governments must complete a critical task : finalising a set of guidelines to deliver on the Paris Agreement promises .

By doing so , these countries would prevent smallholder food producers from cultivating their land , severely threatening their ability to produce food , access water and maintain their livelihoods . It is unacceptable for governments to continue to nurture a vicious circle of poverty and human rights violations : they must gain the courage to take bold action . <p> Future generations deserve better . Climate action must embrace solutions based on fully realising human rights , among others , by ensuring meaningful public participation throughout the design , implementation , and evaluation of climate policies . It is critical to respond adequately to people 's needs and ensure the broadest public support for climate action . <p> We should not have to choose between tackling climate change and fighting poverty : the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development makes it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin and must be achieved in unison . <p> For example , experience shows that indigenous peoples whose rights over their ancestral lands are recognised by public authorities can play a better role in safeguarding the forests and protecting the carbon stored in them .

It is an urgent call to action to consider human rights in the light of climate change . By making this commitment on December 10 , 1948 , governments made a promise to humanity . Now is the moment to give it a new meaning . <p> In the same vein , Mami Mizutori writes " It 's the economic loss , stupid ! " <p> I would never actually say that to anyone - I am far too reserved .

The most expensive in this category is the hospital , school or public utility that fails in a storm or a flood . <p> Second , good economic data can drive planning at the national and local level to ensure that strategies for reducing disaster risk are inclusive of climate change adaptation and provide clear guidance on how to avoid creating new risk.Good accounting of your disaster losses is part of good governance . Efforts to eradicate poverty at national and local level will only succeed if the poor and vulnerable are protected from future losses . <p> Economic losses are key to measuring the success or failure of the overall 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including the Sustainable Development Goals , the Paris Agreement and the global plan for reducing disaster losses , the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction . <p> What is not measured , quickly becomes invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , can not be acted on or remedied . <p> Mami Mizutori is the Secretary-General 's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and the head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction . <p> TanManagement Group CEO Mohammed Jaffer ( left ) and the CEO of Jubilee Insurance , Dipankar Achariya , shake hands after signing the MoU for the launch of the first ever voucher based micro-insurance platform in Africa .

" Immediately after I got divorced , I and my two daughters were denied everything -- from basic needs to shelter , " she said . <p> As the 50-year-old Angelista now recalls that day , it brings back nostalgic memories of discrimination and hopelessness . " My life took a turn for the worst . I was n't prepared . Was being a woman a curse ? I thought . One of the precious possessions that I lost was my piece of land . I used to work hard day in and night at the farm . It was my livelihood , " she recalls . By tradition in their rural Tanzanian community , women did not inherit the land they farmed , no matter the improvements they made to the land , and no matter the number of years they had laboured on the plot . Generally , only a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a majority of whom are women , rarely have access to formal or legal ownership to land due to the complicated traditional beliefs , attitudes and perceptions that dictate land ownership , deeming it a preserve of male members of the society . <p> As a result , women are placed in a position of considerable insecurity with regards to their land rights . <p> But then Angelista knew that she did n't have to be weak , for her daughters need their mother . She had to set an example and needed to show them that women are n't inferior and that they deserve and can do as much as men . " I did not want my daughters to feel any less than what they already saw in a patriarchal society we live in , " Angelista tells Woman Magazine . <p> Angelista 's misery became her strength and not her weakness . " I did not lose hope . It was time for me to prove to my village that women can own land . I did manual and petty jobs for quite some years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . I made sure my farm 's title was shared with my two daughters name on it , " she says . <p> Angelista did n't stop there . 15 years down the lane , today she not only owns a farm but also built two houses . " I bought motorbike to help me with my farming activities and later bought a welding machine to support my niece who was struggling , " Angelista tells . <p> Angelista is currently one of the leaders in the village government , and the elders in the village have voted her to represent the village 's community in even higher positions . " I encourage other women who pass through a similar journey like mine , not to give up , because nothing is impossible , it takes only commitment and determination to succeed in life , " says Angelista . <p> Angelista is a classic case of many Tanzanian women who are denied the right of possessing land and resources for economic activities . Although women formally have the legal right to own land under the 1999 Village Land Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to USAID , in 2015 , only 20 per cent of women possessed land in their own names in Tanzania . <p> The customary practices often require women to access land through their fathers , brothers , husbands or other men who control the land . <p> This makes women vulnerable and decreases agricultural productivity . When women lose their connection to this male relative , either through death , divorce or migration , they can lose their land , home and means of supporting themselves and their children . <p> Traditional cultural attitudes , bureaucratic mismanagement , corporate corruption , and lack of sufficient rural education pose obstacles to women 's ability to own land or defend their ownership to competing interests . <p> The women in Tanzania have until now had tenuous rights to the land they rely on to feed their families . Though Tanzania 's Land Act and Village Land Act ( both passed in 1999 ) provide for women 's ownership of land , customary practices regarding marriage and inheritance continue to discriminate heavily against women . <p> The current constitution upholds equal rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the law or custom take precedent when there is a conflict . And such a conflict exists in communities across the nation , undermining women 's rights . <p> According to the research titled ' The role of women in Agriculture ' shows that women in Africa , including Tanzania , undertake almost half of the agricultural labour , without legal control over the land they farm and the proceeds of their labour , women have neither the incentive , security , nor opportunity to improve their harvests . <p> Ms Mary Makondo , the Commissioner of Lands from the Ministry of Lands , Housing and Human Settlements Development reiterated the government 's commitment to empower and support Tanzanian women to own land . <p> " The government in collaboration with other land stakeholders is committed to survey and demarcate all the land by 2024 , " said Ms Makondo . <p> She made the remarks when she addressed participants during a meeting convened by Care International Organisation in partnership with other Civil Society Organisations ( CSOs ) held in Dodoma earlier this month to mark this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meeting focused on the importance of joining voices between CSOs , local women in communities , and other stakeholders to address challenges facing women in their daily lives especially domestic violence and lack of their voices in important decision-making processes . <p> Women 's land rights were among the agendas discussed at this year 's IWD celebrations which locally took place in Mashujaa grounds in Dodoma Region . <p> Ms Makondo further said the government recently had embarked on the Land Tenure Support Programme ( LTSP ) implemented in Kilombero , Ulanga and Malinyi districts in Morogoro Region . <p> Referring to the positive impacts of the programme , Ms Makondo further revealed that at least 40 per cent of the surveyed and demarcated land in the districts was owned by women . <p> Ms Makondo further said the issuance of land title deeds has enabled the majority of the women in the districts to have access to sufficient loans from financial institutions and Banks to run their economic activities including agriculture . <p> Tanzania 's Land , Housing and Human Settlements Development minister William Lukuvi last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 to 1 per cent in a fresh bid to make it easy for the majority Tanzanians to secure the important documents . <p> He said the move was aimed at enabling more Tanzanians to easily secure title deeds .

" <p> Ms Ndaro further called upon the activists in the country to continue attending capacity building training to gain skills that will really help them to engage in global movements more precisely aimed at empowering the women . <p> Ms Glory Maro , one of the participants who attended the meeting representing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism said , " Women 's right to own land is essential for her and her community regarding the fact that land is a source of income .

Investing in corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) is increasingly becoming important as it contributes to sustainable development by delivering economic , social and environmental benefits for all . <p> However , CSR stakeholders in Tanzania have raised concerns over the need for players in the extractives industry ( mining , oil and natural gas ) to focus more on providing education to the communities around them . This is in addition to providing them with the ' usual ' CSR benefits in the forms of charitable donations and funding utilities , healthcare , formal education -- and more . <p> Stakeholders are concerned that a majority of the population -- particularly women -- lack fundamental education to qualify them for top leadership positions especially in the private sector , notably in the extractives sector . <p> " Extractives companies need to go to secondary schools to present their projects and concerns about environmental problems . And , while at it , they should identify young schoolgirls who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become good future prospects for the companies , " said Mr Michelle Baldini , the director the European Business Group in Tanzania . <p> " The initiative will help to generate more female managers to work in the companies , which need to start this process a bit earlier -- at the secondary school level , for example -- instead of waiting for girls to apply for jobs after they graduate from Universities . " <p> Mr Baldini said this during the 8th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Forum on the participation of women in the extractive industries value-chain . <p> Held in Dar es Salaam recently , the gathering brought together representatives from the government and the private sector , including especially Civil Society Organisations ( CSOs ) . <p> The Forum was organized by HakiRasilimali in partnership with the Canadian High Commission in Tanzania , the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation ( TPSF ) , and Policy Forum . <p> Speaking at the event , the director of Investment Promotion at the Tanzania Investment Centre ( TIC ) , Mr John Mnali , reassured stakeholders of the government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extractives sector . <p> Mr Baldini also called upon the extractives companies to foster special talents in Tanzanian schools who show interest in sectoral activities . <p> " For instance , Total Company might want to hire people to work in its Marketing Department .

The general idea is that if , for instance , children start a Geological Education and Training course at an early stage , they develop more interest in those particular studies . <p> According to Ms Enie -- who is the geologist by profession -- there are less than 400 registered geologists in Tanzania , very , very few of whom are women . <p> " This is not good for a highly mineralized country like Tanzania , " she lamented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country for " effectively engaging in the CSR activities ... " <p> She cited Acacia Mining 's educational and health projects around its Shinyanga mines as having a positive impact in its CSR efforts . <p> The Union Parliament passed three laws on July 3-4 , 2017 that made significant changes to Tanzania 's legal and institutional frameworks governing oil , gas and mineral extraction . <p> The extractives industries are also required to produce annual CSR plans jointly agreed with the relative local government authority . <p> Noting that the 2017 Mining Act requires licensed mining companies to pay 0.07 per cent of their gross revenues as CSR to local councils in their areas of operations . <p> Before the new legislation became operational , some medium and big miners in the country had the discretion to decide on CSR issues . <p> Today , local government authorities are also statutorily required to prepare guidelines for CSR within their jurisdictions , as well as oversee their implementation , and educate the general public on CSR projects in their respective areas . <p> Section 27 of the Amended Act also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSR obligations . <p> Addressing the 8th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Forum , the Canadian High Commissioner in Tanzania , Her Excellency Pamela O'Donnell , said " CSR is about behaving responsibly in all aspects of business , from minimizing environmental impact to good labour practices .

" <p> She also reiterated the Canadian government 's commitment to promoting responsible business practices , and encouraged Canadian companies working in foreign lands to respect human rights and all applicable laws . <p> The Government of Canada understands that responsible corporate behaviour by Canadian companies active abroad not only enhances their chances for business success ; they can also contribute to broad-based economic benefits for the countries in which they are active -- and also for Canada , the High Commissioner reaffirmed . <p> " Gender equality , empowerment of women and girls -- and the realization of their human rights -- are core Canadian values central to Canada 's foreign and domestic priorities .

A 2015 global study found that $12 trillion could be added to the global GDP by 2025 by advancing women 's equality . <p> Delivering her remarks at the Forum , Ms Nathalie Garon -- First Secretary and Team Leader for Sustainable Economic Growth Project at the Canadian High Commission in Dar es Salaam -- said " The development of SMEs is vital for improving participation of women in private sector value chains . <p> Capacity-building to enable women to obtain the necessary skills so as to thrive is equally important . In that regard , Canada extends support to Tanzania through the Improving Skills Training for Employment Programme ( ISTEP ) . <p> Referring to the positive impacts of the project , Ms Garon revealed that the project aims at helping technical and vocational training institutions to deliver skills training that would enable students to find or create employment in the Tourism and Extractives sectors of the Economy . <p> " The ( ISTEP ) project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as mining and heavy machinery operating . I , therefore , would encourage our private sector partners to connect with our development partners to implement these projects , as I see lots of common objectives and potential for partnerships , " she said . <p> The extractives industry remains a male-dominated sub-sector of the Mining sector , compared to some other industries in Africa . It is , therefore , important to involve more women in it if only because women do have the same ' right to development ' as men . <p> So , if the industry diminishes women 's access to economic and social development , this human right for them is violated .

In the past twenty one years , the day has been met with both enthusiasm and resistance around the globe from governments , public health organizations , smokers , growers , and the tobacco industry . <p> In 1987 , the WHO 's World Health Assembly passed a resolution for 7 April 1988 to be a world no-smoking day .

The WHO 's WNTD materials present an alternate understanding of the " facts " as seen from a global public health perspective . WNTD publicity materials provide an " official " interpretation of the most up-to-date tobacco-related research and statistics and provide a common ground from which to formulate anti-tobacco arguments around the world .

The memo includes a warning about the upcoming day , a document that explains the arguments they anticipate the WHO making , and an explanation of how the company should respond to these claims . For example , in response to the anticipated argument that their advertisements target children , the company 's response includes arguments that claim their advertisements are targeted towards adults by using adult models , and that advertisements lack the power to influence what people will actually purchase .

Small quantities were smoked at a time , using a pipe like the midwakh or kiseru or smoking newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah ( see thu ? c l ? o for a modern continuance of this practice ) . Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop ; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin . <p> The alleged benefits of tobacco also account for its considerable success . The astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island , explains that the plant " openeth all the pores and passages of the body " so that the natives ' " bodies are notably preserved in health , and know not many grievous diseases , wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted . " <p> Tobacco smoking , chewing , and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700 . <p> Tobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century . Cuban cigars are world-famous . <p> In the late 19th century , cigarettes became popular . James Bonsack created a machine that automated cigarette production . This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the late-20th century . <p> Contemporary <p> Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century , tobacco became condemned as a health hazard , and eventually became encompassed as a cause for cancer , as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases . In the United States , this led to the Tobacco Master Settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products . <p> In the 1970s , Brown &amp; Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1 . This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine , nearly doubling its content from 3.2-3.5 pc to 6.5 pc . In the 1990s , this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to use this strain as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes . <p> In 2003 , in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries , the World Health Organizationsuccessfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control . The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco . This led to the development of tobacco cessation products . <p> Most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine , a powerful neurotoxin to insects . However , tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others . Unlike many other Solanaceae species , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans and other animals . <p> Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids ( varying between species ) to deter most herbivores , a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed . Nonetheless , tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes . For example , although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest , tobacco 's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival . As a result , some tobacco plants ( chiefly N. glauca ) have become established as invasive weeds in some places . <p> Types <p> Aromatic fire-cured is cured by smoke from open fires . In the United States , it is grown in northern middle Tennessee , central Kentucky , and Virginia . Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee is used in some chewing tobaccos , moist snuff , some cigarettes , and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends . Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia , which is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum . The leaves are cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs in Cyprus and Syria . <p> Brightleaf tobacco is commonly known as " Virginia tobacco " , often regardless of the state where it is planted . Prior to the American Civil War , most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf . Sometime after the War of 1812 , demand for a milder , lighter , more aromatic tobacco arose . Ohio , Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant . Farmers discovered that Bright leaf tobacco needs thin , starved soil , and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco . Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers , and developed quite a taste for it . At the end of the war , the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop . <p> Burley tobacco is an air-cured tobacco used primarily for cigarette production . In the U.S. , burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April . <p> Cavendish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting tobacco than a type . The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco . Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type , but is usually one of , or a blend of Kentucky , Virginia , and burley , and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars . <p> Dokha is a tobacco originally grown in Iran , mixed with leaves , bark , and herbs for smoking in a midwakh . <p> Turkish tobacco is a sun-cured , highly aromatic , small-leafed variety ( Nicotiana tabacum ) grown in Turkey , Greece , Bulgaria , and North Macedonia . Originally grown in regions historically part of the Ottoman Empire , it is also known as " oriental " . Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco ; today , its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco ( a typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia , burley , and Turkish ) . <p> Perique was developed in 1824 through the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chenet . Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos , it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos , but is too strong to be smoked pure . At one time , the freshly moist Perique was also chewed , but none is now sold for this purpose . It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice , strength , and coolness to the blend . <p> Shade tobacco is cultivated in Connecticut and Massachusetts . Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes , and began cultivating the plant commercially , though the Puritans referred to it as the " evil weed " . The Connecticut shade industry has weathered some major catastrophes , including a devastating hailstorm in 1929 , and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000 , but is now in danger of disappearing altogether , given the increase in the value of land . <p> White burley air-cured leaf was found to be more mild than other types of tobacco . In 1865 , George Webb of Brown County , Ohio planted red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seedlings had a whitish , sickly look , which became white burley . <p> Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products . Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil . However , young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles ( Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens ) , which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876 . By 1890 , successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric . Today , tobacco is sown in cold frames or hotbeds , as their germination is activated by light . <p> In the United States , tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite , which partially starves the plant of nitrogen , to produce a more desired flavour . <p> After the plants are about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) tall , they are transplanted into the fields . Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant . A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg , either a curved wooden tool or deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , the planter would move forward two feet , select plants from his/her bag , and repeat . Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis , New Idea Setter , and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process : making the hole , watering it , guiding the plant in -- all in one motion . <p> Tobacco is cultivated annually , and can be harvested in several ways . In the oldest method still used today , the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife . It is then speared onto sticks , four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn . In the 19th century , bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened . The leaves ripen from the ground upwards , so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of " primings " , beginning with the volado leaves near the ground , working to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top . Before this , the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop . Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed , and eventually , entirely harvested . As the industrial revolution took hold , harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers , an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole . In modern times , large fields are harvested mechanically , although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand . Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina , Kentucky , and Virginia . <p> Curing <p> Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf . This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves , and gives a sweet hay , tea , rose oil , or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the " smoothness " of the smoke . Starch is converted to sugar , which glycates protein , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caramelization process that also adds flavor . Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer . Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used . <p> Tobacco can be cured through several methods , including : <p> Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks . Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar , which gives the tobacco smoke a light , mild flavor , and high in nicotine . Cigar and burley tobaccos are ' dark ' air-cured . <p> Fire-cured tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder , and takes between three days and ten weeks , depending on the process and the tobacco . Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine . Pipe tobacco , chewing tobacco , and snuff are fire-cured . <p> Flue-cured tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks , which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns ( Aus : kilns , also traditionally called ' oasts ' ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke , slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing . The process generally takes about a week . This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine . Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco , which produces a milder , more inhalable smoke . <p> Sun-cured tobacco dries uncovered in the sun . This method is used in Turkey , Greece , and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco . Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes . <p> Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing , known as fermenting or sweating . Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a casing solution containing sugar and/or flavouring . <p> Global production <p> Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40 per cent between 1971 , when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced , and 1997 , when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced . According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN , tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the record-high production of 1992 , when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced . The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations , where production increased by 128 per cent.During that same time , production in developed countries actually decreased . China 's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production . China 's share of the world market increased from 17 per cent in 1971 to 47 per cent in 1997 . This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China . While this tariff has been reduced from 64 per cent in 1999 to 10 per cent in 2004 , it still has led to local , Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost . <p> Every year , about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world . The top producers of tobacco are China ( 39.6 pc ) , India ( 8.3pc ) , Brazil ( 7.0pc ) and the United States ( 4.6 pc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco production , 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land . While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers , growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane , because the Chinese government sets the market price . While this price is guaranteed , it is lower than the natural market price , because of the lack of market risk . To further control tobacco in their borders , China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration ( STMA ) in 1982 . The STMA controls tobacco production , marketing , imports , and exports , and contributes 12 per cent to the nation 's national income . As noted above , despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers , China 's government has acted to reduce tobacco use . <p> India <p> India 's Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh . India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers and many more who are not registered . In 2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India. 41 Around 0.25 per cent of India 's cultivated land is used for tobacco production . <p> In Brazil , around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. 36 Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7 per cent of the country 's total cultivated area . In the southern regions of Brazil , Virginia , and Amarelinho , flue-cured tobacco , as well as burley and Galp ? o Comum air-cured tobacco , are produced . These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes . In the northeast , darker , air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown . These types of tobacco are used for cigars , twists , and dark cigarettes . Brazil 's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco , but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative . Brazil 's government , however , provides small loans for family farms , including those that grow tobacco , through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar . <p> Problems in production <p> The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture , which is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco industry houses some of these working children . Use of children is widespread on farms in Brazil , China , India , Indonesia , Malawi , and Zimbabwe . While some of these children work with their families on small , family-owned farms , others work on large plantations . In late 2009 , reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International , claiming that child labor was common on Malawi ( producer of 1.8 per cent of the world 's tobacco ) tobacco farms . The organization interviewed 44 teens , who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season . The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours , as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors . They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness , a form of nicotine poisoning . When wet leaves are handled , nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea , vomiting , and dizziness . Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves . This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have encouraged global tobacco production . Philip Morris , British American Tobacco , and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries. 48 This encouragement , along with government subsidies , has led to a glut in the tobacco market . This surplus has resulted in lower prices , which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers . According to the World Bank , between 1985 and 2000 , the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37 per cent . Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product . <p> Environment <p> Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides . Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field . Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco . Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , end up in the soil , waterways , and the food chain . Coupled with child labor , pesticides pose an even greater threat . Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child 's lifelong cancer risk , as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems . <p> Furthermore , the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation . While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum , coal , and natural gas , which can be used as alternatives to wood , most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process. 54 Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing , packaging , and rolling cigarettes .

One of the projections of the goal is for Uganda to become a lower middle income country by 2020 before progressing to the upper middle income category by 2032 . <p> However , experts say this goal may not be achieved because of the high fertility rate in the country , which affects development . <p> The experts argue that children stop parents from saving and exploring business opportunities that would lead to development and eventually lead the country into economic prosperity . <p> An estimated 1.6 million babies are born annually in the country . On average , every Ugandan woman has the ability to have 5 children .

Instead of saving and reinvesting into the economy to allow development , money is being spent on children . The more children or dependents , the more money one spends , " she says , emphasizing the need to have the population structure changed . <p> " Our population growth rate at the moment is not in tandem with development . The rate at which women give birth to dependents does not match the rate at which families develop . We need to change our population structure so that we can have fewer children and dependents and have more grownups that are able to set up businesses , " she said . <p> Statistics from the National Population Council ( NPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children or youth most of whom are dependent on parents or guardians . <p> According to the NPC , for Uganda to become a middle income country , every Ugandan ought to have a per capita income of $1,000 ( about Shs4 million ) .

He says malnutrition will lead to an increase in the cases of child mortality . <p> " The cost of living has increased especially in urban centres and if we are to avoid child malnutrition then the parents should be in position to buy food and feed their children on a balanced diet because child malnutrition contributes much to death .

She says government needs to come up with a way to stop people in slums from having many children . <p> Francis Kamuge says families should be left to have the number of children that they want . He says government should sensitize people instead of trying to limit how many children every family should have . <p> " Let families have the number of children that they want . We have a lot of land in Uganda and people should have children . Instead of telling people to stop having children , tell them to have children that they can comfortably look after , " Kamuge said . <p> Jackline Kaboyo , a 64 year-old grandmother of three and business woman , says it is no longer possible for families to have many children .

Under such circumstances , several massive assemblies against the amendments have taken place in Hong Kong since June this year . <p> In order to solicit broader public opinions and to restore calm as early as possible , the HKSAR government decided on June 15 to suspend its work on the amendment bill .

But the problem about attracting investments is much wider , and what some important representatives of foreign investors for instance have been saying is a predictable policy climate , meaning over the medium term .

She said a severe lack of confidence for business prospects was likely " over the next two years " if nothing was done to improve predictability of the business environment . <p> Still some things that High Commissioner Cooke mentioned are already being addressed , as she specifically stated that " British investors in the country yearn for policy predictability , less bureaucracy and faster approval of new investments or projects . " The issue about red tape is part of the proposed changes , which means approval of projects will be quickened , apparently at the expense of the National Environmental Management Council ( NEMC ) whose onerous supervisory and permit issuance procedures have been a matter of concern even for decades . <p> Mussa Sima , the Deputy Minister of State at the Vice President 's Office ( Union and Environment ) , had to urge that investors make sure that they consult the National Environmental Management Council ( NEMC ) to familiarize themselves with environment regulations before commencing implementation of their projects . <p> Otherwise the concern until that point was possible conflicts with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or land authorities .

He agreed to a dowry of a few goats for his 15-year-old daughter . <p> It meant one less mouth to feed , and food and livestock for the family " -- stated in a report by UNICEF ( United Nations Children 's Fund ) , which explored different ways that climate change endangers the lives and futures of our children and how we must integrate climate risks into various policies and services . <p> Similarly , in Kenya , a dramatic rise in child marriage is seen due to severe droughts , diminishing the number of cattle at an alarming rate and child marriage is enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ( African Medical and Research Foundation ) , the largest Africa based healthcare non-profit organization aim to convince parents to stop child marriages and send them to secondary school - " when she is done with schooling , she will get a job and she will be able to buy you more than four goats " . <p> Meanwhile in poverty-stricken South Sudan , the majority of parents are marrying their daughters off in exchange for livestock using the bidding process , " Whoever bids with the highest number of cows will take the girl " said Dorcas Acen , a gender protection expert at CARE ( Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere ) . <p> In South Asian countries , families who face financial difficulties from the likelihood of natural disasters like floods , droughts , river erosion , and storms resort to marry off their daughters . <p> Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) told IPS that climate change is one of the reasons that is pushing girls in South Asian countries into getting married before the age of 18 . <p> Barr shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bangladesh and their linkage to early marriage , " Drawing a link between natural disasters and climate change is complex , of course , but we know that Bangladesh -- and other countries in South Asia -- are among those most affected by climate change . This is qualitative research , not quantitative , but the links were striking " . <p> HRW interviewed families who had been affected by three types of disasters -- flooding , cyclones , and river erosion . Many of the families they interviewed had been barely surviving dealing with inadequate nutrition even before the disaster strikes ; and one coping mechanism is that when a disaster pushed them from barely surviving to at risk of not surviving , they reduced their family size by arranging marriages for young daughters . <p> Barr says , " We saw this link most clearly in the families dealing with river erosion , and it seemed to be the combination of river erosion being both predictable and cataclysmic that created that link " adding , " Flooding was predictable and devastating but not cataclysmic " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replant their crops . " Cyclones were cataclysmic but not predictable " -- so families had to respond afterwards but had very little ability to plan beforehand . <p> " With river erosion , however , families would see the fields and homes of their neighbors closer to the river be washed away and those families permanently displaced , and they would know that within two or three or five years the river was coming for them . One of the ways they coped with the fact that they knew they would be displaced was by trying to find a marriage for their daughter that they hoped would ensure her safety and that would reduce their family size " . <p> Recent UNICEF data shows that 59% of girls in Bangladesh are married by 18 and 22% are married by 15 . This is one of the highest rates in the world , and the highest in Asia . Globally a girl is married almost every 2 seconds , among which 21% of girls marry before 18 and 5% before 15 . <p> However , the UNICEF report also shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past decade . The most progress has been observed in South Asia where a girl 's risk of marrying in childhood has dropped from approximately 50% to 30% . The practice is more common among girls than boys , 4% of boys in Bangladesh marry before age 18 . <p> Child marriage is still widespread across the globe where the total number of girls married in their childhood accounts for 12 million per year . One of the targets set in United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ( SDG 5.3 ) is to end child marriage by 2030 , but without increasing the rate of progress " more than 150 million additional girls will marry before their 18th birthday by 2030 " . <p> Barr told IPS that child marriage issue in regards to climate change and natural disaster should be addressed by governments by ensuring the agencies responsible for addressing climate change and natural disasters participate in developing and implementing the national action plan to end child marriage by 2030 . <p> And the plan plays specific attention to how climate change and natural disasters ( and other disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child marriage and includes steps to mitigate that risk ; she also asks for the governments to " Integrate child marriage prevention into all government planning in relation to disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation " . <p> " Taking baby steps like boosting the sense of awareness among the individuals and community to exercise the common best practices to preserve the environment might dramatically increase the progress of the bigger change we want to see at the global level . " <p> An inspiring story from UNICEF is about a Bangladeshi young woman Smriti ( 19 ) from Barisal district , who is working with YouthNet for Climate Justice , a UNICEF-supported network , spreading awareness about global warming to her community discusses about climate change and its connection to the increased rates of child marriage . <p> Smriti says " It is hard to gather people to talk about this , but so often , I 'll stop in a tea shop , or stop a group of people , and engage them that way " . <p> While talking to IPS about child bride issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , Barr stressed that in terms of every other country where child marriage continues , one of the most fundamental driver of child marriage is gender inequality and valuing girls less than boys . <p> Research shows , secondary education for girls must continue to be encouraged ; it opens up doors for their future careers with vocational advancement , making them highly likely to achieve economic empowerment ; and as a result they are able to pull themselves and their family out of poverty , as well as act as an encouragement for their next generation to continue to narrow the gender inequality gap which in turn will create fewer child brides .

@@61445234 <h> Zimbabwe 's currency crisis is far from being resolved <p> Zimbabweans are heading into yet another bleak festive season , with basic commodity costs soaring beyond the reach of many , and basic service delivery on the brink of collapse . The health system is barely holding , with junior doctors on three-month industrial action and teachers threatening- <p> Civil servants are demanding salaries pegged at the formal US$ exchange rate known as the interbank rate . There is a real risk of basic commodities running out , and fuel queues continue unabated . There seems to be no real solution in sight . To address the myriad social and economic woes , the currency crisis must be addressed urgently . <p> This year has seen many twists and turns in Zimbabwe 's long-running currency saga . In February , the electronic real-time gross settlement ( RTGS ) dollar was officially adopted as a local currency , alongside bond notes and multiple foreign currencies . In June , the use of the US dollar and other foreign currencies was outlawed for most transactions , while in October , Zimbabwe dollar notes were reintroduced . <p> In the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Originally the RTGS dollar was simply a US dollar held in a bank account . Over time the fiction that the ' bank ' dollar was worth US$1 could not be maintained , as banks lacked the US dollar reserves needed for convertibility . <p> The value of these bank ( or mobile money ) dollars has continued to drop , from an official rate of 2.5 per US dollar back in February to around 16 in the interbank market and 25 in the parallel market in early December . In the process , inflation has sky-rocketed and incomes have been slashed . <p> Zimbabwe 's currency crisis has been long-running . It goes back to the fixed exchange rate days and shortages of foreign currency since independence , to the rapid depreciation and re-denominations of the currency during the 2000s , culminating in hyperinflation and the eventual formal ' dollarisation ' of the economy in 2009 . <p> Zimbabwe is n't alone in its currency instability ; many countries have been through periods of high inflation , weak domestic currencies and shortages of foreign currency . The root causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fiscal and balance of payments deficits , and excessive monetary expansion . <p> However , Zimbabwe 's experience is unusual in several respects . In few countries has inflation spiralled completely out of control into hyperinflation . Similarly , in few countries has currency breakdown been so extreme that the domestic currency was completely abandoned . <p> A more typical experience is that as confidence in the domestic currency declines ( due to high inflation ) , citizens and firms switch to holding their bank deposits and making transactions in a foreign currency , usually US dollars . This ' partial dollarisation ' involves the coexistence of the domestic currency and US dollars in the financial system . Some countries have managed to recover from this , and re-establish a credible domestic currency . <p> The situation in Zimbabwe from 2009 to early 2019 was complete dollarisation , with no domestic currency . This is not particularly unusual -- there are 13 other countries in the world that use another country 's currency . What is unusual is the attempt to reintroduce a domestic currency after complete dollarisation due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new currencies -- Botswana in 1976 , and the Czech and Slovak republics after the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993 -- but the success of these efforts rested on the credibility of these countries ' ( new ) central banks and macroeconomic policies . These factors are not present in the case of Zimbabwe . <p> Zimbabwe is trying to introduce a new currency with a two-decade history of economic and currency crisis , and a central bank that lost much of its credibility during the era of hyperinflation . <p> It has been claimed that Zimbabwe needs to reintroduce a domestic currency because of the need to have its own independent monetary policy . But this is n't a valid argument . There are 57 other countries that have no separate legal tender , are members of monetary unions or operate a currency board , and hence do n't have an independent monetary policy . <p> Based on international experience , re-establishing a stable and credible Zimbabwe dollar would be a tall order . The minimum requirements would include restoring macroeconomic stability ; ending government fiscal deficits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency in the foreign exchange market and RBZ operations more generally ; and ending compulsory forex surrender requirements for exporters , subsidies for imports , and access to foreign exchange at privileged rates . <p> Zimbabwe also needs to negotiate a quasi-HIPC ( heavily indebted poor country ) arrangement with its creditors to reschedule and reduce its foreign debt and re-establish access to international capital markets . <p> Does Zimbabwe have other currency options that could lead to a sustainable outcome ? Given the need to re-establish macro-economic credibility , adopting an external monetary and institutional anchor is almost essential . Back when the multi-currency regime was introduced in 2009 , many analysts considered that it would make more sense to adopt the South African rand ( ZAR ) as the domestic anchor currency , rather than the US dollar . The ZAR is more relevant considering Zimbabwe 's trade patterns , and less likely to lead to competitiveness problems . <p> But unlike the US dollar , which can be used by any country unilaterally and does n't need the agreement of the US government , adopting the ZAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank . To get a nod from SA 's central bank , Zimbabwe needs to put its house in order . <p> The independence of Zimbabwe 's central bank has to be assured and an independent Monetary Policy Committee put in place . Zimbabwe 's Finance Minister , Mthuli Ncube , established this committee in September , but its independence is yet to be tested . Zimbabwe 's government also needs to be consistent regarding economic policy reforms to guarantee some measure of economic stability before they can be considered for the rand monetary union . <p> While it 's not certain that the Common Monetary Area members would admit Zimbabwe as a member , opening negotiations to explore this option could be the first step in re-establishing currency stability in Zimbabwe .

@@61483234 <p> IT 's a deniable fact that the much-needed industrial drive engineered by the fifth phase government under directive of President John Magufuli will not see the light of the day if the country will not invest largely on petroleum , gas and water sub-sectors . <p> The three sectors are paramount incentives for the mushrooming and metamorphosis of diverse industries , in terms of facilitating transportation , industrial power , heating and lighting , lubricants , petro-chemical as well as use of by-products .

Moreover , since when the authority shifted from ' cost , insurance and freight system ' to ' delivery at port ' in fuel importation , ocean losses have been countered to at least 14bn/- . <p> Since September 2010 , EWURA embarked on an innovative fuel- marking program , code- named ' DNA ' with an eye to counter a spate of fuel dumping , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific research conducted by the University of Dar es Salaam ( UDSM ) over the uses of the DNA program , between 2010 and 2013 the programme has helped to increase fuel 's tax revenues to state coffer at a tune of 468.50bn/- . <p> To ensure for abundant access of fuel within the country , EWURA has so far issues a total of 1,561 fuel business license to various traders .

@@61483235 <h> How nursery school fosters love of learning to underserved community <p> It can be easy to forget that getting to and from school can be a challenge for some children . The children in Madale in the outskirts of Dar es Salaam region experience this struggle on a daily basis . They live in an underserved area for education , with over 400 children who reside there but only- <p> By Sara Barnes <p> couple of schools for them to attend . As a result , there is overcrowding in the classrooms , and many kids have to travel miles to go to school . ( Some children just do n't go at all . ) This is where the Busungu Community Centre ( BCC ) has stepped in . Established in 2016 , it is a non-government organisation ( NGO ) that provides learning for up to 100 children who become part of a nursery school that follows the international curriculum for nursery schools in Tanzania . <p> Ages three through six currently attend the BCC school . There , local teachers and international interns focus on fostering the skills that young children need to help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they learn to be curious , cooperate with others , be creative , and take initiative . <p> My Modern Met Store donates 1 per cent of its profits to a charity that benefits children and adults in helping them to experience art in a way that they might not have before . In 2018 , our online shop donated money as well as drawing books and rainbow pencils for the children at the BCC school to use . <p> If you would like to help support BCC , you can do so by becoming a sustaining member . For just $15 a month , you can help fund the school in providing healthy meals , buying supplies , and making renovations and upgrades to their space . <p> We spoke to three people involved with BCC : Edward Busungu , Co-founder and Director ; Danny Kim , Co-Founder and Advisor ; and Line Bickmann , head administrator . Scroll down to read our interviews with them and learn more about how BCC is helping change the lives of people in Madale . <p> What inspired you to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : In my 20s , I traveled throughout several developing countries in Asia and Africa . At some places , I spent up to 10 weeks volunteering at NGOs . Unfortunately , from my experiences , I realised many NGOs operate for-profit , in which fundraising dollars or volunteer income goes to the owners ( who are usually foreigners ) so the money ends up going back to developed nations ( there is very little legal oversight ) . I was disappointed by my experiences . In my 30s , I wanted to return to Tanzania to create my own organisation with all Tanzanian board members to prevent such occurrences . <p> Edward Busungu ( EB ) : What inspired me the most was my own background and childhood from where I lived as a boy from a young age . I had to walk very far to go to school -- around 45 minutes to the local transport and then on a bus for half an hour . I had to leave home around five o'clock every morning , and if anyone was late they used to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two schools around the area and each school was overcrowded . There were only a few teachers in each class with no proper structure . To get into a proper school , you have to pay a lot of money and go very far from the village of Madale . Most parents can not afford it because most earn a living by driving motorbikes as taxis and cooking local food in the village for the workers and then working budget construction . <p> Line , how did you become connected to BCC ? <p> Line Bickmann ( LB ) : I came to Tanzania to volunteer for the first time in 2009 , and I have known Edward since then . I remember talking to him in 2015 , where he explained to me that they were going to open a school and that I was the one going to run it . By that time , I was living in Greenland , where I was a lecturer at a university college , so that did not really sound like a realistic plan -- but somehow it happened anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening . <p> What are the three key points of the BCC ? <p> DK : To keep it short , our goals are to be Local , Transparent , and Sustainable . In terms of local , aside from myself , our five board members are all Tanzanian and provide their support for free . We also hire local teachers . Being local is important because so many NGOs in developing nations comprise of mainly foreign board members and managers . This creates a divide between foreign and local staff . As a preschool , I think it 's important that the children have adults of their own nationalities in the key positions so they look up to people of their own heritage as role models . <p> Transparency is also very important . Many nonprofits do not open their books or state where their donation money is going to . At the BCC , on our website , we list exactly where donation money is going to ( primarily construction projects ) and how much we 've spent monthly operating our preschool . This ensures that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can have the peace of mind knowing how it 's spent . As an organization , I am proud that 0 per cent of our fundraising money goes to administrative fees . 100 per cent goes directly to the project since all our board members are working free of charge . <p> Sustainability is our last goal and currently our most challenging . We charge a small fee of $15/month for children to attend our school . That money goes to pay staff salaries and operating costs like food and water . Currently , we are losing money some months but our hope is that student tuition can go to running the school and that we can end up near even after each month . 
@@61483236 <h> Christmas as a day and as a series of commemorations <p> MOST religious holidays or festivals have a sort of complication in them , that they are marked on the pinnacle of the historical event involved , but their religious matrix or format is often characterized by a lengthy ritual .

One of them is known as Twelfth Night , apparently starting from Christmas Day , while a different tradition emphasizes an ' octave , ' that is an octet of eight days from Christmas to Epiphany , where the January 6 or so festival is the end of the two week Xmas period , for the wider circle . <p> What is interesting though is that the day itself is a subject of controversy as doctrines differ from one authority to another , even within the church , and also depending on denominations .

At that moment the winter day that had diminished in length starts to prolong until June 21 when the day starts diminishing again at the summer onset . Victory at Hades was insurance of another year of life , thus salvation . <p> It is in this manner that as the kings of Europe led by Emperor Constantine of Rome , to whom the kings were subjected , accepted Christianity so as to have a common religion and diminish wars between them , especially the big war of the periphery against Rome that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual festival that was deeply rooted in the consciousness of the masses of Rome and other parts of Europe that it would have been fairly difficult to just eradicate it .

The popular culture as it spread in the new lands of Christianity sees Christmas Eve and then Christmas Day as the proper marking , while in the lands of Christianity the following day became Boxing Day , of sending and opening gifts from relatives and friends , near and far .
