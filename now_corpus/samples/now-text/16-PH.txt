File photo by Dennis M. Sabangan/EPA <p> To date , research has failed to demonstrate that single-sex education produces better academic outcomes when compared to coeducational schooling . Proponents of single-sex schooling argue that girls flourish in calm environments , free from the sexual pressures represented by their " disruptive " male peers , and boys benefit from energetic , girl-free spaces . <p> Yet studies argue that any perceived academic advantages of single-sex schools disappear when other variables , such as socioeconomic background and parental education levels , are considered . <p> A number of analyses have examined the impact of single-sex education on academic achievement . In 2014 , a large-scale study of more than 20 nations examined the extent to which single-sex schooling led to superior academic outcomes . <p> Similarly , when education researcher John Hattie examined the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influences on learning , there was little to suggest that gender-based segregation offered any academic advantage . <p> Results from the Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) further support the lack of evidence of any link between single-sex schooling and academic outcomes . <p> Gender is complex <p> While it has been argued that boys and girls have different " learning preferences " , there is little evidence that this is sex- or gender-specific , and no evidence that teaching to those supposed differences makes any difference to students ' learning outcomes . <p> Female brains do differ from male brains , both anatomically and developmentally , but this differentiation is minor , not directly related to the child 's ability to learn and arises not only from genetic factors , but also sociocultural and environmental factors . <p> These differences are often used to support the claim that single-sex schools are necessary to provide differentiated education which better accommodates those neurological differences . <p> This is a reasonable hypothesis , but the real test of its validity is not the mere existence of those brain differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved educational outcomes . <p> In the case of academic outcomes , such differentiation does not . In fact , in the case of social , emotional , psychological and social- and gender-equity outcomes , it is clear single-sex schools can produce worse outcomes and may actually be harmful to children . <p> Opponents of single-sex schooling in the United States have argued that separation on the basis of sex and gender is akin to racial segregation and facilitates inequity between students . <p> Like the outdated practice of segregating students based on race , sex- and gender-based segregation ignores the complexity of students , their sexuality and gender and sexual identities , facilitating a culture of sexism stereotypes and discrimination . <p> Single-sex schools also contribute to the construct of a false dichotomy between male and female gender . Forcing students into categories of boys and girls ignores how students perceive and talk about themselves in terms of their gender . <p> Myths <p> Single-sex education also perpetuates the myth that gender is synonymous with sex . It is not . Sex is predominantly but not exclusively binary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are complex phenomena arising from an interaction of many ideological , psychological and sociocultural factors , all of which are culturally and temporally relative . <p> Delineating schools on the basis of this artificial dichotomy perpetuates the myth of both a gender binary and a gender-identity binary . For students who do not fall within these relative norms , or whose gender identities do not align with their biological sex , significantly higher rates of suicide , suicide attempts , self-harm , depressive illnesses and bullying are the tragic outcomes . <p> This is a notable indictment of single-sex education systems , as education has the power to undo these ill-founded and biologically inaccurate stereotypes . While increasing awareness of adolescent sex and gender issues is a step in the right direction , segregation based on students ' sex or gender is not . <p> Just as it is not acceptable to segregate students on the basis of socioeconomic status , race or culture , there is no place for segregation on the basis of sex or gender . <p> While parents and carers have the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve an opportunity to interact and engage with each other , regardless of perceived and socially constructed " differences " . <p> Promoting such opportunities prepares students for life beyond the classroom , a skill that is more important than the purported myth of academic achievement driven by advocates of single-sex schools . -- Rappler.com <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .

I thought that it was not so much to ask because I 'm the first to arrive and the last to be packed up most of the time due to the volume of sequences I had to do every taping day . <p> The next taping after that , I was transferred to a better dressing room it was the master 's bedroom of the location we were at . From then on , that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday ( March 3 ) , the Executive Producer ( EP ) asked me if Ms. Vivian can share the dressing room with me because her assigned area was not ready to be occupied yet . I of course agreed . I was fine sharing a room with any of my co-stars for as long as we have mutual respect . I would not have agreed with production if I had any ill feelings towards Ms. Vivian . <p> My staff and I came from shooting for a movie that day so we were all tired . We tried to get some rest and sleep in the bedroom but Ms Vivian made it difficult for us . She was busy fixing her things and in the process made a lot of noise . She was also arguing with her Production Assistant then quite loudly that made sleeping impossible at that point . At some point I stood up to use the rest room and was annoyed to see the toilet bowl unflushed , so when I went out I immediately called my make-up artist 's attention thinking it was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some air and went to where the common area for artists and production was . The EP asked me why I was there . I said that it was difficult to sleep with Ms. Vivian inside the room . The EP told me not to worry because Ms Vivian 's dressing room will soon be ready . <p> Later I spoke to the EP and requested a dialogue with Ms Vivian so I can make it clear with her that I had nothing to do with the request for her to transfer rooms . To be very clear about it , I never requested anyone at any point for Ms Vivian to be transferred rooms . In fact , I gladly welcomed production 's request for her to share a room with me while her room was still unavailable . <p> And despite the inconvenience I encountered while she was around , I had no intentions whatsoever of booting her out . The EP told me that it was impossible at that time to have a dialogue with Ms Vivian because her emotions were still so high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of frustration and stress , I cried to my co-star Zanjoe Marudo . <p> Thursday taping finally packed up so we all went home with this issue unresolved . Saturday taping followed , and upon arriving on the set , I was still stressed out that the incident has yet to reach any kind of resolution . <p> My co-stars on the set were joking around with me about the incident with jokes like , and I quote , " AA , sasabay daw si Ms Vivian sa car mo paglipat natin ng location , ayos lang ba ? " etc. etc . Our EP heard the jokes and instructed my co-stars to stop fooling around about the issue because the atmosphere is tense enough already . <p> The EP turned to me and said , and I quote , " Konting tiis na lang AA . Sa Monday kakausapin na siya ng management para sa pagkawala niya sa show . " Still I would 've appreciated a resolution better because I had nothing to do with the issue of Ms Vivian 's source of anger . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me . I in fact made the initiative to be the one to transfer dressing rooms that day to stop the issue then . <p> I was so stressed that when it was finally time for me to do a scene where Ms Vivian will be present I was trying to motivate myself by just singing Avril Lavigne 's " Goodbye " song before doing the scene . It was of course subliminal because of my knowledge of her departure from the show . It was short of saying to myself precisely what the EP informed me earlier . <p> More than anything , it was my way of dealing with the situation to get the job done . The scene was shot and thank god it was not with Ms. Vivian directly but with Zanjoe . Ms. Vivian was also there but her point of view was also with Zanjoe . <p> Ms. Vivian started to shout at me and , I quote , " Ako ba ang pinariringgan mo ! ? Sino ka ba ? ! Superstar ka ba ? ! " I got rattled at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kumakanta lang naman ako , masama ba kumanta ? " And it was at this point that Zanjoe pulled me away from the scene because he was alarmed with the way both Ms Vivian and her make-up artist were charging toward me . <p> I am sorry that some gaps in the communication between the production staff , Ms Vivian , and myself escalated some issues . I reiterate that I wanted them resolved soonest for everyone 's peace of mind . <p> I am also sorry that emotions got so heightened that some of my actions were misconstrued for rudeness when they were , more than anything else , my own way of coping with the stressful working conditions on the set in this particular instance . <p> But I sincerely apologize if it hurt Ms. Vivian or anybody else . I do have high regard for and respect with thanks senior artists who have paved the way for stars like me in the industry .

While Viv likes Rob , she responded in a traditional way , the way she was raised by her parents . So she is taking her time to get to know Rob . However , after two weeks of courtship and Viv already intended to say " yes " to Rob , Rob stopped inviting her out or seeing her . So Viv is asking if Rob was really sincere . And because she was raised not to go after a guy , should she just let him go ? <p> DJ : Viv did not mention that she was rude and so I 'll assume that she was cool about the whole thing . She was only taking her time . Being in a relationship requires some form of commitment . So it is okay to give time to discover who they really are for each other .

Guys who truly love someone are usually willing to wait . <p> M : I see nothing wrong with Viv taking her time in getting to know Rob . Should n't it be that way ? If we take time in choosing a school to get into , a course to take , a job offer to consider or even a bag or shoe to buy , why not expend the time and effort in getting to know someone who is courting you ? The problem these days is impatience . Millennials want it quick and fast be it in information , food and even relationships . Taking it slow and sweet seems to be a thing of the past . And thinking about whether or not to get into a relationship with a guy for two weeks is hardly a long time . Fourteen days of waiting surely can not scare a guy away unless the guy is into instant relationships that will probably instantly end . <p> DJ : She can discreetly check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even message him just to see how he 's been . It 's good to possibly know what his reasons are . Seeking first to understand , then to be understood is a good outlook to have . But this area specific to communication needs to be further validated should Rob resume with the courtship in the coming days or weeks . Disappearing without any word to someone who truly matters is not usually an ideal behavior to have . I know the concept of wooing someone is unfortunately fading fast into the sunset . But the process is not only necessary but can even be life-saving . It sets a good foundation of what the relationship will be like in the future . And it also allows people sufficient information to decide not to be in a relationship . <p> M : Rob 's sincerity or lack of can not be gauged just because he stopped inviting Viv or seeing her . Might it be he is busy with work ? Viv can always message him to ask how he is and that is not " going after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to construe it as a girl being interested is just that , a girl being interested or still showing interest . Whether or not Rob is sincere about his intentions with her can not be concluded just after two weeks of courtship . And if Viv likes Rob after her two weeks of introspection or analysis or maybe background check , then she should also make the effort to reach out to him . Guys need some signs too . If the woman is indifferent , you ca n't fault a guy for looking somewhere else or at someone else . If he made the effort for two weeks , at least give him the benefit of the doubt . Relationships are a two-way street . And there should be communication between the two of you for the relationship to progress . <p> DJ : Giving the courtship period two weeks was not a bad call , in my opinion , particularly if Viv was good to Rob .

I suggest that she give it a little more push by messaging him and by still greeting him if ever they 'll see each other . But if he 's still not making any move , perhaps it 's time to charge this to experience and move on more learned and wiser this time around in matters of the heart . <p> Latest issues of Sun.Star Cebu also available on your mobile phones , laptops , and tablets .

Or is it just a Roman Catholic invention to lure people into the Church ? <p> Do Catholics and the Catholic Church have proof of this belief ? <p> " The proof of the pudding is in the eating , " so a saying goes . <p> For Catholics , the proof is written in blood and in history -- both written and oral , particularly in the Bible and the testimonies of witnesses . <p> Some might say that the Bible is itself " an invention " of the Catholic Church , which preserved , collected , collated and bound its many books , letters and documents into one volume . <p> They may criticize but they can not deny that much of the Bible has been acknowledged as historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many secular or non-religious historians . <p> Witness testimony <p> It is within these Biblical accounts that the proof and the testimonies of those who witnessed Jesus die and rise from the dead are recorded . <p> One such proof was the empty tomb , where the body of Jesus was laid after His crucifixion -- a gruesome death witnessed by a multitude in Jerusalem during His time . <p> Citing witness accounts , the Bible says that the body of Jesus was no longer at the tomb early on the " first day of the week , " or Sunday , the third day after Jesus died on the cross . <p> The tomb was empty . <p> Among those who saw the empty tomb were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Salome . According to Mark 16:1 the three women brought spices to anoint the body of Jesus but He was no longer there . <p> The apostles Peter and John later also saw the empty tomb , according to John 20:3-8 . The body of Jesus was no longer there and all they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That tomb is now in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem , a proof that it existed . <p> The ' missing ' body <p> In modern forensics and law , the lack of a body could negate the claim that a person has died . <p> In this case , however , the " missing " body of Jesus is presented as proof that He had risen from the dead . There was no dead Jesus because He had resurrected back to life . <p> The proof of the empty tomb would subsequently be supported by the appearance of a risen Jesus to the disciples and the Apostles , who made up a big number of witnesses who would later testify that the Christ who died on the cross had indeed resurrected . <p> Numerous sightings and appearances of Jesus after His resurrection are recorded in the Gospels . <p> Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene , according to John 20:11-17 . Later , He appeared to His Apostles ( John 20:19-23 ) . Jesus even showed them his hands and feet and let them touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost . ( Luke 24:36-49 ) He even let the Apostle Thomas stick his fingers into the nail marks on his hands and the wound created by a spear on His side . ( John 20:26-28 ) <p> As further proof , Jesus ate broiled fish with them . ( Luke 24:41-43 ) <p> Much later , Jesus showed Himself to His followers as He ascended or rose up to heaven . ( Acts 1:9 ) <p> Testimony of many <p> In all these , Jesus showed Himself to many people and witnesses to prove that He had indeed risen from the dead . <p> The testimony of one witness can be questioned . But it will be difficult to dismiss the testimonies of many witnesses . <p> The lives and deaths of many of these witnesses would later support their testimony about Jesus . For example , Apostles like Peter and Andrew allowed themselves to be crucified as a testimony to their belief . James , Thomas and Jude were reported to have been martyred because of their faith in Christ . <p> Many people base their beliefs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . " Many say they rely on science or scientific hypotheses . Others base their convictions on mere ideas and suppositions . <p> For Catholics , their belief in the Resurrection and of Jesus rising from the dead is not only based on faith , but more solidly on the fact of an empty tomb , a " missing " body , and the testimonies of many witnesses who saw , heard , touched and encountered the risen Christ . <p> Later , many of these witnesses would willingly give up their own lives for this testimony , knowing and believing that if Jesus rose from the dead , they too , would rise again with Him to eternal life . <p> Bearing the same belief , many Catholics rose early on Easter Sunday as a sign of their conviction that as surely as the sun would rise in the morning , they would also rise with Christ in their own resurrection . <p> Catholics gather early Sunday morning outside the Holy Trinity Parish church in Cainta , Rizal , to celebrate Easter , which recalls the Resurrection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resurrected Christ on its way to the ' Salubong ' with the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary .

@@7927239 STABLE PRICES : Consumer confidenceimproves for Q1 <p> March 28 , 2016 <p> Consumers ' outlook continued to improve for Q1 2016 , with the overall confidence index ( CI ) rising to -5.7 percent from -8.1 percent for Q4 2015 . The current quarter CI matched the all-time high recorded for Q2 2013 since the nationwide survey started in Q1 2007 . <p> The higher CI for Q1 2016 means that the number of households with optimistic views increased but continued to be less than those who think otherwise . <p> The CI is computed as the percentage of households that answered in the affirmative less the percentage of households that answered in the negative with respect to their views on a given indicator . A positive CI indicates a favorable view , except for the inflation rate , the peso-borrowing rate , unemployment and change in prices , where a positive CI indicates the opposite . <p> The overall consumer CI measures the average direction of change in three indicators - overall condition of the economy , household finances , and household income . <p> According to respondents , their higher optimism during the current quarter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more jobs ; ( b ) stable prices of commodities ; and ( c ) more investors in the country . <p> The other factors cited by respondents that helped boost their confidence for the current quarter were oil price rollback , assistance from government such as the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program ( 4Ps ) , less corruption and anticipated election of new government officials . <p> For the next quarter ( Q2 2016 ) , consumer sentiment continued to be more favorable as the next quarter CI increased and remained in the positive territory at 9.1 percent ( from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter 's survey ) , while the year ahead CI rose to 25.4 percent ( from 18 percent for Q4 2015 ) . This indicates that the number of consumers with favorable views increased and exceeded those with unfavorable views . Consumers were of the view that good governance and improvements in infrastructure and peace and order would continue over the next 12 months . They also anticipated lesser household expenses as well as an increase in household income and savings which could translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household . <p> Consumer confidence is measured across three component indicators , namely , the country 's economic condition , family financial situation and family income . For Q1 2016 , consumer confidence on the country 's economic condition and family financial situation improved while outlook on family income was steady . Notably , consumer perception on family financial situation registered the highest CI at -6.3 percent since Q1 2007 . For the next quarter ( Q2 2016 ) and the year ahead , consumers ' views on all three indicators turned more sanguine as consumers expected continuing improvements in the country 's economic condition due partly to the coming change in administration and better financial conditions . <p> By income group , the low-income group consistently reported improvements in consumer confidence across the three component indicators for the current and next quarters as well as for the year ahead . <p> Interestingly , the current quarter outlook of the low-income group reached an all-time high CI at -15.3 percent since Q1 2007 . The outlook of the middle-income group on the country 's economic condition and family financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the year ahead but that on family income was less buoyant for the current quarter . Meanwhile , the sentiment of the high-income group generally weakened for the current and next quarters but turned more upbeat for the year ahead . These show that the improvement in consumer outlook was driven primarily by the increase in confidence of the low-income group even as the high-income group remained to be the most optimistic . <p> The spending outlook index of households on basic goods and services remained positive but declined to a record low of 30 percent for Q2 2016 ( from 34.2 percent in the previous quarter ) . Although more respondents continued to expect higher spending on basic goods and services , the number that said so declined compared to a quarter ago , indicating that growth in consumer spending could slow down in the near term . The spending outlook index declined across commodity groups , except for water and electricity . The biggest decreases were observed for transportation , fuel , personal care and effects , and clothing and footwear . <p> The percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy big-ticket items was broadly steady at 29.6 percent . The outlook on buying conditions improved for real estate , but weakened for consumer durables and motor vehicles . Respondents cited lack of parking space , high registration fees and maintenance costs , and traffic as reasons for their less sanguine outlook on buying conditions for motor vehicles . The positive consumer sentiment extended to purchases of big-ticket items as buying intentions for the year ahead increased compared to the previous quarter 's survey results . <p> For Q1 2016 , the percentage of households with savings increased to 32.7 percent from 30.2 percent a quarter ago . Households with savings increased across all income groups , with the high-income group posting the highest increment quarter-on-quarter , followed by the middle-income group . According to respondents , they save money for the following reasons : ( a ) emergencies , ( b ) retirement , ( c ) health and hospitalization , and ( d ) education . More than two-thirds ( 68.1 percent ) of household savers had bank deposit accounts while 43 percent kept their savings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paluwagan , other credit/loan associations . <p> Although the percentage of savers increased , the percentage of respondents who reported that they could set aside money for savings during the current quarter decreased to 38.9 percent ( from 41.5 percent for Q4 2015 ) . Meanwhile , the proportion of those that could set aside 10 percent or more of their monthly gross family income was higher at 38.9 percent ( from 35.6 percent for Q4 2015 ) . <p> Respondents anticipated inflation to decline to 3.3 percent from 4.2 percent for Q4 2015 , reflecting their lower inflation outlook over the next 12 months . This indicates that inflationary expectations are likely to remain well-anchored over the next 12 months as the number of respondents with views of higher inflation declined compared to a quarter ago . Meanwhile , fewer respondents expected interest rates to increase as the CI edged lower for this quarter 's survey . Respondents are of the view that the peso would continue to depreciate against the US dollar over the next 12 months . Meanwhile , fewer respondents expected unemployment to rise for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36.9 percent in the last quarter 's survey . <p> Of the 553 households included in the survey that received OFW remittances for Q1 2016 , 97.3 percent used the remittances that they received to purchase food and other household needs . The proportion of OFW households that said so as well as those that allotted part of their remittances for debt payments ( 46.5 percent ) , savings ( 43.4 percent ) , and for purchase of motor vehicles ( 8.7 percent ) increased . <p> Meanwhile , the percentage of OFW households that allocated part of their remittances for education ( 70 percent ) , purchase of consumer durables ( 21.9 percent ) , purchase of house ( 11 percent ) , investment ( 6.5 percent ) , and other miscellaneous expenses ( 4.5 percent ) remained steady . Fewer OFW households , however , utilized their remittances for medical expenses at 56.1 percent ( from 59.7 percent last quarter ) . <p> The Q1 2016 CES was conducted during the period 21 -- 30 January 2016 .

But many people use offshore accounts for more than just hiding bribes and laundering money . <p> Really . <p> And offshore accounts can be financial tools for more than just the ultra-wealthy , too .

Bruno said efforts to crack down on wrongdoers holding offshore accounts have made it daunting for people living overseas who try to follow the law . Unlike most other countries , the U.S. taxes its citizens on all income , regardless of where it is earned or where they live .

And as long as the money is reported to the IRS , the whole arrangement can be above board . <p> People outside the U.S. may also put money in offshore accounts if they feel the political or financial climate in their own country is n't stable . And while the U.S. is outspoken about its fight against offshore abuses , it has become a popular place for many global companies and wealthy to park their money thanks to laws in some states that make it easy and cheap to establish businesses and accounts , and do so anonymously . <p> Business <p> Small business owners , especially internet-based ones , can have customers all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in the country where the owners live . <p> These businesses often find it much simpler -- and cheaper -- to incorporate the company abroad where registration fees or taxes are low , or where it 's easier to process payments coming from several countries . <p> There are also financial products only available in certain countries that may require an account in that country to access . <p> Often , offshore accounts are just plain practical .

While calling the job cuts " difficult , " he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas . <p> The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014 , and analysts say they may not be the last . <p> " These companies are so big that it takes time " -- and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring -- to change direction , said Patrick Moorhead , a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy . <p> Krzanich has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit .

A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected . <p> Intel has large campuses in Portland , Oregon ; Chandler , Arizona ; Rio Rancho , New Mexico ; and Santa Clara and Folsom , California .

Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months . <p> But aside from the data center business , which now contributes nearly a third of Intel 's revenue , the markets for Intel 's other new products are still " very embryonic , " according to Mark Hung , an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm . <p> " It 's going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working .

Inherited from the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , the conditional cash transfer ( CCT ) program has been recognized and lauded by world leaders as well as the World Bank . <p> A recent survey said 80% of Filipino voters will likely vote for candidates who will continue the current administration 's flagship poverty alleviation program , which is being implemented by the Department of Social Welfare and Development ( DSWD ) . <h> " You can glamorize poverty and think that it is noble .

It is part of the international network Social Watch which holds governments accountable to commitments toward the eradication of poverty . <p> In her interview with Rappler , Briones said that whoever wins the presidency in the May polls will have to work within the national budget created under the Aquino administration for at least two years . <p> Around P62.67 billion of the DSWD 's 2016 budget under the Office of the Secretary has been allocated for the 4Ps .

The House of Representatives has approved House Bill 6393 on 3rd and final reading . <p> Administration bet and former Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II supports the call to institutionalize the 4Ps through a law , but Briones said this proposal is a recognition " that poverty levels will rise " and an admission that " you are not really solving the problem of poverty .

Soliman said her department 's Sustainable Livelihood Program has already helped over 300,000 who are also in the 4Ps , and a 2016 budget of P9 billion will allow DSWD to help more . <p> Poe 's other proposal to introduce an " unconditional " cash transfer program for calamity victims is already being done by the DSWD , Soliman said . <p> " Pantawid 's objective is to keep the children in school and keep them healthy . It 's an investment in the future of the country . That 's what it 's all about . It 's not about giving everyone everything that they need . This is conditional cash transfer , and this is providing the wherewithal . In other words , it 's giving the worst off a fighting chance , " the social welfare chief added . <p> At least two other presidential candidates also suggested to include a livelihood component in the program : Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a proposal similar to Poe 's : include the near-poor families in the program to keep them from reverting to poverty . <p> The latest Listahanan 2 revealed over 67,000 4Ps families already yanked out of poverty are still " vulnerable " to go back in the event of an economic shock or a disaster . <p> But the DSWD secretary thinks another strategy should be laid out for the near-poor , and it should be a program separate from the 4Ps . <p> CONTINUE CCT. 80% of Filipino voters say they will likely vote for a candidate that will continue the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program . File photo by George P. Moya/Rappler <p> Identification of poor ' problematic ' <p> What about proposals to include other marginalized sectors ?

" <p> ( They should change the classification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on saying they are not expected to solve the poverty problem , but if they wo n't solve the poverty problem , how come P60 billion , much of our anti-poverty funds , are for CCT ? ) <p> Briones proposed that persons with disabilities who are also poor should be covered already by the 4Ps . But she said that , to this day , the program 's identification of the poor remains problematic , even after years of implementation . <p> Binay actually vowed to " clean up " the program to keep it from being used for politicking . But Soliman questioned the basis of the cleaning up : " What do you mean by cleaning up the list ? We have cleaned up the list , we have removed 100,000 names of families . We can improve it definitely , but we want to know , how do you want to do this ?

@@8434237 <p> At this late ... of the ongoing presidential contest , the man to beat appears to be Rodrigo Duterte -- until very recently an outsider to national politics whom very few thoughtful Filipinos took seriously . How does one account for the phenomenal rise to national stature of a local politician from a remote corner of Mindanao ? <p> Equipped with an enormous capacity to tell stories and tackle issues in street language dripping with expletives , the man talks tough against criminals , drug pushers and abusive people , promising to summarily purge them from our society . He laughs at his own dirty thoughts and desires , and ridicules our foibles as a people . But he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest contempt for what he considers the nation 's inept and corrupt public officials , and the ruling families they serve . <p> Despite , and perhaps because of , his crude language and coarse demeanor , he comes out -- to his admirers -- as an endearing rogue who articulates without fear their own resentments and fantasies . That is what is interesting -- and , to the rest of us , disturbing . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourlong monologue at a political rally in which he recounted , with all the machismo he could summon , his reaction to the gang-rape and murder of the Australian lay missionary Jacqueline Hamill in 1989 . Hamill and her companions were held hostage by 15 inmates inside a Davao detention center where they were conducting a prison ministry . Duterte 's remark about his feeling especially angry upon seeing the corpse -- thinking he should have had a first go with the beautiful Hamill -- struck me as totally perverse and disrespectful . Knowing that he is a lawyer and a former prosecutor , I did n't expect it . I wondered if the tough-talking mayor was just carried away by the energy of the moment and , in his rush to tell a joke , had failed to censor a barbaric thought . But , he insists he was n't joking . <p> The applause , laughter and jeering from the complicit crowd left no doubt in my mind that the legendary mayor felt completely in his element . One could hear some of his admirers prompting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , the better . It 's difficult to say where this is all coming from . My hunch is that we 're dealing here not so much with a mindset as with a configuration of raw emotions lying just beneath the surface of our culture . I suspect it is this that gives resonance to Mayor Duterte 's brand of political rhetoric . <p> People recognize themselves in him . They see him as someone who makes no attempt to represent our better or higher nature , but is content , rather , to speak to our unpolished , confused and insecure selves . He refuses to be bound by norms of political correctness , secure in the thought that in the fraudulent world of politics , talking bluntly is the only way to be authentic . " Take me for what I am , " he likes to tell his listeners . While the inability to admit a wrong may seem fatal to anyone with presidential ambitions , for Duterte fans , that same rebellious obstinacy seems to lie at the very core of his appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , Duterte would not be connecting to millions of Filipinos the way he has in recent weeks if he had not tapped into a rich vein of popular disenchantment . This public disaffection can flow from various sources . In a highly unequal society like ours , in which individuals find themselves permanently trapped in patron-client relationships , unexamined resentments silently build up in the hearts of those constantly at the receiving end of power and oppression . This is often accompanied by a vague yearning for emancipation and justice . But , instead of taking action , people are typically content to have a forceful figure like Rodrigo Duterte personify and articulate their rebellion , and displace their aggression , for them . <p> But , Duterte 's rise has equally been made possible by the grievances of Mindanao 's non-Muslim majority . Mostly Visayan settlers who made the island prosperous , they have long nurtured an antipathy to Manila politicians who speak of Mindanao 's peoples and their needs as though these were reducible to those of Muslim Mindanao . Davao 's longtime mayor deftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mindanao 's contribution to the country 's gross national product and the pittance it receives in internal revenue allotments .

We have had countless politicians who rose to national prominence by portraying themselves as men of the masses . But none of them ever challenged the prevailing system . In contrast , Duterte has made it a point to mock the system and its conventions , seeing in its openings nothing more than channels through which to undermine it . <p> At his rallies , he kisses the flag and professes patriotism , pledging to repair the country 's broken system of government . Many can sympathize with that goal .

The ( army ) general is coming to pick you up and to bring you to the hospital for medical check up and then you fly ( back home . ) " <p> The governor quickly phoned the military and police about the Indonesians and handed them over to the authorities and brought to an army base where doctors examined them . <p> It was unknown if ransoms had been paid for the safe release of the hostages -- who were all crew members of the tugboat Brahma 12 kidnapped on March 26 off Tawi-Tawi province in the troubled Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao . <p> Indonesian media reported that the company that owns the tugboat -- Patria Maritime Lines -- was willing to pay ransoms in exchange for the hostages , believed being held by Alhabsi Misaya , a rebel commander also tagged as behind the recent kidnappings of 4 Malaysian seamen -- Wong Hung Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teck Chi , 39 , and Johnny Lau Jung Hien , 21 -- all from Sarawak in the oil-rich state of Sabah in Malaysia . <p> Television giant GMA 7 reported that the Moro National Liberation Front helped in the negotiations for the safe release of the hostages , but this could not be independently confirmed , although the former rebel group previously negotiated for the freedom of Malaysian hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf . <p> Jakarta was said to have monitored the progress of the private negotiations between the kidnappers and the ship owner . Indonesia earlier said that it is ready to send police commandos to the Philippines to rescue the hostages . <p> " There have been a lot of efforts by the local and provincial government and the military and police in securing the safe release not only of the Indonesians , but other hostages as well . The recovery of the ten Indonesians is good news . We hope and pray that the others may also walk freely away from their captors , " Tan told the regional newspaper Mindanao Examiner . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abu Sayyaf which pledged allegiance with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . There were no immediate statement from the military 's Western Mindanao Command and the police authorities in the Muslim autonomous region about the release of the hostages . <p> The Abu Sayyaf beheaded a Canadian hostage John Ridsdel on April 25 after his family and government failed to pay P300 million ransom . The jihadist group is also holding Dutchman Ewold Horn , who was kidnapped in Tawi-Tawi ; Canadian Robert Hall , Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad -- who were all seized from the posh resort of Samal Island in Davao del Norte province ; and Japanese treasure hunter Toshio Ito also known as Amir Katayama Mamaito .

Former Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II was in second place with 23 percent . <p> Turnout was a record 81.6 percent of voters , well above 74.8 percent in the 2010 election . <p> The race for vice president remained tight .

Once notorious as the nation 's murder capital , Davao is now one of the country 's safest and more prosperous cities . <p> Duterte has offered at-times contradictory comments on relations with China . <p> He said the Philippines will take a multilateral approach for now to its territorial disputes in the South China Sea , including working with the US , Japan and Australia .

( When Juan Ponce Enrile , then the defense minister , broke away from the Marcos regime , he admitted in public that he had manufactured hundreds of thousands of votes for Ferdinand Marcos in Cagayan Valley ; it was a strategic confession , meant to provoke both anger against Marcos and sympathy for the rebels , from the people who were coming to Enrile 's aid . ) <p> It was not the allegations of corruption linked to Gloria Arroyo 's husband that precipitated her crisis of legitimacy and made her the most unpopular president since surveys became a regular feature of Philippine politics , but the unrefuted evidence of a conspiracy to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her and election commissioner Virgilio Garcillano was to pad her vote total in the 2004 elections with a million votes . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Even in the case of President Joseph Estrada , it was not the allegations of corruption that forced him onto that lonely barge that ferried him out of Malaca ? ang in 2001 ; it was the brazen 11-10 vote in the Senate , convened as an impeachment court , which prevented the opening of the second Jose Velarde envelope . That prompted hundreds of thousands of people to congregate at the Edsa Shrine . <p> We leave it to the academic experts to determine why it is these voting anomalies that exercise our civic energies so ; why charges of " daya " are more potent than accusations of corruption . <p> But there is a valid way of alleging electoral fraud . <p> In Marcos ' case , it was the combination of the Commission on Elections workers ' walkout , the multiple instances of vote-buying and voter intimidation , the lawsuits , eventually the confessions . When the Catholic Bishops ' Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos no longer had the moral authority to serve as president , it was based , solidly , on evidence . <p> In Arroyo 's case , it was the damning recording , played over and over again , which convinced many that there was in fact a conspiracy to rig the elections the old-fashioned way : through the manipulation of the canvassing stage . <p> The allegations of election fraud , later downscaled to concerns , raised by vice presidential candidate Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos Jr . do not pass this test . <p> To summarize his statements and those of his spokespersons : The current lead enjoyed by the Liberal Party 's vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo is suspicious because Marcos Jr . began the quick count with a head start and at one point even had a 1-million-vote edge over Robredo . Robredo 's suspicious surge began when there was a supposed tweaking of the script that runs the transparency server sometime during election night . <p> Other arguments offered by his supporters include one from statistics : The linear progression of the votes for Robredo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one based on , well , denial : Who is this obscure Robredo , and where did her votes come from ? <p> A whole army of statisticians and data experts has emerged to debunk the analysis offered by academics Antonio Contreras and David Yap , who do not hide their support for Marcos Jr . Simply put , their reading is wrong because they assume randomness where there is none . The obscurity argument does n't work either ; Robredo was in virtual ties with Marcos Jr . in the last three preelection surveys -- and in fact campaigned in about twice as many areas as he did . The 1-million-vote edge is explained by the fact -- available to many on election night -- that the early transmissions were from Marcos bailiwicks . As for the supposed script tweak : This can be simply resolved by stopping the main and transparency servers in the presence of observers and comparing the contents . <p> What Marcos Jr . should have done is show his copies of the election returns , and compare these with the tallies he suspects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why .

@@8797234 <p> Playing coy is ... depicted in the third chapter of the great Philippine novel " Noli Me Tangere , " where the Spanish friars display their boorish behavior at Kapitan Tiago 's welcome party or bienvenida for Crisostomo Ibarra , who had just returned from Europe , dressed in trademark black from top to toe , and with a complexion and rosy cheeks suggesting that he had just come from a cold climate . <p> At the beginning of the chapter we see the line jele jele bago quiere that did not require a translation or explanation at the time . This corrupt Spanish phrase with a funny resonant rhyme simply means that one is pretending not to appear interested in something , though in reality one is desperate to have it . One plays coy as a way to fish for compliment or be persuaded to take the supposedly unwanted thing one wanted all along . <p> By force of habit , the two friars head toward the head of the table and are confronted with only one , presumably high-backed , chair . Rizal 's scene is evocative of competitors for a university position , who loudly proclaim the superior traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite . But after a decision is made , the person who is not chosen sulks and grumbles . So the friars loudly exalt the honor of the other , with each keeping firm hold on the chair : <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " ' For you , Fray Damaso . ' <p> " ' For you , Fray Sibyla .

" His true intent is clear from the tone of his voice , so the lieutenant declines the seat to avoid both a social situation and the misery of having to sit between the two quarrelling friars . <p> That Rizal 's influence extends beyond his time can be seen in a short " postelection comedy " published by Rafael C. Londres in 1947 , where he makes up a rivalry between two Batangas notables , Jose P. Laurel and Claro M. Recto , for the 1925 senatorial elections . A fact check shows that there was no contest because in 1925 Laurel was elected senator for the fifth senatorial district comprising Batangas , Cavite , Marinduque , Mindoro and Tayabas , while Recto was elected to the House of Representatives for the third district of Batangas . Nevertheless , the author mirrors the jele jele bago quiere dialogue in the " Noli " of the friars Damaso and Sibyla in a conversation between Laurel and Recto after the 1925 election : <p> Laurel : Now that the election is over and political passions have , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to congratulate you on your election as senator from the fifth district . <p> Recto : I deeply appreciate your wishes , all the more because they come sincerely from a worthy opponent . <p> Laurel : I do n't mind losing to so enlightened , so noble , so great a man . <p> Recto : Believe me , you have not lost at all . You are greater in your defeat than I in my victory . My triumph has not given me happiness , because it is totally unmerited .

@@8797235 <p> " Change is ... " was the campaign mantra of Rodrigo Duterte 's camp , and indeed it was a most tantalizing prospect , especially given that the main opponent was promising " continuity " via the " daang matuwid . " <p> But if " change " meant new faces , new policies , new directions and a fresh perspective , it seems we 'll be disappointed . Let me start with the cast of characters surrounding the presumptive winner of the presidential election , beginning with that sleaze ball lawyer Sal Panelo on the fringes of the circle of followers surrounding the Davao mayor wherever he goes . Then there are the other old faces , mainly former Cabinet members dating back to the Ramos and Arroyo administrations , indicating that instead of moving forward , what we 're witnessing is in fact a U-turn . Reports have it that these former secretaries , along with retired generals and big-time Mindanao business leaders , were largely responsible for engineering and financing Duterte 's run for president . What was their motive ? <p> A possible scenario , hinted at , if not stated outright , is the release from hospital detention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges . Then there are Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla , doubtless salivating at the prospect of joining Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile , who was released on bail on compassionate grounds .

And yet , why this seeming tolerance for the return of the " big fish " finally caught in the net of anticorruption bodies in public life ? Where 's the change -- at least the positive change -- now ? <p> * * * <p> There have also been claims made that ordinances that have supposedly made Davao a peaceful , crime-free city will be implemented nationally . <p> These include the imposition of a curfew on minors as well as the ban on smoking in public places , on the sale of alcohol , and even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is this indicative of the priorities of the presumptive winner of the presidential election ?

But with police kept busy chasing after young people out on the streets past 1 a.m. , public smokers , drinkers and out-of-tune singers caterwauling in the wee hours , will they have the time and energy to go after big-time criminals , much less manage the traffic ? <p> Perhaps the mayor 's image-builders are just trying to create a more accessible version of their tough-talking principal , addressing the " little " problems that pose a daily , constant irritation to ordinary folk who can be easily placated by little measures , forgetting the bigger , more difficult and vastly more dangerous and complicated issues that bedevil society . <p> We were promised " change , " but so far the changes in the works are rather underwhelming . We 're still waiting for clearer directions that promise more decisive policies and actions . But if overturning the historic rulings against corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change will be rocky indeed . <p> * * * <p> More humanizing are the video footage of the mayor breaking down in front of the graves of his parents , especially of his mother Soledad , a public school teacher known to many Davaoe ? os as " Nanay Soling . " <p> Described as strong-willed and of imposing demeanor , Nanay Soling retired from teaching when her husband entered politics , and even as an elderly widow was an anti-Marcos activist , even debating then visiting Defense Minister Enrile in a public event . No doubt she played a big influence on her son , even if the mayor 's political genes can be traced to his father Vicente , who served as Davao 's governor for many years . <p> Duterte was overheard begging his mother for " guidance " as he prepared to assume the presidency , a reality that may have suddenly hit him the morning after the voting .

@@8797236 <p> This is about ... , about who they really are and what they mean to us . <p> Let me start with a story about an ordinary mother . I remember the date clearly because it was an auspicious date that could happen only once in a lifetime -- Aug. 8 , 2008 . It was supposed to be a lucky date depicting three 8s : 08-08-08 . <p> But , apparently , the date was not a lucky one for a mother who died instantly early that day , after getting hit by a speeding vehicle . This little item on an ordinary police matter was buried deep in the inside pages of the next day 's newspapers , amid the reports on the interesting events that occurred , such as the opening of the Beijing Olympics , the babies born on 08-08-08 , and the weddings held on that unique calendar date . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> What was glossed over by many of the newspapers was a small detail -- that the mother died in the process of saving her son . She actually managed to get her son out of harm 's way before she herself was struck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a slight injury . <p> The story profoundly moved me then , as it still does today . Not being a mother , I reflected deeply on how a mother could totally forget herself for her child 's sake , even at the cost of her life . <p> I found the answer from a remark I often hear from mothers : " Sana ako na lang " ( I wish it were me instead ) . These words , usually spoken in anguish , are what a mother cries out when her child is ill or , worse , when her child dies . <p> " Sana ako na lang " must have always been this mother 's wish . It was fulfilled on that fateful day . <p> As I recall this story today , I am reminded also of another mother 's agonizing grief after having lost a child : " A child usually buries a parent , but a mother burying her child ? " And of a mother who asks in sorrow : " A child who lost a parent is called an orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow/widower . But what do you call a mother who loses a child ? " <p> Then I thought of my own mother . I do not doubt that had she been given the opportunity , she would have willfully given her life for any of her seven children . And I say this because she has often said that her one prayer to God was for her not to see any of her children die ahead of her . Thankfully , God granted her that wish . She died well ahead of all her children . <p> And , of course , there are the Gospel stories about mothers and their children . <p> I remember in particular the story of a mother that Matthew the Evangelist wrote about in Matthew 15 , 21-28 . Anyone familiar with the story knows that it is usually captioned as the story of the Canaanite woman . And ordinarily , homily preachers would emphasize her being a woman , that she is from Canaan , and that there is value to unceasing prayer even when it is coming from a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel with a non-Jew audience in mind , in contrast to the others who wrote mainly for the Jewish people . He was also writing for the outcasts , the sinners , etc. , when he wrote about God 's universal love embracing all peoples -- regardless of race , gender , religion , etc . <p> A careful reading of the text , however , would reveal the detail that the woman from Canaan was a mother who came to Jesus to plead without ceasing for her sick daughter , even if she had to defy established customs and practices , earning the anger of the people . Until Jesus granted her request ... <p> And so for me , this is another story about a mother 's love and her wish for her sick child . A story of how a mother can go to great lengths for the love of her child . A story worth telling for Mothers Day and the days surrounding it . <p> On a light note , I remember reading this sign about mothers in the internet : " Sometimes when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I remember the following anecdotes about teachers and their students in a classroom situation . Whether these anecdotes are factual or not , they bring out the point I want to make about mothers just the same -- that mothers have so much influence , especially on their younger children : <p> There was a math teacher who was trying to teach the concept of fractions to her pupils . Teacher : " Your mother baked a pie for your family of seven -- your father , your mother , yourself , and your four siblings . What part of the pie will you get ? " Child : " One-sixth of the pie . " Teacher : " But I said there are seven of you . I am afraid you do not know your fractions well . " Child : " And I am afraid . Teacher , that you do not know my mother well .

That leaves both parties facing the challenge of reuniting for the fall campaign -- a feat that will be much harder to pull off this year than it was in most other presidential election years . <p> Though it is mathematically impossible for Bernie Sanders to win enough pledged delegates to capture the Democratic nomination , he is staying in the race , which means that Hillary Clinton can not yet begin her healing effort . But winning the support of the millions of voters who fervently back Sanders poses a serious challenge . Sanders is not simply an adversary ; he leads a movement that opposes what Clinton and the " establishment " stand for . <p> The contest between Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008 seemed to end amicably enough . Clinton stayed in the race to the end , but she toned down her rhetoric against Obama as the contest wound down . Later she took the unusual step of going onto the convention floor to urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet the efforts in 2008 to unite the Democratic Party were n't as successful as the conventional wisdom suggests . It is one thing for candidates to decide that they must be gracious in defeat . Their followers can be harder to reconcile . After 2008 , tensions between some of Clinton 's and Obama 's strongest supporters lingered for years . <p> One way to unite party factions is for the nominee to select his or her rival as running mate . John F. Kennedy chose his formerly bitter opponent , Lyndon B. Johnson . ( That merger did n't go well . ) But Clinton is n't about to make Sanders her running mate . He is temperamentally unsuited for the role of subordinate , and their policy disagreements reflect deeply held views about the role of the federal government . <p> Obama probably chose Clinton to be his first secretary of state for reasons that went beyond her considerable intelligence : It was better to have her in the tent than outside it . Even so , Clinton 's loyalty was not absolute . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his handling of Syria 's civil war , and in her campaign she has sometimes distanced herself from his policies . Yet Obama , once Sanders is out of the race , will surely campaign hard for Clinton . <p> It is clear that Sanders intends to challenge Clinton on some issues to be included in the party 's 2016 policy platform . During the nomination campaign , he managed to pull her somewhat to the left on trade , the minimum wage , and mass incarceration . But there 's only so far she can go in the general election without losing the votes of independents . <p> While Sanders ' proposals are popular , particularly among young people , much of his agenda -- such as transforming Obamacare into a single-payer health system -- is n't politically feasible . Likewise , Wall Street 's banking behemoths are unlikely to be broken up . <p> Moreover , at this point , Clinton and Sanders are exasperated by each other . She and her husband Bill are annoyed with Sanders for continuing to campaign ( even though she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his critique of her record . <p> Candidates rarely forget such things .

Kennedy , around the stage in pursuit of the traditional photo of former rivals with arms raised and hands clasped . Instead of a beaming show of unity , Carter got only a grudging handshake . <p> The main reason it could be hard for Clinton to win over Sanders ' supporters is that a great many of them do n't like her . A third of them have said they wo n't vote for her . In April , only 40 percent of Democrats gave her high marks for being honest and trustworthy , and only 50 percent of Democrats rated her favorably overall .

As a result , her standing has gone down during the campaign . <p> Clinton has a great many fervent supporters , of course , but her presidential campaigns have both suffered from a dearth of passion . The greatest danger she faces in the November election is that too many Democrats simply wo n't bother to vote . Her campaign is counting on Donald Trump to unite the party , and that might well happen . But she will have her work cut out , particularly among young and first-time voters , who have overwhelmingly backed Sanders . <p> The Republicans will also have a problem uniting around Trump , now the party 's presumptive nominee .

Bush have both said they 'll stay out of this race . <p> For the first time in US history , both parties ' nominees are far more disliked than liked by America at large , though Trump does lead Clinton in this department .

A little taken aback , I quickly said , " No , thank you , " and the man raised an eyebrow as though I had personally offended him . Then he said casually , " Oh , so you 're not a voter ? " I clarified that I was , but I did n't share his choice of candidates . <p> I had long stopped associating the presidential candidates with the behavior of their supporters . With all the mudslinging in print , on TV and social media , one thing that 's certain is that nothing we read about politicians ( or their supporters ) is likely to be 100-percent true . After that episode , however , I do want to discuss two things that are 100-percent true : that drug addiction is a problem , and that drug addicts are people , too . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> The Philippines , unlike many of its neighbors , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access of Filipinos to mental health services . Many legislators , among them vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo , have long been pushing for coverage for mental health issues . The World Health Organization , in a 2007 report , noted that 5 percent of the total budget for health goes to mental health , and that most of this is dedicated to the maintenance and upkeep of mental health hospitals . While 5 percent may seem large when compared to other more visible and apparently pressing health concerns , I 'd like to issue the reminder that ( as this column has said before ) the brain is an organ like any other ; mental illness is fully deserving of treatment , attention and , ultimately , financial coverage . Drug addiction is one cause , symptom and effect of mental illness . To receive treatment for it is not only expensive and harrowing , but is also further hampered by the stigmatization of drug addicts during the escalating war on drugs . <p> Drug addicts and the pushers who supply them are often vilified as the bottom feeders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propels ( as then presidential candidate Duterte liked to say ) criminality and corruption . We think of addicts as emaciated people engaged in shady deals and rotting in basements and empty warehouses , eyes bloodshot , injecting themselves with drugs while their dealers laugh evilly on and men higher up in the ladder of power just get richer and richer . However , drug addicts are not merely criminals but also victims ; the two are not mutually exclusive . They are victims of their own mental illness , and the archaic attitude of mere punishment is simply unacceptable in this day and age . Long gone are the days when the only option for drug addicts was to lock them in cells and to starve them of their drug of choice . While treatment options in the Philippine landscape are still limited , health professionals are at least slowly beginning to look on addiction as a legitimate mental illness and to focus on compassionate , responsible and holistic rehabilitation . People do n't lose their human identity just because they have used drugs . <p> " People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health-care provision which is their human right , " says a 2014 report on human rights by the International Network of People Who Use Drugs . " People who use drugs can not rely on not being arbitrarily detained , harassed , abused , arrested or incarcerated . They are subject to violations of their bodily integrity , to torture , to compulsory labor camps masquerading as ' treatment , ' and to execution . " <p> Does that last bit sound familiar ? That 's because what most people see as the answer to the country 's drug problem -- an opinion that is not only uneducated but also inhumane . Multiple news portals last month quoted presidential candidate Duterte as saying that he would kill even his own children if they ever used drugs . However true , untrue , or merely flippant this statement might be -- after all , despite his harsh words for drug addicts and pushers , Duterte has devoted significant funds and resources to the repair and upkeep of a rehab center in Davao -- it is symptomatic of the attitude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this attitude is unacceptable . <p> Respect for human rights must always be at the heart of drug control , and the management of addiction should focus less on criminalization and more on treatment . Despite his brash proclamations , Duterte clearly does n't intend to execute all drug users and might even ( we dare to hope ) be a force for change in the way we manage drug offenders , balancing their accountability and their need for rehabilitation . It 's about time his supporters and the rest of the electorate followed suit . Let this millennial voter issue the gentle reminder that , as the song goes , the fundamental things apply : that to even the lowest and most pathetic , to the most criminal , and to the most mentally ill , to the most addicted and the most abused and abusive , human rights must always apply .

@@8846233 <h> Unshifting pattern <p> ... case you have not seen Teddyboy Locsin 's " Teditorial " on ANC last Friday , May 13 , by all means try to do so . I understand it is very hot on the Internet . In it , Teddyboy raised several interesting issues that apparently perplexed him regarding the conduct of the counting of votes in the May 9 elections . He thinks Comelec has a lot of explaining to do . <p> Among the issues Teddyboy raised was the fact that in the senatorial race , and most especially in the winning circle of twelve , everybody largely kept their rankings from start to finish . It did not seem to matter where the votes came from or what time of the day or night they were transmitted - most everybody managed to just hang on to their places as if by assignment . <p> It was only when widespread disbelief threatened to undermine the credibility of the polls over the surprise topping of the race by Joel Villanueva that , as if on cue , he suddenly traded places with Franklin Drilon . But except for this last-minute swap at the top two positions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to number twelve . <p> Teddyboy has a point . To have almost no changes in the rankings of those who make up the magic twelve , with the notable exception of the Villanueva-Drilon shell game at number one and number two positions , is stretching credulity too far . Even if the composition of those in the winning circle was to hold firm and steady , surely the geographic and demographic factors behind every vote should have some effect in the rankings . <p> But as Teddyboy noted , the rankings just stayed almost the same . And this can give rise to a number of questions and suspicions in the mind of the public that no one else but the Comelec can answer and allay . Unless the Comelec confronts the issue squarely , there is no stopping the public from suspecting that maybe the polls have been rigged . For how else can the composition of the magic twelve in the senate race remain almost steady all throughout , and at precisely the same rankings ? <p> Teddyboy also had the same reservations with regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bongbong Marcos . Teddyboy noted that just like in the surveys , Bongbong first led by a wide margin , only to be overtaken by Leni toward the end . But Teddyboy did not stop with the script-like turn of events . More importantly , he noted that Leni just seems to keep her roughly two hundred thousand lead over Bongbong no matter what . <p> Freeman ( Article MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : <p> If Leni was destined to win , why can she not just lead by , say fifty thousand ? Or if it had to go in the opposite direction , why can she not increase her lead to , say five hundred thousand or even a million ? But this lead being at a constant two hundred thousand , give or take a few votes up or down , is indeed perplexing . It seems to follow a pattern at well , like in a program . <p> Now , everything that Teddyboy said in his " Teditorial " seems to fall into place given recent developments like the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing the Comelec heirarchy as protocol and common sense demanded , to change a script in one of the servers involved in the poll count . The change may have been minor and cosmetic , as insisted by the Smartmatic official , and did not interfere with the count or alter the results . But that is not the point . <p> The fact that a Smartmatic official , without top Comelec authorization and clearance , can change anything at all in the system only shows and proves , in no uncertain terms , that unauthorized intrusions can actually happen to the process and that the chain of integrity securing the 2016 elections can indeed be broken . That indeed is very terrifying . <p> No wonder sitting Comelec commissioner Rowena Guanzon and former Comelec commissioner Gregorio Larrazabal are demanding , like Teddyboy , for an explanation from Comelec . Guanzon goes even further . She wants Smartmatic blacklisted from here on and banned from further participation in all Philippine elections . Maybe it is time that it should . <p> Aside from it being the partner of Comelec in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the programs that run them , not much has really been known about Smartmatic other than that it is a Venezuelan company . And yet it has apparently become the Comelec favorite , not just winning rich Comelec contracts but assuming the audacity as well to act unilaterally without Comelec en banc approval .

He has also set eternity in the human heart ; yet , no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end . <p> I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live . <p> That each of them may eat and drink , and find satisfaction in all their toil -- this is the gift of God . <p> I know that everything God does will endure forever ; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it . God does it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been , ? and what will be has been before ; ? and God will call the past to account . <p> And I saw something else under the sun : In the place of judgment -- wickedness was there , ? in the place of justice -- wickedness was there . <p> I said to myself , " God will bring into judgment ? both the righteous and the wicked , ? for there will be a time for every activity , ? a time to judge every deed . " <p> With crimes , drugs and corruption as the priority targets of the incoming administration , Duterte 's adherence to Ecclesiastes-3 should serve as fair warning . When Duterte first started his presidential campaign , he already issued ultimatum to those engaged in these nefarious activities . Obviously , his 16 million voters agreed with him . <p> Citing " 98% of the Philippine National Police ( PNP is clean , " the incoming Commander-in-chief warned " scalawag " policemen to find an honorable way out of the service , either resign or retire now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public persona of Duterte as " The Punisher " while being mayor of Davao City will surface in Malaca ? ang when he takes over . <p> As soon as he assumes the presidency on June 30 , Mayor Duterte vowed to issue a text blast for the rest of government officials and workers . <p> He has a very brief message to all of them and spelled it out : " STOP .

But that 's not UP . That 's not UP Football . And that 's not this amazing collection of young men and women . <p> MANILA , Philippines -- Leaders in the business world sure do love a good sports story . Those heroic tales of courage , resiliency , leadership , and will to win . We love them because we can use them to inspire and motivate business teams . Sports and business after all are both battlefields of sorts . One is a battle on the fields and in the gyms ; the other is a battle in the marketplace . The learnings are easily transferable . <p> Well , you can take all those DVDs of Hoosiers , Coach Carter , Remember the Titans and Seabiscuit and all the other popular sports films that businesses love to use with their organizations and you can put them back in their cases . Because the greatest sports story of all is a Filipino story . Right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happened last week . <p> It all starts with the men 's and women 's football teams ( soccer for the Americans ! ) . <p> UP is a fabulous institution . Being an adjunct professor there , I have learned first-hand what an amazing place it is . There is an attitude at UP I love . Dynamic and talented kids , many coming from far-flung provinces , grasping at their shot to improve their lives and the lives of their families . It 's a special place . <p> Yet , the sports program is a mixed bag . Some teams have success in the UAAP and some do not . UP suffers from a lack of funds and does n't have the wealthy patrons other schools may enjoy . The budgets are razor-thin . And nowhere is all this more visible than in the football program . <p> The program has had its own mixed success of sorts . The men have won the UAAP a few times , even as recently as 2012 . The women , however , have never won in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the budget for separate men 's and women 's head coaches .

Just a few short months later , on Feb. 2 of this year , Rogie passed away . So young , with his whole life in front of him . A wonderful young man . It 's so tragic that it does n't leave your heart aching ; no , this one literally rips your heart out of your chest and tosses it out the window . <p> Beyond a grieving family and hordes of friends , Rogie left another family devastated : the UP Football program .

They wanted the memory of their beloved Rogie to live on forever . They knew they could build a monument or paint a mural and achieve this in some small way .

They had made it to the title game ! The women would take on powerful DLSU , while the men would take on perennial powerhouse Ateneo de Manila . <p> I am sure you can already anticipate what happened . The women took to the pitch first , and played a brilliant match against a superbly talented DLSU and won 2-1 against a previously undefeated squad .

His teammates , his family at UP , made sure of that . <p> Hollywood will come knocking for the movie rights for this one . And the movie will be a blockbuster that every business will use .

@@8967233 <h> Decoding Duterte <h> ... Duterte <p> DAVAO . Supporters ask their Duterte shirts to be autographed by presumptive President Rodrigo Duterte while they pose for a photo with him . ( Stella A. Estremera ) <p> In my Facebook status last Friday , I wrote : " As I was reading the comments in a Sun.Star article about the exclusive interview with presumptive President Rodrigo Duterte , I realized not only are the Tagalogs barely able to comprehend as Duterte weaves one story to another simply because there is no exact Tagalog translation of the Visayan word " yaga-yaga " , they are in deeper trouble because there 's a term more complex than " yaga-yaga " ... <p> " bugal-bugalon " fits Duterte 's way of talking to a tee , especially when he 's talking to the masses . " As expected , this generated questions on what " bugal-bugal " and " yaga-yaga " mean . Sought out to explain what both words mean , Sun.Star Cebu SuperBalita editor-in-chief wrote : " Yagayaga and bugalbugal both mean ' to ridicule ' but the difference between both lies in their nuances . The bisaya always considers the context of the joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ourselves and we tend to see the lighter side of things . We describe someone as bugalbugalon if we know the person to be such . " <p> It is Duterte 's penchant to ridicule even himself when trying to drive a point that is often lost in translation . But since we will have six years of himself , the it 's best if we learn from what has been observed through the three decades that he served Davao City as city mayor , vice mayor , and congressman . <p> Lesson No. 1 : Learn the nuances of the Visayan language and their penchant to make fun of , ridicule , or belittle themselves . While alluding to his throng of girlfriends in an exclusive interview with Sun.Star editors and officers from Visayas and Mindanao near dawn of May 18 , 2016 , he said that he is no longer the Lothario that he was before . <p> " Matanda na ako , masakit na likod ko , " he said . Then there is his repeated statements that he made it through formal education by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lesson No. 2 : Do not take yourself seriously . When asked about how he is dealing with the throngs who just want to have a selfie with him , he admits it makes him uncomfortable . <p> Once you get the drift of how these two lessons work , then you will have an idea of when to take Duterte seriously and when to let things pass . <p> Lesson No. 3 : Dig up old files and quotations , he 's starting from there . Maybe it 's because he has been saying the same thing on specific issues like peace and order and his war on criminality , he tends to just jump in with a statement and forget the predicate . But those who have covered him for decades now know that the predicate has long been laid down . Shoot-to-kill orders have always been issued against those who put up a fight and not a blanket order in any pursuit against criminal suspects . <p> Being a lawyer , Duterte knows the limits of the law and have a good grasp of how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has the rules of engagement of the Philippine National Police to back him up for this , where Rule 8 is the Use of Force . <p> " The police officer must first issue a warning before he could use force against an offender . The warning is issued for the police officer to identify himself and to give opportunity to the offender to surrender . The duty to issue a warning is however not absolute . The directive to issue a warning is necessary only in situations where several options are still available to the police officer but in cases where the threat to the life of a police officer is already imminent , and there is no other option but to use force to subdue the offender , the law enforcer 's failure to issue a warning is excusable . " <p> That he will ride a jetski to the shoals claimed by China in the disputed West Philippine Sea and plant the Philippine flag at the Chinese airport built there was also said with a predicate , that is , " We have to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na nanalo tayo sa korte and then we demand sa China to empty the place , amin yan . " <p> His keen knowledge of laws is also why he openly admits killing a thousand , and repeatedly says he will kill all druglords and drug pushers and throw them to Manila Bay and still not be hauled off to court . The reason : he did not threaten nor name a particular individual . <p> Lesson No. 4 : Talk is important and he can talk for several hours . While Duterte may seem to go off-tangent in replying to some questions he will give the same answer when it is about Mindanao peace , his respect for revolutionaries , and his hatred of drugs . <p> He has said it over and over through the three decades in elective office . Sitting down to talk is important to him . <p> " Better a hundred years talking than a single day at war , " repeat that a hundred times and he will still say that over and over again . <p> For druglords and drug pushers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost of their former selves and he is not inclined to put them in jail because then , government will still have to spend to feed them and keep them alive . <p> The relative peace and order in Davao City is not merely borne out of laws being implemented and people obeying laws , but most of all , people living in harmony . <p> It may not be a perfect model , but in most ways all people are represented and at the very least tolerated here . Under his leadership , deputy mayors of the 11 indigenous tribes ( both locals and settlers ) have been appointed as recommended by the tribal councils . <p> These deputy mayors are tasked to be the bridge for the concerns of their people to the mayor . Lesson No. 5 : He talks dirty but he knows GMRC . In the exclusive interview with Sun.Star executives from Visayas and Mindanao near dawn of May 18 , 2016 , Duterte admits that the way he talked to the crowd during the campaign was all about messaging . Admitting that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some people are getting offended , he said , that while addressing the mobs that would gather for his rallies , he sees himself among them . " Yun ang gusto nilang marinig nagalit ka talaga , " he said . <p> But , to reporters at past midnight of May 10 , 2016 , the day after elections , " I ca n't be bastos because I 'm speaking for our country . Kung mayor-mayor lang pwede na . But if I 'm representing the country , prim and proper na . Maging holy na ako . " <p> Even as mayor , he has behaved when not cursing criminals . In giving his reason why he quit drinking when he became mayor and the consequent liquor ban at past midnight until the early hours of the morning since 1988 . <p> " When I was mayor , hinto na ako .

They now show that good things come in three 's as their third collaboration , " Tatay Kong Sexy " , is another heartwarming story of a widowed father struggling to raise his three kids by himself . The characters and the situations in this film are all so real , not just an over-engineered enterprise with manipulative plot mechanics in the script aimed to make pa-cute and please the crowd . <p> Sen. Jinggoy is Paquito , owner of a car repair shop whose wife died of the big C five years ago . He has three kids : Empress Schuck as Mariel , Jolo Estrada as Frankie and Maliksi Morales as Ken . He then meets Maja Salvador as Monette , after she had her car repaired in his shop . Maja works as a fixer and takes care of her sister 's love son . There 's mutual attraction between them but this is not articulated . Problems arise when Empress ' boyfriend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy , gets her pregnant . Patrick works as manager in a bank that is owned by his own father no less ( the late Mark Gil . ) But naturally , Jinggoy fumes . Empress , who is initially hostile to Maja , finds an ally in her so it becomes easier for Jinggoy to accept his only daughter 's pregnancy . <p> But things get complicated when Dominic 's mom ( Marina Benipayo ) advises him that they 're against the idea of their son marrying Empress just because she 's now preggy . What 's nice about the movie is that it does n't dwell on negative situations . When problems arise , they are solved easily without unnecessary histrionics and melodramatic confrontations . The pacing is very brisk and there 's no time to get bored . This is a comedy where the laughter is not forced . <p> And there are many really hilarious laugh-out-loud scenes . You should watch out for that dinner scene where Jinggoy and family are invited by Dominic 's family to their own well-appointed home . Jinggoy is dressed-to-kill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result is truly quite funny . You can easily observe the disparity in the economic and social standing of the two families as they interact with each other . The acting of the entire cast is also uniformly good . Maja easily stands out in her " babaeng bakla " role , which she delivers so effortlessly . She is just a natural ribtickler in a number of scenes , like in restaurant scene with Jinggoy 's family where she is formally introduced to his kids . Her being a motor mouth turns off Empress who tries to embarrass her but she 's completely oblivious of Empress ' sarcasm . She 's also good in the dinner scene with Dominic 's family where she praises the dishes laid out for them and asks : " Ano to ? Niluto nyo o binili lang ? " We honestly believe Maja is better than most of her colleagues and contemporaries at ABS-CBN these days . <p> Sen.

@@9149233 Trump , Nor a Lee Kwan Yew <p> 06/01/2016 11:05 pm ET Updated 17 minutes ago <p> Richard Javad Heydarian Academic , policy adviser , and author of " Asia 's New Battlefield : US , China , and the Struggle for Western Pacific " <p> " All men of sense , " one of America 's most imaginative founding fathers Alexander Hamilton once said , " will agree in the necessity of an energetic executive . " Rodrigo Duterte , the Philippines ' most popular mayor , was just elected to the presidency with the highest number of votes in the Southeast Asian country 's history . And his legions of supporters -- who relish the provincial mayor 's off-the-cuff honesty and celebrate his unmatched bravado against the establishment -- fervently believe that they may have elected not only the country 's first president from the southern island of Mindanao , but also , perhaps , its most energetic so far . <p> But what can we expect from the new president ? Does Duterte resemble any contemporary leader , providing some clues into his governance style as a head of state ? Recently , Karen Davila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me whether I see similarities between Duterte , on one hand , and Donald Trump and Lee Kuan Yew , on the other . My answer ? Let Duterte be his own man , let him set a new standard of leadership . After all , he faces a set of very unique challenges that neither the American colossus nor tiny Singapore have ever faced . <p> It must be said that Duterte is absolutely no Trump , the bigot who has openly slandered one underprivileged minority after other , while showing little appreciation of the complexities of 21st century global politics . In contrast , Dutetre , who has embraced his Muslim and Christian roots , boasts decades of experience in actual political realm -- not some phony reality show . Unlike the neo-mercantilist Trump , who belongs more to the 19th century age of empires if not the Game of Thrones , Duterte has also exhibited a particularly savvy understanding of regional politics , including the South China Sea disputes ( See my articles for Foreign Affairs and Brookings Institution , inter alia ) . <p> Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements and , not to mention , uncanny media savvy , which allowed Davao 's mayor to stay in the headlines without spending a single penny . But what about Lee Kuan Yew ( LKY ) , the Cambridge-trained prime minister and master strategist , who -- through an odd mixture of high-minded eloquence , technocratic lexicon , and soft authoritarianism -- turned Singapore , historically known as the " Gibraltar of the East " , into a Platonic Republic , a utopia of meritocracy and harmony ? <p> Well , unlike the legendary Singaporean leader , Duterte is n't set to govern a tiny city-state on the intersection of global trading routes . Duterte will , instead , govern a middle-sized democratic nation of hundred million souls , racked by structural overheads such as complex rural-urban divides and massive inequality between the industrialized north and the conflict-ridden south . He confronts a totally different matrix of governance challenges that demand correspondingly distinct policy responses . <p> As Deng Xiaoping -- China 's admirably-humble ' paramount leader ' , who reawakened a sleeping giant after centuries of self-imposed stupor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calibrated market liberalization - crisply reminded his boisterous adviser , Lee Kuan Yew : " If I only had Shanghai , I might be able to change Shanghai just as quickly as you did in Singapore . But I have the whole of China ! " <p> Perhaps , one could argue , Duterte can better learn -- but not necessarily emulate -- from the experiences of other charismatic and democratically-elected leaders , who were also former provincial officials or mayors , say Jokowi of Indonesia , or Narendra Modi of India , not to mention Turkey 's Recep Tayyip Erdogan . <p> There are , however , certain things that Duterte can learn from not only Lee Kuan Yew , but also other visionary Asian leaders who took their nations from the Third World to the First World . What all these successful leaders shared in common was their simultaneous reliance on and empowerment of state institutions , which competently handled the day-to-day challenges of governance and nation-building . <p> What great leaders of the modern age established was what Max Weber , one of Germany 's greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The 21st century , with its dizzying array of policy conundrums , is after all about strong institutions rather than strongmen . It 's about rule of law , rather than the rule of men . Without a robust and capable state , the Philippines stands little chance of upgrading to the next stage of development . Strong State , not Strongmen <p> " Where the bureaucratization of administration has been completely carried through , a form of power relations is established that is practically unshatterable , " Weber wrote in Economy and Society ( Naim 2013 : 42 ) . It is precisely the " iron cage " of bureaucracy , which allows large , complex organisms such as modern societies to achieve internal coherence , maintain order , and rationally pursue collective goals such as national development . <p> One of the most misguided aspects of contemporary debates in development economics is the debate on whether " big " or " small " states or whether " open " or " closed " policies are responsible for the success stories of late-developing countries in Asia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) openness of city-states such as Hong Kong and Singapore , while partisans of developmental statism enthusiastically attribute the success of mid-sized countries like Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan in the middle of the 20th century , and more recently in the case of giant China , to their strategic protectionism , particularly in their early stages of development . <p> What this binary debate tends to miss is the appreciation of the unmistakable commonality among all of Asia 's industrialized states . " Regardless of the degree of government intervention , the fast-growing economies of East Asia share a common feature : they all possess competent , high-capacity states , " Francis Fukuyama ( 2014 : 335 ) brilliantly explains in Political Order and Political Decay . " A capable state is particularly important for activist governments , " Fukuyama explains , during their " catch-up " phase of development . <p> Now contrast Northeast Asian strong states with Southeast Asian strongmen , from Marcos to Suharto and Myanmar 's generals , who , after ravaging their countries for decades under an iron fist , never managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche . At best , especially in the case of Marcos , the country established , over a span of decades , a wide network of basic infrastructure , which was , however , built on the back of crushing foreign debt . Until today , the Philippines is still paying the Marcos-era debt . <p> Aside from the sheer incompetence and the legendary decadence of Southeast Asian dictators , what they lacked , compared to their Confucian counterparts , were precisely the " competent , high capacity states " that Fukuyama sees in the case of China , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Singapore , and Vietnam . <p> The Right Models <p> But as the case of North Korea poignantly shows , bad leadership and wrong-headed policies can turn robust state institutions into a beast of tyranny , something that is not far from the memory of fellow Confucian countries , who had their own share of despotic leaders in the past . In short , the Confucian state is a double-edged sword : it can be deployed for national development , whether via autocratic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " bad emperor . " <p> This is not too dissimilar from the experience of Germany , which , thanks to Frederick the Great ( Friedrich der Gro ? e ) , and his Prussian predecessors , was also able to develop robust state institutions . But the country faced disaster as soon as the kinds of Kaiser Wilhelm II and , even more tragically , Adolf Hitler took over the state institutions . The result was two World Wars that changed human history . <p> From Lee Kuan Yew to Deng Xiaoping , we see examples of good ( but not imperfect and often autocratic ) leaders who showed constant penchant for self-education and ascentism , learned from the best minds , and employed a competent cadre of subordinates , who -- leveraging the vast bureaucratic machine -- deployed a sustained stream of innovative policies geared towards national development . Instead of mindlessly listening to ( self-serving ) foreign or Western-trained advisers , they tried to understand the unique developmental challenges they confronted and dedicated their lives not to narrow interests , whether ethnic or sectoral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they served as true " national " leaders . <p> Nonetheless , Duterte will operate in very different context . First of all , unlike Lee and Deng , Duterte is an elected official , with time-bound mandate , operating within the constitutional framework of a liberal democracy . So , for instance , America 's 20th century experience could prove more instructive . In democratic countries like America , visionary leaders such as Theodore Roosevelt Jr , who busted oligopolies , Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( FDR ) , who introduced the New Deal , and Lyndon Baines Johnson , who build on FDR 's welfare programs in the context of the civil rights movement , were responsible for the empowerment of American bureaucracy and expansion of public services for ordinary citizens . <p> All these leaders also built on Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act ( 1883 ) , which reduced political appointments in favor of meritocracy . And unlike the case of Germany and Confucian states , bureaucratic empowerment in America , Britain and other major democracies did n't undermine public accountability and transparency . So clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crucially , that democratic leaders can also achieve great accomplishments while remaining accountable to the electorate <p> Second , the 20th century provided a significant space for strategic protectionism and strong-minded leadership that is no longer available in today 's globalized world of hyper-connectivity . Trade liberalization regimes , 24-hour television , and citizen-driven journalism , inter alia , present a unique set of constraints on the powers of 21st century state leaders . As keen observers such as Mois ? s Na ? m , in The End of Power , note , power is decaying , diffusing and diminishing in its returns , mainly thanks to advances in information technology , economic globalization , and the emergence of a new array of players on the political chessboard . <p> In today 's world , great leadership is about acknowledging the limits of power and , accordingly , pursuing necessary reforms within the coordinates of possibilities . <p> 21st Century Leadership <p> What about contemporary leaders ? Well , Duterte will be wise to carefully watch the fate of his fellow democratically-elected leaders in India , Indonesia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to constantly wrestle , with varying degrees of success , against the weight of bureaucratic inertia , political opposition , and vested interest . <p> Erdogan , in particular , should serve as a reminder of the risks of the emergence of illiberal democracy in rapidly-developing countries , while Jokowi ' and Modi ' experiences , so far , should serve as a brutal reminder of how weak state institutions can frustrate even the most purposeful and popular leaders . A look at Duterte 's recently-revealed ( prospective ) cabinet evinces the newly-elected president 's likely plan to rely not only on his own political will , but also the competency of seasoned technocrats , trusted friends , and a proportionately large number of individuals with military background . <p> Moving forward , Duterte 's grandiose plans to suppress crime and proliferation of drugs , ameliorate Metro-Manila 's suffocating traffic , and end the conflict in Mindanao will constantly run against the grain of political reality . To achieve his goals , albeit within a more realistic timeframe , he will not only have to use tough language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in the capacity of state institutions . <p> The police forces , for instance , need better compensation , training and equipment to fight against organized crime . The armed forces will have to be also similarly empowered to fight against domestic and external threats -- meaning the Armed Forces of the Philippines modernization should continue and be further upgraded . Such bureaucracy-boosting measures should definitely be extended to other corruption-vulnerable bureaus such as internal revenue , immigration , and customs . <p> Investing in the capacity of the state means more effective delivery of basic services , improved tax collection , and an enhanced business environment , which is crucial for sustained national development . What the Philippines needs is n't a new set of laws , or another autocrat , but instead a competent state , which can actually implement a wide array of existing laws . Similar to Lee Kuan Yew , Duterte can become a good leader by not only inspiring discipline and diligence , but also investing in a meritocratic , clean , and effective state that fulfill its basic functions in an efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@9174235 <h> Popularizing and depoliticizing ... indigenous <p> The paradoxical disposition of the media to instigate public attention lies in its ability to popularize a social phenomenon . However , the popularization of media texts is juxtaposed with the eventual depoliticization of the texts-subjects itself , especially when the formed discourse is indefensibly contextualized in its political and historical nature . <p> In its attempt to reap the popular taste of the audience and occupy locus in the economic and culture industry , the corporate media posture its capital to popularize the intriguing , yet sometimes frivolous , news which often leads to misrepresentation , hence depoliticization of the news subject as in the case of Carrot Man and Badjao Girl . <p> Both the online news and social media platforms of various media outlets put lavish reporting space on the seeming unorthodox looks of an Igorot man and a Badjao/Lumad woman after their " stolen " shots were , by chance , captured and posted on Facebook and Instagram by local tourists . <p> The original photos of the Igorot man carrying a basket of carrots in Bauko , Mountain Province in February 2016 and the Badjao/Lumad woman begging in the streets of Lucban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carrot Man and Badjao Girl , respectively . <p> Thanks to the power of the social media especially of the " millenials " who unwittingly failed to realize the marginalization of the indigenous in terms of political , economic and cultural state . <p> A number of media reports revealed that Carrot Man , Jeyrick Sigmaton , is a 21-year old Igorot vegetable farmer from Monamon Sur , Bauko , Mountain Province . Meanwhile , Badjao Girl , Rita Gabiola , is a 13-year old Badjao and a daughter of a fisherman whose family hailed from Zamboanga , Mindanao . Gabiola 's family was forced to migrate to Manila and now to Lucban , Quezon to look for a sustainable means of living . <p> The media representation of the two marginalized indigenous individuals centered on their not-so-eccentric physical attributes not due to physical peculiarity per se , but simply because of their " indigenousness " and struggling economic and labor position in society . <p> Representation in the media stimulates a public discourse that outlines the critical sentiments of a society . It helps in the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contradictions endured by classes and positions of its peoples .

They are poorly portrayed as powerless sectors that needed to strike attention before the public realize that they indeed exist among us , either in a far-flung or simply unnoticed setting . The intention to provide them with a space in public consciousness is mere superficial as their existence only resonates their physical and sorry state of livelihood features . <p> As a matter of fairness ( though I am still unconvinced by such fact ) , their representation in the corporate media paved way for the provision of opportunities like modelling appearance to Carrot Man and scholarship assistance to Badjao Girl .

He was a shameless self-promoter yet he was profoundly entertaining . He was brash but not off putting like John McEnroe . <p> I 'd like to reiterate Ali 's being an entertainer . About a year after the Thrilla in Manila , Ali engaged professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon ( aka Robert James Marella ) in a " bout " after the latter took care of Mikel Scicluna . Ali tried to pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsoon then picked up the boxer and spun him around several times before slamming him on the mat . Ali had enough after that . No one is sure if that was rigged but whatever . That " bout " was my entry point too into professional wrestling , something I keenly follow to this day . <p> I did get to see him from afar when Ali Mall was inaugurated in 1976 . My father took me to the then-newly opened mall in Cubao . Just to see him ... wow . He was the first celebrity that I ever saw in person . <p> However , more than boxing and pro wrestling , Ali 's social activism got me to understand and know more about social issues . My father taught me that if there was something I did n't know , in order to make an informed opinion , I had to do my research . <p> His conversion to Islam was something I looked into .

Or should you be more broad-minded and understand that not every one is like that and that there are reasons that gave rise to this violent pursuit of political aims ?

He was brash but not off putting like John McEnroe . " Photo by AFP <p> And there was Ali 's refusal to be drafted into the US Army because he said that he did n't have a problem with the Vietcong and it was against his beliefs . That was shocking . I had relatives and friends who served or later would in the US Armed Forces . Or even back home , military service or training ( especially during the era of martial law I grew up in ) was compulsory . Ali spoke out against the Vietnam War even before Martin Luther King ever did . That was bold and helped give rise to the counter-culture of the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I formed back then about understanding before forming an opinion still holds true . <p> In fact , many African-American superstars are measured by their willingness to speak out on a variety of social issues .

That is why people like Ali are a rarity . He said what needed to be said and the heck with anyone who did n't agree . <p> I figure that if Ali was growing up in this day and age of social media , the Louisville Lip would still be just as loquacious and social media-active . <p> Having said that , one of my fondest memories of Ali is that television film , Freedom Road ( and to this very day , I still have that well-thumbed browning novelization of that film ) along with actor , Kris Kristofferson .

Ali , who let his fists -- well , mostly -- do the talking in the ring , chose a more peaceful manner outside the ring . Although in his early years after his conversion to Islam , his statements were explosive and very radical , I guess , we should all be thankful that he chose another road , the one harder to travel . <p> In these past few days , people from everywhere have enumerated his top fights , most quotable quotes , and shared <p> their own personal experiences .

WITH THE Blue Eagles concluding their quest to defend the crown with a decisive finals win over the National University ( NU ) Bulldogs and the Lady Eagles falling short of a much-expected three-peat with a tragic loss to the De La Salle University ( DLSU ) Lady Spikers , the University Athletic Association of the Philippines ( UAAP ) Season 78 Volleyball tournaments ended on a bittersweet note for both defending champions . <p> Despite failing to secure the top spots , both teams maintained a forward-looking mentality through the loss , and viewed the situation as an invaluable opportunity to grow and to rebuild -- a catalyst to rewrite the blueprints to stage another attempt at glory next year . <p> Previous seasons have seen these Eagles take on a Cinderella narrative of improbable runs and miraculous finishes . And although those memories still resonate in this year 's path to their podium finishes , the tale of greater significance has been some of these Eagles ' final flight and the teams ' plans moving forward . <p> Takeoff and landing <p> Having dominated both divisions of the tournament the previous year , the Blue and Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Season 78 began , with both squads aiming to maintain a reputation of superiority by keeping the their titles . <p> In order to ensure that his plan of action would triumph in the long run , Blue Eagles Head Coach Oliver Almadro put into effect a program that targeted both the physical and emotional aspects of the Men 's game , fortifying the team 's well-tested foundation by concentrating greater effort into their conditioning and fundamentals , while still building a winning attitude throughout his squad . The multi-titled coach also sought to develop the team 's dynamic in the preseason by instilling a positive mindset among his wards , keeping them motivated , grounded , and dependent on each other as they underwent the ups and downs of another shot at the gold . <p> Trust and camaraderie were of utmost value to Almadro 's coaching philosophy , as he believes that , although individual awards can single out players and undervalue team success , mutual reliance on the court founded on teamwork and family remains the key to victory . " Positive thinking is equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that they were worthy of their own achievements so the mindset that was important was trust and that no brother would be left behind . " <p> The Lady Eagles , on the other hand , faced a different struggle entering Season 78 . According to Assistant Coach Timmy Sto . Tomas , the key losses of two graduating stars from the previous year 's championship squad was one of the biggest setbacks the Blue and White faced . The absence of Ella de Jesus and Season 77 's Best Receiver Dennise Lazaro was a hurdle that the team aimed to overcome in their defense of the crown , with the on-court presence of mainstays Alyssa Valdez , Amy Ahomiro , and Bea de Leon stepping up in place of the graduating seniors . <p> " Players come and go , and there 's always the need to find a way to fill the spaces left behind , " shares Sto . Tomas .

Fortunately , rookie setter Lawrence Gil Magadia was able to deliver beyond expectations in the absence of the benched Santos , while commanding displays by veterans Ish Polvoroza and Marck Espejo helped fuel the Eagles ' reclamation of the gold . <p> Meanwhile , the Lady Eagles were hampered by the unexpected resurgence of their rivals and were handed two consecutive defeats by the University of the Philippines ( UP ) and the DLSU Lady Spikers early in first round , foreshadowing the route that the team would later take in the seedings of the Final Four .

According to Sto . Tomas , with the reigning three-time Most Valuable Player Valdez out of playing years , the need to improve as individuals and to play as a cohesive unit is greater than ever among the remaining members of the team , who will be operating without their primary outside hitter for the first time in five seasons . <p> " I think everyone should just step up , " admits Sto .

" Right now , I want my second stringers to realize that they have to step up for next year , " explains Almadro . " They must accept the challenge and the hardships that come along with it . " <p> As the journey draws to a dramatic close , a drastic change is sure to come for the Blue and Lady Eagles . The community of players , students , and fans will be bidding farewell to a decorated crop of spikers whose accomplishments rise well beyond the net . This graduating batch of athletes have not only garnered trophies , titles , and victories in the school 's name , but have strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and eminence for both institution and sport . <p> The departure of these veterans creates an unfathomable absence on the court and leaves behind quite a big pair of shoes to be filled . However , the greater challenge that lies ahead is the legacy to be carried on . Indeed , their last term of service sporting the name of the school marks the end of a golden era , but where one story ends , another begins . Although a few Eagles may have retired their wings , their comrades are ready to resume the flight and get the game soaring into new frontiers .

@@9924232 01:56 PM <p> Phil Mickelson of the United States , right , shakes hands with Henrik Stenson of Sweden , on the 18th green after they completed their third round of the British Open Golf Championships at the Royal Troon Golf Club in Troon , Scotland . AP <p> TROON , Scotland -- Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson delivered what everyone expects out of a major championship . <p> They matched birdies and improbable par saves . Momentum could change with any shot . The lead changed four times over four hours of golf at its highest level , played in the cold wind and occasional rain off the Irish Sea . All the British Open lacked Saturday ( Sunday Manila time ) was a winner . <p> Turns out this was only the preview to a duel at Royal Troon . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Stenson took the lead for the last time with another two-shot swing on an inward par 3 , and he kept it with a nifty up-and-down on the 18th for par and a 3-under 68 , the second straight day that no one had a better score . <p> That gave the 40-year-old Swede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just one shot over someone who already has five majors and his name on the claret jug . <p> " There 's only one thing that matters tomorrow , " Stenson said . " I know he 's not going to back down , and I 'm certainly going to try to not back down , either . So it should be an exciting afternoon . I 've worked hard these first three days to put myself in this situation and I 'm going to try my hardest tomorrow to finish the job . " <p> Links golf can deliver some strange finishes , though this had all the trappings of a two-man race on Sunday ( Monday Manila time ) . <p> Stenson had his third straight round in the 60s -- no one has ever won at Royal Troon with all four rounds in the 60s -- and was at 12-under 201 . He is trying to become only the eighth player dating to Old Tom Morris in 1861 to win his first major after turning 40 . <p> Mickelson , winless since he lifted golf 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 . His game was nowhere near as sharp as his opening-round 63 that tied a major championship record . Even so , he came up with the rights shots at the right time until Stenson passed him late in the afternoon . <p> " Some days it 's easy and it looks pretty like the first couple , " Mickelson said . " Some days it 's hard and it looks terrible , like it did today . But either way , I shot three rounds under par . " <p> He made a 25-foot birdie putt on the 13th hole for a two-shot lead . Stenson answered with a 5-iron to 6 feet for birdie on the next hole to tie for the lead when Mickelson three-putted , only his third bogey of the week . <p> Mickelson regained the lead with a pitch to 4 feet for birdie on the par-5 16th , only for the Swede to answer again , this time with an all-out 3-iron into the wind on the 220-yard 17th hole to 20 feet . Mickelson lost the lead by missing the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like mere spectators . <p> Bill Haas , a six-time winner on the PGA Tour who is rarely heard from at majors , was solid with a 69 and alone in third . It 's his highest position ever in a major , yet he was six shots off the lead . Another shot back was Andrew Johnston , the Englishman with a big belly and beard to match who goes by " Beef . " He broke par for the third straight day with a 70 . <p> It was unlikely to matter . <p> This was all about Stenson and Mickelson , two powerful players with different styles and different credentials , mainly the number of majors -- five for Mickelson , none for Stenson . Mickelson spoke earlier in the week about not having as much pressure knowing he already has won them . <p> Not since Davis Love III and Justin Leonard shared the lead and were seven shots clear of the field in the 1997 PGA Championship has the final round of a major took on the appearance of match play . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the par 3s and pick up two shots on either one of them to come back out on top at the end of the third round , " Stenson said . " I 've always been of the thought that it 's better to be one ahead than one behind , because that means Phil 's got to play better than I do . " <p> Mickelson finished three shots ahead of Stenson three years ago at Muirfield when Lefty closed with a 66 in one of the best final rounds of a major . He has n't won another tournament since , and at age 46 , it appeared time was running out . <p> A victory would give him six majors , same as Nick Faldo and Lee Trevino . He also would be the third-oldest major champion behind Julius Boros ( 48 ) and Morris , with whom Mickelson shares a birthday -- June 16 , albeit 149 years apart . The 1861 Open was played in September . <p> Stenson was on the verge of falling two shots behind until he holed a 40-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickelson was in danger of losing the lead when he pushed his 2-iron toward trouble and was fortunate the ball deflected off a piece of prickly gorse . He had just enough room to hammer it up the fairway , and then played a shot rarely seen in links golf -- instead of running it up along the ground , he spun it back down a ridge to 6 feet for a key par . <p> " I got lucky that that ball did n't go into the gorse , even though I did n't have a back swing , " Mickelson said . " I still had a chance to advance it a little bit . I still hit a good shot to advance it down the fairway like I did , and found a way to get up and down . "

@@9935231 <h> PEACETALK : Should ... really be contingent on the BBL ? <p> We are all aware of how the longstanding armed conflict in Muslim Mindanao has brought immeasurable grief to Filipino Muslims and Lumads alike . <p> What is more painful about this tragedy is that the overwhelming majority of our compatriots in that region share no appetite for combat at all . For this precise reason , the peace-building effort deserves the nation 's complete and fervent support . <p> And the foremost requirement for peace in Muslim Mindanao should be the official government recognition of accountability for the large-scale and indiscriminate immigration of Filipinos from Luzon and the Visayas to Mindanao . <p> There should no longer be any doubt that the marginalization of Filipino Muslims and Lumads in their own traditional lands was a direct result of this state action . And this fact must now be properly set in stone . Hence , as head of state , President Rodrigo Duterte can convey this official acknowledgment in his first State of the Nation Address ( SONA ) . <p> I must note that the act of a government to recognize a profound shortcoming is not without precedent . Successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different reasons within the last decade . <p> On February 13 , 2008 , then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd conveyed during a special session of the Australian Parliament an apology to Aboriginal Australians for discriminatory acts perpetuated against them by past governments . Another former prime minister , Julia Gillard , issued a formal apology last March 21 , 2013 to the victims of forced adoptions implemented by the government in the 1950s . <p> Since these apologies were made , I believe the vast majority of the Australian public have become more conscious of their responsibility to repair the damage caused by these unjust government acts . In fact , I have personally heard Aboriginal Australian elders laud Rudd 's official recognition of the injustices committed against the indigenous peoples of Australia as a good start to the reconciliation movement . <p> But I claim no historical parallelism here . Rather I would simply like to highlight the optimism that a similar state action could also enhance the healing process in Mindanao . <p> Moreover , concomitant to this official recognition , the President must also unequivocally express in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reconciliation Commission will proceed completely unhindered . This commitment must be made because addressing the historical injustices and human rights violations committed against Muslim and Lumad communities is integral to establishing peace in the region . <p> There should be no sacred cows or cover-ups . And as I have written elsewhere , reparation and restoration for the communities ravaged by the fighting should not simply be treated as an ideal to aspire for . As an indispensable condition for lasting peace , this pursuit for justice must translate to tangible remedial actions at the grassroots level . <p> Lastly , the demands of sustainable peace also behooves the President to heed the suggestion of the eminent academic from Ateneo de Davao University , Mussolini Sinsuat Lidasan , that education must play a big role in explaining the real story of the Mindanao crisis . <p> I remember Professor Muss narrating a story about a trip to Iloilo where high school teachers actually still believe the propaganda version of Muslim history in Mindanao . Therefore , an essential component of the official recognition proposed here must be a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational institutions to include the real history of Muslim Mindanao in its curriculum . <p> Peace in Muslim Mindanao is paramount . Justice for Filipino Muslims and Lumads is equally paramount as well . Therefore , it is absolutely imperative that Filipino youths from Batanes to Jolo form a clearer and more accurate comprehension of the crisis in Muslim Mindanao . After all , they will be the keepers of the peace we are all working for . <p> This is not to say that the Bangsamoro Basic Law ( BBL ) can now be set aside . Indeed , I truly believe that the BBL is immensely so important that its enactment must not be limited by self-serving political interests and an unrealistic deadline . <p> If the BBL , or any other regional autonomy statute for that matter , is to be a truly organic piece of legislation , then it must emanate from the very people who will be responsible for making it work and as determined by their own nuances and needs . The outcome in this regard may prove to be more beneficial to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawmakers from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) can revisit Sections 1-3 of Article V of the BBL on the creation of the category of Concurrent Powers because this directly contravenes Article X of the Constitution . <p> The division of powers allowed by Article X pertains only to the exclusive powers of the regional government , the scope of which is articulated in Section 20 . And to the residual powers of the national government under Section 17 which states that all powers , functions , and responsibilities not granted by this Constitution or by law to the autonomous regions shall be vested in the national government . Simply put , the Constitution does not sanction the sharing of powers by the national and regional governments . <p> Curiously , many of the state functions listed under the classification Concurrent Powers should actually be under the Excusive Powers of the contemplated Bangsamoro regional government . <p> Therefore , ARMM legislators should consider transferring more powers to the projected regional government as this would be more aligned with Article X , particularly Section 20(9) which empowers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be authorized by law for the promotion of the general welfare of the people of the region . " <p> In sum , peace in Muslim Mindanao and genuine and meaningful autonomy for Filipinos in this region are two deeply connected yet plainly distinct cardinal pursuits . Needless to say , we must all ensure both goals are achieved sooner rather than later . But hopefully , I have shown here that both undertakings can be pursued simultaneously but separately .

All those noisy firecrackers are as much to welcome the coming year as to send off the old year . With the new year , we get a fresh start . We forget the sad stories of the past year as we hope for a better year ahead . <p> Take the stock market for instance . It took record highs and disturbing lows last year .

Perhaps at the back of their minds they nurture that fear , but in public , we can only hear them tell us how great our country 's macroeconomic fundamentals are and how we are most likely to ride out any economic turbulence in our future . <p> We have other reasons for hope in the coming year .

In the past , vote buying was at the retail level of the voter . Now , with computerized election , the scuttlebutt is that the election can be bought wholesale with little or no trickle down effect to the masa . <p> Also , a large part of campaign expenses now go to established media channels , mainly television , with every 30 second spot costing at least half a million pesos . How much of media revenues eventually get recycled locally to fuel consumer expenditure is a hopeful guess . <p> Still , the fact that we are having an election is in itself good news that justifies hope in the new year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand , electing our top leaders is something we should be proud of . <p> Who that new president will be is still a question mark .

It could be the end of teka teka unless Mar Roxas wins . <p> Also good reasons for hope are new projects that impact on our traffic problem may get completed this year . The NAIA Expressway should be ready by the end of the year . Portions of the NLEX-SLEX connector road of San Miguel may also be opened to the public . <p> In other infrastructure , the Caticlan airport is now ready to accept Airbus 320 flights , as it is now only waiting for CAAP to complete its certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is also the prospect of night flights as the airport is now capable for this .

This may just be the disruption we need to improve Internet service in the country . <p> Indeed , our country 's many problems aside , it would be foolish to sell the country short at this time . We Filipinos are hopeful about the new year because we somehow manage to meet whatever heavy challenges come our way each year . <p> Sometimes , I wonder if this very resilience of the Filipino is being abused by our leaders .

@@10000239 <h> The forgotten generation <p> Since the 1980s , being half Filipino , half foreign has become a premium in Philippine sports . Though historically , there had been hybrid Filipino athletes representing national teams before , it was only after the ' 80s that they started to become commodified . In basketball , there is obviously an abundance of Filipino-Americans . This trend took a big upswing in the late 1990s , when the Metropolitan Basketball Association allowed each team to have a maximum of two Fil-Am players . Afterwards , the PBA announced that it would allow an unlimited number of Filipino-foreign players per team . We all know that this eventually created a gap with ordinary fans , who could not aspire to be 6 ' 9 " behemoths playing professional basketball . <p> Since then , several pro basketball and national teams in other sports have recruited players who have one parent ( predominantly the father ) from Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , the United Kingdom , Australia , Sweden , Switzerland , Africa and a few other territories . The belief is that size , endurance , training and predisposition give these offspring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone agrees , and schools in the NCAA and UAAP have been wrestling with the issue of even allowing foreign student-athletes onto their varsity teams for the last decade . It is , putting it mildly , a ticklish issue . <p> But there is a forgotten sector of Philippine society that could have filled in a void in this regard , a wasted resource , as it were . There is an entire generation of half-Filipinos who have been neglected in their own country , unable to get fair treatment , growing up victims of abuse , and , all told , being neglected by the government . Estimates originally ranged from 200,000 to well over 300,000 of these marginalized in their own country . But reports from as recent as 2012 suggest there could be up to five times as many of these undocumented children of American servicemen . They are the Amerasians , derogatorily better known in some sectors as " G.I. babies " . In Vietnam , they are better known as " dust of the earth " and are treated accordingly . <p> Almost half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck ( " The Grapes of Wrath " ) noticed a disturbing trend . In countries that hosted US military bases , servicemen were constantly leaving behind pregnant women or unwanted children . Worldwide , these unrecognized Americans have grown in number to the tens of millions over more than 70 years . They are ostracized , treated as a burden , and are a reminder of the untrue promises of US citizenship and a better life . Many of their mothers believed a concocted fantasy used to gain sexual liaisons . That is why many of the mothers abandon their children or treat them badly . <p> In many sports , being African-American is considered a genetic superiority . Unfortunately , in the case of Amerasians , it is quite the opposite . They are insulted , branded as inferior , even beaten . Imagine if their natural abilities were harnessed , instead . They would have powered many of our country 's national teams and catapulted us to world contender status in many sports . The Caucasian or light-skinned children , for their part , are used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent scouts and become singer or actors , as being mestizo is in high demand . But since most of them grow up in poor backgrounds which caused their mothers to desperately cling on to empty promises of leaving the country in the first place , the greater likelihood is that they end up bar girls or prostitutes . <p> The Pearl S. Buck Foundation ( PSBF ) Philippines has been a lonely vanguard trying to give these abandoned children a better life , finding their strengths , and trying to build on them . With offices stretched thinly over Manila , Cebu , Olongapo , Pampanga and Leyte , the foundation has been seeking sponsors and donors for decades , trying to assist with the studies and social welfare needs of these children . But , in the final reckoning , the PSBF has been hard-pressed to even meet the needs of a quarter of them .

Now , almost a quarter of a century later , they face a new problem . Age and illness are catching up with them . And without knowledge of their paternal health histories , their illnesses and allergies are much more difficult to treat . Neither do they get any support as dependents of past or present US military personnel . A few this writer knows have been tremendously fortunate to have contacted their fathers and receive recognition , but they would be in the very small minority .

In just six remaining months of the bungling administration , he must solve the shameful years-long backlog of vehicle license plates . The problem is " ripe , " but not as Cabrera likens it to " fruit ready for the picking . " It 's a bomb about to burst . His boss Transport Sec . Joseph Abaya had lit the fuse in hiring an unqualified maker of " tamper-proof " metal plates . The local principal , a mere backyard operation , is banned from government contracting due to forgery . The Dutch " technology partner " is undercapitalized . They simply have no capacity to fabricate 20 million four-wheeled vehicle and motorcycle tins . Abaya 's sin is catching up with him . The former LTO head left in a huff during the Christmas holidays , having had enough of covering up for Abaya . The latter must think putting in a new guy would get him off the hook . <p> It 's worth reading between the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , among others , would help him . Hmm , does that mean President Noynoy Aquino knows the cause ? Surely word has penetrated P-Noy 's cordon sanitaire that the LTO is unable to issue vehicle plates , aside from driver licenses . Vehicle owners and drivers have been getting nothing for the registration fees they are made to pay . Even lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Party , of which Aquino is chairman and Abaya is president , cry " rip-off . " But does P-Noy know that one ca n't get good work from bad men , as one can not squeeze blood from a turnip ? If he has n't heard of Abaya 's P3.8-billion vehicle plate scam , then he must be dumb . If he knows yet retains Abaya , then he must be part of the scam . <p> Irate vehicle owners and drivers will be placated with " Band-aid solutions .

Everybody must grin and bear it as criminals run roughshod in plate-less getaway cars of undocumented drivers . <p> Abaya 's sins are catching up with him as well in railways , airports , and seaports . <p> The MRT-3 commuter rail is forced to accept engine-less coaches from the inexpert Chinese that Abaya contracted . The deal , P3.8 billion like the vehicle plate scam , is for 48 running units . But for reasons known only to Abaya , the arriving coaches are mere shells . <p> Engine-less , the prototypes had not been test-run for 5,000 km , for operability and safety , as the contract states .

Tests are supposed to be at 45-65 kph on varying curves and slopes . Yet the MRT-3 trains can run only 10-35 kph on the rundown tracks . He intends to do it at night . That would leave no time for the MRT-3 even cursorily to inspect the tracks for cracks during off hours . Expect more accidents and breakdowns . <p> The sin at PH Trams easily had caught up with Abaya . The fledgling LP front partnered with CB&amp;T , longtime maintenance servicer of LRT-1 , to bag the $1.15-million monthly MRT-3 budget . Two months after the forced marriage , it was on the rocks , the CB&amp;T president told The STAR . PH Trams could not supply the spare parts to CB&amp;T 's manpower . Abaya replaced it with the same LP mates ' Global Epcom , in tandem with APT Global , the LRT-2 maintenance firm . Same problem , Epcom had no money for parts .

Hmm , he must find that number lucky . <p> At LRT-1 Abaya 's ineptitude has shown too . As 2015 came to a close the press reminded P-Noy of a promise to extend the railway into Cavite by then , or else have himself and Abaya run over by trains . The Press Secretary had to beg to not take all of P-Noy 's words literally -- which provoked questions on what other presidential avowals must be ignored . <p> At LRT-2 the extension of a mere four km has just begun . This was five years after P-Noy became President , and vowed to make the country First World . <p> The multiple rail mess has worsened traffic and misery of Mega Manilans . Related is congestion at the Port of Manila .

From the start to the end we all were caught up in the never-ending storm of competitively best comebacks and debuts . However , for me the SURPRISE of the past year is , RETURN OF B.A.P ! So I decided to pick them as my best of 2015 . <p> Let 's have a look back . <p> B.A.P was on hiatus for an undecided period upon legal issues they had with their agency , TS Entertainment . Since the announcement of filing a lawsuit against the agency to nullify their contract , seeing the group back on stage any soon was just a distant light of hope . <p> Finally , long rooted wishes of B.A.P fans ( BABYs ) started blooming through their faith kept on their beloved artist , with the official statement made by TS Entertainment on B.A.P 's Official Facebook page , on the 3rd of August . Agency stated , " B.A.P returned to TS Entertainment on August 1st 2015 " , together with a long message apologizing to the fans and a promise to be responsible about B.A.P 's future and to bring their good music . <p> Later , on October 5th , B.A.P surprised fans , announcing about their comeback , which was going to happen after one year and nine months , spreading an unlimited excitement to every nook and corner , posting a teaser image of a spaceship arriving to the planet . They confirmed their comeback show case to 15th November , 2015 . <p> Since then , keeping enough time gaps for the fans to breathe they started releasing the rest of the teaser images with a concept of cute Matoki characters , for the comeback album titled , ' Matrix , ' which literally meant ' the base which an individual or a society can grow from ' . Taking it to another level , they released audio teasers of each member for each track . Preparations were done well . <p> On 15th November , with a showcase held for exclusive number of fans -- lucky ones I must say , who were given free passes to the show , B.A.P made their official comeback . B.A.P ensured the rest of their fans are never disappointed by airing the showcase live on their official V Channel . <p> The same day midnight ( 00:00 KST , 16th November ) , they officially released the music video for title track of the album , ' Young Wild and Free , ' and the album , ' Matrix . ' It was really a celebration for both fans and the group as for being back on the stage , stable , stronger and happy was indeed a dream coming true . <p> The album was so much like a gift for fans . It was focused on younger generation with important messages . Leader , Bang Yong-guk was fully involved in writing lyrics and composing the album , and the story of Matrix was inspired by their own story , which they experienced when they were on hiatus . <p> B.A.P debuted on 26th January , 2012 with the track ' Warrior ' , which debuted at 10th place on Billboard 's World Album Chart in February the same year , and sold over 10 , 000 copies within two days since release . Same year they released their next album , ' Power ' . <p> In February , 2014 group 's first full length album , ' First Sensibility , ' of which the title track was , ' Angel 1004 , ' was released . It was again a hit topping various charts . Although in June , the same year , they released another single album titled , ' Where are you ? ' it was never promoted , making ' First Sensibility ' the last album before the long break . <p> The group consists of six members . It started with the leader Bang Yong-guk , who had already made his solo debut with the single , ' I Remember , ' featuring Yang Yo-seob of BEAST , in August , 2011 . An Ulzzang multi instrumalist , Kim Him-chan was the second to be introduced , whilst Choi Jun-hong was introduced next as Zelo . Jung Dae-hyun , Yoo Young-jae and Moon Jong-up followed to join the group to debut as Best Absolute Perfect , B.A.P. <p> Bang Yong-guk ( leader ) <p> Kim Him-chan <p> Choi Jun-hong ( Zelo ) <p> Jung Dae-hyun <p> Yoon Young-jae <p> Moon Jong-up <p> Every one of us pass through rough roads at least once . What matters is how we rise up . With all good and bad memories , B.A.P is finally back in action and ready to continue their show on the Korean music floor . <p> B.A.P always has been a fabulous boy group . Although it is a rookie group , their music has been absolutely perfect since the very beginning . In my opinion B.A.P wrote the best memory of the year 2015 . I 'm sure you agree with me too . <p> Let 's patiently wait to see what these boys will bring us in this year and keep on loving and supporting them . <p> Min here . A die hard Kpop fan .

@@10037231 <h> Batuhan : A deadly romance <h> Batuhan : A deadly romance <p> AS I write this piece , I am watching a replay of United States President Barrack Obama 's Town Hall , on the subject of gun control . Coming on the heels of the horrific attacks in Paris , as well as the homegrown terror outrage in San Bernardino , California , his appeal to the American people is to put more stringent controls around the acquisition and ownership of firearms , in order to stem the supply of deadly weapons on America 's streets and neighborhoods . <p> Put in context , America has an estimated 300 million firearms in circulation , enough to arm every man , woman and child in the country . This does not even include weapons belonging to the military , the police and the state national guards . These are just the ones belonging to private owners . <p> Gun ownership is a very emotional and controversial subject for Americans . Unlike any other written constitution in the world , the Americans enshrine the right to bear arms , in the form of the Second Amendment . Written at a time when America was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside , and lawless elements from the inside -- the provision made sense then . It was the concept of a " citizens militia " to protect the independence of the nation , which motivated the amendment . <p> Fast forward over two hundred years hence , and the provision is still in place -- stronger than ever . Protected by lobbies such as the National Rifle Association , and political organizations like the Republican National Congress , it is considered an untouchable right and something that can never , ever be taken away . Then , as now , Americans consider their right to arm themselves to be an integral part of their freedom , and therefore one that they will fight tooth and nail to keep ( or rifles and pistols to keep , more appropriately ) . <p> Possibly , a sense of reality check is in order . The United States is the most powerful nation in the world . Its armed forces bristle with the latest weaponry , including nuclear missiles that could destroy the world many times over . It is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone enemy aircraft . It has modern police forces trained in the latest law enforcement techniques , and equipped with the most modern weaponry . The individual states have their own national guards that they can call on in the event of any emergency . Safety and law and order in today 's America is as far removed from the days of the invading British forces and the outlaws of the Wild West as the frontier musket is from the modern AR-15 assault rifle . Arguably , the American citizen is infinitely safer today in the streets of Anytown USA , as he is in his own home . But still , they insist on bearing arms for protection . <p> The thing is , the proliferation of weapons in the country , rather than keeping the nation safe , is just playing into the hands of the very elements who wish to do the Americans harm . Firearms are so easy to come by that terrorists -- such as the ones in San Bernardino -- could easily accumulate a stash of them to perpetrate their heinous crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage kids are subjected to the constant terror of guns , no thanks to the endless supply of weapons that are so easy to come by . <p> So what is a president to do ? Barrack Obama knows that his legacy will be defined by what he does to try to curb his country 's love for guns . But he is up against a formidable challenge that no president before him has ever accomplished . Long removed from their wild frontier beginnings , the American people have a romantic attraction to firearms that seems impossible to extinguish . It is , however , a deadly romance that sooner or later they will have to get over with , if they are to stay safer as a nation . <p> ( **32;364;TOOLONG &amp; twitter.com/asbbatuhan ) <p> Published in the Sun.Star Cebu newspaper on January 09 , 2016 . <p> Latest issues of Sun.Star Cebu also available on your mobile phones , laptops , and tablets .

Jacobson says that carbon dioxide or CO2 makes up 42 percent of the warming problem alone , and the simple fact that trees help abate this by taking in CO2 and releasing oxygen or O2 makes tree-planting activities all the more important . <p> By growing and protecting " greenhouse sinks " such as forests and reducing and abating " greenhouse sources " such as oil and coal we can bring ourselves closer to a world with less air pollution and reduced conflicts due to scarcity of resources . <p> But the journey to bringing back our forests and tackling the challenge of oil and coal dependence has just begun . In 2005 the ROAD to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippines started , bringing together individuals , governments , and companies to bring back forests in the country using rainforestation technology , or the use of native tree species in reforestation projects . <p> Meanwhile , Leody de Guzman of the Power for People Coalition ( P4P ) cites that current Philippine energy policy unveils an " approval of 59 coal power plants and 118 mining permits under the Aquino administration . " <p> Much indeed has yet to be done , but before we can enjoy lush green forests , solar-powered transport and harmony between humanity and climate , we must protect and expand today the army of floral biodiversity that has always fed and protected human civilizations since its dawn through the following ways : <p> 1 ) Continue the ongoing effort to bring back our forests , our natural sinks of greenhouse gas carbon . According to a study published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Management in 2008 , if 1 million hectares of forest are brought back , these areas have the potential to sequester almost 15 percent of annual carbon emissions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Community-based Resource Management ( CBRM ) to empower people to restore and protect their forests . Rainforestation work in Sitio Palbong in Mindoro for example has not only brought back 12 hectares of native tree species , but has also transformed a once extractive community into one that has led the rehabilitation and protection of its own forest domain . This has been repeated in more than 60 communities in the country , restoring more than 1,500 hectares so far via the ROAD to 2020 movement . <p> 3 ) Pass the Forest Resources Bill to protect all existing original forest that we have left and bring back our rainforests . To date only 24 percent of our original forest remain ( DENR , 2010 ) . Haribon Chief Operating Officer Maria Belinda de la Paz further notes that " we need 54 percent forest cover to maintain ecological processes in the country . Aside from energy conservation , there is an urgent need to bring back our forests in order to minimize the effects of climate change . " <p> 4 ) Protect and maintain the remaining coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected areas and marine protected area networks . These include the mangroves , seagrass beds , coral reefs and soft bottom communities . These ' blue carbon ' habitats absorb and store 50 to 71 percent carbon and other greenhouse gases . Covering only 0.5 percent of the seafloor , they play a very big role in world 's climate and mitigating the effects of climate change . According to a 2013 study by Gevana et al . the total carbon stock of the current seagrass cover in the Philippines of 27,282 hectares may contain an estimated 161 metric tons of carbon . For mangrove forests in the Philippines 115.45 t C ha-1 to as high as 1306. 9 t C ha-1 ( Geva ? a and Pampolina 2009 , Camacho et al . 2011 ; Abino et al . 2014 ) . <p> Starting with the pioneering efforts of the Siliman University in establishing the Apo Island Marine Reserve in Dumaguete , the number of MPAs has been steadily increasing , 455 in 1995 , 688 in 2000 and 1785 as of December 2015 . This has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , non-government organizations , academe and the numerous peoples organizations . <p> 5 ) Support conservation research initiatives to learn more about our biodiversity and the impacts of climate change . <p> The knowledge , resources , abilities and even the technologies are available today to curb the adverse affects of human-induced climate change by the deadlines set by the entire world . <p> Conservation efforts , rainforestation technology , and community-building strategies conducted in the Philippines within the last four decades alone might just be enough to create the change needed on this side of the Pacific . The ROAD to 2020 movement , backed by sound science from the Haribon Foundation and the Rain Forest Restoration Initiative ( RFRI ) , has long developed strategies such as community-based native tree nurseries , and has advocated that a forest is more than just a collection of trees : it is an ecosystem that requires requires protection from national government . The roots to a safe world have long been laid . The question is , can we finally move together to grow toward a safer climate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 1 million hectares of forest , enroll your rainforestation project or Adopt-A-Seedling , Nurture-A-Seedling or plant trees with the Haribon Foundation . <h> 2 Responses to Forests are key to solving climate change <p> The only way for forests to alleviate global warming is for trees to be planted at a rate to absorb CO2 at the same rate as fossils are being burned . The primary reason is not the absorption of CO2 per se , but the fact that for every pound of CO2 converted to forests by photosynthesis , 4800 btus of solar energy are removed that otherwise would become heat . Heat emissions from energy use is a much greater contributor than CO2 , to global warming . <p> Thanks Philip . Whether heat emissions or CO2 is more or less of a contributor to global warming , this is certain : they both contribute to it . And forests do help abate the heating in more ways than one , as communicated in your comment . Thanks for that . <p> Although our article is heavy on the forest argument , we do mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jacobson , as mentioned in the above article , says CO2 makes up 42 percent of the warming problem . <p> I agree , trees would have to absorb CO2 at the same rate as fossil fuels are being burned . To help alleviate the heating , we must also increase our dependence on renewable energy , and less on fossil fuel energy . That way , we help forests do what they do so well . <p> Your email address will not be published .

Balikbayan #1 Memories of Overdevelopment Redux III <p> Director : Kidlat Tahimik <p> The journey of Kidlat Tahimik 's Balikbayan #1 Memories of Overdevelopment Redux IIIis an admirable story of perseverance . What started out as a film about the adventures of Enrique , the first person to circumnavigate the world , mutates into something completely different , something absolutely bizarre and wonderful . As its offbeat title suggests , the film is a monster that is stitched from all the remnants of Kidlat Tahimik 's illustrious career . The original Memories of Overdevelopment , originally a short film that has the filmmaker narrating what could have been the feature length film about Enrique over footage , is framed within the story of a man who is searching for a mysterious man he met on the beach . The not-so-traditional narrative gives way to performance art . It all works marvelously , resulting in a film that serves as a valedictory for one of the world 's most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director : Erik Matti <p> While On the Job , its thematic predecessor , has codes of action films to sustain being an adroit piece of entertainment despite its grave explorations , Honor Thy Father is austere and almost humorless . It consistently carries a severe tone of desolation from start to finish , badgering its protagonist , played with adamant conviction by matinee idol John Lloyd Cruz , with a barrage of conflicts that put him in an overwhelming state of despair . Its unflinching depiction of a world where all men differ only in the gravity of their sinfulness can only shock and batter the senses up to the point of absolute fear , not for the fate of the father whose only wish is to protect his daughter , but for this nation , whose state is n't that different from the fictionalized one the film is set in . <p> 3 . Salvage <p> Director : Sherad Anthony Sanchez <p> The pleasures of Sherad Anthony Sanchez 's Salvage are apparent . It is first and foremost a horror film , one that sufficiently uses almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scares . The film also operates in a different level . By pitting a television crew with the unknown dangers of Mindanao , it probes on the abject cluelessness of imperialist Manila with the affairs of the South they only know of from sensationalized news . Sanchez 's film is bewildering because it can only aspire to be strange and unusual as it works best when it puts its viewers in the same position as its characters who dared to invade territories their egos do not allow them to comprehend . <p> 4 . Dayang Asu <p> Director : Bor Ocampo <p> Dayang Asu paints a very bleak portrait of a country thriving in corruption . The anger and frustration director Bor Ocampo harbors for a culture that ca n't seem to separate itself from evil is felt in every frame , even the ones that have been painstakingly designed by cinematographer Albert Banzon to evoke a strange gleam of elegance that is rare in films that exploit a world drowning in amorality . The film examines the connections between top-tier criminality and everything else below , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of sin is as impressive as it is frightening . <p> 5 . Imbisibol <p> Director : Lawrence Fajardo <p> Everything is veiled in snow in Lawrence Fajardo 's Imbisibol . The film expands Herlyn Gail Alegre 's one-act play to further tackle the lives of various Filipinos living and working in Japan but are now in danger of being deported because of new legislation . Fajardo and screenwriter John Bedia enlarge the characters , giving them stories that mold their humanity by magnifying their harsh imperfections . In the end , the film becomes a multi-faceted exploration of men and women who are forced to act in the face of self-preservation . Nationality and culture are thrown out the window , and everything is at once local and universal , because in this world that prospers in practicality , you can only be allied to yourself . <p> 6 . Kapatiran <p> Director : Pepe Diokno <p> The connections between the various sounds and images of Pepe Diokno 's Kapatiran are more imagined than real . The film , which starts out with a lo-fi video of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes featuring fraternity initiations , poverty , government corruption , bored rich kids , and other random events , only makes sense with the help of one 's own fiction . Perhaps Diokno 's goal was to discredit the fraternities that he originally chose to depict as organizations whose connections are as fleeting as his visuals are . However , the film 's ambitions are greater . His target is a nation and its inexplicable chaos , and by stringing everything that is tainted in the metropolis , Diokno has assembled a narrative of disarray that is but apt . <p> 7 . Apocalypse Child <p> Director : Mario Cornejo <p> Mario Cornejo 's Apocalypse Child is a film about myths and the events that shatter them . The titular character , a grown man who as a child was led to believe that his father is a Hollywood director , is in between various loves and friendships . Everything feels transient . Even Cornejo 's direction is bolstered by the way it treats its narrative with the same level of commitment its characters treat each other . The film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the characters who chose to become tangled in life 's foolish game getting irrevocably devastated . Things cohere , and one ca n't help but be at awe at what Cornejo has achieved -- a film as personal as it is grand . <p> 8 . Manang Biring <p> Director : Carl Papa <p> Carl Papa 's Manang Biring is a feat of artistic integrity . The film , which plots the final few months of a cancer-stricken woman , is one that could have done away with the painstaking process of being animated . Papa nevertheless commits to his ambition , proving that it is not one borne out of creative whim but of principle . The world of Papa 's film is one that is purposely deprived of color , perhaps to evoke the monotony of life that only leads to certain death . Yet when the woman who cheats for a living is given news that forces her to first , attempt to cheat death , and later on , herself , to give happiness to someone dear to her , the film pops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impossible if the entire thing was done in a traditional manner . <p> 9 . Sleepless <p> Director : Prime Cruz <p> Prime Cruz 's Sleepless is n't a romance , although it is draped with similar grooves and intentions . It is essentially a vigorous portrait of a city in a perpetual state of wakefulness . It focuses on the lives of two insomniacs who start out as co-employees and end up as each other 's could-have-beens . It aches as much as it delights . However , it is the call-center setting , aptly stylized by Cruz and screenwriter Jen Chuaunsu without losing its relevant social context , which gives the story of a painfully platonic relationship all of its poignant nuances . <p> 10 . Ari : My Life with a King <p> Director : Carlo Catu <p> Ari : My Life with a King takes its cue from Christopher Gozum 's Anacbanua in celebrating a language in danger of being obscured and the poems that serve as evidence as to why the language 's slow passing is an unfortunate thing . Catu treads a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlikely friendship between a teen and a celebrated poet . This allows him to explore his themes with great emotional heft , granting the dying art the same love and dignity that is usually reserved for loved ones . <p> 11 . An Kubo sa Kawayanan <p> Director : Alvin Yapan <p> Alvin Yapan 's An Kubo sa Kawayanan has a tight cast of 3 -- a woman who is far too in love with her house and her two suitors , a man who is leaving for opportunities abroad , and a documentary filmmaker who is returning to his homeland because of its wealth of subject matters . Despite its economy in characters and storytelling , it bursts with pulsating sensuality which it owes to its bizarre melding of folkloric charm and quiet visual splendor . Yapan , however , is n't interested in empty eroticism . The film is more a critique of provincial mindsets in this contemporary age that favors convenience , than it is just an inert piece of sensuous art . <p> 12 . Heneral Luna <p> Director : Jerrold Tarog <p> History is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heneral Luna takes that concept to heart as it uses one of the supporting characters of the Philippine revolution to wage its war against the nation 's suffocating addiction to complacency .

It is an environmental apocalypse that can be averted only by the concerted action of all of humanity . <p> The covenant signed in Paris accepts several premises that were debated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of those premises is that global warming is the consequence of human activity -- particularly the massive production of carbon gases . <p> Opinion ( Article MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : 1 <p> The way we chose to live since the Industrial Revolution is now deemed unsustainable . <p> The industrial age has been characterized by massive consumption of fossil fuels , comprehensive urbanization , high-energy consumption per capita and reckless pollution .

That is no longer true . As fertile floodplains are threatened by rising sea levels , the oceans are also losing their capacity to support life . <p> We can not think of evacuating the planet in the event it becomes inhospitable to life .

We ought to demand such a policy statement from all those seeking to lead the nation in the future . <p> The global agenda for turning back climate change involves building an agenda for every nation , every community and every individual . This requires an unprecedented effort that should dwarf every other concern . <p> Except , perhaps , terrorism . <p> Over the last two decades , we shuddered under the threat of organized transnational terror , principally from the Al Qaeda .

@@10106236 that my personal registered financial planner constantly worries about is my retirement . She always reminds me to be smart with my saving and spending habits and to always remember to set something aside for when I retire so she does n't have to worry about our finances when we stop working and we can enjoy our old age without having to be a burden to our children . My wife , who is a registered financial planner , considers the education of our kids and our comfortable retirement as among the top priorities in the over-all financial management scheme of our household . <p> To achieve that goal , we put aside money . A small part of that money that we save for our retirement goes to the regular Social Security System contributions but a big chunk of it is deliberately directed to investments in long term financial instruments . It took a lot of getting used to , especially if you are not used to putting money away not just for a rainy day , but for something that is 20-30 years down the line , but it is something that we have decided is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While it would be a nice bonus if the pension that we were to expect from the SSS were suddenly increased by the stroke of a magical pen , we are not counting on it because my very strict personal financial planner has been preparing us for our eventual retirement almost 10 years ago , when we were in our early thirties . I found it ironic that the woman that I introduced to saving money when we were an unmarried couple has become the one who has been repeatedly pounding into my head the sobering fact that the SSS pension will never be enough and even if we account for our respective employer 's retirement packages , we will still need to consciously save for our retirement because nobody else will do that for us . <p> This consciousness of saving for our own retirement is the reason why I understand PNoy 's reasons for vetoing populist House Bill No. 5842 that would have raised the monthly pension of SSS retirees by P2,000 . It is easier for someone who has started saving for his or her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future depends on the money you collected in the past . The only way for money to grow is if you either put in a lot to start with or if you give it enough time to grow . But I guess that our politicos have n't really considered that . All they know is that signing a law that would give pensioners an additional P2,000 per month during the election season would be good for their careers . <p> I say that the lawmakers who hopped on the SSS pension increase train were n't really expending too much brain juice on that law because after I spent a bit of brian juice googling this vetoed law that was unexpectedly quite difficult to find if you base your search on news reports alone , I was flabbergasted to find that HB 5842 consists of merely 23 lines in TWO pages . What basically happened was that the collective intellect of this country 's House of Representatives decided that it would be nice to give SSS pensioners an across-the-board increase . They did n't say where the money would come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they did n't even bother adjusting the salaries and bonuses of the allegedly overpaid executives of the SSS to help pay for their proposed pension increase . They simply decreed it . What an amazing piece of legislature ! <p> No wonder PNoy vetoed it even if it meant political suicide for his anointed one . The outgoing president could 've considered it a parting gift to the pensioners of the country and left the problem of funding it with the SSS and his successor but he did n't . If PNoy is as stupid and selfish as the disappointed ones portray him to be , it would have been easier for him to sign the bill into law and let his successor deal with the problem of a crumbling SSS . He would have been hailed as a hero with a heart of gold and his papogi move would 've earned his struggling candidate a few million votes . It was actually easier for him close his eyes and sign the law but instead he thought about it a little bit more than his counterparts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been an easy law to pass . <p> There is no question that SSS pensioners currently get a pittance but the reason for that would be that they probably put in a pittance as well . Increasing that pension will require money and the least the vetoed bill could 've done was specify where the money was going to come from . Was it going to come from the national budget ? Was it going to legislate budget cuts within the SSS hierarchy so it can afford the additional costs ? Will they require the SSS to invest their pension funds in more aggressive investments or allow it to fund a drug lord or a white slavery ring to get the best return on investment ? Or did those lawmakers with bleeding hearts simply expect to reap the goodwill and the votes from their bill and leave the headache of sourcing and generating those funds with the SSS ? The 2-page , 23-line bill that they filed made it pretty clear that they could n't be bothered with the specifics and if you come to think of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bill . <p> Noynoy Aquino did what he thought was right , not what is popular . He will be packaged as heartless and his candidate will suffer the fallout of this veto but we should be mature enough to see that our country needs a leader who uses his mind as well as his heart . We should also be financially smart enough to realize that money does n't grow on trees and that it would be the height of being irresponsible to yourself if you think that your SSS pension will be enough for a comfortable retirement . Plan for your future and save for your retirement early so you do n't have to blame the president when the government can not magically increase the SSS pension that you signed up and paid for . <p> As the late John F. Kennedy said : ? Ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country. ? Planning for your retirement is n't even doing your country a favor . It 's doing yourself a favor. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

" <p> Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , who was also in Davos , criticized the US decision on missile-related sanctions . <p> " I find it rather bizarre that the United States expresses concern over the Iranian missile program , which is defensive and does not violate any current international regulation , " Zarif told an audience of bankers and top business figures on Wednesday . <p> " We are entitled to our defense . We are spending a fraction of what our neighbors spend on defense , so what 's all this fuss about ? I ca n't understand . " <p> The US Treasury said Sunday it was imposing sanctions on five Iranian nationals and a network of companies based in the United Arab Emirates and China in connection with Iran 's ballistic missile program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Malaysia is a good example ... It is now an interesting option for wealthy people , " he says . " We do n't have a lot of inquiries regarding the Philippines . " <p> Steffen says applicants need to prove their wealth in order to qualify for Caribbean or European citizenships . " For the citizenship program , the cheapest starts with $300,000 all inclusive for donation and for investment , around $500,000 .

" We have clients mainly from the US who are concerned when they travel with US passport because perhaps they are going to Middle East countries . They want another passport that they can travel with . Then they check in hotels with their European passports and nobody knows they are also US citizens , " he says . <p> " I had a client recently from Singapore office .

It depends on where the family wants to live and how long the family will spend in these countries . But a lot of countries have interesting investor schemes , " he says . <p> He says St. Kitts &amp; Nevis citizenship program is the oldest in the world , which started in 1984 . " You can make a donation of $250,000 or you make an investment of $400,000 and you can get citizenship . You do n't even have to go there .

For six years , you have to be in Malta . Additionally , once they received the citizenship , they have to invest 150,000 euros in government bonds in Malta . It does n't sound easy for you , or it sounds expensive but it is up and running now . Over 900 families applied for it , " he says . <p> Steffen says with a Cyprus passport , one can travel to more than 150 countries .

But you have to see that it also brings a lot to these countries . Some European countries were against it . The most important is the reputation of the program . If you ensure that not the wrong people get these citizenships , then usually it is not a concern , " he says . <p> Henley &amp; Partners developed the concept of residence and citizenship planning in the 1990s , as globalization expanded . However , the quickening pace of globalization has given rise to a growing demand for greater transparency among financial institutions and tax authorities . The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has called for the global implementation of its Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information , which addresses automatic disclosure of financial account information between countries and is comprised of detailed rules contained in the Common Reporting Standards . <p> " When the governments start exchanging information , they do n't know who sees the information . The same is true here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they do n't know who will get the information , " says Steffen . <p> Steffen says the CRS is a big step towards a globally coordinated approach to the disclosure of financial information from both individuals and organizations . " If governments begin to exchange information of income earned by individuals , then this could threaten the security of wealthy individuals and families , especially those in developing countries since there is a risk of this information becoming available to the wrong sources , " he says . <p> He says if wealthy families have security concerns regarding a possible exchange of information with their home country , an option is to consider moving to a country where the overall situation is more favorable with regard to security , tax , lifestyle and education . <p> Steffen says this is where Henley &amp; Partners comes in , as it provides the best and most appropriate residence options in the world . He says other residence options that are tailor-made to the needs of wealthy families are the UK tier 1 investor program , Portugal 's golden visa program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor program , the capital investment entrant scheme of Hong Kong and Malaysia 's second home program . <p> Steffen says wealthy Filipinos usually apply for residence or citizenship programs for the education of their children . " Usually , it is easy for education . But Filipinos usually , they do not move together with their children to the UK or to Canada . Their children go there , but their families stay here , " he says . <p> Steffen says even with a new citizenship , wealthy Filipinos choose to stay in the Philippines . <p> " What we see in the end , if they lived here their whole life , they do n't want to move to another country , " he says . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

Specialized yoga and pilates classes for pregnancy are also widely available . <p> The aim is to maintain or improve fitness to cope with pregnancy , not train for competition .

Within hours or days of the delivery , this may mean starting to walk in short bouts ( three to five minutes ) a few times a day , gradually building up to longer and harder sessions of 20-30 minutes . <p> Alongside a resumption in exercise , women should regularly practise pelvic floor exercises .

@@10168235 <h> Pomeroy Studio Unveils Carbon-Negative Home in Singapore <p> The award-winning Singapore-based sustainable design firm , Pomeroy Studio , finally completed The B House in Singapore , an operational carbon-negative home that was recently awarded with Building Construction Authority 's ( BCA ) Green Mark Platinum Award , the highest recognition for environment-friendly buildings in Singapore . <p> The B House in Singapore is one of the most sustainable detached modern homes in the region <p> The house has been designed in such a way that it offsets the energy that the entire household consumes through the use of solar energy as well as efficient use of water and waste . The B House uses many design techniques that are used in Singapore 's colonial black and white bungalows but with energy efficient features . Now it is even priced at the same price point as its neighboring residential developments . <p> Inspired by Jason Pomeroy 's design on Asia 's first carbon-zero prototype home , the Sime Darby Idea House ( 2010 ) in Malaysia , Pomeroy applied all the learnings from that project and used the traditional black and white bungalows of Singapore with their passive design techniques and space planning principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhangs , large verandahs for outdoor living and entertaining , and variable shutters that could keep the sun out but allow the air to percolate in . With the B House design , a " form-matching-climate " approach that embraces the climatic conditions of Singapore was utilized in order to reduce energy consumption and promote efficient water use . Natural airflow and daylight penetration were considered to position and orient areas of design . The designers were able to minimize heat from the East and West sun -- reducing solar heat gain and maximizing cross ventilation through the prevailing wind . By strategically placing low , medium and high-level windows and shutters in the North and South fa ? ades , they were able to regulate better airflow . These can be opened and closed in multiple configurations to prevent rain , and provide shade while filtering light during the hottest or wettest seasons . At the same time , daylight penetration is optimized through shallow floor plates that permit all habitable rooms to receive 100 percent natural light . <p> B House used a form-matching-climate design approach that embraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient water use ; orientation and design of the house harnesses natural airflow and daylight penetration <p> The house is touted as one of the most sustainable detached modern homes in the region . " The owner of the B House was keen to push the boundaries of sustainable design for a private commission of two family bungalows in Bukit Timah , Singapore , " says founding principal of Pomeroy Studio Jason Pomeroy . " The home sought to ensure that the occupants would never have energy bills again , and greatly reduced water bills . The challenge therefore was to create a zero carbon house at the same cost of a bungalow comparable in scale . What started as a carbon zero project would eventually become a pioneering operational carbon negative house in Singapore , " he adds . <p> The passive design techniques drawn from the traditional Asian dwellings provided a low energy base from which Pomeroy Studio was able to incorporate the latest green technologies and practices , giving the house its carbon-negative credential .

As for its water usage , a water-harvesting equipment is set in place forecasted to save up to 465 cubic meter of water per year . As for the construction of the house , materials used had low eco-toxicity and high recyclable content , and pre-fabricated " kit-of-parts " were manufactured off-site , improving quality and reducing wasteful off-cuts . <p> " The future of sustainability is not just about technology , but , like the B House , draws on the essence of culture and tradition to create built environments that are carbon-free and truly reflect their inhabitants ' way of life , " explains Pomeroy . <p> " We are delighted to have been given the opportunity to design this carbon negative home in Singapore .

They have wonderful and not-so-wonderful discoveries . <p> We would like to admit that public markets really attract tourists . If you go to Baguio , the best souvenir items are in public markets ... blankets , fresh vegetables , and fruits , t-shirts , key chains , native bags and even dirty strawberry ice cream . In Bohol public markets , a tourist would find well-crafted souvenir items made of wood , bamboo , nito , and rattan . <p> There is no doubt about it , our public market is a vault of heritage products of a particular province . We have to bring our local and foreign tourists there . On the other hand , our tour guides who made the familiarization tour have observed many things that need the attention of our town and city officials , especially the market directors , superintendents , supervisors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public markets are really dirty . There is the presence of uncollected garbage ( or probably , the garbage has not been collected for several days ) . The garbage receptacles are not covered ( or the covers have been missing ) .

The gutters ( cannals ) have cursing century-old foul odor ( a combination of urine , stagnant water , and rotten matter ) . <p> If the market floor is concrete , some areas are slippery and always wet . ( The floor sweepers could be absent always . ) Market supervisors have to dispatch their inspectors to monitor the sanitary condition of the market . There are always senior citizens who are complaining that the wet section of the public market is not customer-friendly . That could be the reason why some vendors are complaining that their daily net income is a curse . <p> You can seldom find clean comfort rooms in most of our public markets . The toilet bowls are always unattended ( could not be flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not function ( could not be opened or could not be closed ) .

We challenge our public officials to do their own version of market tour . <p> Our public officials may possibly discover that some areas are dark ( no electrical connection ) . If it rains , there are waterfalls inside the market and the low-level areas would create small ponds . Heavy rains would flood the lower grounds because the culverts have been clogged by garbage . Market goers are stranded and they have to wait for hours until the water subsides . <p> After the rain , cockroaches and rats start to appear because their hiding places have been flooded .

Traffic is in chaos . Sometimes there are no policemen and traffic enforcers in strategic intersections . Accident could always happen . <p> When there is a market rush , we can always expect the participation of snatchers , pickpockets , " budol-budol " groups , and persons who use fake money to buy your items . There are also idiots who take their chances on women who are not ready to defend their spare parts . That could be the reason why parents do not send their young ladies to do marketing . <p> Some market vendors have to be reminded of their manners ( only some ) .

Duterte delivered his first State of the Nation Address ( SONA ) as the 16th President of the Philippines , focusing on improved government services , tax reform , transportation , tourism and agriculture , and economic development , among others . <p> Taking up the SONA agenda , Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel F. Pi ? ol has said that he is tasked with accomplishing two things -- to ensure that sufficient food for Filipinos ; and to stop corruption within the agency . These objectives may be achieved with the help of Republic Act ( RA ) No. 10845 , or the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act of 2016 , signed by former President Benigno S. C. Aquino III on May 23 , which primarily aims to boost the productivity of the agricultural sector and protect Filipino farmers and agricultural enterprises from illegal traders and importers . <p> Currently , the Philippines is not self-sufficient in agricultural products such as rice in part due to the impact of climate change on the rice crop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring countries .

@@13674235 <p> MANILA -- In ... long , expectedly complicated journey to federalism , the Philippines need not rely on a " one-size-fits-all " strategy but build its own model , bringing together the best parts of other nations as they suit the local context . The advice to set up its own virtual " Lego Land " comes from Senate President Aquilino " Koko " Pimentel III , as he spoke at a forum on federalism on Thursday , in a back-to-back appearance with his father and namesake , the former Senate President Aquilino " Nene " Pimentel Jr . <p> The older Pimentel is one of the earliest proponents of federalism in the country , advocating the shift for the past four decades in the belief it would best loosen up the stagnation in development as most regions fall behind " imperial Manila . " <p> Addressing Thursday 's forum , Senate President Pimentel III said the Philippines could have its own unique model on federalism by picking up good points and ideas from existing systems from all over the world . <p> In an interview after speaking at the Senate Centennial Lecture Series , Pimentel said , " we are free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other templates to craft our own federal form of government . <p> " We are free to choose our own model , our own system , and we can borrow good points , good ideas from existing federal systems and existing presidential or parliamentary systems , from all over the world and then piece them all together in one puzzle , isama-sama , and this is now the Philippine model , " Pimentel said . <p> He believes that President Rodrigo Duterte has been right all along in focusing us on the French model on executive-legislative relationship . <p> " We look at the US and Australia for the federal model but when it comes to the executive-legislative relationship , we look at the French model , " he said . <p> Pimentel III explained that the French model actually introduces parliamentary concepts , but basically retains the presidential form of government . <p> " We will be federal but at the same time slowly turn into a parliament but retaining presidential features , " he added . <p> How regional states are divided <p> The division into regional states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system because Philippine society is diverse enough , he said . <p> " So we will divide regional states as much as possible , grouping together those who are not diverse from each other . Those who are more or less similar culturally , religion-wise , with each other , that is the first thing we have to do , " Pimentel said . <p> However , Pimentel warned that the Philippines should be careful in dividing regional states by looking into their economic data , taxation , Internal Revenue Allotments ( IRA ) and budgets . <p> " We add this all up to find out now this so-called economic viability of the proposed regional state , " he said . <p> Another contentious issue , Pimentel said , would be the division of the sovereign powers and the shared powers of the federal government and the state government . <p> " What taxing power should be given to one level of sovereignty , and what can be shared ? All of these things , but these are not insurmountable . Puwede pa ito pag-usapan , at puwede pong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Equalization fund <p> If federalism pushes through , Pimentel wants to institute a provision in the Constitution for an equalization fund , which is always available in countries with a federal form of government . <p> Under the system , the national government will set aside part of its national revenues for the equalization fund which could be used by the Legislative Department ( or National Assembly ) to extend assistance to a troubled economy in a particular regional state . <p> " Like Australia , they have this system . Kasi it may be economically viable today , " but if , 20 years down the road , the regional state encounters some problems , " there must be a mechanism where the central government can extend assistance to a troubled economy . " <p> As to the percentage of assistance , Pimentel said that should be fixed in the Constitution , so it is part of the overall agreement . <p> " As to how much percentage , that should be fixed in the Constitution . It can not be changed . So there is that responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help directly or indirectly troubled regional states , " Pimentel said . <p> Determining troubled states <p> With this , Pimentel said the national government can determine which regional economy is in distress by looking into their finances . <p> " If let us say , the revenues the state can generate on its own can not meet its necessary or required expenses , then that means that regional state needs to ask help from the federal state : ' Help me get my budget ' or ' Help augment my budget ' , so that is now the mechanism , " Pimentel explained .

@@13691238 come to an end . This week , we have witnessed the collapse of a romance for the ages . We pause now to pay tribute to the epic relationship between Donald Trump and his poll numbers -- a pairing that appears to be , if not over , definitely on a break . <p> So far , it 's a rocky breakup . When the Republican nominee has mentioned polls at all , it 's either to reminisce about far happier times and deny that anything has changed , or to dismiss entirely the story surveys are telling now . No longer -- at least , not from Monday afternoon through Thursday night , when we 're typing this -- is he tweeting cheery poll graphics or text toplines . Once , there was love . Right now , there is only an empty space . <p> That survey was released a little while after a poll from McClatchy/Marist that showed Trump down 15 points , pulling only 33 percent of the vote . Those numbers are , to put it bluntly , shocking . Mitt Romney was never down by that much to President Obama in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomberg that had him down 13 , with 40 percent of the vote . <p> In only one of the four major polls released this week is Trump over 40 percent , which is itself remarkable . Each of the four had Clinton gaining ground since the last time the same outlet released a poll , by an average of about 5 points . Three of the four showed Trump losing ground , by a little more than 3 points . <p> The two new polls show a pattern that 's consistent with other recent surveys , including at the state level . Clinton is getting more support from Democrats than Trump is from Republicans , and his advantage among men and white voters has diminished . In both of the new polls , Clinton leads with men , which has not been the trend over the course of this election . <p> Among black voters , Trump is doing particularly poorly , earning only a percentage point or two . ( The results in the Fox News poll were similar . ) Comparing how Trump is faring in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls ) is revelatory . Romney won men by 7 points ; Trump trails by 1 and 7 points in the new polls . Romney won white voters by 20 ; Trump leads by 2 and 5 points . Romney won Republicans by 87 points . In the McClatchy/Marist poll , Trump is winning by only 73 points -- a big dip among more than a third of the electorate . <p> Because the four new polls are divergent -- showing Clinton leads of 9 , 9 , 10 and 15 points -- we look at the average of recent polls , compiled by RealClearPolitics . We did a version of the chart below on Wednesday , when Trump 's week in polling was only terrible and not completely horrible . His average in the recent polls is now back to what it was before both conventions . Clinton 's gained 4 points and now leads in the average by 7 points . <p> How big is that ? Big . Relative to Election Day in 2004 , 2008 and 2012 , Clinton 's lead is more than twice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George W. Bush had a 6-point lead for a few weeks ; in 2008 , Barack Obama led by 6 points or more for the final month or so . Other than that , though , Clinton 's lead is exceptional . <p> Notice that blue line , though . Donald Trump now trails Hillary Clinton in the polling average by more than Mitt Romney ever did in the final 150 days . In fact , Romney never trailed by that much for the last year of the campaign . <p> One consolation for Trump probably lies in that rapid spike in the polling average -- a spike that conceivably could rocket back the other direction if ... something . It spiked because the Democrats had four straight days to hammer Trump and praise Clinton , of course , which is hard to duplicate . <p> The other consolation for Trump is that at least only one of the two polls today had him losing by double digits . <p> -- Philip Bump <p> THE WAY THEY WERE ( via Chris Cillizza ) <p> Right now , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo by Sarah Rice/Getty Images ) <p> Donald Trump and polls have had a long and unusually good relationship . Throughout the Republican primary , polls showed Trump at or near the top of the field . He dutifully cited them -- and cited them -- as evidence that he was #winning , and that everyone who second-guessed his unorthodox campaign style was , in a word , dumb . <p> It was Trump 's ultimate defense . Every time another candidate or a party leader raised questions about his fitness for office or his conservative credentials , he could always point to polling that showed the Republican primary electorate siding with him . It served as his uber-example of how out of touch the party establishment was with its base ; every time they predicted something he said or did would doom his campaign , his poll numbers went up . ( See Muslim ban , build wall and make Mexico pay for it , etc . ) <p> That polling reality does n't mean that Trump is n't still trying to lean on polls to make the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally Wednesday in Daytona Beach , Fla. , Trump cited a " new " poll that showed him ahead by eight points in Florida . But there has n't been any " new " polling done since early July -- before the two conventions -- in the state . And , of the 14 most recent polls in the state , Trump has led Clinton in just four . <p> For the past 15 months , we 've all been wondering what would happen to Trump if his beloved poll numbers took a turn for the worst . So much of Trump 's pitch to voters was based on his standing in the polls -- I 'm winning and that means I am a winner and , therefore , someone you should vote for -- that it was hard to imagine what he would even say if he was n't ahead . <p> That question never really got answered in the primary because Trump never experienced any sort of extended polling slump . But it is quite clearly happening right now . <p> Trump seems to be struggling to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through his usual litany of the big crowds he is drawing -- " We go to Oklahoma , we had 25,000 people . We had 21,000 people in Dallas " -- before turning more introspective : " I hear we 're leading Florida by a bit , " he said . " I do n't know why we 're not leading by a lot . Maybe crowds do n't make the difference . " <p> There are a lot of them . That may tell us ... not very much . ( Photo by Sarah Rice/Getty Images ) <p> The smartest thing Trump could do when asked about his poll problems is to note that Clinton is enjoying a very traditional convention bounce and that the race will eventually settle down to a close single digit contest . <p> But Trump rarely does the politically smart thing -- particularly when he feels betrayed by the same polls that were so good to him for so long . And there are already indications that Trump -- a friend spurned -- is going to burn the bridges of his past close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I do n't know -- there 's something about these polls , there 's something phony , " Trump said Tuesday at a rally in Loudoun County , Va . <p> President Obama seems to have hit his limit with " rigged " election complaints too -- especially Donald Trump 's . Today , he called the GOP nominee 's charges that the voting process itself was tainted " ridiculous .

There 's a loose story built into the career mode , but it 's barely worth mentioning . You 're a hot new racer trying to prove their self on the underground scene . An old friend and rivals will appear every now and again with some quick jabs , but calling it a story is like saying the warning label on a bottle of pills is a tale . As if one needs a reason to race wicked water bikes in a futuristic city , but it 's there to those curious . <h> " There are only about nine courses in the game , but the campaign remixes them , creating new ways to venture through so locations remain feeling fresh " <p> Going through the campaign is simple enough : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star rating at the end of each event .

There are only about nine courses in the game , but the campaign remixes them , creating new ways to venture through so locations remain feeling fresh , even when you revisit them multiple times . Courses also tend to change during races , in a similar style to Blackrock Studios ' Split/Second from back in 2010 .

That 's the gist of most racers though . <p> While skill is definitely at play , simply grinding can also help level the playing field . Similar to a good RPG , any time spent with Riptide GP : Renegade is not wasted , even in defeat . Cash can help beef up a rig 's acceleration , top speed , handling and boost capabilities , making it easier to pass through those trickier levels .

The harder the trick , the better the boost . Aside from steering well , it 's imperative to make the most of these obstacles and gain as much power as possible . Considering Riptide GP : Renegade comes from a mobile developer , there 's much more complexity to it than you 'd imagine . <p> Aside from the career mode , players can venture online with multiplayer , hang out with up to four friends on the couch for some split screen action , climb the leaderboards , or jump into a single track just for fun .

@@13713234 <p> Media reports have ... the wide array of options available to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as they decide who will be their number twos for this campaign , and perhaps for four or eight years to come . <p> Who will Trump and Clinton pick ? That depends on each candidate 's goals -- both for the remainder of the presidential campaign and after Nov. 8 . Political observers widely agree that the most important characteristic to look for in a running mate is the ability to serve as president in the event of unforeseen circumstances , like a president 's death , incapacitation , resignation or impeachment . <p> However , when campaign staff and trusted political advisers vet potential running mates , they are certain to also weigh political considerations . That is , whether a given running mate will help or hurt the presidential ticket , with voters in general or with a key voting group . Particularly if the campaign is at a competitive disadvantage , its strategists may look to the running mate as a potential " game changer . " <p> The electoral advantage most commonly associated with vice presidential candidates is geographic . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or region in the Electoral College . But do they actually deliver ? <p> Based upon the data , it is unlikely that Hillary Clinton 's or Donald Trump 's running mate will deliver a crucial battleground state , like Ohio or Virginia . Instead , the presidential candidates would be wise to select a respected running mate who can effectively serve as vice president . <p> Mythbusting : VP influence <p> Survey data and internal campaign polls from 1960 even cast serious doubt on the " fact " that Lyndon Johnson delivered Texas and the South for Democratic presidential candidate John Kennedy that year . Although presidential candidates typically receive an electoral advantage in their home state , our findings for vice presidential candidates suggest a conditional relationship . <p> Such advantages are most likely to occur in less populous states where a running mate has significant elected political experience within that state . The vice presidential candidacies of Maine 's Edmund Muskie ( 1968 ) and Delaware 's Joe Biden ( 2008 , 2012 ) , both political " institutions " in their small home states , serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Will a running mate deliver votes from a targeted demographic group -- say , based on gender or religion -- if she also belongs to that group ? To find out , in a recent analysis we tested whether women ( 1984 and 2008 ) , Catholic ( 1972 , 1984 , 2008 , and 2012 ) , and Jewish ( 2000 ) voters were more likely to vote for a presidential ticket that included a vice president from the same demographic group . Once again , running mates failed to deliver as expected . <p> True , voters more positively evaluated vice presidential candidates who belonged to their demographic group . But this did not change votes . Women , for instance , were no more likely than in other years to vote for a ticket featuring a woman as running mate , and the same generally goes for religious minorities . <p> While there 's a great deal of speculation that Hillary Clinton will select a Hispanic running mate , partly in hopes of increasing her vote share among Hispanics , this evidence suggests that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may perform better among Hispanics for other reasons , namely opposition to Donald Trump 's candidacy . <p> In 1976 , Ronald Reagan used his vice presidential pick to attempt to unify the warring factions of his party and pick up uncommitted delegates at the Republican National Convention . It backfired when he announced Sen. Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania would be his running mate , which provoked a strong reaction from Sen. Jesse Helms and other conservatives . Gerald Ford got the nomination that year . <p> Four years later , Reagan considered the possibility of inviting Ford back to the ticket as his running mate in what some dubbed a co-presidency . Instead he offered the vice presidential slot to his relatively moderate primary opponent , George H.W. Bush . <p> Indeed , the empirical evidence suggests that running mates have a modest , but measurable influence on presidential vote choice . In our book , we used data from the American National Election Studies and found that evaluations of presidential candidates are three times more influential than evaluations of running mates , when explaining voter choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not just presidential candidates . That 's why VP candidates have some level of influence on voters , albeit small relative to the presidential candidates . This means a vice presidential candidate may strengthen or weaken overall evaluations of the ticket to the extent that he or she is very appealing or very unappealing to voters . <p> The major takeaway from our findings is this : If a running mate is exceedingly popular or unpopular relative to the presidential candidate , then they could marginally influence vote choice at a national level . <p> Typically , this does not happen . When vetting running mates , most campaigns take a " do no harm " approach and ensure that the vice presidential pick will not detract from the presidential candidate . Most vice presidential candidates are not exceptionally popular or unpopular . Many are simply unknown to voters . <p> What does all of this mean for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016 ? Given that both candidates have historically high unfavorable ratings after winning exceptionally divisive party nomination campaigns , a vice presidential candidate could influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If Clinton or Trump select a running mate who is also unpopular , while the other selects one with high or even neutral favorability among voters , the latter could make a positive and meaningful contribution to the overall ticket . <p> Perhaps , then , this is the year that vice presidential selections will make a difference -- not by delivering a key state or voting bloc , but by enhancing the popularity of a presidential ticket that desperately needs the help . <p> The authors do not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> ADVISORY WARNING : EconoTimes provides references and links to selected blogs and other sources of economic and market information as an educational service to its clients and prospects and does not endorse the opinions or recommendations of the blogs or other sources of information .

Scott Boyd has helped spearhead a temporary pilot project that examines how traffic flow through the roundabout might improve if the inner lane is taken away . <p> " For some time , we have had some folks concerned about the double-lane roundabout and weaving through and out in different directions , " Boyd said . " We 've come up with striping and signage , but 99% of the time , it has n't changed the behavior of the drivers , which is part of the problem we 're having . " <p> Accidents and traffic confusion have been concerns of nearby residents who frequent the roadway since the roundabout 's genesis , and the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the roundabout 's inner lane last week in an attempt to block off access to it and simulate a single-lane roundabout .

After the project is over , Boyd and his team will seek feedback from residents that will help them decide whether the county ultimately needs to shut down the inner lane permanently . <p> " They 're experiencing what ultimately will more than likely be the fix in the traffic issues that have surrounded the roundabout for quite some time , " Boyd said . " Prior to spending money in doing so , this is the best way to figure out how it works . " <p> Jim Rawlings , a nearby Windermere Trails resident , started a poll on the social-media platform NextDoor after the barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors thought of the project . The general consensus was that the temporary change to simulate a single-lane roundabout functioned better than the two-lane setup . <p> Rawlings , a proponent for a single-lane roundabout , said the primary issue with the roundabout is where drivers exit and enter onto Reams Road . <p> " A single lane works just fine , " he said . " I do n't think putting stop signs in will make a difference . If it was a single lane , you have a 50% less chance of accidents happening . I 've driven the ones in Windermere and never had a problem . " <p> Brian and Sharai Pittman , residents of the Grande Pines community , used to live in Reno , Texas , and were used to the regular presence of roundabouts there . <p> " This was supposed to be more efficient , that they put a two-lane roundabout in , and no one here knows how to drive it , " Sharai said .

@@13882235 <p> Raksha Bandhan brings ... a plethora of memories for me . It marks the official start of the festive season . Right from Rakhi till perhaps the end of the year , there is some festival or the other almost every fortnight . And these celebrations involve copious amounts of mithais ! So as kids , my brother and I were constantly hovering in the vicinity of the kitchen -- lured by the aromas of sweets and savouries . <p> The choice will spoil you , and yet , the brain will sound alarms of calorie overload . Thanks to the constant experiments of my mother and grandmother , we never had the same mithai twice -- as they would combine unique ingredients in such an amazing fashion that what was cooked at home was never available in shops . I think I inherited this love of culinary alchemy from these two women -- who , so early on in my life , encouraged me to be creative in my cooking . <p> My profession as a patisserie chef means that my brother is my first guinea pig . Lucky for him ! <p> Though personally , sugar is a sinful indulgence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavours and consistencies to create desserts that look and taste amazing and are healthy too . Banana Hazelnut Ladoos are that perfect low-cal Rakhi mithai that not only have significantly less sugar content , but are actually healthy because banana is a key ingredient . This is a sweet that is good enough for those who choose to eat healthy as well as for those who have chronic health conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and cholesterol . <p> This is a mithai that your taste buds will remember for a long time -- not only because of its unusual velvety , and yet crunchy texture , but also because of the intensely fruity flavour that has nutty overtones . The banana adds a fruity twist to the popular ladoo , not only adding flavour , but also helping to bind the remaining ingredients -- thereby making it a very convenient and quick-to-make mithai . <p> Banana Hazelnut Ladoos <p> Ingredients : <p> 2 bananas mashed <p> 150g hazelnut powder <p> 50g crushed hazelnut pieces <p> 50g icing sugar <p> 30g hazelnut paste/ Nutella <p> For the Coating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Method : <p> 1 . Combine all the ingredients ( except dark chocolate and digestive biscuits ) in a large bowl -- best to use hands to ensure the consistency is uniform and there are no lumps .

Can you go and hunt for Pok ? mon , or stay by a pokestop longing for pokeballs ? While this article wo n't assist you in game strategy , I 'll give you my first impressions analyzing the game . <p> There are two sorts of Pok ? mon applications : <p> 1 . The official versions , issued by Niantic . <p> We will talk more about these later , but in brief , they are not malicious . <p> 2 . The hacked versions . These are also known as " mods " , which are issued by other developers , for multiple reasons . It is in this category we are the most likely to encounter malware . For instance , a repackaged version infected with DroidJack RAT has been identified to be in the wild . <p> However , not all hacked versions are necessarily malicious : we inspected hacks to play on Android 4.0 ( the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinates , neither of which showed any malicious intent . <p> This is a known malware , for which we have had a signature since 2015 . Therefore , Fortinet customers were protected from this malicious Pok ? mon app from the beginning : ) <p> This malware is quite widespread . Internal statistics at Fortinet indicate more than 8,800 detections in a year , and 160 last month alone , but those figures are largely underestimated for various reasons , including the fact that reporting is not enabled by default . So , basically , what you should remember is that this malware is still in the wild and active currently . <p> More malware to come ? <p> Yes , very certainly . Malware authors are likely to continue to re-package the game with a variety of malware and distribute it . The fact the game was n't released in all countries at the same date , for example , ( thus forcing impatient users to look for alternatives on the web ) , combined with the fact there are large game hacking ( that 's nice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the potential for downloading an infected version of the game .. <p> Risk #2 Full Google Account Information ? ( This is fixed ) <p> Adam Reeve noticed that the game requested full access to your Google account . Note : we are not talking about an Android permission here but a permission of an app connected to a Google account . <p> This was an error and Niantic fixed this . So be sure to remove the permission from your account and upgrade your Pok ? mon Go application . <p> Finally , note that it is not extremely clear in the documentation exactly how much " full access " really means , but no malware or exploit of this has been reported so far . <p> Risk #3 Unwanted network traffic <p> In a perfect world , we 'd expect games to only send packets over the network that are absolutely necessary for the game to run , such as your location , the details of Pok ? mon around you , etc . <p> However , this is very far from reality , and for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( analytics , crash reporting , cross platform engines , etc. ) which use up the bandwidth which send and receive more or less useful side information containing , in the best cases , the exact model of your smartphone , or in the worst , personal information such as your phone number and other private data . <p> Pok ? mon Go is one of these bandwidth hungry applications .

He trusted people too much and if you abide by a credo of political survival , you must make sure the institutions of coercion are on your side , " said Arugay . <p> Duterte , who has not only survived but thrived in his 3 decades as a politician , could just be making sure he has all his bases covered . <p> Reason 2 : Preparation for authoritarian regime ? <p> Curiously enough , it 's Duterte himself who has brought back the specter of Martial Law after he threatened the judiciary with it should his war on drugs be hindered . <p> These threats makes one wonder if there 's more to these military camp visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an outspoken critic of Duterte , has dire pronouncements about these camp visits . <p> The strategy of consolidating military support as a power base mirrors that of certain Latin American leaders like former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who during his presidency curtailed some democratic freedoms and sought to rewrite his country 's Constitution . <p> " The first thing they did is to get the support of the Armed Forces and the next thing they did was to tinker with the Constitution so they can perpetuate themselves in power , " said Trillanes . <p> Other ways Duterte is following the " Hugo Chavez template " is with his " populist , anti-elite , anti-establishment , and even anti-American rhetoric , " added the senator . <p> INSPECTION .

" <p> But for Honasan , who used to be Trillanes ' mentor , such theories are pure " speculation . " <p> " Difficult to validate . Speculation . Conspiracy theory -- the worries that we inflict on ourselves . How many variables do you need to put together that theory ?

He has a tendency to speak with a forked tongue , " he warned . <p> Arugay thinks such a plot is possible but it may be too early to tell Duterte 's true intentions . <p> " It 's possible though I do n't see it right now . But if you are the president and you are a strategist which I think Duterte is , you will not make known your possible moves , " said Arugay . <p> Reason 3 : Appeasing the military amid release of communist rebels <p> Yet another objective of Duterte 's may be to calm down the military as he releases communist rebels to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Left , said Trillanes . <p> As of August 19 , the Philippine government has temporarily released 17 rebels so they may join peace talks in Norway from August 22 to 26 . The released include top New People 's Army leaders Benito Tiamzon and wife Wilma . <p> Peace Process Adviser Jesus Dureza said Duterte intends to declare general amnesty for all communist rebels if the peace talks are successful . <p> Neglecting the military who risked their lives to apprehend these communist rebels would have been careless of Duterte . <p> " Let 's just say a segment of the Armed Forces would not be comfortable seeing these communist leaders released again after the sacrifices they went through in affecting their arrests ... To avoid the scenario , he might as well court their support through these visits , " said Trillanes . <p> The same communist rebels tasting freedom under the Duterte administration may have killed Philippine soldiers . If Duterte did not take the time to address the soldiers , he would have heard some " grumblings " . <p> Likely , this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the government 's peace talks with the Left . <p> " My job as president is to seek peace , not to declare war , " he would say . <p> Reason 4 : Gearing up the military for the war on drugs , confrontation with China <p> As Trillanes points out , catching drug lords is not within the " traditional mandate " of the military . <p> But with Duterte eager to pull out all the stops to " destroy the drug apparatus , " it 's not surprising he wants to deploy the military as well . <p> The reach of the military and its physical presence across the nation is a definite advantage for quelling the nationwide " drug menace . " <p> " Wherever you are in the country , there is a military structure . In fact , in terms of territorial structure , only the Catholic Church can rival the structure of the military , so it has a wide reach . If you have a nationwide campaign against crime and illegal drugs , you would want to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , and hardware , " said Arugay . <p> Trillanes believes Duterte has darker motives . <p> " That way , the Armed Forces can get used to getting deployed by Duterte in other missions outside their traditional mandate and by doing so he could eventually shift or line up other missions that would suit his political objectives , " said Trillanes . <p> Duterte has time and again declared that war with China is not an option for the Philippines . <p> But his casual , even humorous mention of the maritime dispute with China , indicates it 's on his mind when he speaks to troops . <p> " We have a tense regional strategic environment right now and he knows this . He says , jokingly , China might invade us ... The deeper meaning here is that he is aware that the current strategic environment is tense . He is aware that he needs to have the military ready and able to fulfill the function of territorial defense from external aggression if necessary , " said Arugay . <p> A mission to inspire the loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duterte should not forget the military itself is composed of groups and individuals with independent motives and ways of thinking . <p> This is proven by the examples of Trillanes and Honasan , two coup plotters . <p> " The problem is there is no assurance of military loyalty because the military is also factionalized , it 's not a cohesive institution , " said Arugay . <p> Honasan said most soldiers would know when to stop obeying their president . <p> " When the commander-in-chief and president stops serving the interests of the people who he is mandated to protect , then the military , as a matter of principle is not bound anymore to follow him , he stops being commander-in-chief . That 's why ' 86 happened , " he said . <p> Trillanes , one of the leaders of the Oakwood mutiny against the Arroyo administration , warned of the consequences should power over the military be abused . <p> " The AFP is technically a political weapon .

There were 447 fewer crimes in July 2016 compared with the numbers in July 2015 , according to the Police Regional Office ( PRO ) 7 . <p> As promised , the campaign against illegal drugs turned more aggressive . As many as 71,123 persons surrendered to the Central Visayas police between July 1 and Aug. 22 , and vowed to give up using or peddling illegal drugs . They represent about 10.5 percent of the 673,978 who , the police said , have so far surrendered nationwide . <p> The region 's police force reported the deaths of 69 suspected pushers in law enforcement operations since Duterte 's term began .

Different national tallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite all these deaths , the official murder and homicide records are not alarming , when viewed in per capita terms . From January to July 2016 , the murder rate in Central Visayas was four for every 100,000 persons . The number of homicides was even lower : 0.98 for every 100,000 . <p> Still , all these drug-related deaths raise several questions . How many of the 76 victims of unidentified assailants had previous arrests or criminal convictions , whether for drug peddling or some other offense ? Who 's behind all these attacks ? <p> Facing a Senate panel yesterday , PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa said that in his visits to barangays , teary-eyed citizens have approached and thanked him for what the police are doing , apparently in reference to the ramped-up campaign against illegal drugs . So why , he asked , were the police being presented as the bad guys ? " Hindi po kami mamatay-tao ( We are not murderers ) , " the police chief said . " Hindi po kami butcher na pumapatay ng tao na walang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason at all ) . " <p> Our sympathy goes out to the police chief . But the more information the police can dig up and provide about these deaths caused by unidentified assailants -- these " conviction by cardboard " executions -- the more pronounced the public 's support could be for legitimate police operations . Their reports to the public could even include the number of officers hurt or killed while going after drug peddlers and other criminals .

When I passed in front of a church on my way to the mortuary , I met my sister who was with two lady companions . I was surprised to see them wearing gowns and asked her what the occasion was . " Why , are you not attending it ? Were you not invited ? " she asked . And then I remembered that a relative and his wife were celebrating their silver wedding anniversary and were to renew their vows during a Holy Mass that afternoon , and that indeed they had requested my and the wife 's presence . Which invitation I had completely forgotten . " Why are you not dressed for it ? " my sister added , seeing that I was just wearing jeans and a T-shirt . <p> Without a word , I left her and her companions and rushed to the mortuary , afraid that the celebrants might soon arrive and see me . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> I remembered a passage in the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a leading Pharisee . Jesus noticed that the guests were jostling for the best places at the table and so gave this admonition . " When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet , do not recline at table in the place of honor . A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him , and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say , ' Give your place to this man , ' and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place . Rather , when you are invited , go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say , ' My friend , move up to a higher position . ' Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted . " <p> Next , Jesus gave an unusual advice : " When you hold a lunch or a dinner , do not invite your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , in case they may invite you back and you have repayment . Rather , when you hold a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ; blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you . For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . " <p> Of course , human wisdom is averse to the idea . When we throw a party , we usually ask family and friends to come and are honored by the attendance of prominent people . Parties occasion the display of status and often highlight the disparities in social classes . But the mission of Christ seeks to include everyone , especially " the poor , the crippled , the lame and the blind " -- the wretched of the earth -- and particularly to them we should offer our hospitality because they can not return the favor , and in this way , we will merit God 's reward at the Resurrection . This , I think , is what Jesus means . <p> Although I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebration . I know that it is de rigueur for those invited to a wedding and the like to be costumed for the event in the formal wear required . I once stood as sponsor at a wedding and decided to have on a black suit -- and not a barong , which was prescribed -- a choice that set me apart from the rest of the sponsors , and to my dismay discovered at the reception when a guest asked me for water that like me , the waiters were in black suits . <p> I know that I would have embarrassed both myself and the hosts , as well as the other guests who had come correctly dressed . I would have appeared not unlike the lady in Manet 's " Lunch on the Grass . " <p> But I would slip quietly inside the banquet hall and take a seat in an inconspicuous corner near the restroom .

In fact , as in the case of TV5 journalist Ed Lingao during the election period , their social media accounts were reported as " offensive " or as " scam " in attempts to disable them or even hack them . <p> My friend suspects that this pattern shows that these are really orchestrated counterattacks by a huge network of keyboard warriors bent on really crushing Duterte critics .

" -- Alfred Whitney Griswold <p> Liberal Arts colleges are world-class education providers that nurture crucial life skills like communication and critical thinking -- both characteristics that make graduates more globally employable . <p> The structure of this type of institution , however , differs greatly from the more traditional university model ; students explore an eclectic range of disciplines and build on a rather diverse knowledge base , which in turn opens up a gateway to a vast array of career opportunities . <p> And yet , with demand for careers in the fields of Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics -- or STEM as they are more commonly known -- on the rise , some might question the value of the modern Liberal Arts education . <p> But to these naysayers , consider this : <p> " Just 3 percent of American College graduates are educated at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Under-Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education , when she cited the achievements of Liberal Arts alumni at a higher education conference . <p> " Yet the alumni of Liberal Arts institutions account for almost 20 percent of all U.S. Presidents , " she continued , adding that , " On a per capita basis , Liberal Arts colleges today produce nearly twice as many doctorates in sciences as other institutions . " <p> If this is n't enough to get you writing up that application to a U.S. Liberal Arts institution , here are 5 more reasons why you should attend a leading-edge liberal arts college : <p> 1 . The family-like community <p> A Liberal Arts college is much smaller and more inclusive than the traditional university , providing a campus community that is both vibrant and tight-knit . Since such an institution plays host to a smaller population , students get to know each other on a much more personal level , encouraging camaraderie and a more homely campus ethos . <h> Image courtesy of Simpson University <p> But a more intimate student body is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly advantageous in terms of academics ; smaller classes mean more undivided attention from educators and encourages full student participation . <p> " The Liberal Arts create a scholarly community where professors and students learn and study together , building lifelong relationships with people from backgrounds different than their own , " says Silvio Vazquez , a Liberal Arts education professional . " Small classes promote lively , thoughtful discussions and allow teachers to know their students and work with them individually . <p> This creates a wealth of opportunities for students , who will leave with a much better chance of snatching leadership positions and landing themselves in positions of power . <p> 3 . Graduates are incredibly versatile <p> The Liberal Arts curriculum is fluid and student-specific , allowing students to try their hand at a number of topics that interest them . By definition , Liberal Arts colleges provide students an overview of the arts , humanities , mathematics , natural sciences , and social sciences , preparing them for success in more or less any career . <p> 4 . Outstanding Grad School preparation <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of top 10 institutions that produce the most students who ultimately earn doctorates . Furthermore , Liberal Arts colleges produce twice the number of graduates with PhDs in science per capita than any other type of institution . <h> Image courtesy of Le Moyne College <p> 5 . The Liberal Arts are valued by employers on a global scale <p> Graduates of the Liberal Arts enter the professional sphere with presentation , essay-writing and collaborative experience , making them highly valuable to any international employer .

With the yearly success of the " Kumbira " culinary show and the mushrooming of both famous and up and coming restaurants and food businesses offering almost all kinds of cuisines , the city has proven that it has whatever anyone 's palate demands . <p> Right smack among food business success stories is Cagayan de Oro 's very own Monster Kitchen Academy . Founded in 2008 by Jan Michael Uy and his wife Maggie Uy , the Monster Kitchen has become the city 's leading culinary and pastry school . Eight years into the business , the Academy prides in producing quality cooks and seasoned food entrepreneurs who have made great names in the country 's food industry . <p> " The reason why we named our enterprise as ' Monster Kitchen ' is because we want to ' Monsterize ' food enterprises . By being ' Monsterized ' we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And indeed , a lot of Monster Kitchen 's students throughout the years have found their own successful paths in the food business through building their own restaurants and starting their own trends in the culinary world . As a matter of fact , culinary and pastry enthusiasts come from as far as Davao , Butuan , Lanao del Sur , and Zamboanga just to learn the secrets of the craft . <p> But in spite of the success of Monster Kitchen Academy , the Uys still teach culinary and pastry arts with the highest standards as when they began years ago . <p> Maggie Uy and her husband started the business in the most humble of means without actually expecting their business to boom and even become a well-renowned cooking school . Looking back , Uy said that this culinary tradition that they have built actually started as a simple laboratory project of her husband . <p> " When my husband studied entrepreneurship in Manila , one of their requirements to graduate was to make their own business . So he decided to make a baking supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company which is a big company of packaging supplies . And so we named that baking supply enterprise as ' The Monster Kitchen ' and then , it was only after a couple of years that it became the ' Monster Kitchen Academy . ' People were asking us why do n't we offer baking classes than just selling baking supplies , " Maggie Uy narrated , <p> Because of public demand , the Monster Kitchen Academy began giving Lifestyle classes to interested students . A Lifestyle class Uy explained is a one-day tutorial on any baking technique or lesson . At the start , their Lifestyle classes were only few and they were only teaching more of the basics but as time went by and the MKA were able to tap the expertise of chefs , their courses became more elaborate . <p> " One of the many things that is good about our teaching styles here in the Monster Kitchen Academy is the fact that we really teach culinary theories first before allowing our students to make their own food . One simple example is the art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just can not adjust it or add measurements that will not work together . We make our students understand that if you are to make a decent and appetizing cake or pastry , you have to follow the rules of baking . That is why we really stick first to the theories of the books because when our students have already mastered these , they can do whatever they can in cooking , " Uy said . <p> Owner Maggie Uy also shared that Monster Kitchen is one of the only two schools in the entire country which is certified by the Wilton Cake Decorating school in the United States . She said that Wilton is one of the biggest authorities in the world when it comes to cake decorating and Monster Kitchen Academy has decided to incorporate its modules to their classes to better meet the expectation of the students . <p> Also , Uy is proud to inform Kagay-anons of Monster Kitchen Academy 's collaboration with Montessori de Oro 's K to 12 Technical-Vocational track . This is , she said , to further expand the dissemination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own schools . <p> For now , Monster Kitchen Academy has seven exclusive chef instructors who have specializations in the various fields of baking and culinary arts . The Academy offers three types of classes . First , they have the Lifestyle or Workshop classes which are one-day classes for specific recipes or cooking techniques like cupcake-making . The twelve-day Certificate classes have wider scopes of classes with modules in Baking and Culinary arts ; the graduates of which are given vocational certificates to practice in establishments or restaurants . And , lastly is the Professional classes which are composed of comprehensive tutorials from basic to advanced techniques in baking and cooking ; these classes last from three to nine months . <p> Monster Kitchen Academy now teaches some 1,000 students per year . Uy shares that one of the biggest pleasures that she is getting in this business is the part where she gets to watch her students grow in the field of culinary arts . <p> " I actually have a student here which is only 16 years old . I remember when she first presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , she was near to tears because she was very nervous about her work . But now , days later , she can create wonders in the kitchen , " Uy said . <p> To expand their influence in Mindanao and to better accommodate more students , the Monster Kitchen Academy is opening its branch in Davao later this year . <p> " It is amazing because we actually did n't expect this boom in our enterprise and school but we are thankful for the support and the success that we are receiving in the culinary field and we hope that it continues for years to come , " Uy said . <p> Published in the Sun.Star Cagayan de Oro newspaper on September 29 , 2016 . <p> DISCLAIMER : Sun.Star website welcomes friendly debate , but comments posted on this site do not necessary reflect the views of the Sun.Star management and its affiliates .

AFP File photo <p> SALT LAKE CITY , Utah -- Dante Exum remembers driving to the hoop and making a difficult layup on the first day of Utah Jazz open gym . Newly acquired George Hill , the man who will eat into Exum 's minutes , immediately came over and offered some advice . <p> That was one of the first notable moments of the Exum-Hill relationship that the Jazz hope will be beneficial to all . <p> " I think for someone just to come in straight up the first day , and not knowing me at all , to be able to come in and correct me , that 's the kind of player that I need , " Exum said . " So from then we built a good relationship . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Exum used the word " excited " repeatedly this week to describe his feelings . His mood is understandable considering he had n't participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with the Australian national team in the summer of 2015 . <p> The 21-year-old started 41 games as a rookie and is the point guard of the future for the Jazz after being selected No. 5 in the 2014 draft . But general manager Dennis Lindsey traded for Hill , an eight-year veteran chasing his first NBA title , during the offseason . <p> There could easily be some animosity between two competitors wanting as many minutes as possible , but Hill is eager to mentor and Exum wants to learn . <p> " That 's just how I am , " Hill said . " When I first got ( to San Antonio ) I was a young rookie that did n't know any better . Tim ( Duncan ) did the same thing with me . Kind of put his arm around me and kind of ( showed ) me the way . As a rookie I needed that . Me coming in , that 's what we needed here , a little veteran leadership .

" They 're smart enough to understand the opportunity they have to play with some of these guys . " <p> Exum is 100 percent healed from his injury and has no limitations in practice . He added 10 pounds of muscles to his lanky 6-foot-6 frame and said his shot is much better than during his rookie year , when he shot 34.9 percent from the field . <p> Snyder said he 's shown some burst on the court and just needs to continue to grow overall . <p> Exum has added a floater from the paint to his game -- a play that tore his ACL .

So far he has . <p> There were difficult stretches last season as Exum would sit behind the bench during home games and remain in Salt Lake City on road trips . But he was able to better learn how Snyder wants the team run by sitting with the coaches and listening each night . <p> Hill is learning the intricacies of Snyder 's system himself , but he has played in defense-first systems in Indiana and San Antonio . His best season came in 2014-15 when he averaged career highs with 16.1 points , 5.1 assists , 4.2 rebounds and a 47.7 shooting percentage . Hill 's 3-point percentage rose to a career-high 40.8 percent last season . <p> The 30-year old has missed the playoffs just once since entering the NBA and reached the Eastern Conference finals twice . That experience is part of the reason the Jazz traded for Hill , but that 's not necessarily easy to pass along . <p> " I do n't think you can teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of what we 're coming here for is to lead by example .

" <p> Almost all of those natural philosophers , and even many of those who would later identify themselves as scientists , did not get paid to do science . For them , science was a hobby . <p> Antoine Lavoisier , considered the " father of modern chemistry , " was a tax and customs administrator who used the wealth he accumulated to fund the research he did with his wife Marie-Anne at their home . Ada Lovelace , considered the " first computer programmer , " was a countess whose affluence gave her the leisure to pursue her research in mathematics and computation .

Here is a President who is working and doing the best that he can to eradicate drugs and criminality in the country . It should be a positive signal to investors and not the other way around , " he said . <p> Uncertainty is not good for business <p> According to a report by the Associated Press , analysts and businessmen point to uncertainties about Duterte 's policies and flip-flopping pronouncements as largely to blame for foreign selling in the stock market and the peso 's plunge to a seven-year low , reversing the initial optimism after his June 30 inauguration . <p> Some experts say unpredictability is slowing longer-term foreign investment in the Philippines . Photos and reports in the media of killings of suspected drug dealers and users -- more than 3,000 since July 1 -- have contributed to sagging confidence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures in place to provide for risks , " said Guenter Taus , the head of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines . " But uncertainty is a factor that we do not like in business , and that is exactly what we 're experiencing right now because we do n't know where we are heading . " <p> Taus said several companies that had intended to establish operations to the Philippines now prefer to wait and see what happens under Duterte . He declined to say which companies had changed their plans . <p> He said investors unsure about the Philippines may choose to look at other Southeast Asian countries to gain access to the region 's common market of more than 600 million people . <p> Image problem <p> The American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines said in September that while the country 's economic fundamentals are strong and its potential high , there is growing concern that Duterte 's policies and behavior could affect long-standing optimism by American businesses in the Philippines . <p> The chamber said that the large number of deaths in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that some investors are asking if the drug war " reduces the rule of law . " <p> " In addition , traditionally excellent bilateral relations between the U.S. and the Philippines have recently been strained by language from Philippine leaders , " the chamber said . Last month , before heading to the Asean summit in Laos where he had been scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama , Duterte used the Tagalog equivalent for " son of a b**** " as he told Philippine reporters he would n't accept questions from Obama about extrajudicial killings that have occurred during the drug crackdown . Obama canceled the meeting . <p> After the European Parliament recently called for an end to the drug killings and expressed concern over the scale of deaths , Duterte hit back with a profane insult and raised a fist with his middle finger thrust out . And this week , Duterte said US-Philippine joint military exercises end this year , though his foreign minister said later that they will continue until 2017 as previously agreed . <p> President Duterte also started to chart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has taken steps to bolster relations with Russia and revive ties with China that had been strained under his predecessor , Benigno Aquino III , over territorial conflicts . <p> He said he wo n't allow government forces to conduct joint patrols of disputed waters near the South China Sea with foreign powers , apparently scrapping a deal Aquino reached with the US military earlier this year . Duterte has also said he wants US forces out of the southern Philippines , saying minority Muslims there resent the presence of American troops . <p> All of this has raised concerns about a Philippine economy that grew seven percent in the second quarter and 6.9 percent over the first half of the year compared to the same periods last year -- among the fastest rates in the region . <p> The credit-rating agency S&amp;P Global warned Sept. 20 that the stability and predictability of policy making in the Philippines " has diminished somewhat under the new presidency .

It stood at $4 billion for January to June this year compared to $2.2 billion for the same period a year ago . <p> " As far as fundamentals are concerned , I think they are outstanding fundamentals , but then the sentiment is something else , " he told reporters late Wednesday on the sidelines of an economic forum . Sentiment is driven by both external and domestic factors , and it 's difficult to attribute negative sentiment to a specific factor like Duterte 's statements , he added . <p> Guinigundo said the government 's economic program follows the broad strokes that have produced 70 quarters of economic growth , low and stable inflation and a healthy banking system . " And yet the stock market is dropping and the exchange rate is moving consecutively down such as we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said Wednesday that the depreciation of the peso is a result of the strengthening of the dollar more than the weakening of the local currency , and should not be a cause for concern . <p> But Joey Cuyegkeng , ING Bank 's senior economist in Manila , said the peso was the only Asian currency that slid in the third week of September , despite favorable economic reports , including an increased balance of payment surplus in August . <p> Presidential spokesman Martin Andanar said that the fundamentals of the economy are solid and strong , and that the anti-drug campaign will enhance the Philippines ' image to attract more foreign investment . <p> In a speech to troops the day after the S&amp;P Global warning was released , Duterte shrugged off the agency 's remarks . He said if business and the economy are affected , " so be it . " " Get out , then we start on our own , " he said , apparently referring to Western investors . " I can go to China .

Thus his administration has strongly moved into an aggressive peace negotiations with the Moro rebel groups in the hope of reversing this historical inequality between the Moro people and the rest of the Filipino people . <p> The Bud Dajo massacre and that of Bud Bagsak in 1913 along with many other violent responses to the Moro wars during the American colonial period were all part of the US pacification in the Philippines which many young Filipinos hardly know about given the deficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An earlier event which was another massacre involving a hundred Filipinos -- that took place in Balangiga , Eastern Samar on September 28 , 1901 is another historic event that may have been glossed over . <p> The massacre of Moro people persisted until the contemporary era . During the early years of martial rule , on September 24 , 1974 more than a thousand male residents were shot dead inside a mosque in Barangay Malisbong , Palimbang , Sultan Kudarat by soldiers and militias . <p> And through the years there have been casualties owing to the wars that have not stopped until now . <p> Because of the manner that our educational system has deprived the youth of the land with a revisiting of these important historic moments that define our identity as Mindanawons -- by gross negligence in terms of making sure that knowledge of these historical facts are incorporated in textbooks -- President Duterte has challenged the Department of Education ( DepEd ) and Commission on Higher Education ( CHED ) to correct the historical injustice against Mindanawons and thus incorporate significant local historical narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History teachers to make sure that Mindanao 's history is well covered in their classes . Many local social scientists and educators have also pushed the State educational agencies to give more attention to this matter . In this way the dominance of the north and imperial Manila in the collective memory of our people would give way to a more integrated historical consciousness as more local knowledge constructs are also privileged and appreciated . <p> This has not been true only in reference to the Moro people but also to the Lumad ; the result of which has not led to their empowerment but also sustaining gaps in knowledge systems of our citizenry . The colonizers treated the Lumads in a harsh manner ; even their labeling of our indigenous people manifested their sheer racist and condescending postures , referring to them as " wild tribes , " primitive and pagans . At the height of the Americans ' colonization period , there were Lumad communities attacked by American soldiers like those of the Tagakaolos in Malita , the scene where a Datu Mangulayon assassinated General Edward Bolton as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive drive to push them out of their ancestral domain to set up agri-business plantations . <p> What followed after our independence only perpetuated the dominance of the outsiders over the Lumads ' lives and resources . This was especially true during the height of martial rule , but which has persisted until today . More ancestral domain territories were appropriated by the State in favor of big corporations and land-hungry peasants from the Visayas and Luzon . It started with logging operations but have now expanded to mining explorations and actual extractions leading to massive displacement of Lumad communities . And when they resisted , they were militarized and driven farther away from the ancestral abode . <p> The power constructs that allow for the production and reproduction of governance structures -- at regional , provincial , local and even barangay levels -- have reinforced the grabbing of power and control by the elite including local politicians most of whom belong to political dynasties , oligarchs and representatives of corporate firms as well as the military and police . Their habitus allows them to consolidate their economic capital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by guns , goons and gold -- very useful during the time of periodic elections . <p> Into this field comes President Rodrigo Roa Duterte with his own habitus enveloping his Digong persona brandishing his own notion of a strong leader -- in the mold of either an apocalyptic folk hero or a fearless action star -- who promises radical change . <p> Endowed with a huge political capital arising from the popular support of the vast number of the citizenry , social capital with his network of social connections and symbolic capital given his image projection that attracts adulation , he is in an extraordinary position to win the game in the game-field which is the Philippine political landscape today . He has also surrounded himself with members of his Cabinet who provides further resources to put the stakes even higher in terms of effecting radical change that could lead to structural changes . <p> Since his election campaign up to the present , he has challenged the centralized structures of the State governance system by proposing a federal system . He has vowed to end the oligarchs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to the anti-mining drive of his Secretary of the Department Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) , Ms. Gina Lopez . He appointed a left-leaning peasant leader to head the Department of Agrarian Reform ( DAR ) who is set to push for a genuine land reform more radical than CARP . He has placed Mr. Jun Evasco , a known social reformist to head the government 's anti-poverty agenda . He has put an end to the dislocation of the Lumads and the killing of their leaders and paved their way for their return to their ancestral domains . He promised there will be no demolitions of informal settlers without clear relocation sites . And above all , he has promised to end all kinds of rebellions and wars plaguing our populations especially in Mindanao by forging peace talks with both the CPP-NPA-NDF ( Communist Party of the Philippines-New Peoples Army-National Democratic Front ) and the Moro rebels , as well as running after the Abu Sayaff until they are pulverized . <p> In this connection , he provides us a new scenario of power sharing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State and were subject to arrest and imprisonment on account of their subversion of the democratic nation . He has given his peace negotiators a lot of leeway to deal with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front leadership assuring them that he fully supports a peace negotiation with them . Even the " rebel-on-the-run " leader of the Moro National Liberation Front -- the discredited Nur Missuari charged with the crimes related to the Zamboanga siege -- has been provided some legitimization as the Norwegian kidnap victim of the Abu Sayaff was first presented to him before he was turned over to the State functionaries . And look who his recent guests were at a dinner in Malacanang : no less than the members of the top hierarchy of the CPP-NPA-NDF to the consternation of some disgruntled military men upset with this act of dining with the enemy . <p> Indeed , the field of power and knowledge constructs in the country today is very fertile for the planting of Duterte 's vision of a radical change needed by the body politic . Only time will tell if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when the trees of these efforts will bear fruit ; and if we will still be around during that time when it will be ripe to pick the fruits . <p> But there are those among us who have worries of the future , as we see a dark cloud hovering ; and under this cloud lurks shadows that forebode of still more tragic things to come . Already there is a growing concern as to the more than 3,000 killings that have taken place in view of President Duterte 's drug war ; many of which can be considered extrajudicial killings . This field of governance has proven to be quite problematic , as power to decide on who lives or dies lies in the hand of only the President and his Philippine National Police officials , with a backing of his political allies and members of the military . The concentration of power within this elite group -- who are mainly male and militaristic in perspective -- has spawned a knowledge perspective of what primarily ails the nation that needs to be fought with all the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilize . This has resulted in the rise of a Foucaldian landscape where the powerful 's gaze arising out of the panopticum of Malacanang is concentrated on this phenomenon . <p> This knowledge perspective is contrary to a post-modern reading of the root causes and nature of drug addiction and the ensuing treatment required to those who are addicted to all kinds of chemical and alcohol substances . The power-that-be 's take on the drug menace is already considered outdated and passe by those who would know better but are not consulted in the process of finding out the Habermasian " best argument " as to how this menace should be faced for the greater good of the body politic . <p> And for now , one of the big mistakes of the Duterte Presidency has been to demonize and sacrifice the discourse of human rights , just because those in power desperately want this war against drugs to succeed , come hell or high water .

This is what a network of combined real and fake accounts on social media can achieve in a matter of minutes . <p> Over the past several weeks , we monitored several suspicious accounts connected to various online Facebook groups . <p> One account alone we determined to be fake was connected ( as of October 6 , 2016 ) to about 2.9 million members of various overseas Filipino groups associated with Ferdinand " Bongbong " Marcos Jr , and other hobby groups . Another fake account was linked to over 990,000 members of groups supporting President Rodrigo Duterte , and still another was connected to an estimated 3.8 million members of various overseas Filipino organizations and buy-and-sell groups . <p> Imagine the impact of a single message sent from just one fake account and spread to these hundreds of thousands of Facebook accounts . Even assuming only 10% actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrong information can still be damaging . They can convincingly manufacture reality on social media as they wish , transforming perception to reality , and swaying opinion on the basis of perceived number and power . <p> In the Philippines , with a population of 100 million , there are an estimated 47 million active Facebook accounts as of 2015 . <p> In the 2016 elections , Facebook recorded about 22 million Filipino Facebook users interacting and actively talking about , and debating over the elections with friends and their respective connections . Yet , most political campaigners belittled the ability of social media to sway voters and influence voting -- some political camps said it was just all noise with little power for conversion . <p> Something interesting happened , however , in the last quarter of 2015 , as candidates geared up for the campaign . <p> Nest of ' sock puppets ' <p> John Victorino , an investment analyst who has been working overseas for the last 7 years , and who has monitored a nest of online accounts for at least 3 months already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts . <p> He called them " sock puppets " or fake accounts . Sock puppets are used to either amplify a message , drown out a contrary or conflicting message , or even create a false sense of the popularity of an idea or cause through amplification and spread . <p> Some of these sock puppets , aptly named because they act according to how a puppeteer motions them , post in existing online forums on Facebook -- political groups , hobbyists , buy-and-sell , and even OFW groups , Victorino observed . The infiltration is subtle , and the undiscerning could very well fall into the trap of interacting with and helping create activity within a group or discussion thread . <p> Victorino said some of the accounts he watched closely were created fairly recently , in the last quarter of 2015 , in the lead up to the May 2016 elections . Those who were part of this nest shared common practices : <p> They used profile photos of celebrities or other sexy-looking persons instead of their own <p> They used cover photos like gardens and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They had similar liked pages such as Okay Dito and Ask Philippines <p> They had less than 50 friends <p> One of them , linked to groups whose members number over 2.8 million as of early October , is a certain " Mutya Bautista " , a supposed software analyst at ABS-CBN . She uses the profile picture of pop star Im Yoona of Girl 's Generation , a South Korean KPop group , and has ties to over 160 groups -- the biggest of which is BongBong Marcos United at over 160,000 members , and other overseas Filipino workers groups like Pinoy OFW sa UAE with over 67,000 members . <p> A check with ABS-CBN showed that " Mutya Bautista , " who has only 21 friends , was and is not connected with the media giant , just like several others such as " Jovelyn Mayor " , " Lenny de Jesus " , " Babylyn Ventura " , " Kim Montes " , and " Julius Marquez " who all also claimed to be with ABS-CBN . <p> " Lily Lopez " also declared herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She used as her profile picture the photo of former Miss Korea and now actress Kim Sa-rang . She also happens to be a Facebook " friend " of the fake " Mutya Bautista " . <p> Another interesting profile is that of " Luvimin Cancio " , who sourced her profile photo from softcorecams.com . This was established via tineye.com . She has 46 friends -- many of them sock puppets too sharing the same characteristics , and some of them appearing to be real people . <p> A fourth Facebook account , that of " Jasmin De La Torre " , shows the exact same cover photo as Lily Lopez . She only has 14 friends as of October 7 but is a member of various groups whose members total almost a million . <p> There is also the account of " Raden Alfaro Payas " , who has links to over 200 groups with over 3.8 million members . Raden uses another profile picture also of Im Yoona . He however describes himself as a senior engineer at Northrup Grumman Corporation and lives in Grand Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 5 , about 13 of them part of the nest of 26 sock puppets watched closely by Victorino . Among Raden 's friends is someone with an identical name but who appears to be a real person . <p> The same real person Raden has over 1,300 friends , among them at least 16 with fake accounts . He also creates a page as a public figure with likes of over 1,200 people . <p> How falsehood spreads <p> To illustrate how one misleading and false information can be spread using a mix of trolls and real people , Victorino pointed to identical posts by " Mutya Bautista " and the real person Raden Alfaro Payas shared with the groups BongBong Marcos United and Bongbong Marcos Loyalist Facebook Warriors last June : <p> Similarly there was a post from the fake account of " Luvimin Cancio " on the Rody R. Duterte Movement group about " alleged martial law victims " posted last September 28 on a blog , why0why.com . <p> The blog also said : " Martial law victims should tell young generation that ' pasaway kami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why we were imprisoned . ) <p> Affirmed by what appears to be another account of Raden Alfaro Payas , created only last September 21 , information about victims of Martial Law is twisted and reaffirmed by another troll or fake account . <p> Efficient use of social media <p> Social media by itself can be empowering for the disadvantaged and those without access to mainstream media . <p> For instance , Nic Gabunada , who was part of the presidential campaign of then Davao mayor Rodrigo Duterte , said limited campaign funds forced them to be creative in using the social media space . Duterte 's campaign budget was nowhere near the budget of other presidential contenders , if political ads were any indication . In the past , presidential campaigns were said to cost anywhere between P1 billion to P3 billion . <p> In an interview last June with Rappler , Gabunada , who was part of the Duterte campaign communications team , said his P10-million budget allowed him to tap into a robust volunteer network of about 400-500 whose individual networks at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having about 800,000 members . <p> It was these " warriors " on social media who delivered the presidency to Duterte , who won with over 16.6 million votes -- convincingly and overwhelmingly over his strongest rival Manuel " Mar " Roxas II who got over 9.9 million votes . <p> In contrast , the battle for the vice presidency was intense and breathlessly close between Leni Robredo of the Liberal Party and Marcos . Robredo edged out Marcos , garnering 14.4 million votes compared to his 14.2 million votes . <p> Duterte campaign insiders admitted they used trolls or fake accounts and paid for them , along with " influencers " on social media , essentially people or accounts that had a huge following . There was no unanimity of opinion within the Duterte camp , however , as some like Duterte social media director Pompee La Vi ? a were reported to have favored more engagement over the use of trolls . <p> It was Gabunada who had part command over the efficient network that included overseas Filipino workers ( OFWs ) and even regional groups in Luzon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were messages of the week or of the month cascaded to what he called " parallel groups " or the Duterte " warriors " . <p> They had administrator or " admin coordinators " in various chat rooms that already existed . A chat group of admins constituted the " super admins " . <p> Gabunada explained that it could be a chat group of 20 people who could each be administering two to 5 chat groups or pages . " Their whole principle is organizing for social media effectiveness , " Gabunada said . <p> But even after an overwhelming victory with over 16 million votes , Gabunada explained there was a need to continue campaigning because they got " only 40% of the votes " and needed more than that to allow Duterte to effectively govern . <p> He admitted there were some groups " na talagang palaban , matigas ulo ( really combative , hard-headed ) ... sometimes we felt they were out of control so mahirap ma-associate doon ( it was hard to be associated with them ) . " <p> At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they could be at play even today , Duterte supporters say . <p> Fast-forward to the present , months after Duterte won as president , there is evidence that trolls are still very much alive . These trolls " seed " messages taken from blogs and pages , and which are then amplified by other trolls and spread through members of bigger groups . The messages are beneficial to various political camps and interests , creating a false notion of what is true and what is real . <p> Propaganda agents and propagators <p> In addition to the activities of the trolls , there are also noticeable " propaganda pages " associated with Duterte . <p> In September of this year , du30newsinfo.com was observed to have at least 13 agents or spammers who posted over 4,000 posts in more than 40 groups . An account is classified as an agent or spammer if it had posted more than 100 items in groups in a single month from a single website or page alone . The 4,000 posts resulted in a cumulative 170,000-plus shares . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least five of these posts received more than 1,000 shares . This is how one post can go viral very quickly . <p> Besides that , newsph.info , with only 5 agents generated over 50,000 shares from only 1,300 posts during the same period . Similarly , nowreader.com generated 39,000 shares from over 1,100 posts of only 3 agents . <p> In the same month , the site whose content is regularly shared by the troll Luvimin Cancio , OKD2.com , got 11,900 shares from only 716 posts . <p> From August 1 to September 20 , some accounts were observed to be sharing the same links more than 7 times on average with different groups . Our tally showed that each of the top 10 " spammers " who mentioned Senator Leila de Lima , a recent favorite , posted at least 200 messages during that period . <p> Interestingly , on October 5 , one account was observed to be sharing a link about alleged drug lord Jaybee Sebastian to 23 different groups in rapid succession , merely copy-pasting text for each post . The interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time stamps . <p> The frequency of posts of sock puppets and real persons alike indicate any of several things : <p> posters who pretty much post and share content to their liking throughout the day are dedicated followers or supporters of whoever they are supporting <p> posts are automated <p> posts can be misused as an effective tool of harassment <p> posters copy-paste and share content for a living <p> ' Business partners ' <p> How much are trolls paid -- whether for political or commercial purposes ? <p> In one page for commercial purposes , for example , repeated call-outs were made for " business partners " who were required in 2015 to spend 3-5 hours daily on Facebook . Payment was supposed to range conservatively from P1,000 a day to P10,000 a month , with training provided . <p> The Inquirer had reported that some trolls even get paid from P2,000 to P3,000 a day just by copy-pasting content . This explains the uniform posts or comments seen on Facebook . Clearly , trolling has become and can become an even more lucrative business . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too evident . It can result in beliefs or convictions anchored on false premises . Different versions of what is supposed to be the one true fact can be manufactured , creating confusion and deep-seated schisms among groups who get to believe that their version of the truth is what is real and correct . <p> Expose the fake , do n't engage <p> What to do , given a virtual world of manufactured truth and reality ? <p> Spot and actively call out the fake accounts , the sock puppets , the trolls . <p> Gather evidence and report them . <p> Do n't bother to engage them because it is a lost cause . <p> Help clean up the social media space and restore it to what it used to be , or at least a semblance of what it used to be . <p> Abandoning social media and not challenging lies being peddled and spread is losing by default to the trolls and propagandists . <p> In August this year , Archbishop Socrates Villegas spoke to a group of youth leaders and priests during a clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . He told them about the boiling frog syndrome . Easy to find on Google , the anecdote about how a frog can slowly be boiled alive without it realizing what 's happening was shared by Villegas . <p> If it 's thrown into a pot of boiling water , a frog would jump out . But if it 's put in cold or lukewarm water which is slowly put to a boil , the frog will not sense the danger until it is cooked to death . The frog takes in the water and frolics in it before it realizes too late that because the water has already become too hot , it 's already impossible to get out . <p> The parallelisms of the boiling frog syndrome with the lies being propagated , tolerated , and accepted are easy to see . Without doing anything , users of social media may find themselves no different from the desensitized frog slowly cooked in the heat and the fire . <p> The battle to preserve truth has shifted online and is no longer fought in the streets alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without timely intervention , it could evolve into a monster that could devour and swallow us all . -- with John Victorino and Wayne Manuel/Rappler.com <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .

The massive spillover effects of such on-going financial events like the rise and fall of interest rates is beyond the control of the government of any country . This being the case , it is unfair for the critics of President Duterte to blame him for every financial problem that affects our monetary stability . <p> Let 's take as an example the so-called bank bail-ins . Certainly , the impact of this monetary scheme to our banking system will be felt in our country soon . I am sure our banks are well-informed about bank bail-ins . <p> Nobody thought , until recently that the so-called bank " bail-ins " will become a reality . What , one may ask is bail-in ? In simple layman 's term , a bail-in happens when capital is pooled together from the failed bank 's own stockholders and creditors as differentiated from government bail-out for banks . <p> Let me share the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global financial crisis in 2008 ( Lehman bankruptcy case ) , the US government and the Federal Reserve spent trillions of dollars to stabilize the financial markets . Expectedly , the national debt ballooned to almost $20 trillion . In this situation , the US government and the Federal Reserve can no longer bail out banks that collapse like the Lehman Brothers Holding Inc . <p> And so , in 2010 under the Obama administration , the US Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act whereby the US Congress enacted laws that gave the US Government power to freeze and seize citizens bank accounts to save the banks by " bail-ins " ( capital pooled together from the failed banks own stockholders and creditors as differentiated from government bail-outs for banks ) . In short , the government has absolute power to freeze all bank accounts and use the deposited money of citizens with certain limits to pay the banks creditors . <p> *The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act above-mentioned is similar to the so-called " total loss absorbing capacity " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced sometime in November , 2015 by the G20 . This group ( G20 ) is composed of the finance ministers and central bank governors of nineteen ( 19 ) countries .

The 19 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom and the United States of America . <p> From Internet reports , if a bank ( in a country-member of G20 ) is failing and the government fails to bail the bank from collapsing , then the bank can take the depositors money and convert it into shares of equity of the bank .

This TLAC proposal of the G20 is scheduled to be formally implemented in 2019 . <p> *After some Central Banks around the world stopped using the so-called zero interest rate , said central banks experimented using another monetary scheme -- the negative interest rate scheme . Let me explain about the zero interest rates ( ZIRP ) before discussing the negative interest rate . ZIRP is a policy taken by a central bank to keep/maintain the base interest rate at zero ( or near to zero ) percent hoping to stimulate demand in the economy by making the supply of money cheaper . Under ZIRP , the central banks maintain a zero ( 0 ) percent nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , Japan , United Kingdom and several European Union member-nations . <p> *Going back to the negative interest scheme ... this is how it works . The depositors are actually charged to keep their money in a bank account . Meaning , that borrowers are being paid to borrow someone else 's money . The term used for interest rates going below zero is " zero lower bound . " <p> Strangely , there are some central banks that have decided to try the negative interest rate policy on commercial banks ' excess funds held on deposit at the central banks -- to stimulate economic growth and to raise inflation . Actually , private sector banks that use the negative interest rates have to pay to park their money with the central banks . <p> Now that the different scenarios of bail-ins is explained , let us relate this monetary scheme to what is happening in some European banks . <p> From recent Internet reports and financial news , we know that , at least two ( 2 ) European banks , are experiencing losses .

Putin gave flowers to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and to Peng Liyuan , the wife of China 's President Xi Jinping . <p> Relations between Russia and the United States may be strained and Putin may be anti-American ; but the two countries cooperate in programs like the ones geared towards nuclear arms reduction and space exploration . <p> And Putin 's friends include former US president George W.

Our rate increases , while high by our standards , are generally lower than in other states . And if you 're willing to be flexible , most of you can limit your premium increases to no more than 5 percent . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " If you hear something 's happening in one state , it does n't necessarily mean it 's happening in California , " says James Scullary , spokesman for Covered California , the state health insurance exchange . <p> Today , I 'm going to pass along five pieces of advice for those of you with Covered California or open market health plans . Open enrollment for those plans begins Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31 , 2017 . <p> Not painless <p> But I 'm sorry to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to avoid the biggest rate hikes -- and perhaps even see your premiums drop -- you may need to make difficult choices : Are you willing to change plans , and perhaps lose your beloved doctor ?

This year , it will be especially important , " says Dena Mendelsohn , a staff attorney at Consumers Union who specializes in health care . <p> Case in point : Nancy De La Torre , an enrollment specialist with the Community Health Initiative of Kern County , recently helped two gentlemen renew their Covered California plans . After studying their options , they decided to switch from PPOs to HMOs . <p> As a result , De La Torre says , one man 's premium will drop from $116 per month to $2 a month after his tax credits are applied , and the other 's from $53 to $1 . <p> Do n't do this alone <p> My most important piece of advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Covered California customers face a statewide average rate hike of 13.2 percent in 2017 , but your specific increase depends on many factors , including where you live , which insurer you choose , your income , age and family size . <p> Certified insurance agents and enrollment counselors can guide you through the application or renewal process , often face-to-face , and help you manage all of these variables . <p> " Always come to someone who can assist you , " De La Torre says . " There might be an option you 're not seeing on your own .

Acronyms such as HMO and PPO determine what your network of doctors and hospitals will look like , which in turn affects price . <p> For instance , HMOs generally cost less than PPOs , but you must stay within network to get coverage . <p> Note that Anthem Blue Cross next year will convert a majority of its PPOs in California to EPOs -- or Exclusive Provider Organizations -- which offer no coverage out of network , except in emergencies , Mendelsohn says . <p> " It really depends on how much choice consumers want to have , " she says . <p> Coverage levels also affect premium cost . When choosing a plan , enrollees must select a " metal tier " ( bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much they will pay out of their own pockets for care .

More on that later . <p> Check networks <p> If you 're thinking about switching plans to save money , remember that different plans cover different doctors and hospitals . <p> " I have a lot of clients who say , ' I want to keep my family doctor , ' " Zhang says .

Do you have medications you have to take on a regular basis ? Do you have a chronic condition ? " asks Maria Romero-Mora , director of programs for California Coverage &amp; Health Initiatives . <p> If you do , the bronze plan probably is n't wise , even though it comes with the cheapest monthly premium . <p> You may want to consider one of the silver , gold or platinum plans , which have higher premiums but lower co-pays for prescription drugs and medical care . <p> " The bronze plan is designed for people who might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's more of a safety net .

The government " is also picking up part of it . " <p> If you 've accounted for the increase in tax credits , shopped around , done the math and still face a big rate hike , you may be tempted to drop coverage and pay the Obamacare tax penalty instead . <p> Before you do that , here 's one more equation for you to crunch : The basic penalty for not having health insurance next year will be $695 per adult ( half of that for kids ) or 2.5 percent of your adjusted household income , whichever is greater .

She was introduced to running by her husband Clark nearly 30 years ago and averages two half-marathons a year .

@@15421236 <h> When the forest ... angels take over <p> BY this time , many would 've already swooned over the leads in Fallen . By this time , people may have forgotten this unique film , titled Baboy Halas . But , while Ella Fitzgerald sings " Miss Otis Regrets " in the background , a song about love being gone , let me remind you that angels and forests are wild and lovely metaphors about our world , or what we know about it . <p> Let me address the more regular , i.e. , common , film . It 's called Fallen and since there are angels in the story , it is okay to be ready about Lucifer and the day the devils were born . For those who introduced to the faith by way of parochial schools and Catholic high schools , the words about the big battle among angels is so big deal . We really do n't need the formal accent of Joely Richardson to lecture us about the story of the Fallen Angels . <p> Well , let 's get to the story . Based on the book of the same title by Lauren Kate , Fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not handsome , who is so mysterious . Luce is intrigued by his presence . In breathy scenes that never get above the decibel of a whisper , the two talk at close length . <p> With their faces separated only by a thousand tiny angels dancing on a flame , they are always , it seems , about to kiss each other . Or , eat each other 's face . Nothing happens , though , amid their intimacy . Something is stopping them . We find out later that it 's Daniel who is pulling back . <p> The case is hopeless . We want them to fall in love and they do , but physical intimacy appears to be out of the question . What a boring proposition . What 's in the kiss or the touch of lips ? A flurry of Greek mythologies and other cautionary tales fly in our face . Is there a taboo ? It ca n't be . Is there a curse ? <p> Before we get to the curse and malediction , the film takes a serious look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher talks forever about angels and heavens and , well , demons , as if the syllabus has been built about those themes . <p> The students are not surprised at all their class has become a fusion of Catholic eschatology , elementary hermeneutics and moral theology delivered by a mentor who is damn serious about her pedantry . As it turns out , this teacher , Miss Bliss , also knows why Daniel is avoiding Luce . <p> Maybe " avoiding " is n't really the word . Maybe trying hard to be evasive describes more the situation Daniel always places himself in . Luce , of course , wonders and wonders about the aloofness that comes over this eye candy of a man . In another film , the question " Is he gay ? " should have long , long ago cropped up . But there 's mystery here that 's more flamboyantly gothic rather than flamingly outing . <p> We find out in the end . The kiss is dangerous to Luce and heartbreaking to Daniel . <p> The film is so slow that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of excitement . The announcement of Daniel that he is a Fallen Angel gets to be the most prosaic of revelations . The wings of angels , though , are breathtaking . When Daniel flies off with Luce to a place where , the Angel assures , she will be safe , we ache for the appearance of Lucifer who , we assume , will even be cuter and hotter than Daniel . But the greatest Fallen Angel of them all takes a long time to fly in . In our catetchism , a mere mention of the Devil will bring him rushing to you . That is how I remember my religion class . <p> Fallen stars Addison Timlin as Luce and Jeremy Irvine as Daniel . The film is directed by Scott Hicks . <p> There are no angels making ordinary appearance in Baboy Halas . There 's only this eternal swath of green forests that fill the horizon . And , I believe , given the death of wooded areas on this earth , that is even more angelic . Let me stretch my metaphor : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagane Fiola 's Baboy Halas . The film is an attempt not to exoticize the communities we endear to call " tribes . " <p> Using people from the community , the film chronicles the ordinary life of the forest people . We have seen this kind of exercise from documentarians . In fact , National Geographic comes to mind . But Bagane Fiola has a different take on the subject matter . <p> The film has a camera trained on the forest . The feeling is one is looking into the lives of people in a location , a setting that we are familiar with but are now looking at , in a different way , for the first time <p> The forest community , first of all , is not the stereotype form we have gotten used to . We can also put it this way : there 's a radically different stereotyping happening in the film . <p> The filmmaker follows individuals as they negotiate the forest areas . As they walk through dense foliage and some clearings , it 's as if the filmmaker is showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , about how arduous life in that setting can be . What happens is that we , the audience , are prodded to ask the question : How , indeed , can one find his way through the forest ? Indeed , how can one live in the hut set up on the canopy of the trees ? Indeed , how can one go through life almost bare ? <p> If there 's one great lesson we learn from the wilderness of Baboy Halas is that we , in the lowland or those not of the forest community , can never live there again . <p> Some critics praise Baboy Halas for allowing us access to the forest or to the culture of people we have no knowledge about . And yet , the lesson of the film and its forest can be found not in the understanding of the people in the plot but in the wonderment that their ways of life engage us to think about their survival . The hostility of the forest is the precious gift of Baboy Halas and not in any epiphany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film shows one of the " lead characters " going deep into the forest and staying there till nightfall . The sound of nocturnal animals and the gurgling of the stream are pure terror . The magic for the audience , of course , is that we are the only ones terrified . After all , what the film offers , not by insight , but by observation , is how the camera always moves away from any series of human activities . Then the screen is filled with the verdant hue of the forest , the humans banished , unseen in the bigness and power of nature . <p> Baboy Halas is one of the entries to the recently concluded Quezon City International Film Festival . Bagane Fiola , the director , is one of the newest discoveries of the film festival , proof there are good filmmakers outside the dark forest called showbiz . n

Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense , it is a moral imperative , " he added . <p> According to the report , the combined human and economic impacts of extreme weather on poverty are far more devastating than previously understood . In the East Asia and Pacific region alone , disaster damages are 50 percent more than previous estimates , totaling $200 billion per year . <p> In all of the 117 countries studied , the effect on well-being , measured in terms of lost consumption , is found to be larger than asset losses . Because disaster losses disproportionately affect poor people , who have a limited ability to cope with them , the report estimates that impact on well-being in these countries is equivalent to consumption losses of about $520 billion a year . This outstrips all other estimates by as much as 60 percent . <p> With the climate summit , Conference of Parties 22 , under way , the report 's findings underscore the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Poor people are typically more exposed to natural hazards , losing more as a share of their wealth and are often unable to draw on support from family , friends , financial systems , or governments . <p> " Unbreakable " uses a new method of measuring disaster damages , factoring in the unequal burden of natural disasters on the poor . <p> Like the impact of Haiyan in the Philippines , Myanmar 's 2008 Cyclone Nargis severely hit the poor . <p> It forced up to half of the country 's poor farmers to sell off assets including land , to relieve the debt burden following the cyclone , the report said . Economic and social repercussions of Nargis will be felt for generations . The report assesses , for the first time , the benefits of resilience-building interventions in the countries studied . <p> These include early-warning systems , improved access to personal banking , insurance policies and social-protection systems , like cash transfers and public-works programs that could help people better respond to and recover from shocks . <p> It finds that these measures combined would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the overall impact of disasters on well-being by 20 percent . <p> " Countries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change , " said Stephane Hallegatte , a GFDRR lead economist , who led preparation of the report . <p> " Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that can not be avoided . With risk policies in place that we know to be effective , we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty .

Double-round robin , top two go straight to the finals . It 's a format that rewards season-long excellence , depth and coaching vision and as proof of how competitive the schools are , four different teams made the finals in the past two years . <p> The three-year experience in Cesafi football shows change is good and that sometimes the people themselves who are batting for change are reluctant to change .

He encourages me , even as he teases that no one else in the world will speak as my daughter and I do . Despite my relatively deep-cuts vocabulary , my accent and confusing verb tenses give away immediately that I 'm not a native speaker . I moved to Saudi when I was a baby and to the US at 15 .

I remember feeling this excited about learning Filipino in the first grade when I started with the alphabet ( a , abaca , b , bola ... ) , pointing to things in our house and asking my parents to " say it in Filipino . " I was 7 , maybe , when I noticed the word " tampon " on the side of public restroom bins and I smiled because I thought that it was the word " tapon , " ( to throw ) misspelled . <p> The irony is that I became proficient in Filipino when I arrived in Connecticut , USA , where I shared a couple payphones with about 30 girls in my boarding school hall . As the only Filipino in that school , Filipino became my secret language . I could talk freely about everything with my parents and sisters in Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting across from me . <p> Recently , my sister Myra and I attended Rachel and Nino Alejandro 's concert in Rhode Island , and we understood all their jokes .

These days , my bilinguality is something I 'm proud of , even grateful for , though it was n't always this way . <p> There was a time when I was so ashamed of being Filipino that I pretended I could not speak Tagalog . There is a Tagalog aphorism that translates roughly to " He who does not recognize where he comes from smells ranker than rotting fish .

There is no satisfying translation for nakakagigil ( trembling thrill ) , lambing ( tenderness ) , or iniibig kita ( I love you ) in English and I think it 's because the Philippine culture makes room for those words , those feelings , to exist . <p> To gigil , for example , feels perfectly normal when I 'm in the Philippines but it feels novel , precious , when I do it in New England where I live . In fact , when my husband watched the last 30 minutes of Four Sisters and a Wedding ( with subtitles , of course ) with me , he said , " I understand you even better now .

I accept that what she will know about being Filipino will come from my sisters and me , but not from her community , her town , or her country . <p> And I accept , too , that some day , my girl might choose to reject whatever parts of her are Filipino .

After all , my parents gave me that freedom to choose , too . <p> But , if and when she 's ready to learn more about what courses through her , I like to think that she 'll find solace and joy in the cadence of our shared language , so that when she hears " Mahal kita " ( I love you ) or " Lahat ito , para sa ' yo , " ( All this is for you ) she wo n't need anyone to translate it for her . <p> She 'll already know . <p> I love you .

And no doubt most of the PlayStation 4-owning crowd will be playing this most-awaited title on the first day of release . For the few who are quite unsure , that 's understandable . This game has been stuck in development hell for quite some time now and it has gone through dozens of trailers that ended up nowhere . But after getting the opportunity to play the first 3 hours of the game , I can tell you that it 'll most probably worth the decade wait . <p> And here 's why : <p> One of the most impressive open worlds <p> Western RPGs like Witcher 3 and Skyrim are famous for their incredible and beautiful open worlds , but Final Fantasy XV may give them a run for their money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the massive world of Final Fantasy . <p> To give you a perspective , the media were given three hours by Sony to explore Chapters 1 through 3 . Most did n't even reach Chapter 2 just because of the sheer number of side-missions to complete and the places you can explore . <p> I managed to power through Chapter 2 and ignore some of the activities , but I was still thoroughly distracted from the main quest . And even if you 're not into side-missions , you can still get stuck driving and marveling about just how gorgeous Final Fantasy XV 's world is . <p> From the vast dessert to the beautiful sunny beach coast to the cavernous ruins , I was awe-struck by the level of detail and attention given to this game . And this bright and slightly modern fantasy world we get to play in is honestly just a breath of fresh air from all the gritty medieval fantasy worlds we 've gone through in recent months . <p> Eye-candy graphics with no perceptible problems in performance <p> The cinematic trailers were impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there were those who took issue with the reported " downgrading " of the graphics , I 'd say the quality of the visuals right now is still enough to drop jaws . To add to that , the demo I played ran on a standard PS4 and I was pleasantly surprised that it was able to run smoothly despite the amount of detail and texture brought into this game . <p> The animation is stunning and the combat is just pure eye-candy . It reminded me a bit of the flurry and flourish of Devil May Cry , Bayonetta and other fast-paced action games but Final Fantasy XV 's action just looks better . It 's not as fast as the aforementioned games but it 's fluid . And the sparks and sounds that come with every strike against an opponent will even give you a subtle reminder of the old Final Fantasy games . <p> Of course , with this being a Japanese RPG , you can expect that the characters have porcelain smooth skin textures that could rival your favorite Korean-pop stars ' . Couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that they 're both ready to kill and burst into song and dance in the middle of nowhere . But these observations aside , one can really see how much Final Fantasy XV has come in terms of character animation and graphics . The characters ' movements are more fluid and the fact that they are sometimes subject to mundane tasks make it even eerily realistic . <p> A Final Fantasy plot with down-to-earth characterization <p> Noctis , being a prince whose father just got murdered , is not exactly relatable , but Director Hajimete Tabata was true to his word when he said that the game would still show some relevance to our daily lives . This is most apparent during Noctis ' road trip with his friends/body guards and whenever he 's tasked to do random errands for NPCs . <p> Often times I found myself laughing at the prospect of a prince having to retrieve and deliver items for different folks but nonetheless , the friendly banter , the voices of concern and the teamwork displayed by Noctis and friends was heartwarming to see . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geralt of Rivia can go on long trips without the need for sleep , Noctis and their friends do . While it first rubbed me the wrong way when Ignis kept suggesting that we make camp or crash in a hotel in the evening , it makes sense in reality to do so . Getting some rest will allow you to level up and it will also give you a chance to reap a few benefits . When you 're camping , Ignis ' home cooked food will give you a full day 's boost of different stats . And if you manage to procure better ingredients , you will also get better boosts . <p> A long enjoyable trip <p> All in all , I am genuinely looking forward to Final Fantasy XV . From what I 've seen so far I have high hopes for this game . That being said it is n't perfect . I expect that the new combat system will rub a few gamers the wrong way and from my experience it would take some time to get used to it . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks that feel very much like every MMORPG but we still have to hold judgment for the full release to see if these quirks can easily be overlooked . <p> Final Fantasy XV is off to a good start and I feel like this would be a long and enjoyable title . The game wants you to take your time with it and not rush to its conclusion . The frequent breaks , the gorgeous scenery , and the good amount of distraction all give me the impression that this is a game best taken slowly . Tabata did mention that this game will roughly be around 200 hours long so it makes sense that we should relish it as much as we can . <p> Excited for Final Fantasy XV ?

I think the team right now overachieved , and I ? m really happy for them . " <p> Back in 2002 , the Ateneo Blue Eagles put on one of the most memorable campaigns in UAAP history , by capturing the UAAP men 's basketball title , snapping a 13-year title drought , and in the process a four-year De La Salle dynasty . <p> Fast-forward fourteen years later , the Ateneo Blue Eagles are back in the post season and are looking to break a three-year title and Finals drought . <p> One of the pillars of that magical 2002 champion team , Wesley Gonzales , says that he sees some similarities between that 2002 team and this 2016 team , which includes the Blue Eagles ' defensive presence . <p> " I think , for one , they 're peaking perfectly , they 're picking up their game , especially in the second half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During our time , it was really our concentration , kumbaga main focus coming into the games . " <p> One more similarity between the 2002 and 2016 teams were that they share the distinction of preventing a DLSU sweep in the eliminations . <p> Back in 2002 , the Green Archers were favored to win their fifth straight crown . With a team led by Mark Cardona , Mike Cortez and BJ Manalo , they appeared poised to sweep the season , until they ran into the streaking Blue Eagles , behind future professional stars in Gonzales , LA Tenorio , Enrico Villanueva , Rich Alvarez , and Larry Fonacier . <p> In 2016 , the Green Archers were once again an unstoppable basketball machine , armed with super-import Ben Mbala , Jeron Teng , and a supporting cast that could easily be divided and turned into two Final Four-worthy teams in the UAAP . The Archers were once again expected to steamroll their way into the finals , until the young Eagles unleashed their brand of ' mayhem ' on DLSU . <p> Immediately after the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media , implying that the upset was reminiscent of the 2002 season . <p> Gonzales , who was actually there , somehow agrees with the sentiments , and hopes that the 2016 Eagles can manage to go all the way as well . <p> " Kind of , especially when they beat La Salle . Sila yung naka-stop , kasi everyone was expecting La Salle to sweep the eliminations . Medyo , in a way , na-feel ko na ' Wow , this is what happened during our time . ' and hopefully , mag-tuloy tuloy . " <p> With the departure of long-time stars Kiefer Ravena and Von Pessumal , plus the exits of would-have-been key guys in Jerie Pingoy , Hubert Cani , Arvin Tolentino , and CJ Perez , the expectations for the Blue Eagles were set low . <p> Very little expected the Katipunan squad to break into the Final Four , let alone clinch a twice-to-beat advantage . The second place finish after the eliminations surprised even Gonzales , who said he expected the Eagles to get into the Final Four , but definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Definitely , lalo na kung alam mo na maraming natanggal , syempre bumaba yung expectations .

" <p> Now , the 2016 Ateneo Blue Eagles find themselves backed in a corner , in the second game of a semifinals series , pretty much like they were back in 2002 against the James Yap-led UE Red Warriors . <p> The difference however this year , is that they are the ones that have relinquished a twice-to-beat advantage . If you ask some , they 're still deemed as the underdogs against defending champions FEU . <p> Whatever the case , should the Blue Eagles find a way past FEU , they 'll be meeting De La Salle again in the Finals .

Cortisol promotes muscle breakdown and makes your body store fat in the abdominal area . Hello Santa belly ! Cortisol also increases the production of cholesterol , which we all know clogs arteries , increasing blood pressure and the risk of getting stroke or heart attack as a Christmas present . <p> 3 . ' The saltier it is the better ' must be your mantra if your grownup Christmas list includes hypertension , and heart and kidney diseases .

You will surely ace your blood exam come first quarter of 2017 . High bad cholesterol ? Check . High blood sugar and triglycerides ? Double check . <p> 5 . Sack those high fiber vegetables , fruits , and whole grains because they only delay the absorption of sugar in the blood and decrease bad cholesterol in the body . This is not the way to go if you want to maintain a high blood sugar level ( diabetes ) and damage your heart with bad cholesterol or LDL .

BCC is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer that is common among pale or lighter-skinned individuals , including Caucasians , Chinese , Japanese , and Hispanics . Those with fair skin are more susceptible to BCC as darker-skinned individuals naturally have more melanin in their skin that can better shield the sun 's ultraviolet B ( UVB ) rays . But those with constant and prolonged ultraviolet exposure , regardless of skin color , may also be at risk as UV exposure is a main cause of BCC . This means spending long periods under the sun ( whether due to tanning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while BCC is not hereditary , the skin characteristics of an individual can be passed on ( like one 's skin color ) . On the upside , BCC rarely spreads on the body . It is highly treatable with early detection . BCC may vary in appearance , from a scaly patch of skin to a small inflamed lump that usually appears on the face , ears , and neck , but may also appear on other parts of the body . <p> This is why , while BCC can easily be diagnosed by a dermatologist , they still take a skin sample of the affected area ( skin biopsy ) to verify the condition . Once diagnosed , the patient is given different treatment options , depending on the size , location , and quantity of BCC on the body . <p> Forms of treatment include : <p> Excision of the BCC with four millimeters extension or Moh 's Surgery <p> Cryotherapy by freezing the affected area to stop the growth of BCC <p> Curettage and cautery by removing the affected skin and applying heat <p> Radiotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of chemotherapy drug taken by patients with multiple BCCs <p> If you have had BCC before , chances are higher that you may have it again .

Reapply every two to three hours and after every towel-dry ( if swimming ) . Refrain from going out at peak hours ( 10 a.m. to 3 p.m . ) . <p> Avoid tanning and tanning beds as much as possible . <p> Check your skin regularly even in places you can not see ( check using mirrors or ask help from someone you know ) . Any changes on the skin such as scabs or sores that do not heal , a change on its appearance , or scabs that bleed must be checked immediately . <p> Now that the ozone layer has somehow depleted , the UVB rays are much stronger than before .

@@15748234 <h> The Standard <h> ... US move away from globalization ? <p> Arguably the most powerful element of the campaign platform of Republican candidate ( and now President-elect ) Donald Trump in the recent US Presidential campaign was his argument that the outgoing Obama administration had pursued external trade policies that took American jobs abroad to foreign workers . Trump took aim at the regional free-trade organizations that the US had entered into and was in the process of joining . <p> Candidate Trump was emphatic about NAFTA ( North American Free Trade Association ) , which is made up of the three North American countries , and TPP ( Trans-Pacific Partnership ) , which has yet to become operational . The Donald was imprecise about what he would do with NAFTA , but he knew what he would do with TPP . One of the first actions he would take as President would be , he said , to take the US out of the Pacific-area organization . <p> This raises an existential question . Is the country with the world 's largest economy , after seven decades of advocacy of the idea of universal free trade -- this began with its signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade ) , the forerunner of WTO ( World Trade Organization ) -- about to turn its back on globalization ? Is the world about to see the emergence of the economic equivalent of Fortress America ? <p> The **32;455;TOOLONG campaign rhetoric appears to have resonated with workers in states -- mostly in north-central America -- that had been considered safely blue ( Democratic ) . The Electoral College votes of Ohio , Wisconsin and Michigan brought Trump to the 270-vote winning mark . <p> In recent days President-elect Trump has reiterated his desire to pull the US out of TPP , and , with a Republican-controlled Congress , he might very well try to do that . But the US ' turning its back on globalization completely is another , far more serious matter . I offer two reasons why there is likely to be no turning back , not even during the four years of the Trump administration . <p> The first reason is historical in character . In the modern era the US has been a staunch advocate and unwavering supporter of the concepts of free trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eye focused on America 's manufacturing industries and have always tried to strike a balance between the welfare of America 's working class and the need to achieve high levels of production efficiency and consumer welfare , which are attained by subjecting to foreign competition the products of the US ' factories , workshops and farms . Whenever the policymakers in Washington D.C. have perceived a real threat to America 's industries and workers , they have usually reacted not by disengagement from trade arrangements and prohibitions of foreign goods but by appropriate changes in the US Tariff and Customs Code . <p> As stated earlier , Donald Trump may move for the US ' disengagement from the not-yet-operational TPP . But disengagement from NAFTA would be a very serious and highly disruptive action . Not only has NAFTA been operating for nearly two decades but it involves US relations with Canada and Mexico , two of its closest allies . <p> My second reason for believing that the US is not about to turn its back on globalization relates to present geopolitical circumstances . China has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could before too long , overtake the US economically . And , although the US is still the only superpower , China is beginning to flex whatever military muscle it has . In no part of the globe is American-Chinese rivalry more intense than in the area encompassed by the ocean that the US and China share . Indeed , this growing rivalry is the explanation for the pivot to Asia effected by the administration of President Barack Obama . On China 's side , Asia-Pacific influence is demonstrated by its establishment of a development financing institution to rival ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) , which is controlled by Japan and the US . <p> The American architects saw the 12-member TPP not only in terms of its economic benefit -- chiefly the exchange of production efficiencies and employment opportunities -- but also in terms of its strategic value , viz. , its being a vehicle for the further projection of American power and leadership . To withdraw from TPP would be to offer China a strategic advantage on a silver platter . <p> Free trade has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and globalization has become entrenched as a part of America 's economic vocabulary . Was the US not one of the principal moving spirits behind WTO 's creation ? <p> To be sure , American workers need relief from competition from foreign producers .

Mr. Trump 's administration should look in other directions for that . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

@@15748236 <h> Quick Links <h> ... Standard <h> Leni liberated <p> Vice President Leni Robredo has resigned from the Cabinet . Although , if you ask me , she had already stayed far too long before she finally left . <p> My own belief was that Robredo would stay on until she could weaponize her resignation politically , to " make a statement " out of it in the manner of the so-called Hyatt 10 . She would , together with her colleagues in the Liberal Party , wait for the arrival of widespread disenchantment with the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte and then she would go , thus maximizing the propaganda mileage of her resignation . <p> But Duterte , the provinciano mayor , would one-up the " decent " Yellows and their de facto standard-bearer once again . Through his Cabinet secretary Leoncio Evasco , Duterte would order Robredo not to attend any more Cabinet meetings as chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council , starting yesterday . <p> Robredo took this directive to mean that she was being forced to resign , by text message , no less , after Evasco said he failed to reach the vice president by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger plot to " steal " the vice presidency from her , as well . <p> Robredo fell into a trap Duterte had set , because I do n't think she was really being fired . I think Duterte wanted Robredo to quit on her own accord , while giving her the option of not leaving the Cabinet if that was what she really wanted , by ordering Evasco to send her the message . <p> Commission on Higher Education Chairman Patricia Licuanan , a Cabinet-rank holdover from the previous administration , has also been told by Evasco to stop attending Cabinet meetings . Licuanan merely said that , yes , she would no longer be attending , adding that she was staying on in her post ; she has n't been fired yet . <p> As for Robredo justifying her staying on as long as she did , because she and Duterte shared a similar goal of helping the poor , that 's just a lot of cow manure . Almost from Day One of her appointment , Robredo has been declaring publicly how she disagreed with Duterte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marcos burial -- differences that should have made her quit a long time ago . <p> Then there was the speech where Duterte made fun of Robredo 's knees and asked her about her supposed congressman-boyfriend . It took Robredo a full day to understand that she had been ridiculed in public and to react angrily -- but still she did n't quit . <p> The fact that she endured everything until she resigned in a huff yesterday made me think that Robredo had finally decided that she would no longer stick to the LP timetable . Never if , depending on who you talked to , she resigned too early or too late . <p> * * * <p> The appointment of Robredo to the Cabinet was made at a time when Duterte was endeavoring to show that his was going to be an inclusive government . That was the time when he was recruiting ex-rebels from both the left and the right into his official family and restarting peace talks with various groups dedicated to bringing down the government , in a gesture of reconciliation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cabinet , failed to understand that she was not brought in to become some sort of in-house critic of the administration . I 'm sure Duterte never had to tell her that she should just do the job she was given and not to issue regular press releases taking the stand that was contrary to the President 's ; that she failed to figure that out says something of her political acumen -- or the lack of it , actually . <p> Robredo was left to figure out that Duterte did n't really have to give her a job . But I guess she started to believe that her Cabinet position was an entitlement and that Duterte could not possibly fire her simply because she was the Vice President and deserving , for some reason that is not in any statute book , of her high post . <p> Furthermore , I think Robredo must have decided that she would resign , first verbally on Sunday and then in writing yesterday ( albeit without the traditional " irrevocably " to intensify the verb " resigning " ) because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . She wanted Duterte to take back his order and to say that all is forgiven . <p> That was not to be .

Like those " solid accomplishments " that she claimed to have racked up in the last five months , this is something I fail to comprehend . <p> On the plus side , I think Robredo should feel liberated that she is no longer a member of the administration that she has repeatedly and consistently criticized . Now she can focus on the job of fighting the electoral protest against her , something that really needs her undivided attention . <p> If , as Robredo claims , there truly is a plot to steal the vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and work full-time to keep it .

@@15748237 <h> Quick Links <h> ... Standard <h> A job is more than a paycheck <p> In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election , I 'm starting to rethink one of my basic beliefs about the economy . For a long time , I 've believed that what mattered most for economic well-being was money . Median income , consumption , wages -- all the things I cared about most were measured in dollars . <p> Because of this attitude , I 've supported lots of policies aimed at boosting the amount of money in the average person 's pocket . I 've called for Japan to liberalize its markets , and for the US to encourage workers to move to places with better opportunities . And I 've often assumed that a dollar of government redistribution is just as good as a dollar of wages . <p> I 'm starting to think I was wrong . Maybe not completely wrong , but I did ignore a big , important source of economic well-being : jobs . <p> In most of economic theory , a job is n't treated as something inherently valuable -- it 's just a conduit through which money flows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about the amount of money they get , but how they get it . If they see themselves as having earned their daily bread , they feel better about themselves than if they got a handout . A job also probably has an important symbolic value -- it sends a message that society cares about you and has a place for you . <p> I say " probably " because this just is n't something economists think about much , so it does n't appear in the research literature much . To most people , the idea that jobs give people dignity and a sense of self-worth seems laughably obvious . Sociologists have probably researched this too , which supports my contention that the US needs more input from sociology and less from economics . But among economists , there remains a relentless unwillingness to consider the importance of dignity and social respect . <p> There are a few exceptions . David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald have measured the impact of unemployment on happiness , and found that having a job is an important determinant of how satisfied people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , some of the little sociology research I do know about shows that job status is important for keeping marriages together . <p> Meanwhile , out in the real world , Americans are hurting from a lack of jobs . A number of deep dives into the mindset of Donald Trump voters , both before and after the election , have focused on the loss of status and self-respect that less-educated men in decaying industrial regions have suffered as jobs have been lost and replaced by government benefits . One way to see this is in the decline in the percentage of men in the US labor force : <p> The dramatic Democratic loss in the Midwest in the 2016 election should be a wake-up call . The Democrats have been the party of the social safety net , and have long wondered why so many working-class Americans do n't seem to appreciate those benefits . <p> Trump , meanwhile , sailed to victory in the Midwest , in part by railing against globalization . Economists David Autor , David Dorn and Kaveh Majlesi have found that regions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for Trump . Other studies by Autor and Dorn have found that that same import competition was responsible for throwing lots of Americans out of work and that nothing else replaced those jobs . So it seems that many voters in the Midwest did n't want checks in the mail -- they wanted work . And they voted for a candidate who promised them jobs , even if he was very vague on his plans for doing so . <p> What kind of concrete plans would address Americans ' hunger for jobs ? An easy step is to promote demand-based policies that keep employment high , like fiscal stimulus . A more drastic measure would be a federal job guarantee . Although many such jobs would pay low wages and would contain some element of make-work , it 's probably better to have unemployed people doing something marginally useful . A third option is to focus on slashing regulations that make it more costly and difficult to hire employees . <p> Perhaps the deepest change would be to tweak US corporate culture , restoring the value of long-term employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this direction -- witness Japan -- but it could be that US labor arrangements are simply too short-term and insecure to provide the social benefits that workers in Japan , South Korea and much of Europe enjoy . Tax incentives for long-term labor contracts , or for labor hoarding during recessions , could put the government 's thumb on the scale in favor of employment over pure dollars . <p> Whatever policies are appropriate , it 's clear that economics pundits and policy wonks need to shift our thinking a bit . We should n't be so quick to assume that every dollar of income is the same to people . We should read more sociology , talk to more workers and pay more attention to things like dignity , respect and a sense of community -- intangibles that are n't sold in any market . <p> Maybe someday , academic economists could even put these things into their models , too . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers who exercise their right to free expression and they do not necessarily represent or reflect the position or viewpoint of thestandard.ph .

That was a clear message from Mr. Duterte that she no longer enjoyed the confidence of the appointing power . Thus , she must resign . And that was exactly what she did . <p> Malaca ? ang cited " irreconcilable differences " as the cause of her resignation . My gulay , when an alter ego of the President no longer believes in the appointing power , they should resign if they have any self-respect or delicadeza left . <p> This also applies to other Cabinet members : Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo , Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael Mariano , National Anti-Poverty Commission head Liza Maza , among others .

To me , my gulay , this is Robredo 's conscience bothering her . <p> Another member of the cabinet who was also told not to attend cabinet meetings was Patricia Licuanan , chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education . Just why she has not yet resigned is a big question . <p> This reminds me that there are still hundreds of " leftovers " from the BS Aquino administration , and they are all enjoying their perks ! <p> *** <p> I can believe the news reports that demoralization has set in among the rank and file of the Philippine National Police . This is because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group , who was not only named as having been involved in the illegal drug trade , but was the head of the raiding team that served a search warrant on jailed Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa . That raid is suspected to have been a rubout ; he knew who among the police were also involved . <p> This is clearly a case of double standard -- one , for friends and allies of the President , and another one for others in the police force . I can not buy the excuse of Duterte that Marcos was reinstated because he wants to look into the paper trail . <p> So why did n't Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa resign when told by " a higher-up " that Marcos should be reinstated after he himself had relieved Marcos ? Any self-respecting government functionary should have resigned under the circumstances . But it seems Dela Rosa is also clinging to his post . <p> *** <p> Malaca ? ang is committing a big mistake in insisting on the appointment of lawyer Randy Escolange , former deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Subic Freeport . <p> President Duterte must not forget that in the many instances when both the chairman and the administrator were appointed , conflict became inevitable . On the other hand , when a single appointee acted as both chairman and administrator , there was peace at the SBMA . <p> I recall the time when the now-Senator Dick Gordon was both chairman and administrator of the Subic Freeport . That was a good , peaceful time . The same thing happened during the term of Felicito Payumo . <p> But I also remember the time , during the term of President Gloria Macapagal Aroyo , there was a chairman and there was an administrator , and both of them quarrelled over turf all the time . <p> I was in Subic when both the chairman and the administrator were ready to shoot each other . They were arguing on who should occupy the Admiral 's Cottage . <p> The Bases Conversion and Authority Development Act of 1992 is not very clear on who should be appointed and to what post .

They have not been paid their overtime , travel and meal allowances amounting to close to P1.7 billion . <p> The news report said that Faeldon has written to Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez who has written to both PAL and Cebu Pacific to remind them of the financial obligation . Just why the Customs Commissioner is acting only on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really tragic when we know that many of the 900 Naia Customs personnel have since retired or passed away without getting their pay . <p> Not one of the past five Customs Commissioners before Faeldon looked into the matter .

@@15748239 <h> The Standard <h> ... rights are forever <p> On Saturday , December 10 , we celebrate the 68th year anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . This is a monumental document proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in 1948 , a recognition of the inalienable rights and inherent human dignity all members of the human race . The UDHR consists of 30 articles , which have been incorporated , in international treaties , economic transfers , national constitutions , and other laws , including our 1987 Constitution . <p> The Philippines , being an original member of the United Nations , participated in that historic occasion . Among others , we have consistently incorporated basic human rights in our Bill of Rights , progressively making this Article of our fundamental law stronger in every new iteration . We have not been perfect , of course . In the last Aquino government , we saw how Lumad leaders were hunted down , their communities uprooted and displaced , and schools closed down ; supposedly in the name of anti-insurgency but really an attempt to control their natural resources by outsiders . Even a former President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for weak cases that could not stand judicial inquiry . But those failures are nothing to what we saw in the Marcos martial law regime and nothing to what we are not witnessing in Duterte 's war against drugs . <p> In the 1987 Constitution , acknowledging our failure to implement human rights norms , we did create a Commission on Human Rights that is now at the forefront of holding the Duterte government accountable for its human rights excesses . I know personally CHR chairman Chito Gascon and his fellow commissioners Leah Armamento , Roberto Cadiz , Karen Dumpit , and Gwen Pimentel-Gana . They are courageous and resolute in the face of an antagonistic government ; they are my heroes and we should support them unconditionally . <p> Aside from our domestic efforts , in the last 30 years , after we overthrew the Marcos dictatorship among others for its human rights excesses , our diplomacy has also constantly been pro-human rights . As recent as the 2015 Paris negotiations on climate change , we were seen as credible champions of the integration of human rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . Slowly but surely , we are becoming a pariah globally on human rights . <p> Contrary to the view that human rights is a western thing and that the oriental or developing country view is different , the UDHR emanated from the collective wisdom of all civilized nations as part of humanity and was not an imposition by the Western World . The rights recognized in the 1948 Declaration are all based on the predicate that a human being is endowed with faculties unique unto themselves and are not founded on lower life forms like animals . Intellect , reason and conscience are some attributes which other life forms do not possess . Utter disregard of this basic precept has resulted in " in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind , and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people . " ( preamble , UDHR ) . <p> The most fundamental and basic of human rights is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Civil and Political Rights , to which the Philippines is a State Party , " every human being has the inherent right to life . " Article 6 of the ICCPR also says that the right to life " shall be protected by law " and that " no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life . " Extrajudicial killings and arbitrary executions are proscribed under this convention . <p> The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights defines " extralegal , arbitrary or summary executions " as the " deprivation of life without full judicial and legal process , and with the involvement , complicity , tolerance or acquiescence of the Government or its agents . " It further explains that extralegal , arbitrary or summary executions include " death through the excessive use of force by police or security forces .

" <p> Fortunately , under international law , victims are not without remedy , foremost of which are the International Criminal Court and the system of human rights rapporteurs and experts created by the United Nations . I write about the ICC below and reserve the rapporteur/expert system for another column . <p> The ICC is an international tribunal that has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes . According to the Rome Statute that created the ICC , genocide are " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " ; crimes against humanity are acts " committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population , with knowledge of the attack " ; and war crimes are " acts of aggression " defined as " the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty , territorial integrity or political independence of another State , or in any other manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus far , the ICC has conducted investigations into a number of cases that fall under its jurisdiction including , the indictment and conviction of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and the prosecution of certain individuals in Central African Republic , Sudan , Kenya , Libya and Mali accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity . <p> The spate of drug related extrajudicial killings -- nearing 5,000 persons now , mostly poor and including some children - as a result of President Duterte 's war against drugs has once again people talking about the ICC . The International Commission of Jurists has written a letter to the President calling on him to unequivocally denounce extrajudicial killings , whether of alleged criminals or of any person in the Philippines . It also urged the Government of the Philippines to conduct prompt and impartial investigations into the police operations that resulted in these deaths . The chief prosecutor of the ICC has put on record that it is carefully watching events unfolding in the Philippines and promised to take action if warranted . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Perfecto Yasay , we have threatened to leave the Court . To do so would be a big blow to our diplomacy because we have been in recent years one of the major champions of the ICC and have successfully campaigned for the election of two of its Judges -- Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago ( who was not able to sit at the Hague because of illness ) and Dean Raul Pangalangan who is now ably serving in the court . Justice Pangalangan is in The Hague in his individual capacity but he does the country proud with the work he does there . <p> I hope our decision-makers realize the irreparable long-term damage it would cause to our country 's reputation if we left the ICC . They should realize that they will not be in their positions forever and they have to worry about the country also and not just themselves . <p> Respect for human rights is not a passing or seasonal fashion . Human rights are not relative . Human rights are absolute and must forever be respected . <h> Related stories : <h> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

The editorial stated that " ( n ) ot one suspect has been charged in the massacre . " But in the previous paragraph , it noted that " 106 so far are being tried . " The two statements are contradictory . This makes the editorial misleading . For the record , in a Nov. 23 , 2016 , briefer released to the media ( including to the Inquirer justice beat reporter ) , it is clearly stated that there are 106 being tried . <p> 2 . It is wrong , not just unfair , to blame the judiciary only for the so-called " judicial massacre . " This case is not solely the judiciary 's concern , and any " shortcomings " are not solely attributable to the court . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Again , as pointed out in our Nov. 23 briefer , " There are 12 lawyers comprising the third Panel of Public Prosecutors , 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings .

The initial presentation of their defense evidence of these 45 accused will commence on January 19 , 2017 . " <p> It is also wrong and unfair to blame the court , and the court alone , for all the delay in this case as that unfairly shifts the burden of prosecution -- and not adjudication -- to this court .

@@15767237 <h> The Standard <h> ... Martial Law was declared <p> IN the wake of so much hatred peddled by those opposing the burial of the late strongman President Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani , two pertinent questions have to be answered . <p> One , why did Marcos declare Martial Law at midnight of Sept. 21 , 1972 , and two , if Martial Law were not declared , what would have happened to the country ? <p> Let 's rewind a bit , and follow the antecedents of the declaration of Martial Law . In the the late 1940s , there was the Hukbalahap ( Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon ) which traces it roots to the time of the Sakdalistas , demanding fair and equitable treatment of tenants by landlords , particularly in Central Luzon . <p> This struggle of oppressed farmers and tenants metamorphosed into the Hukbalahaps during the Japanese Occupation . <p> After Liberation in the early 1950s , because of the Cold War , communism and nationalism were the wave of the future . People thought that to be a communist , or at least a socialist , was something romantic . <p> I knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila , even I fancied myself a communist . In fact , my good friend and classmate , former Vice President Tito Guingona and I used to call each other " comrade . " <p> Those were the days when the Huks became the enemy of the state . They went on a rampage throughout Luzon , inspired by the Communist Party of the Philippines , with an agenda of overthrowing the establishment . It got to be so that during the Magsaysay regime , foremost in the agenda of the late President Magsaysay was to break the backbone of the Hukbalahap . With the help of the Central Intelligence Agency , the Hukbalahap movement had a big setback . <p> Through the years , communism grew , so much as that media , the academe , the bureaucracy in government , and even Congress had admirers and supporters . <p> Santa Banana , would you believe that months before the imposition of Martial Law , the Huks , together with the New People 's Army , had already occupied Balara near the University of the Philippines ? I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ateneo High School in Loyola Heights . <p> I had a jeep then which I bought for P1,500 and I used to take Highway 54 , now Edsa , as the fastest route to my law school . Then one day , when I wanted to take the Highway 54 route to Manila , the highway was barred by logs and boulders , which I was told later , was done by the NPAs . <p> Marcos and then-Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile knew this as an early warning device . The Huks and the NPAs were already knocking at the doors of Metro Manila . With their supporters inside the establishment , they were ready to take over the government . <p> Long before this , I was told , Marcos and his people were already ready to declare Martial Law using the 1935 Constitution which provided that in cases of invasion and rebellion when public safety requires it , it can be done . With Proclamation 1081 , Mr. Marcos simply did what had to be done . <p> Another factor that came into play was the rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary , Nur Misuari , a graduate of the University of the Philippines , who believed that the Muslims must have their own government . The MNLF was not only after autonomy , but total independence of the Muslims from the central government . <p> Marcos was then actually fighting on two fronts -- the communist takeover of the establishment , and the Muslim rebellion.With the declaration of Martial Law , the backbone of the communist movement was broken . This was precisely why Martial Law had to be declared . <p> As for the Muslim rebellion in Mindanao , with the help of Marcos friends among the Muslims , Marcos gave MNLF commanders what they wanted -- money and power . Muslim commanders were given access to imported fruits , sardines and other groceries which they could sell . That also broke the Muslim rebellion which forced Misuari into self-exile in Egypt . <p> Comes now the question : If Marcos did not impose Martial Law , what would have happened ?

That gave birth to the inclusion of the anomalous party-list system which benefited the communists and everybody else identified with the left . <p> To the Aquinos , Marcos was all evil , because they blamed him for the assassination of the late Senator Ninoy Aquino .

@@15767238 vs Duterte <p> Vice President Leni Robredo has been fired from the Cabinet of President Duterte . She has been treated shabbily , according to the Inquirer . <p> Leni should have known from the start that as member of the Duterte Cabinet , she served at the pleasure of the President . She was at his beck and call . The President was her master . And when the President does n't like you , that 's it . The President can express or not express his dislike in many ways . Including your being fired by text , through a presidential subaltern . <p> In being fired , she did n't enjoy the courtesy of a call from the boss himself . Nor the formality of a perfunctory letter telling her how the President appreciates her brief stint and service in the cabinet but because of sharp differences of views or approaches to governance , they can not pursue their common goal of reducing poverty and extending prosperity to all without giving each other the flexibility or adequate elbow to pursue that goal in the manner each saw it best . <p> Leni had it coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and he did n't like her joining his Cabinet . He did n't like her because he wanted Bongbong Marcos as the elected vice president . I think Duterte suspects BBM was cheated in the count . <p> Duterte did not like her joining the Cabinet because she represented the Liberal Party which during the election campaign raked up his so-called unexplained but bogus wealth and unexplained but bogus bank deposits , with some help from the supposedly independent and secretive Anti-Money Laundering Council . <p> Duterte , 71 , the president , operates by institutional memory . We develop our memories out of the daily anecdotes we encounter . Those experiences shape us and shape our ideas and vision of the future . That is why rags-to-riches stories of wealth are so compelling . It 's like seeing light at the end of the tunnel . The same with the rise to power of once a small town mayor like Duterte . <p> Anyone who wants to analyze Duterte should read back to his childhood thru adulthood , his background at Ateneo where he was sexually molested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at San Beda Law School where he carried a gun to protect himself from bullies and imbibed his present knowledge of law without much diligence , at Lyceum where he took up foreign service and hobnobbed with closet rebels and where he developed his view and vision of the world as it was and as it should be , and at Davao where he tried to rule over what was virtually then a vast Wild Wild West by dealing with all kinds of lawbreakers -- corrupt government men , police and military , communist New People 's Army , separatist Muslim rebels , foreign interventionists like America , and an incompetent and uncaring central government . <p> Duterte believes he owes it to the Marcos family to return the gesture of the old man Ferdinand who gave Digong 's dad , Vicente , the chance to serve in the Marcos cabinet as secretary of general services from 1966 to 1968 when nobody knew Duterte 's old man from Adam during the pre-martial law years . <p> For a decent but low-key professional from then-obscure Davao to be thrust into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolutely big deal , especially to the Duterte family who emigrated to Davao from Cebu in search of greener pastures . Don Vicente put up a house on what he thought was a Davao government property only to find out somebody rich already owned it . This explains why the President hates squatters being relocated and the poor being told to hop from office to office , enduring all kinds of red tape and maltreatment , just to get a permit that should be issued without much ado . <p> President Duterte believes that it was Cory Aquino who offered a local government job to his mother Soledad . Mrs. Duterte declined the job which led the young lawyer Duterte to accept the job which then led to his becoming mayor of Davao for the next 23 years . For this reason , I do not believe Duterte will order the arrest and jailing of his predecessor , Benigno S. " Noynoy " Aquino III despite the latter 's supposed crime of raiding the treasury and distributing moolah to senators , congressmen and other favored politicians . Unless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration and to install his Trojan horse , Leni Robredo . <p> Now , is there a future for Vice President Robredo ? Not much , I think .

If you look into her website , Leni as VP promises heaven on earth -- zero poverty , prosperity for all , gender equality . <p> Not even the richest and most powerful nations on earth can do those things . How much more of a Robredo without a Cabinet position ? <p> In the meantime , she could hope that Duterte 's frequent invocation of a migraine as an excuse to escape from mandatory socials and events is real . Or that his constantly vexing powerful America might finally prompt the CIA with extreme prejudice . <p> You know what , Duterte will last his six-year presidential term .

The complaint was eventually referred to the CoA where it is currently snoozing .

The introduction may have been because of an ongoing electoral protest by Marcos against Robredo lodged with the Presidential Electoral Tribunal ( PET ) . Could not the President exercise some prudence and wait for the PET 's decision ? <p> It is no secret that despite having a different vice presidential candidate during the election period , Duterte 's true preference to win was BBM . His calling the young Marcos as probable VP in the middle of election protest case plus his position on the LNMB issue gave credence to talks that he may in fact be preparing the way for an eventual Marcos victory in the PET . <p> People 's protests against the Marcoses is understandable given the way the president has been openly favoring the Marcoses . The Filipinos ' long struggle against dictatorship and plunder under FM is set aside in the interest of friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bolstering the possibilities of the Marcoses ' return to Malaca ? ang . <p> If such perception is true , the president may be doing an injustice to the victims of Martial law and those who fought against the Marcos dictatorship . <p> Now , take the case of the war against drugs . <p> Duterte won on an anti-drugs campaign . He said he would be relentless and ruthless against drug pushers and drug lords . He said he would kill those associated with the drug menace . He warned that this war would be bloody and told people to not vote for him if they were not ready . <p> Indeed , in the first six months of his presidency , the Filipino people have witnessed how ruthless and remorseless this administration is against those associated with drugs . To date , more than 5,500 mostly poor and small-time suspected drug users and/or pushers have been mercilessly killed . I underscore the word SUSPECTED because all those killed did not have any chance to defend themselves in the court of law . Their right to due process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those killed were gunned down by members of the Philippine National Police . Most were accused of engaging in gunfight against the uniformed men , even those already handcuffed , in custody , and in jail . A number of those killed have earlier surrendered and released . <p> It is very noticeable that while poor suspected users and pushers are killed , the drug lords like Peter Go are at large , or in the case of Kerwin Espinosa and one of his suppliers , are under protective custody of PNP officials . There is injustice in the treatment of poor and rich drug personalities . <p> There is no doubt that because of Duterte 's war on drugs , syndicates are trying harder to cover their tracks . It is very possible that a good number of those killed were murdered by these syndicates . However , recent developments and some cases have pointed to the involvement of some PNP officials in narco politics . <p> No less than PNP Chief Bato dela Rosa said that Supt. Marvin Marcos is involved in drugs . Marcos was also implicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team while in jail . Like many others , the late Mayor Espinosa was said to be armed and had fired on the police first . Even before any investigation was done , the president already said that he believed the police 's story . <p> Chief Bato relieved Marcos but was ordered by President Duterte himself to have the Superintendent reinstated . The president had to own up because Gen. Bato said that someone higher ordered him to do as he did , and Senator Leila de Lima divulged to media that it was Secretary Bong Go was the one who called Bato on Marcos ' behalf . <p> The thing is , the National Bureau of Investigation released its findings that Mayor Espinosa was not armed in jail and that his case was a rub-out . In response and in true Duterte fashion , the president said that he will not allow the police to go to jail . <p> This is another clear indication of selective justice . If the country can not expect the president to implement our laws , especially when law enforcement themselves violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people turn to for real justice ? <p> The president can not practice selective justice . He can not favor some at the expense of the Filipino people 's interest and lives lost due to his war against drugs . <p> People protested against the previous administration 's ' tayo-tayo ' mentality . Former President Benigno Aquino III was heavily criticized for his loyalty to his friends . The Duterte administration is showing signs of the same mentality . <p> This time may even be worse because in favoring the Marcoses , injustice is done on the people 's democratic struggle . In favoring the men in uniform , injustice is done on those whose lives were lost . <p> Where there is selective justice , there is no true justice . We must say no to this . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

It could cause eye injuries or even blindness , and other bodily injuries . <p> Battery-operated toys may not be appropriate for very young children , especially if the toy has tiny batteries that are not firmly secured or batteries that may leak and cause chemical burns . <p> Because young children have sensitive hearing , do n't give them loud musical toys or squeeze toys that make shrill noises . It would also be good to avoid toys that encourage violence and aggression , like knives or swords , guns and other ammunitions . <p> If you are buying electronic toys or gadgets , make sure they are safe enough not to cause overheating , burning , or fire .

Carlos Isagani Zarate of Bayan Muna , a lawyer , explained that a sole bidder is a contradiction in terms since a single company can not compete against itself but the PSA declared it as the sole complying bidder . <p> Zarate also questioned PSA about its failure to discipline Unisys , which had failed to comply with the original contract provisions for 12 years . <p> The Civil Registry System-Information Technology Project Phase 2 ( ITCP2 ) deal between the PSA and Unisys Corp . will be the second contract for the company , which also controlled the first phase of the project under the defunct National Statistics Office ( NSO ) . <p> Earlier , Zarate filed Resolution 592 asking the House of Representatives to inquire into the P1.59-billion contract and urging the House Committee on Government Enterprises and Privatization to look into the deal , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolution 592 said " the PSA , with their failure to sanction Unisys , even allowed the latter to secure two contract extensions that ran from 2012 up to 2015 , apparently with the go-signal of a higher authority . The PSA , in its reply to the Commission on Audit COA , did not name who specifically that ' higher authority ' was . Clearly , this project was so lopsided in favor of Unisys , evident with the fact that Unisys was even the sole bidder of the project . " <p> The resolution also argued that the COA itself had " raised apprehension over a foreign company having full and unbridled control over the country 's civil registry system , as this would surely be compromising to public interest and security . The COA , in its 2004 Sectoral Performance Audit of the Civil Registry System project , noted the government 's inadequacy of controls to protect the interest of the government and the public .

" The resolution also noted that Unisys had committed gross violations of the contract provisions for the first phase of the project , and this was confirmed by the COA in its 2005 and 2015 reports . <p> Zarate warned that , with Unisys having " unbridled control " of the civil registry system , the US government can easily have undiminished access to all civil documents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 3 Unisys executive Juan Ingersol Castro and PSA Director General Lisa Grace Bersales signed the concession agreement for under the Public-Private Partnership ( PPP ) Program . <p> " The recent deal , in sheer disregard of the said audit , still proceeded with Unisys , given again full control of all civil registry documents nationwide and government getting a mere 45.5 percent of the revenues , " Zarate said , while Unisys secured the rest despite the original provision of the contract that calls for the government to have 58.7-percent share . <p> " The COA , in its audit , castigated both the PSA then the NSO and Unisys for violating the original contract . It was stipulated in the original 12-year contract ( CY 2000-2012 ) that Unisys shall transfer operations and control of the civil registry system to the PSA five years before the contract 's expiry in 2012 , but Unisys did not abide . Perplexingly , the PSA did not even muster any initiative to take over controlling the civil registry system , even failing to impose sanctions to Unisys despite the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " This seeming intention of Unisys not to hand over the civil registry system was already evident in the early years of the project when the COA , in its 2004 Sectoral Audit of the CRS-ITP 1 , observed that Unisys had not trained the PSA personnel to operate the system . Moreover , the PSA has neither possession nor took part in the monitoring of records on actual purchases and inventory of items to be turned over to the PSA . In fact , this isolation of the PSA from the implementation of NSO Serbilis Centers eventually led to the anomalous contract extension of Unisys , " the resolution added . <p> The same resolution stressed that " had the PSA taken over control of the country 's civil registry system , the government would not have needed the rollout of CRS-ITP 2 , thus saving government billions of pesos .

We will submit a committee report in January , " Lacson said in an interview . <p> " We wrapped up the legislative inquiry so we can now start preparing the committee report so we can report it out on the floor this coming January , " he said . <p> When asked about the executive , Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said it was only to tie some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . <p> " I can not say because precisely it was discussed during executive session .

@@15925234 <p> QUEZON CITY , ... 16 - Crop insurance can be an effective safety net that can significantly reduce poverty among agricultural households . This is according to a study by state think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies ( PIDS ) . <p> In a forum held recently at the House of Representatives in Quezon City , PIDS Senior Research Fellow Celia Reyes noted that around half of the households who are engaged in agriculture can be considered as " sometimes poor " . According to Reyes , these are farmers who usually become poor when they are unable to recover from losses in their farm production after typhoons , flooding , and other calamities . She noted that providing safety nets such as crop insurance can protect these vulnerable households from sliding into poverty . <p> " Crop insurance helps farmers manage risks by providing them with funds to cover production costs for the next season and finance household expenditures after a shock such as typhoon , flood , and drought , " Reyes stated . <p> Reyes ' presentation at the House of Representatives was based on a PIDS study that aims to evaluate the design and implementation of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as its sustainability and impact on farmers . The forum is part of the Legislative Forum Series organized by PIDS and the Congressional Planning and Budget Research Department of the House of Representatives . <p> The PIDS study , which was conducted in collaboration with major universities around the country , concluded that the Agricultural Insurance Program has a positive impact on farm households ' income and welfare . However , it also noted that the program , which is being implemented by the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation ( PCIC ) , leaves a lot to be desired . <p> " Improvements in the design and implementation of the crop insurance program of the PCIC , particularly with regard to the penetration rate and insurance cover , can further increase its benefits to farmers , " Reyes emphasized . <p> The crop insurance offered by the PCIC is considered as a " production cost insurance " as it typically insures the cost of production inputs of farmers , with prescribed cover ceilings . One of its programs is the free insurance to farmers and fisherfolk that are listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . RSBSA is a database of farmers , farm laborers , and fisherfolk in the 75 poorest provinces in the Philippines which the Philippine Statistics Authority maintains . <p> For the past three years , PCIC 's annual budget has been an average of PHP 1 billion . This amount was increased to P2.5 billion in the proposed 2017 national budget . Under the program , farmers with farm sizes of three hectares and below are the priority beneficiaries . Despite the increase in funding , Reyes noted that the amount is still not enough to cover all eligible beneficiaries under the existing RSBSA program . <p> In addition , the PIDS study pointed out that the actual insurance cover that PCIC pays is below the average production cost particularly for rice and corn . For example , PCIC 's average amount of cover per hectare for rice in 2015 was around PHP 21 , 000 under the RSBSA program while average production cost per hectare is around PHP 42,000 . According to Reyes , the low insurance cover is a trade-off of targeting more farmer beneficiaries for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that given the limited funds , the free insurance premium subsidies should be directed to the poorest farmers . <p> " Since PCIC will continue using the RSBSA as a targeting tool for giving free insurance premium , there is a need to validate and reconcile the list of farmers and fisherfolk in the RSBSA with the list of agrarian reform beneficiaries ( ARBs ) , " Reyes explained . <p> Another way for the PCIC to increase coverage rate of insured farmers , particularly for those not listed in the RSBA , is through partnerships with local government units ( LGUs ) such as in the case of Isabela , Cebu , Negros Oriental , and Davao del Norte . Reyes and her co-authors suggested LGU-PCIC partnerships in the form of full premium subsidy by the LGU or the provision of loans to farmers as the LGU 's counterpart in the insurance premium . <p> Lastly , the PIDS study highlighted the low level of awareness of target beneficiary farmers about the programs of the PCIC . <p> " Some farmer groups and LGUs are not aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not aware that they are insured under the RSBSA and that they are the priority beneficiaries of the program , " Reyes stated .

@@15925239 <h> Quick Links <h> ... Standard <h> Testing Duterte <p> Maybe some of those nameless bureaucrats at State decided to test if the potty-mouthed new leader of the Philippines is as tough as he says he is . Maybe they think that if they hit him where it hurts , by cutting off American aid to the Philippines , he 'll come running back to good ol ' Uncle Sam , the tried and tested dispenser of development assistance . <p> The United States has started turning the screws on the Duterte administration by withholding a large aid package on concerns about the rule of law and civil liberties . The decision of the Millennium Challenge Corp. , a US Congress-funded agency , to defer approval of a new multi-million-dollar aid package for the Philippines also appears to be Washington 's way of finding out if President Rodrigo Duterte is really serious about embracing China and Russia and de-emphasizing the importance of traditional ties with our former colonial masters . <p> MCC was established by former President George W. Bush in 2004 " as a means of combating terrorism by funding development in poor nations under a strict neo-conservative free-trade model , " according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fundamentally changed the way the US distributed aid to developing countries by making them compete for funds with others , using a set of criteria developed by " independent " groups such as the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank . <p> Only last year , MCC said it had unanimously agreed to give the Philippines a second grant " in recognition of the policies on good governance " of close US ally President Noynoy Aquino . The announcement came ahead of the expiry last May of the first grant or " compact " of $434 million given to the Philippines , which was approved in 2010 . <p> The first tranche of the MCC grant , worth $262 million , was spent for the Secondary National Roads Development Project to improve access to markets and services for farmers , fishermen and small businessmen . A second installment of $120 million was earmarked for poverty reduction programs while the third , for $54.3 million , went to the computerization and streamlining of business processes of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . <p> Now , with Duterte in power and pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting the Philippines ' focus away from the US and towards American rivals China and Russia , the MCC said the renewal of the aid package will be " subject to a further review of concerns around rule of law and civil liberties . " In other words , the US is challenging Duterte to a game of diplomatic " chicken , " in effect asking him to choose between the American way or the highway . <p> Prior to the MCC 's decision to defer the renewal of the Philippine aid compact , the US has been gamely declaring that there will be no fundamental change in the relationship between Manila and Washington . This despite Duterte 's widely-reported cussing out of outgoing President Barack Obama , his opposition to the continued presence of US military forces in the Philippines and his apparent ill-will towards Americans in general . <p> The State Department noted that the new Philippine leader 's verbal anti-American broadsides have never escalated to formal diplomatic action . So perhaps the Americans have decided that it 's time to find out if Duterte 's actions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> * * * <p> Of course , the Americans may also discover , as not a few Filipinos have , that Duterte seems to enjoy proving his detractors wrong and that he will not back down from a fight . Instead of driving the Philippines back into the heart of the American geopolitical sphere of influence , Duterte may just decide to ratchet up the anti-US rhetoric and take his unabashed courtship of the Chinese and the Russians and his independent foreign policy to the next level . <p> The latest surveys , after all , have Duterte keeping his high trust rating among Filipinos , despite criticism of his campaign against illegal drugs . Never mind if the results of other polls show that Filipinos continue to hold the US in high regard and view other powers like China with a lot of suspicion . <p> Duterte has also consistently campaigned for improved economic and even military ties with the US ' rivals . His attempts to come up with a bilateral solution to the long-running dispute in the South China Sea and his plans to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US have led to comparisons with Josip Broz Tito , the Yugoslavian leader who famously played both the Russians and the Americans for the benefit of his countrymen . <p> But Duterte will need all the political skill that he has if he is to play with the big boys on the world stage . He can not quail at the first sign of pressure from any of the major geopolitical actors . <p> The Americans have fired a shot across Duterte 's bow with the deferment of the new MCC fund grant . It 's now up to the new guy from Davao to show if he deserves to sit at the same table as the Americans , the Chinese and the Russians . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

@@15925240 Standard <h> Asia 's gambling binge <p> Amid much protest , Japan 's lawmakers are considering a bill this week that would open their doors to opulent gambling houses . Analysts have dubbed it " manna from heaven " and the " holy grail . " Yet as any gambler will tell you , appeals to the divine are a sure sign of a weak hand . Japan 's casino project , like Asia 's gambling binge in general , is unlikely to end well . <p> The current vogue in the casino business is for " integrated resorts , " or multibillion-dollar goliaths designed to lure out-of-towners and offer them a variety of ways to spend -- shows , shopping , baroque dining -- beyond gambling . This model generally makes casinos more profitable , less dependent on high rollers , and better able to withstand economic ebbs and flows . <p> For governments , too , it 's an appealing prospect . In theory , foreigners will drop their cash , boost the local economy and take their problems home with them . Developers can be prodded to improve local infrastructure and to include space for conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's a hard dynamic to sustain . <p> For one thing , the Asia-Pacific region is already brimming with such resorts , from Singapore to Saipan , Vietnam to Vladivostok . New ones are on the way in the Philippines and South Korea . Macau has some three dozen and counting . Studies show that increased regional competition can drive down revenue for established casinos , as you might expect , and drawing out-of-towners becomes much harder when they have options closer to home . As the US has lately learned , this leads to some very unhappy endings for areas that ca n't compete . <p> Another problem is that many of these new resorts are pursuing the same customer : the Chinese tourist . With China 's economic growth sluggish and the yuan weakening , that 's not the sure bet it once was . The Chinese government is cracking down on foreign casino companies trying to recruit local gamblers . And it is keen to discourage capital flight , which means it may further tighten rules on spending overseas . <p> Even under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hype . Although they can produce a short-term economic boost , on average the effect dies out quickly . Taxing gambling might seem like a painless way to bolster budgets , but casinos can actually be a net drag on public revenue when social costs are factored in . What public income they do collect tends to be regressive . Without precautions , they can lead to a host of other ills , including lower property values , increased problem gambling , higher bankruptcy rates and more crime . <p> Japan faces some distinctive risks of its own . Nearly five percent of its adult population is addicted to gambling , according to government figures , a much higher rate than in other rich countries . A strong yen may discourage foreign tourists , and slots and craps are unlikely to alleviate the country 's chronic lack of demand , especially if they simply draw revenue from ubiquitous pachinko parlors . Not incidentally , most of the Japanese public opposes the measure . <p> The best argument in favor of any casino is that gambling is fun . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . If the public approves , and is fully informed about the social costs , it should be legal . But do n't be a sucker : The benefits of casinos are always oversold , just as the odds are always on the house . <h> Related stories : <h> More from this Category : <p> COMMENT DISCLAIMER : Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard .

But as the stench started to blanket the dump site and its surroundings , the lie about the facility being still useable in two to three years was exposed .

For the short term , one viable and legal choice available to him was to look for an existing landfill where the city could dump its trash instead of in the Inayawan dump site . <p> On this , he could have either renegotiated the deal with the private operator of the Consolacion landfill to correct whatever its infirmities are , or if he did not want to deal with the said private contractor , look for other available landfills in the province .

But more than a month after the family tragedy , she said she 's most worried about John Ryan , who had become detached , brooding , and given to tears . <p> The boy , she said , would often say : " Igaganti ko si Papa . Pinatay nila , kinuha nila ; natutulog lang ( I will avenge Papa . They killed him . They took him while he was asleep .
