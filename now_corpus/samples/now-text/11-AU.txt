@@3964231 <h> Politics , Disability and Social Inclusion : review <p> In his important and timely book Politics , Disability and Social Inclusion . People with different abilities in the 21st Century , Dr. Peter Gibilisco makes an innovative and major contribution to debates around , and our understandings of , politics , disability and social inclusion . <p> Bringing together theoretical debates around what constitutes a just society , up-to-date analysis of policy and political movements around disability , and important empirical material , including interviews with key thinkers and drawing on his own life experiences , Gibilisco makes a significant case for both the importance of a sociological approach to engaging with disability and for the continuing relevance of a pragmatic social democratic approach as a means of moving towards a socially just and inclusive society . <p> The book is divided into ten chapters . After an introductory chapter , in which the author sets out the terms of the debates and the central aspects of his arguments , the following three chapters engage with social democracy , neo-liberalism and the third way , both in general terms and in the context of the politics of disability . <p> Advertisement <p> Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes associated with globalisation , while chapter six is a vital chapter in which Gibilisco sets out the defining elements of a just society , a society which is inclusive of people with disabilities . <p> Chapters seven , eight and nine then explore different dimensions of the lives of people with disabilities , focusing on employment , education and service provision . Chapter ten provides a conclusion to the book . <p> Throughout the book , while the primary focus is on the Australian context , the debates that the author engages with and the examples he uses mean that the book is of relevance well beyond Australia . <p> A striking feature of the book is the author 's capacity to draw on his own experiences as a person with a severe physical disability , and to consider how his personal experiences connect to broader societal processes and to the experiences of others in society . <p> Here , indeed , is a significant example of CW Mills ' concept of the sociological imagination in practice , namely , the ability of the author to show , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual is intimately related to broader social , economic and political processes . <p> Indeed , one of the highlights of the book is the capacity of the author to interweave theoretical , policy and personal processes together to provide a compelling narrative about the politics of disability in contemporary societies . To give one specific example , the author makes a persuasive argument that societies such as Australia should not be fully satisfied if people with disabilities succeed in higher education . <p> Advertisement <p> While such outcomes are of course important , there is an ongoing obligation on society to ensure that structures and opportunities are in place so that individuals who have succeeded in education can continue to engage in a proactive way in society . <p> In other words , from a policy perspective , measuring the number of enrolments or graduations from education , while important , is not enough in terms of conceptualising policy outcomes . There is a need to consider what happens post-education . As the author 's own experiences show , societies such as Australia fall well short in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on employment , education and service provision , the author shows both how people with disabilities have been able to create opportunities for themselves in these areas , but also shows how they continue to experience systemic discrimination .

@@3964237 <h> Fish Facts : Seagrasses <p> Seagrasses are plants that are important cornerstones of our estuarine and inshore fisheries . Their leaves provide structure to otherwise featureless sandy bottoms , providing critical nursery habitat for a wide variety of fish and invertebrates through provision of food , shelter and protection from predators . Their root systems act to trap , stabilise and bind sediments , and they also oxygenate the water and the sediments they bind , reducing the buildup of toxic sulphides that otherwise form in anoxic sediments . A useful analogy is that they are the " lungs " of our estuaries and inshore environments . <p> It is common knowledge that seagrass habitats have undergone significant decline in the past 50-60 years . Unfortunately , this decline is predicted to continue throughout the 21st century . The first part of the decline begins with fragmentation of large continuous seagrass beds into smaller , more isolated patches , through processes such as storms or through human mediated mechanisms ( e.g. boat propellers , nutrient loading ) . <p> Fragmentation does not affect fisheries as much as you 'd think , because research shows that plankton and other fish foods ( and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus for a while fisheries productivity is not badly affected by early declines in seagrass , as fish remain abundant at the increased " edge areas " . <p> The next stage relates to catastrophic losses of seagrasses , often following flood events that bring sediments , nutrients and pollutants . Seagrasses can cope with a certain amount of sediment , and their growth can actually be increased by moderate nutrient loading . But in both cases too much of either results in mass seagrass diebacks . Like other plants , seagrasses need light for photosynthesis , but excess turbidity reduces light penetration , while nutrient loading encourages algal overgrowth that smothers seagrass . The most insidious pollutants though are the herbicides washed from agricultural and urban areas into the estuaries and bays during rainfall events . No one ever pulls weeds anymore , they spray , and there is now a significant body of scientific evidence showing levels of herbicides in inshore waters after rainfall events are high enough to cause seagrass dieback . Most herbicides work by blocking photosynthesis pathways -- essentially they shade out the seagrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seagrass loss is sometimes reversed with seagrass regrowth during favourable periods , but mostly meadows never regain their original extent . Massive seagrass losses have been linked all over the world to loss of biodiversity , coastal erosion , collapse of fisheries , and loss of populations of dugongs and turtles ( which eat seagrass ) . <p> Indeed , seagrasses are sensitive indicators of environmental quality , and because of this there are many seagrass monitoring and conservation programs in place around the world . Managing water quality ( reducing nutrient and sediment inputs and herbicide inflows ) and maintaining light availability through riparian and coastal buffer zones are critical approaches that support seagrass resilience . <p> In my local Moreton Bay Marine Park we have the Healthy Waterways ecosystem health monitoring program . This is a good start , but the program fails to relate its ecosystem quality ratings to something that key stakeholders such as fishers can understand -- for example is the habitat with a " B " rating still suitable for seagrasses and recruitment of fish ? Unfortunately , an assessment of their rating system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtly optimistic results . For example , high ranking estuaries such as the Noosa River ( B+ rating ) have issues with recruitment of sensitive native species such as Australian bass . The B rating is defined as " Good " -- conditions meet all set ecosystem health values " . In reality , a B rating denotes a system under significant stress - seagrasses are stressed and fish recruitment begins to fail at this level . I know this via a recent trip to Moreton Island , where I witnessed a seagrass meadow severely clogged with algae 1 km north of the Tangalooma wrecks , in an area with a " B " rating . Their C rating is defined as " Fair " -- Conditions meet some of the set ecosystem health values " . In reality , based on observations of loss of seagrasses , oysters and other bivalve molluscs ( = fish food items ) in Pumicestone Passage near where I live when it was rated " C " , it seems " C " indicates severe loss of ecosystem function . Pumicestone Passage just slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The D rating is classified as " Poor " , but in reality , D = Death of virtually any semblance of normal ecosystem function . This therefore suggests the Healthy Waterways F ( = Fail ) is completely redundant in that it is commonly associated with kills of adult fish in " F " areas such as the Albert-Logan river systems . Obviously the , sensitive seagrasses , larval fish and invertebrates are affected somewhere around " B " or " C " , well before death of adult fish , so do we have to wait for the " D " and " F " ratings before considering something is wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed ? <p> The Queensland Government recently alerted the public of the condition of the marine park with headlines such as " Marine Life Thriving in Moreton Bay Green Zones " . Of course , this is demonstrably false , as shown by the seagrasses and the Healthy Waterways results , which show that Moreton Bay is dying under the weight of relentless urban expansion . The worst part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , and is even spinning the public message to try and somehow blame fishing for the decline . <p> A Halophila sp. seagrass bed at Tangalooma , Nov 2010 , in an area with a " B " water quality rating .

Police estimated the crowd at 30,000 but rally organisers claimed they gathered 60,000 in the streets . <p> It was the biggest Red Shirt rally months after a violent government crackdown on protests . It was also the first major rally after the lifting of the state of emergency in the country 's capital . The Red Shirts core members are supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra but the group has since then become a broad movement calling for substantive changes in Thai government and society . <p> Bangkok Pundit confirms that the Sunday rally was the biggest Red Shirt protest since the street blockades last year . <p> This is actually the biggest rally since the March-May protests by a long way . On September , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around 8,000 reds gathered in Bangkok on October 10 , another 12,000 in Ayutthaya on October 17 , and up to 10,000 gathered again on November 19 to mark the six-month anniversary of the May 19 crackdown . <p> The rally started at the Democracy Monument . Jatuporn Prompan , the Red Shirt leader , was forbidden by a court order to go and speak at the rally . However , he defied that order today . He not only turned up , but he gave a speech as well . That is really what made this rally so different from anything we have seen since the bloody crackdown by the army which resulted in 91 deaths . For the first time we had people giving speeches . <p> The parade virtually brought many roads through Bangkok to a standstill . Despite that , I witnessed many shopkeepers coming out to clap and cheer as the Reds passed them by ... the thousands that came today mainly came by their own transport . Most people were from around Bangkok and the surrounding provinces . <p> Their demand was simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

An estimated 60,000 protesters turned out in support of their political beliefs . They initially departed from Democracy Monument , a focal point of remembrance for their dead , who were killed during the May 19 , 2010 , crackdown . <p> The crush of Red Shirts on Sunday ( January 9 ) signaled that with the disbandment of the CRES state of emergency decree more are willing to take to the streets to show their dissaisfaction with the current government . Prime Minister Abhisit has talked about reconcilliation to smooth the political divide but by and large the Red Shirt movement has brushed off his attempts . The Red Shirt leaders and laymen believe that Abhisit 's policy initiatives are insincere and self-promotional . <p> The reliqueshing of the emergency decree and the subsequent invoking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government mechanisms in place for the government to take a hard line against its opposition . The military can still be used as a policing apparatus and people can be detained for up to seven days without legal representation . However cynical , the invoking of the ISA might be , it does allow for more political freedom albeit at the behest of the government and military . <p> Abhisit 's boldfaced strategy coming into the as yet to be declared elections strays wildly from past Democrat Party platforms . They have taken a page from former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 's play book . Thaksin won over the provincial voters through populist policies and a promise to reform the system . Thaksin kept his promises with soft loans , a 30-baht health plan and a wildly popular OTOP project where the provinces used their skills and produced high-quality goods for internal sale and on the international market.Prime Minister Abhisit has largely copied Thaksin 's platform and introduced his own populist policies in an attempt to lure Red Shirt supporters to his camp . His strategy will largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pracha Wiwat ( Public Interest ) plan is based on nine principles . These are mostly centred around good governance and social welfare programs . The issuance of low-interest rate loans of 5000 baht to taxi drivers , motorbike taxi drivers and street vendors would appear to be a positive step . However , 5000 baht in today 's world is not nearly enough to do anything constructive with . There is nothing of substance to this plan and it has been criticised as being a governmental payoff to buy votes . <p> Another major point of this plan is the extension of social security to 24 million Thais in the informal jobs sector . This is supposed to help low-paid Thais when they near retirement age . However , the poor in Thailand never retire but continue to work until they are physically unable . What paltry sumd they garner from social security will do them little if any good . The Abhisit oil subsidy program of 7.3 billion baht aimed at keeping cooking oil and gas prices low is a shortsighted venture aimed at drawing votes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's oil and gas prices ? <p> The most head-scratching proposal is Abhisit 's plan to reduce crime in Bangkok by 20% in six months . There have been little if any details given about how this will be achieved and government agencies , most notably the Crime Suppression Division , has said it 's " impossible " to do so in such a short amount of time . <p> In 2009 the Royal Thai Police Force was viewed as the most corrupt government agency . It will be very hard for the public to believe that one of the engines of corruption in Thailand is wiling or able to affect real change in the crime rate . <p> None of Abhisit 's plans mean anything if they are not administered in a transparent and equitable manner . The current government 's record on the administration of the country does n't bode well for the future of Pracha Wiwat . The government is perceived by the public as being more corrupt now than under former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra . <p> Abhisit 's nine-point plan hinges on whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equitable fashion . How much of the funds will reach the provinces ? Abhisit 's needs to sway a large section of the population from the north and northeast if he is to have any chance winning an election . If the funds for these programs are siphoned off by corruption before they reach the people he needs the most , he has little if any chance to win their hearts . <p> The insincerity with which Pracha Wiwat is viewed might play into the hands of Abhisit 's opposition . The people can take the money and wai but in still vote for the opposition . Nothing guarantees which box they tick . <p> What can be guaranteed are the memories of May 19 , especially for the people of the north and northeast . The January 9 rally suggest sthat they wo n't .

What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a decent thesis . I completed a PhD in Austrian capital and interest theory , focusing on Menger , B ? hm-Bawerk , Mises and Hayek -- real intellectual champions . You ca n't beat the subjective theory of value ; wins hands down on the labour theory of value . <p> However , the whole econometric approach seems to be just glorified statistics to me , though it seems to have its use . Multivariate models try and explain the past and predict the future . Forecasting , proper , appears to be more honest , and really has nothing to do with economic analysis , but makes an effort to use the past to predict the future by minimising error terms . And it is pretty useful -- at least in the short run . But call a spade a spade : forecasting is forecasting -- statistics ; econometrics uses statistics as the vehicle and bolts economic notions onto the explanatory variables ( but it is still empirical , as against the bulk of Austrian concepts , which are rationalist ) . <p> The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish in A and A* journals . It is a funding thing . Economics departments are now focusing on hiring North American economics graduates ; and , if want a job as a finance academic , you simply need to be on top of quantitative analysis . <p> The deafening silence from the many responses ( ! ) to my post , to me at least , indicates a couple of things : ( 1 ) how unaware the public is of what passes for mainstream academic economics in Australia ( or elsewhere ) ( though some of the microeconomics can be useful , as can some of the forecasting tools , applied commercially ) ; and ( 2 ) how utterly detached the academic profession is from the general public . The whole thing passes as a black box . <p> I recall that Ron Manners of http : //www.mannkal.org does sponsor a couple of undergraduate Austrian units at The University of Notre Dame ( WA ) , taught by a history of thought specialist , Assoc Prof Greg Moore . <p> The mainstream have control of the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other heterodox schools ( e.g. Minsky and the post-Keynesians ) are making a gallant effort , but it will take a while . <p> No wonder that anyone who challenges the mainstream is left without a place in an economics department . <p> ( What I find bizarre is how Glenn Stevens can call himself a Christian and sit atop the RBA , which controls the time price of money and credit , and not make any statement about the judicial nature of that activity . After all , though it is legislated , the notion of controlling the overnight cash rate is tantamount to distorting the time-price of money . It is nothing different to theft , because it causes harm to the holders of Australian RBA dollars by distorting their value . But this is the very nature of fiat money ! I suppose Glenn needs to eat as well . Good luck on judgement day with that one , Glenn ! And to all fiat money protagonists . ) <p> The curious and certain thing about what you know , is that you are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain worldview -- knowledge , reality and ethics -- is a deduction of those committed principles . Nothing will budge mainstream economics unless their presuppositions are seriously -- rationally and empirically -- challenged . There are not many brave souls who can fight on in a university economics department and do this ; one needs to eat . Those that do specialise in their own area of research and get on with teaching . <p> I recall one classical economist argue for Say 's Law ( " goods that are produced and paid for with money become the source of the demand for other goods " ) ; he was met with fierce and determined opposition by a neoclassical mainstream macroeconomist . The latter could not understand the former , because he was speaking in classical economics ' terms ; whereas the latter , though adamant that he is not a Keynesian , and a committed neoclassical macroeconomist , would not accept the notion of Say 's Law ( which , by the way , was the focus of Keynes ' attack in his General Theory ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the neoclassical economist an economist ; they are more glorified mathematical statisticians , who use economic data ( in GSGE models ) as the subject matter . <p> What is needed is some serious methodological debate ; but that is so involved and detailed that it loses itself , and participants return to their corners to fight on . I gave a seminar once on the ontology and epistemology of the Austrian School ; it was met with blank looks . As I noted , one will only understand and produce what accords with one 's worldview . Anything outside of that is akin to listening to an alien language . <p> In the meantime , it is commercial -- Port Philip publishing -- and think tank apparatchiks -- CIS , Mises Institute -- that are making headway with this , but it takes deep pockets , sacrifice and commitment . <p> I reckon one should begin with Rothbard 's Man , Economy and State before Mises 's Human Action . Mises , you see , continued on with the great philosophical debates ( in the first few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History ) . I recall an article by Shostak , who also noted that he understood Mises better after reading Rothbard . <p> If you want to avoid methodology , read Rothbard 's Man , Economy and State , which has more economic analysis than method ( though he still has a great deal of the latter ) . If you want a broad spectrum of economics , it is Mises 's Human Action . If you wish to understand capital and interest theory , read B ? hm-Bawerk 's Positive Theory of Capital ( then Mises ) . Hayek is also good on capital and the trade cycle and for fleshing out a lot of Mises ( similar to Rothbard ) . And if you want to read the Austrian founder , read Menger 's Principles , a real delight . Menger was a real intellectual innovator , as were they all , as each built on the common edifice of the subjective theory of value . <p> The Austrians buried the labour theory of value , so Marx is dead ; but Keynes is still kicking . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in mathematical form ) presupposes a relationship between aggregates ; but it misses out on the causal links . They should be more honest and simply state that CGE and DSGE models are glorified statistics or macroeconometrics , because there does not need to be any real economic analysis in macroeconomics . The tools are largely mathematical and statistical . It is an empirical matter . <p> I argued , in my research , that the Austrian position was personified by Mises , and therefore it was rationalist . He was one of the last rationalists still standing . But Mises is largely ignored or simply side-stepped . <p> Empiricism is the new god ; however , there is one and small overriding problem with the empirical method : that is , it can not verify itself as a method . In other words , when many economists want empirical proof concerning any proposition , they want evidence , so they turn to econometrics and look for the evidence . This can not be true , by definition , because the empirical method implies the use of raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes implied , as the tools by which the raw data is interpreted . Even these rational propositions can not be verified , because they are abstract and evidence can not be mounted to confirm or deny them . <p> This is why the subjective theory of value is ignored , though implied , by mainstream micro- and macro-economists . And it is why the Austrians continue to push it -- the notion of a universal , referred to as the subjective theory of value , in which individuals ordinally rank their needs and wants on an internal value scale , in order of importance , with each want to be fulfilled to such a degree , and then the next and so on . As these needs stand in opposition to the available supply on the market , a marginal price is struck , which represents the marginal value of the last unit the individual is willing to give up in order to satisfy the extant want . And then , as noted , the individual moves onto the next want . <p> Hence the reason which Mises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the bounds of available savings , and the ensuing boom and bust ; that the time-price of money on the market can be distorted by deflation or ( usually ) inflation , or by control over the quantity of media inflated onto the market , which again distorts the time-price of money ( interest rates ) . But it is worse : the whole physical capital structure of the market economy is time dependent ; and this , too , is distorted when interventions , in the form of the central bank , enters the market to impose its own order -- the order of the state . <p> It all began with Menger , and was developed by his disciples : methodological subjectivism and methodological individualism . They simply refer to the individual ( or corporate entity ) as the final authority on all matters of value in the market ; and that the method by understanding this is one of subjective value -- that the individual 's scale of values determines this value .

We are healthier , in general , than we were 30 years ago . But when we get sick , we usually require more complex forms of care from a wider range of health professionals . <p> Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall in 1984 would have been taken to hospital , patched up and sent home to fend for himself .

Medicare does not cover the cost of most non-medical treatments and does not take into account the long-term cost of care . <p> As a result , many people with chronic conditions face high , ongoing costs for treatment to manage their condition which can result in them missing out on essential care . According to a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) study 10 per cent of patients referred to a specialist delay their treatment due to its cost . A survey by mental health body SANE also found that the majority of respondents reported having to choose between paying for health care or other essentials , such as food , on at least one occasion . <p> The EMSN was introduced in 2004 to address this issue by subsidising 80 per cent of all out-of-pocket costs ( once a threshold had been reached ) . This policy was so poorly designed that it not only failed to reduce out-of-pocket costs for many in the target group but actually caused an overall increase in specialists ' fees resulting in higher costs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Safety Net found that in some specialty areas 78 per cent of total funding for the program had gone into doctors ' pockets in the form of fee increases with consumers receiving only 22 per cent of benefits .

The Howard government may as well have handed medical specialists a chequebook and asked them to write themselves a pay rise . <p> Caps placed on the level of the rebates available for some services were imposed in 2010 to attempt to address this issue . However , there is no way the Government can force the doctors involved to reverse their opportunistic fee increases . <p> Other problems with the EMSN revealed by the review were that most of the funding went towards families living in the richest areas of Australia . In fact , only 3.5 per cent of the total amount allocated under the Safety Net went to families living in the poorest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more likely they are to use private health services . Even with the Safety Net , many poorer Australians can not afford the out-of-pocket costs of private health care . <p> The review concluded that there was little evidence that the EMSN had reduced out-of-pocket health care costs for most consumers . This finding is supported by recent research from the ABS which found in 2010 that medical gap costs have soared by 30 per cent in the past three years . Unless this issue is addressed , it will fundamentally undermine the universality of Medicare by locking out some of the most vulnerable from many sectors of the health system . <p> One of the policy challenges in this area is that the distribution of out-of-pocket medical costs across the population has what statisticians call ' a long tail ' . Basically this means that the number of people facing high out-of-pocket costs is low but that the costs they face are high . <p> This is why the AMA can argue correctly ( although disingenuously ) that gap payments are not a problem on average while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out the inequities in a ' universal ' health care system where many of the sickest and poorest struggle to afford the care they need .

This involves making a distinction between the different types of financial barriers to accessing health care . <p> Many people facing short-term difficulties with health bills have a budgeting problem rather than an overall affordability problem . This is because medical expenses are often unpredictable and coincide with times of reduced earning capacity .

The EMSN ( like many other safety nets ) uses income level as a targeting mechanism . This is a mistake . Income is at best a crude predictor of the ability to afford health care . A safety net based on annual income treats a healthy 18-year-old student with a part-time job the same as a frail 85-year-old pensioner . It treats someone with a one-off health care expense the same as someone with a life-long condition requiring ongoing treatment . <p> A more sophisticated mechanism for identifying those individuals and families who have problems affording the health care they need would take into account the overall long-term costs of their care as well as their income level . This would include many people ( but not all ) on low incomes and those on middle or even high incomes with substantial ongoing health expenses . <p> Currently , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Australians over their lifetimes . However , new developments in IT , allowing for the development of electronic health records , unique patient identifiers and health credit cards , would enable this to occur . This would enable subsidies to be directed at those who incur ongoing expenses rather than those with an intermittent need for care . <p> A redesigned safety net also needs to distinguish between necessary and discretionary health services . Over 30 per cent of the funding for the EMSN went on private obstetrics services , despite the fact that this is a planned , one-off expense for which there is a high-quality and free public alternative . <p> Someone choosing to pay $3,000 to have a baby in a private hospital is clearly a lower priority for public subsidies than someone with debilitating arthritis who needs to spend the same amount on non-PBS drugs simply so she can get out of bed in the morning .

@@3984233 <p> Record-breaking floods in Queensland are having a domino effect on our local construction , mining and insurance industries , washing away profits and hampering progress . Principals need to be prepared for a potential raft of claims as the aftermath prompts doubts and delays for construction in affected areas . <p> Principals and contractors on sites damaged by flooding need to first consider whether their construction contract specifically provides for flooding as an ' excepted risk ' . If not , then contractors will be responsible for rectifying the loss or damage at their own cost . However , the contract may declare that flooding is an event of force majeure , and free the parties from certain obligations . <h> HopgoodGanim 's recommendations <p> Parties to construction contracts for sites affected by flooding should urgently examine their contractual arrangement and consider the following : <p> Does the contract have a Force majeure clause outlining the consequences of floods or delays ? A contractor seeking to rely on such a clause bears the onus of proving its application and adhering to any notice requirements . <p> If floods are not specified as a Force majeure event , how are extensions for delay granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeframes required , and principals should carefully monitor the completion date as adjusted . <p> Can the contractor claim the costs of delay ? Standard form contracts usually only entitle contractors to claim costs for delays caused by the principal , ' excepted risks ' , or risks provided for elsewhere in the contract . <p> Upon recommencing work , can the contractor claim costs for reinstatement of the works ? Standard form contracts generally require the contractor to reinstate the works at its own expense , unless the cause of damage is specified as an ' excepted risk ' or a risk otherwise provided for by the parties . <p> Which party is responsible for insuring the works under contract ? That party should closely examine whether the policy genuinely excludes the type of flooding responsible for any damage . <h> The renewed significance of Force majeure Clauses <h> Frustration <p> When a contract has become impossible to perform , or radically different to what the parties contemplated , there are grounds that the contract has been frustrated . However , it is important to note that the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually render performance as ' radically different ' . <p> On the other hand , Force majeure clauses may prove to be a lifeboat for parties looking to avoid or allocate liability for damage on flood-stricken sites . According to The Australian Financial Review , mining companies such as Peabody Energy , Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton have all declared Force majeure to break supply contracts in the wake of the floods . The typical requirements are that the event was not reasonably foreseeable and was completely beyond the parties ' control . If triggered , such clauses can establish the event of Force majeure as a neutral risk borne by both parties . <h> What constitutes a Force majeure event ? <p> Force majeure is not a common law concept . Consequently , whether principals find themselves caught by Force majeure will depend on how the clause has been negotiated in each contract . An exhaustive list of predicaments may be set out , ranging from invasion and national strikes to the kind of natural disaster that has affected much of the State . Comprehensive or exclusive clauses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If provided for , contractors can still be deemed responsible for reinstating any damage . This saves the principal from having to recontract for the construction of the damaged section of the works . Instead , reconstruction can be treated as a variation to the existing contract . <p> Inclusive definitions that are non-exhaustive and leave scope for a wide range of events will no doubt be drawn on by contractors seeking non-performance . Contractors may view their obligations as ' discounted ' by an event of force majeure . However , such clauses should not be considered a right to non-performance , but rather protection against failure to perform an obligation as long ascertain circumstances exist . Alternatively , the consequences of the Force majeure event can expand on suspension and include return of payments , cancellation or termination rights . <h> Seeking extensions of time <p> The absence of clauses related to flooding in a contract may not render a contractor helpless . Most standard form contracts provide for inclement weather as a valid or ' qualifying ' cause of delay . Before claiming an extension of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 of the Domestic Building Contracts Act 2000 ( Qld ) for wet days . <p> Procedure must be adhered to strictly . For example , the standard form Construct contract AS2124-1992 requires that a claim be made within 28 days of the delay occurring . A principal maintains its right to liquidated damages should the reviewed date for practical completion not be met . <h> Insuring the contract works <p> Generally , either the contractor or principal is responsible for insuring the contract works . A policy may or may not provide coverage for flooding , and insurance companies will be quick to rely on the relevant exclusion clause . However , there may be scope to dispute a rejected claim where there is evidence that the flooding is not within the conditions defined in the exclusion clause . <p> Flooding from a ' natural watercourse ' is generally excluded , whereas localised or flash flooding caused by rainfall may be covered . Liability may be excluded where riverine flooding is the sole cause of damage , but a claim may be upheld where it was a contributing factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of ' flooding ' , is essential for any insured party . <h> Entitlement to delay costs <p> The Queensland floods will inevitably affect the earnings of contractors and principals alike . However , as a general rule , contractors are only entitled to prolongation costs ( costs caused by the delay ) where they stem from a breach by the principal . <p> Standard form contracts AS2124-1992 ( Construct ) and AS4300-1995 ( Design and Construct ) provide that the delay must be caused by the principal for the contractor to recover costs . However , Clause 36 allows parties to agree on additional events where the contractor can recover delay costs . <p> Similarly , standard form contracts AS4000-1997 ( Construct ) , AS4902-2000 ( Design and Construct ) and AS4910-2002 ( Supply -- with installation ) provide in Clause 34.9 that a contractor may claim for delay damages only if the extension of time results from a ' compensable cause ' , namely the fault of the principal . <p> For more information about the effect of Queensland 's floods on construction contracts , please contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The process will give certainty to landholders for property management and to resource companies for mining activities . <p> Some comments from our readers ? ?

@@3984237 <h> An ' unthreatening ' lunch with Tony Abbott <p> To a casual observer , it would n't have looked unusual , just a table of presumably gay men at a restaurant in East Sydney , having lunch . A more knowledgeable observer might recognize some of the people at the table : Associate Professor Max Kelly , an historian at Macquarie University and a President of the History Council of NSW ; Dr Ian Black , who taught history at the University of NSW and was a close associate of the state Independent MP for the inner-city seat of Bligh , Clover Moore ; the writer Gary Dunne , who was also Chair of the Board of the gay weekly Sydney Star Observer ; Larry Galbraith , former editor of the gay monthly Campaign and a former editor of Sydney Star Observer ; and me at that time Co-Director of the Australian Centre for Lesbian and Gay Research at the University of Sydney , and also teaching in the University 's Faculty of Economics . <p> Also at the table were Christopher Pearson , a former speechwriter for John Howard and former editor of the Adelaide Review , and Tony Abbott . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister for Employment , Education , Training and Youth Affairs . This was clearly before he decided he felt ' threatened ' by gay men . <p> Advertisement <p> The luncheon had come about at the instigation of Christopher Pearson , whom I knew only slightly . I had met him some years before , in a former life , he had dabbled in gay activism himself , and I had some dealings with him when he was editing the Adelaide Review . <p> He contacted me with an intriguing offer ; the Howard government had recently taken office in Canberra , and Christopher said that he and Tony would like to meet some politically-minded gay men in Sydney , to discuss what the Howard government might do for the gay community . Larry had interviewed Abbott several times , on topics of concern to the gay community . <p> Christopher was a committed trencherman , and suggested that we dine at Otto 's .

There was much to discuss , in terms of discriminatory legislation that should be amended or repealed , and positive steps to be taken - but the time rolled by . Abbott and Pearson were attentive , but not particularly forthcoming . It was at the dessert stage that someone , I ca n't remember who , put the question : what was in it for the conservative Coalition ? <p> Apparently Abbott and Pearson had noted , at the previous state election in NSW , the ongoing campaign within the gay community against the ALP and Susan Harben , its candidate in the seat of Bligh , where she was pitted against Clover Moore . Harben had had a high-profile in Sydney 's lesbian and gay communities - she had been President of Mardi Gras - but was a recent convert to the ALP , gaining instant preselection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece for the Sydney Review , looking at the possible outcomes for the citizens of this important inner-city seat . <p> Advertisement <p> Harben had lost convincingly , and Pearson and Abbott wanted to meet with us , to build on this anti-ALP sentiment within a community that had some political and economic clout in Sydney . <p> There was a stunned and incredulous silence when this was explained to us . <p> Did Abbott and Pearson have any idea who they were dealing with ? We were not some cabal of conservatives - most of the gay men at the table would never have voted for the Coalition ; it epitomized everything we abhorred . Most attacks on the gay community came from Coalition people such as state National Party MP Peter Rowland-Smith , who wanted the Mardi Gras parade to be banned from Sydney streets ; or Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan , Howard 's bovver-boy , who made false accusations under Parliamentary privilege against High Court Justice Michael Kirby ; or the National Party 's Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson , who wanted a book featuring two lesbians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those two so-called political sophisticates - Abbott from the refined wastes of Sydney 's North Shore , and Pearson from Adelaide , the " Athens of the South " had utterly misread the Bligh campaign and what it was about , which was having an independent voice in state Parliament , rather than some hack who would do a party 's bidding . Our anti-ALP stance was for Clover , a long-time gay rights supporter , not for the conservatives . <p> As might be expected , the meal ended shortly thereafter . We all paid for our food , and Abbott generously offered to pay for the wine . We Sydney gay men wandered off into the afternoon sun , a trifle befuddled perhaps , but much bemused by these blow-ins .

@@3984238 <p> Ambassador Monz ? n , who arrived in Australia in late 2010 , had invited a number of union leaders for a chat . Paul Howes , as national secretary of the AWU , responded in what seemed an unnecessarily offensive way : " I would be happy to take up your offer to meet but this can , unfortunately , only happen once the Cuban government stops repressing independent trade unions and releases the many union leaders now in prison in your country . " He names five men , held in jail . <p> Paul Howes says the AWU has " been critical for some time " of Cuba 's trade union federation , the Central de Trabajadores de Cuba ( CTC ) , which has coverage of almost all employees in Cuba . He claims the federation 's leaders are not elected but rather appointed by the state . After citing information prepared by US-funded groups , he concludes : " there is increasing talk of the need for unions to highlight this repression and put more pressure on Communist regime sic which rules your country to give workers real rights in the workplace " . <p> Perhaps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howes may have missed the point that , since late 2009 , the Australian Labor Party-led federal government has been engaging with Cuba on aid and international affairs . Never mind , he 's not a Labor member of parliament yet . <p> In the substance of his Cold War styled claims , Paul copied arguments developed by US-government funded groups , the latest of which is the Committee for Free Trade Unionism ( CFTU ) , cleverly borrowing the old acronym for the international trade union federation , the ITUC ( formerly the ICFTU ) . The CFTU has managed to have some of its material adopted by the ITUC . The " dissident union groups , the CUTC , the CONIC and the CTDC " that the AWU claims to support , do not exist as unions in Cuba . They are US-funded fronts . <p> Cubans understand very well that these groups -- like the " Ladies in White " , the " independent journalists " and the " independent human rights monitors " -- are business operations . A Cuban friend of mine who works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand out $50 to each of the " Ladies in White " , and $30 each to their companions , for each event or action in which they participate . The money comes to this embassy from the US Interests Section in Havana . <p> Precisely because the US has been working these fronts for many years , Cuba 's trade unions maintain a united and pro-Revolution front . Unity has been a key strength of the Cubans , in face of half a century of US aggression . <p> The CUTC , which the AWU claims to support , is run by Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos from Miami . He is cited by Paul Howes as an ex-political prisoner who was jailed for his union activities . This is quite false . Alvarez Ramos was jailed in 2003 for paid collaboration with the US government in programs specifically designed to overthrow the constitutional order in Cuba . Such activity is a crime in Cuba , as in most countries . Alvarez Ramos was released in 2006 and lives and works for US-funded groups in Miami . That city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the Washington money , gives the CUTC a leg up into the AFL-CIO . <p> The CFTU includes a gaggle of old AFL-CIO members , who in turn collect money from USAID and the trade union wing of the US government-funded National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) . The NED , set up by the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s , is notorious for its backing of " transition " regimes for countries such as Afghanistan , Iraq , Haiti and Honduras . Its current activities focus heavily on Cuba , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia and Ecuador . While the US has laws against foreign funding of political activities within the US , this is precisely what the US Congress funds the NED to do , in other countries . <p> The CFTU attacks pretty much every country on " union rights " , except the US and its client states , and pays an extraordinary amount of attention to Cuba . Some of the group 's material has been adopted by the ITUC , to its discredit . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramos , are working on Cuba . <p> For example , CFTU board member , Ms Lourdes Kistler , got NED money in the 1990s for the AFL-CIO 's " Committee for a Free Cuba " campaign . The CFTU 's website notes that she also secured the CFTU " a U.S. State Department grant ... to assist Cuban labor activists trying to organize democratic and independent trade unions " . <p> The US government has for many years funded a series of campaigns supposedly in support of " independent journalists " , " human rights advocates " , " labour rights advocates " and so on . The integrated " transition " program which provides these funds ( from US Congress , the State Department and USAID , not to mention the CIA ) for the various " independent " groups " requires " a system in Cuba which is based on a " free economy " , with privatisation of all key sectors , including health . All this is spelt out in US law ( the 1996 Helms Burton Act ) and elaborated in the George W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of US President Barack Obama has made no changes to the plan . <p> A " Free Cuba " must join the World Bank , decontrol prices , engage in an " effective privatization program " , enforce new property rights and various other " free market mechanisms " . The US government will also " encourage a Free Cuba to settle outstanding property claims issues as expeditiously as possible " . This last one could put the Cuban people in debt for as much as US$100 billion . The impact of all this on workers ' rights would be appalling . <p> Apart from Alvarez Ramos , other alleged labour activists mentioned in Paul Howes ' letter - -- Nelson Molinet Espino ( CTDC ) and Iv ? n Hern ? ndez Carrillo ( CONIC ) - -- were jailed not for labour activism , but for collaboration with and receiving money from the then US station chief in Havana , James Cason . If your Spanish is up to it you can read about these people in Rosa Miriam Elizalde and Lu ? s Baez 's 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Aleida Godinez , " Revelaciones sobre el ' sindicalismo independiente ' en Cuba " . <p> It 's worth noting that the CFTU and the anti-Cuban AFL-CIO committee are made up of US citizens who are banned from travelling to Cuba to actually talk to Cuban trade unionists ; that is , they are banned from talking to Cubans by the very same government that pays them to malign Cuba . <p> Paul Howes keeps this Cold War spirit alive by his own bold " boycott " . He claims the CTC leadership is " not elected by workers but appointed by the state and the Cuban Communist party " . This is simply false and shows his great ignorance , probably willing ignorance , of the Cuban system . Fortunately there are a number of other Australian trade unions officials who have travelled to Cuba to talk with their CTC counterparts , and who would know more . The CTC has its own elections and provides input to all significant government policies and laws , before they are finalised . <p> It is true that the CTC works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . This is what is expected of a socialist system . Even in capitalist Australia most of the trade unions are embedded in the Labor Party , forcing them to back wars , privatisations and the interests of giant corporations . In Cuba the state-union link has meant the CTC , along with the Federation of Cuban Women , is deeply involved in policy development and has achieved some substantial gains . <p> Paul Howes makes an off-hand remark about the CTC supposedly collaborating in mass " sackings " in public enterprises . It is understandable that Australians might not know much about recent changes in Cuba . Reports from the US appear alarming and non-Spanish speakers would find the Cuban debates hard to access . But why commit to firm opinions based on ignorance ? <p> With the involvement of the CTC , the Cuban government defined the rights of laid-off workers in the Ministry of Work and Social Security 's Resolution 35 , October 7 , 2010 . Almost all current lay-offs are for productivity reasons , as in the 1990s , when the sugar industry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the immediate supervisor and a CTC representative . If laid off , the worker can apply for another position in the state sector , a small business license , a usufruct land lease or for work in the non-state sector . Laid-off workers receive full salary for one month , then 60% salary for up to five months , depending on length of service . <p> All Cubans maintain rent-free and mortgage-free housing , free health care , free education for life and subsidised basic foods . Social security , paid maternity leave ( for one year ) and free child care ( from when the child can walk ) is guaranteed for all . Have any Australian unions achieved this ? <h> Comments <p> " He claims the federation 's leaders are not elected but rather appointed by the state . " <p> What a hypocritical little gusano Howes is . He 's really so organically connected to the AWU membership , which is really so bursting with participatory democratic struggle . From my recollection from his brief teenage fling with socialist politics in the mid 90s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has been a creature of the union bureaucracy since the age of 17 . After never working a day in his life in any job undertaken by his membership , he was " elected unopposed as National Secretary in 2007 and was re-elected unopposed in 2009. " http : **25;698;TOOLONG . I wonder if he got any mainstream media space for this heroic stand , which is the main point of his numerous pompously " controversial " pronouncements , like his mentor Bill Shorten . <p> In reality Howes is n't elected but rather appointed by the most right-wing , pro-Labor elements of the bureaucracy . <p> It takes two to do a Cold War tango and Tim Anderson is engaged in the pathetic dance of anti-Communism with pro-Communism . <p> The latter means identification with the kind of Communist state that collapsed almost everywhere in the popular and workers uprisings of the late-1980s . <p> This dance was going on in the inter/national trade union and labour movement in the 1960s when I was working for the Prague-based World Federation of Trade Unions ( WFTU ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discourse , Czechoslovakia for Cuba and the ROH ( ' Revolutionary Trade Unions ' ) for the CTC . Then as now , trade union ' tourists of the revolution ' would be wined and dined in Prague , provided with guided tours of selected factories and union offices , and return to extol the socialist and democratic nature of the Czech trade unions . <p> I would have thought it was the task of any left , socialist or even merely democratic social scientist to surpass this exchange of fundamentalist coldwar brickbats , to provide some fresh and independent research , rather than reproducing Cuban government propaganda . <p> If the Cuban regime and its unions were in any way democratic they would welcome critique from and dialogue with trade unions , socialists and democrats in the capitalist world . <p> Instead they are totally identified internationally with the Communist rump of the old WFTU - an organisation with virtually no profile on the global stage and which provides no challenge at all to the social-reformist and Eurocentric International Trade Union Confederation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

On the last year of his contract , the unceremonious ousting of Ivan Henjak will certainly have Kevvy on his toes . <p> And in literal terms , he 'll be taking on season 2011 with a team of heavyweights . Ben Hannant might have headed back to Queensland , but in his place the Doggies have bought in a ridiculously hefty foursome : prospective NRL regular Grant Millington , Frank ' the Tank ' Pritchard , promising young prop Aiden Tolman and Greg Eastwood , the man who inspired a million weight-related jokes . <p> It 's a seriously beefed up Bulldogs outfit , and no doubt there will be more bite in their pack this year , to back up Michael Ennis and his special brand of menace around the ruck . <p> The difficulty will be the big shoes that new recruit Trent Hodkinson will have to fill on the field . While Luke ' General ' Patten is finding his feet in the English Super League , Canterbury have lost their other little general , Brett Kimmorley . Noddy brought a wealth of experience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match his on-field authority , even with Noddy working with the club as a halves coach . It remains to be seen whether Kris Keating can stake a claim to a spot in the halves alongside him or whether Ben Roberts will make it his own . <p> The loss of Noddy means added pressure and responsibility on hooker Michael Ennis to look beyond his own game and direct the attack ; look for him to struggle a little as he adapts to the power shift . <p> There is no shortage of wingers or three-quarters at Belmore : even if giant Jamal Idris is moved to the back row , the Dogs have brought in Michael Lett and Jonathan Wright to back up players like Bryson Goodwin , Josh Morris and Steve Turner . <p> X-Factor : Ben Barba has shown flashes of sheer brilliance for the past two years , and his unique skill with the ball in hand even earned him the nickname : " the X-factor " . As always , the question mark over him is n't his talent , but his ability to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the makings of a superstar . <p> Main man : Like his fellow old-school forward Michael Hodgson , Andrew Ryan is the hard-working , stand-up heart of the Canterbury club .

Kris Keating on the other hand I am not so sure ? I think Ben Roberts should be given first shot and number 6 as he has the ability to be a game breaker and is the incumbent . I really like Ben " x-factor " Barba at fullback as he can pop up anywhere and also can not be targeted by opposition attacks . Forwards on paper look awesome but Kevin Moore has to get the balance between flair and work right -- the dogs need David Stagg injury free as he does those little things that get unnoticed and Aiden Tolman to pick up where he left off before getting injured with the Storm . He is SOG quality . Bulldogs -- top 4 <p> OneHD knows their rugby league lol. 14th ? So you think they will go worse than last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have no weaknesses across the park and as apposed to last year , have a lot of depth . The major problem last year was Roberts getting injured and no mongrel in the forward pack . This year there is Keating and Roberts fighting for the position they lacked most(5/8) , and they have Eastwood and Pritchard now to provide some aggression and attack in the forwards . The big question mark is Barba at fullback but if it comes off it will be a massive boost , and there is always the back up options in Lett , Turner &amp; Goodwin . Also , I do nt think Ennis will struggle , he is the time of player that thrives on responsibility . Other than that I think you made some good points , it is just the predicted finish that baffles me . Out of all the prediction 's I have seen so far , this one will be the most off .

Illustration by John Shakespeare . <p> Charlie Sheen , Matthew Johns , Jeremy Clarkson and Sam Newman were all involved in controversies and , though variously bruised , survived to tell the tale .

It is not , Markson says , simply a case of different morals for radio and television but , rather , the vast difference in value Sandilands represented to the companies that employed him . <p> " To Austereo , he was the mainstay of the breakfast show and , therefore , the station in Sydney , plus his show was going for an hour a day right around the network ( on Fox FM in Melbourne ) .

" It 's a weird world we live in , " Markson says . " Some things are acceptable and others are n't . " <p> Despite Sheen 's apparent lack of contrition -- last week he claimed on US radio that sobriety was boring and the use of crack was fine " if you can manage it socially " -- saying sorry can work wonders after a celebrity implosion . <p> " Sometimes the strategy is to come out and say you 're sorry and the sooner you do , the better , " Markson says . <p> " You want to prick that bubble before it sets into the psyche of the public .

" <p> Markson says the media only reflect what the public wants . " You can not blame the media for reporting the news and nowadays gossip is the number one form of content , " he says . <p> Media organisations , Markson says , now have two sets of news values -- a set of core values for their primary business , such as a TV news service or newspaper , and a spicier set of parallel values for their web business . <p> " The web wants a sex scandal or pretty-girl pictures ; that 's where the eyeballs are coming to on the internet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote US gossip columnist Jeannette Walls , in which gossip has become the news and the news has become just another TV show .

@@4049236 <h> Can feminism overcome the beauty myth ? <p> In the feminist debates swirling around recently , the voices that we have heard are overwhelmingly those of Generation X women . As a Generation Y woman , I am a beneficiary of the courageous work of feminists before me . I have access to tertiary education and contraception , I can vote and assume roles outside the domestic sphere . These achievements are not to be understated but they do not signify the success of the feminism . <p> The goal of feminism was neither simply a female prime minister nor entitlement to equal pay . The fundamental aim of feminists was to change the way in which women were thought about . Only this would enable women to realise their potential as fully-fledged individuals . On these terms , the success of feminism is dubious . Society has been unable to revise conceptions of femininity . <p> While I have grown up with female politicians , with acknowledgement of domestic violence , I have also grown up with makeup , the Brazilian wax and anorexia . The inability to reconsider the image of the female body has damaged the women of my generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing makeup , and by boys who referred to the few girls who wore trousers as dykes . Watching my friends apply foundation at recess then at lunch , and again before leaving school , I was baffled . They explained that they felt more confident wearing mascara and blush . Why do young girls have to cover their faces to feel empowered ? This reveals their feeling of being deficient . <p> Some would argue that these girls were embracing and expressing their femininity . Why does femininity take the form of plump lips and sculpted eyebrows ? These girls were embracing an idea of female beauty that makes women loathe their bodies . <p> This learnt dislike of our bodies is age old . Yet , it has recently become more pronounced . This is evident in the number of young women waxing their vaginas , starving themselves , undergoing cosmetic surgery , essentially altering their bodies to look and feel ' beautiful ' . <p> In the few years that have passed since high school , two of my friends have received breast implants . They chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , at 20-years-old , would bigger breasts seem the way to happiness ? In our society femininity is equated with hips and breasts , with hairless legs and dainty hands . <p> The media , and not specifically magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Women 's Weekly , is largely responsible for entrenching this harmful idea . However , so too are the men and women who do not question the rules of beauty , who respond with scorn to the suggestion that shaven armpits are part of a debilitating image of beauty . <p> I am not saying that everyone is mindless , misogynistic , and oppressive . I am suggesting that the images of beauty that we are fed become so deeply embedded that they are hard to scrutinise . In her accusation that radical feminists underestimate women and men , Jennifer Wilson fails to understand the extent to which the media , along with the fashion and beauty industries , influence us . <p> I have found , amongst the women and men of my generation a suspicion and an ultimate misunderstanding of the various forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , to invite ridicule . The problems that Generation Y women face are fewer but they are also , dangerously , less visible . The less apparent the problem , the harder it is to address . <p> Moreover , constantly reminded that we have been liberated , that we can now freely choose our identities , we feel that we would be further victimising ourselves by acknowledging the feeling that our bodies are deficient . In this light , the distrust of and even contempt for radical feminist arguments that beauty practices are harmful are understandable . We want to be seen as free , independent thinkers . We do not want to concede that we have subscribed to an oppressive idea of beauty . <p> Wilson claims that conservatives and radical feminists consider women " too stupid to know if they 're being exploited " . This is a misinterpretation of radical feminism . According to Wilson , to learn from what we see around us is to be stupid . We are not stupid , we simply have never been presented with an alternate version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stupid , but because we want to fit the definition of beautiful . <p> I do n't want to pay 50 dollars every month to have my naturally growing pubic hair removed with hot wax but I want to be attractive , I want to be accepted . Unfortunately , being pretty appears incompatible with being natural . <p> I discovered this at 16 when I was teased , by boys and girls alike , for the hair that poked through my tights . Now , a few years older , I am still battling the conflicting desires , on the one hand to resist the notion of beauty that so devalues my body , and on the other to fit in . <p> Helen Razer 's encouragement to the women of my generation to " dispose of the need for self esteem " resonates with me but also seems a superficial solution to the double bind in which we find ourselves . <p> If the goal of feminism is to be reached , we do not need to discard self esteem , we need to rewrite the understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@4049237 <h> The case for ' less adversarial ' family law <p> Even the most amicable of divorces involving children can be traumatic for all parties , but when feuding parents are unable to come to an agreement on mutually acceptable arrangements for the children , the stormy ride through the Family Court of Australia or Federal Magistrates Court is one which delivers very few happy outcomes . <p> The fact of not having dealt with the children 's best interests beforehand and taking matters to the courts usually sends a signal of trouble ahead and it would seem that the only winners are the divorce industry practitioners . And of them there are plenty ; independent children 's lawyers , family counsellors , court-appointed family psychologists ( who can charge in excess of $11,000 for a 1.5-2 hour consultation ) , and of course the barristers and lawyers . <p> When dealing with conflict , the Family Court -- ( despite claims of being ' less adversarial ' ) at best hamper the process of resolving the discord and unfortunately more often than not , actually fans opposing views rather than fostering a consensual mutually agreed resolution . This is the nature of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are allowed to engage and employ lawyers in Family Court , we invite conflict and dissent , especially when the parties have fallen out of love and into hate . <p> The court room turns into a high-drama boxing ring with husband and wife driven by a need to win .

It is very common for costs in those marital battles to exceed $100,000 for each parent . It is also common for those cases to run for a number of years , with all sorts of stalling tactics used to ramp up the mutual hatred . <p> Coupled with the problems of the winner/loser system of the Family Court are the failings of the Federal Magistrates Court .

There is now a presumption that equal parental responsibility and shared care is one and the same thing and the subsequent expectation is that a 50/50 split is the normal starting point . Meaningful time with kids is measured by how much time you spend with them . The amendments were applauded by men 's groups who felt that previously the scales were tipped heavily in favour of women .

@@4049238 <h> FOUR CORNERS <h> Interview <h> Interview - Bob Graham <p> Read the transcript of Kerry O'Brien 's interview with retired US Senator Bob Graham - who is also the Co-Chairman of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill . First broadcast on 14 March 2011 after the BBC report " BP : $30 Billion Blowout " . <p> Reporter : Kerry O'Brien <p> Date : 14/03/2011 <p> KERRY O'BRIEN , PRESENTER : In January this year , a commission of inquiry into the Gulf disaster , established by President Barack Obama , found substantial systemic failures by BP and two other companies - Halliburton and Transocean . It also damned weak US regulation governing deepwater drilling and recommended tough new laws . <p> The Obama commission also studied Australia 's own deepwater drilling accident at the Montara West Atlas well in the Timor Sea , in August 2009 , a leak that took 74 days to plug the leak . <p> One of the companies involved in establishing that well was Halliburton , although in that case it was not found to be at fault <p> Australia had its own inquiry into what went wrong at Montara , and Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing deepwater drilling offshore here . <p> Mr Ferguson must be confident of progress because six days after the US commission presented its report he granted BP new permits for deepwater exploration in the remote Great Australian Bight , off the coast of South Australia . <p> To explore the significance of the American findings , I spoke with commission co-chairman , former Senator and Governor of Florida , Bob Graham . He was in Washington . <p> Bob Graham , your report to the President was highly critical of BP and other companies involved in Deepwater Horizon . Firstly , what views did you form of BP 's culture with regard to safety leading up to the disaster ? <p> BOB GRAHAM , CO-CHAIRMAN , NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE BP DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL SPILL AND OFFSHORE DRILLING : Kerry , we found first that this was a totally avoidable accident . It was not an act of god , it was an act of men operating badly . Number two , that there was a culture within BP and much of the rest of the offshore oil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident was the result of a series of errors made in the hours before the explosion , which were then magnified by the failure to have an effective response plan to contain the oil and to clean it up . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : Your report found that BP 's safety lapses had been chronic prior to the Gulf spill . Was there any evidence that BP had learnt from previous accidents , including its Texas City refinery explosion in 2005 , in which 15 people died ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : Yes . BP had a particular reputation of putting money ahead of safety , and that was true in the Texas oil refinery . It was also true in Alaska where they were responsible for one of the main pipelines that burst and caused a significant amount of damage as well as lawsuits , resources . So BP was a company that was under suspicion . The problem is the rest of the industry did n't go beyond just having suspicions . <p> One of our recommendations is that the oil and gas industry needs to adopt some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major disasters , such as the chemical industry in Bhopal , India and the nuclear power industry in Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in the United States . <p> Both of those responded by setting up strong internal safety programs that were industry-wide and which have had the effect of substantially increasing the safety of those two critical industries . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : You saw it first hand - the extent of the disaster in the Gulf . Did you allow yourself the luxury of anger over BP 's previous safety history ? It 's apparent failure or lack of willingness to learn from previous mistakes . <p> BOB GRAHAM : Well I hope we did n't succumb to anger . Our job was to do an impartial , objective evaluation of what happened and then make some recommendations to avoid it in the future . <p> This was the most significant man made environmental disaster in the history of the United States of America . So it was an extremely important event and I hope an event that rang the bells both within the industry and government that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to continue to operate in these inherently more risky deepwaters . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : As your report points out BP had proclaimed in its 2009 Sustainability Review , " our goal of no accidents , no harm to people and no damage to the environment is fundamental to BP 's activities " . <p> BOB GRAHAM : Kerry , the problem with that is that 's a very eloquent statement but it was n't backed up by actions . There was , on the rig itself in the hours before the explosion , there were multiple opportunities to have avoided that tragedy which took 11 lives . <p> There was also a commitment by BP and the others who were drilling in the deepwater to have a plan to respond in case there was an accident . What we found is that the plan was just a paper exercise and there was no real capability , and therefore for the first month after this explosion we staggered around trying to figure out what to do and it was n't until a tremendous amount of damage had been inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to containing this spill . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : Halliburton is another very significant player in the energy industry , including in Australia . What view did you form of the way Halliburton conducted itself with regard to the operations of Deepwater Horizon ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : Well that was one of the most interesting similarities between your accident , Montara , and ours Macondo , is that Halliburton was responsible for pouring the concrete in both instances . <p> That 's a very important step in excavation and production because that cement will provide the protection between the pipe and the very high pressures , in the case of Macondo , 17,000 pounds per square inch was the pressure that that well was subjected to . <p> And in both instances the evidence is that the cement failed thus being a primary cause of the action . What we said that this was a systemic incident - that is it was not just BP but it was industry-wide . <p> And one of the reasons that we came to that conclusion is that companies like Halliburton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horizon , both operated virtually globally supporting virtually every major oil and gas company in the world . <p> And if their behaviour at Macondo was indicative of their commitment to safety it is a concern of deep and legitimate concern . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : You say there 's inherent risk in deepwater drilling , risks for which your report says neither government nor industry has been adequately prepared . Now why was n't government adequately prepared ? Why was government regulation of this industry so poor ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : Unfortunately there has been a history of cosy relationship between the regulator and the industry , largely driven by the fact that the same regulator responsible for setting and enforcing safety also is the agency that collects almost $20 billion a year in royalties . <p> And again , whenever there was a conflict between doing it the safest way , such as delaying a particular step in the process to be sure that it can be done in an appropriate manner , or maximising royalties , maximising royalties won out . <p> Already by executive action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of royalty and we 're recommending that the regulatory agency be made independent with for instance a head of that agency serving a term of years so that he or she can not be removed for strictly political reasons . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : So you regard it as vital for the regulator to be genuinely independent of the energy industry ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : I think it 's absolutely a critical factor in terms of not only accomplishing the objective of safe operation and safe regulation but also being able to attract the quality of people that are required to do that and to rebuild public confidence this industry and government relationship is such that their safety , their environment will be appropriately protected . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : Is it fair to say that there 's still a great deal to learn about deepwater drilling , especially in remote areas ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : Yes . This is an evolving activity . It 's only been about 20 years that there was any significant drilling in the world at more than 1,000 feet . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and below . In the case of Macondo it was 18,000 feet . <p> And the reason is that 's where the geologists say most of the oil reserves are located . And I think this is going to be a movement in other areas , including Australia , Brazil is now contemplating drilling at over 30,000 feet . So the risk of operating in that very difficult , high pressure environment where you have to rely on robotics if any problem occurs that requires correction are extremely challenging and I think the industry , and the government will be on a learning curve for the foreseeable future . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : How seriously could any government or government regulator take the assurances of BP or any other serious player in the oil and gas industry in the wake of this disaster ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : To use the example that I cited earlier , the chemical and nuclear power industries , they have independent industry-wide safety programs . But those are not a substitute for effective governmental oversight . They can assist in governmental oversight but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical that elements like adequate laws , adequate funding , adequate quality of people attracted to the job who are at least as knowledgeable and well prepared as those that they are regulating , be in place before government can say that it has conducted itself in a way that meets the public 's legitimate expectations . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN : The Australian Government recently issued licences to BP for deepwater exploration in the Great Australian Bite , a remote area in the great Southern Ocean . Can we be confident that there will not be another Deepwater Horizon in Australian waters ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : Well , you can not be confident that there will not be . This is such an inherently risky area that there probably will be mistakes . The question is how many , and what the consequences of those will be . <p> I believe that with the kind of effective regulation that is in place today in the North Sea that the probabilities of accidents and the result of those accidents should they occur can be substantially diminished . <p> KERRY O'BRIEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deepwater Horizon disaster ? <p> BOB GRAHAM : One I think that this movement to deepwater is almost inevitable . If we are going to produce the oil and gas that our economies depend upon , we 're going to be moving to where those deposits are and increasingly are found in deep water . <p> Number two , you can do this safely , and again I cite the North Sea example , but it 's going to require an industry and a government committed to the highest standards of safety .

Or did they perhaps discuss current affairs -- the massacre here , the riot there , the arrest of Gandhi on charges of sedition ? In what was probably a surprising turn of events for them , a small number of ordinary Indians got to participate in a historic event -- the first ever Linguistic Survey of India , headed by the civil-servant and linguist , George A. Grierson . <p> Even by modern standards , the project was an amazing accomplishment . The Survey recorded a total of 179 languages and 544 ' dialects ' , from at least four currently recognised language families ( to put the level of diversity into perspective , consider that Spanish , German , Russian , Czech and Hindi are all one family ) . The descriptions of each of these languages and dialects were published in a series of 11 volumes over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole enterprise was the production of over 200 gramophone records with the sounds of almost 100 languages from India and Burma ( then a province of British India ) .

In the interest of having a comparable sample across all languages , Grierson asked native speakers to translate a bible passage , ' The Parable of the Prodigal Son ' , into their mother tongue . In many instances , a short folk tale , poem or song was also recorded . Regardless of the words being spoken , or the washing machine chug-chug that permeates all the recordings , there is something deeply moving about hearing these voices from almost a century ago ; from an India that now only exists in history books . <p> Why did Grierson and his colleagues go through all this trouble ?

After all , the importance of training administrators and military officers stationed in India in local languages had been recognised since the early days of the East India Company . The 1825 ' General East India Guide ' , for instance , warns future job-seekers that " all persons ignorant of the language spoken in common , namely , the Hindee ... are incompetent to any duty " . To remedy this , the Guide exhorts the Company 's junior officers to become " practical linguists " and " proficient orientalists " .

It is hoped that this material , which is accessible to native speakers and researchers alike , will lead to the production of resources that may be used in language revitalisation projects by the respective communities . <p> Yes Aung Si , it was an amazing achievement . And the race is on to document many languages that are spoken by a few and are dying .

Paul Cully puts the weekend 's Super Rugby action into a World Cup context . <h> Australia <p> Of the Wallabies ' 22 that defeated New Zealand 26-24 on October 30 last year , 13 of them came from the Brumbies and Waratahs . So how do you turn an All Blacks-conquering Wallaby into a pub player within five months ? <p> Apparently , you just send them back to their provinces . <p> Robbie Deans said before the Super Rugby season started that he favoured a hands-off approach when it came to dealing with the Super franchises . Given the performances of the past three weeks , some at the ARU must now be pondering the merits of a more interventionist approach . <p> Advertisement <p> What was most alarming about the Waratahs loss to the Cheetahs on Saturday was the ease at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A spot of inclement , but hardly atrocious weather , a stubborn but limited opponent and a few wonky throw-ins from a new hooker was all it took for the wheels to fall off . <p> These issues are not new for Wallabies fans but the seeming inability for the players to address them is a mounting concern in a year when time is of the essence . It took Deans until the end of the Tri Nations last year to really whip the Wallabies into shape - the breakthrough win in Bloemfontein took place eight Tests and four months after the first squad gathered . Knowing no such leeway exists in World Cup years , Deans would have expected them to turn up for duty this year at a similar or advanced stage to the end of season tour , hopefully following a successful Super finals campaign for at least two Australian franchises in Test-like conditions . <p> At this rate he 'll be spending the first few months attending to crises in confidence of varying degrees , bruised egos and mental scars inflicted by New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . <p> So it is hard to remember a Brumbies v Waratahs match with more significance than this Saturday 's match . Those with question marks against their names - and who has n't ? - will be playing for much more than the competition points . It is not as if there are n't alternative cases being put forward by the likes of Sam Wykes in the second row , Nick Cummins as a centre/wing and James O'Connor as a 10 . Nor has Deans been afraid to dump ' established ' players in recent history . <p> Happily for the Wallabies , there were signs in the Reds ' win over the Rebels that one of their key men , Quade Cooper , is playing himself back into form . Let 's not get too excited - the woeful Rebels made Mike Harris , a solid operator at ITM Cup level , look like a cross bewteen Dan Carter and Frank Bunce . But there was enough of Cooper 's trademark running to the defensive line to admire . <p> RugbyHeaven does n't buy the line that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shows plenty of bravery in attack . <p> Every time his partner Will Genia is bending over the ball at the ruck , Cooper is already moving forward towards the defence , at pace , in the knowledge that every loose forward in the competition would like to hit him so hard that his tattoos come off . It would be a lot easier - and safer - for Cooper to sit deeper , in the pocket , but he constantly stresses defences until he finds the chink , whether through his own speed or his peerless long passing . <p> We also think that the Reds ' decision to hide him from a five-eighth 's defensive duties does nothing for the Wallabies . <p> Queenslanders will howl , but let 's be honest , the Reds will not win the Super title , but the Wallabies have a real shout of winning the Cup if their No.10 has at least been given the opportunity of honing his defensive technique in the preceding months . Did not Deans issue him with an ultimatum after England last year and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries : The sight of Benn Robinson going to the sideline with a rib injury was very worrying . He will be out for three weeks with a fractured rib . The Wallabies need this guy at his best . <p> The wildcard : Nick Cummins . Last week he compared himself to a honey badger , he apparently perms his mullet and he smashes into contact . That 's good enough for us . <h> New Zealand <p> Two of the past three World-Cup winning sides had No.8s who were giants of that position . In 1999 it was Toutai Kefu for Australia , in 2003 it was England 's Lawrence Dallalglio . Is New Zealand 's Kieran Read going to be the 2011 version ? <p> His display and captaincy for the Crusaders on Saturday , on the back of an outstanding 2010 , suggests he is on the right path . <p> Written off somewhat dismissively earlier in his career as " another Rueben Thorne " , Read has made giant strides since the All Blacks coaches installed him in the No.8 jersey , even though to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> His showing against the Highlanders was further confirmation that the All Blacks have something that they have lacked in the past two campaigns - an explosive big man at the back of the scrum who goes over the gain line . <p> After a relatively quiet start to the year , Read was outstanding . Time and time against the tough Highlanders he made important metres and then when the opportunity came in the loose he displayed his athleticism with a 50m dash to the try line with Jimmy Cowan trailing in his wake . And it 's not just his work rate and lack of errors in his game that impresses . When young second-rower Sam Whitelock was sent to the sin bin in the first half , it was Read whom the Crusaders gathered around for the pep talk . <p> Little wonder the 25-year-old is featuring prominently in " next All Blacks captain " discussions . After an early setback to the Blues and the horrors of the Christchurch earthquake , the Crusaders have barely missed a beat without the injured Richie McCaw . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling that the All Blacks ' World Cup fortunes are inextricably linked to the Crusaders . One-eyed Cantabrians will be lobbying for the inclusion of up to 11 Crusaders in New Zealand 's starting XV and while that might be optimistic , there is no doubt the core of the All Blacks is being forged in Christchurch . <p> McCaw , Read , Whitelock , Brad Thorn and Owen Franks are well clear of their competitors in the pack , while Sonny Bill Williams , Israel Dagg , Robbie Fruean and a rejuvenated Andy Ellis are staking their claims to be included alongside Dan Carter in the backs . <p> The benefits of familiarity were starkly clear on Saturday as the scrum destroyed a depleted Highlanders unit and Williams yet again displayed his amazing knack of keeping the ball alive after contact . On three second-half occasions he found runners on his shoulders with a variety of offloads and the big No.12 even won a turnover with some previously unseen technique at the breakdown . <p> Given Read 's performance , it was timely that further north on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display his potential had long hinted at . Vito was everywhere in a game where the 41-17 scoreline unfairly maligned the Hurricanes , showing venom on defence and attack to complement his strong lineout work . <p> While the drums are beating for Adam Thomson , Vito has the attraction of being a genuine option at No.8 as well at No.6 , and he has thrown his name into the loose-forward mix . <p> For the Chiefs , Sitiveni Sivivatu continued his steady improvement against the Sharks , throwing himself into the line and repeatedly showing that ability for turning up at second receiver to ask questions of the defence . Richard Kahui must also have been delighted with a strong return from shoulder woes , particularly his considerable shot on Louis Ludik that sent the Sharks No.15 sprawling across the turf . <p> The injuries : Stephen Donald is gone for a month with a back fracture . By the time he returns will Colin Slade have mounted a compelling case to be Carter 's deputy ? <p> The wildcard : Jared Payne . Conrad Smith is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to benefit the pace outside him . Growing with every game . <h> South Africa <p> Something astonishing happened in the Bulls v Stormers game at the weekend . After years of terrorising opposition lineouts in their Pretoria citadel , sending various hooker-second row combinations into meltdown , Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha did n't trust themselves . <p> First , Matfield called a risky throw to the tail in difficult , slippery conditions . Not straight . Then they went to prop Gurthro Steenkamp from a short throw-in . Third , they went to Botha at the front and the ball was turned over . It was n't until their fourth lineout - to blindside Dewald Potgeiter - that the Bulls got it right . <p> The reason was pretty hard to miss - the giant , 208-centimetre figure of Andries Bekker . It felt as close to a passing of the Springboks baton as you are ever likely to get . But the question is : do the Springboks dare pick a World Cup side that breaks up their talismanic locking duo ? And is the Bulls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springboks ? <p> It was n't just in the set-piece that Matfield and Botha were outpointed . All over the park , Bekker and his young second-row cohort Rynhardt Elstadt were displaying the sort of athleticism so vital to the modern game , while Matfield and Botha tried in vain to stem the tide of the Stormers ' physicality . <p> Again , Bulls No.8 Pierre Spies was virtually anonymous from the action , a worrying sign for South African selectors with Ryan Kankowski equally subdued in the Sharks ' arm wrestle against the Chiefs . Fourie du Preez cut a frustrated figure at No.9 , and Morne Steyn 's most obvious weapon - the up and under - has largely been negated by the long overdue and welcome decision by the officials to correctly police the chasers . <p> But while the Bulls might be giving Springboks fans plenty of reasons to fret , the Stormers are doing the opposite . Their lack of tries has been well documented , but it 's hard to feel anything but admiration for the toughness of their approach . Francois Louw is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullocking presence at No.8 . The five-pointers will come , especially with the exceptional Jaque Fourie back at No.13 to restore his midfield partnership with Jean de Villiers . <p> Bryan Habana , too , took a huge step in the right direction with a workaholic display on the wing that was rewarded with a classic poacher 's try to seal the game . While this amount of pace and hunger remain intact , Habana will continue to be a matchwinner at Test level . <p> The most significant individual South African performance of the weekend however , happened before the Stormers confirmed the Bulls ' fading powers . At the Sydney Football Stadium on Saturday night , Heinrich Brussow sent a message to the world that he is back . <p> Remarkably , after just a touch over half of football the week before , Brussow gave the Waratahs a lesson at the breakdown , winning several turnovers and penalties and stopping what little momentum the Tahs generated stone dead . Brussow has that sense of timing that marks all great opensides , the ability to hover at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field after 69 minutes , the Cheetahs ' bench practically formed a queue to pat his back . <p> If there were any doubts that he could transform the Boks this year , Saturday night answered some of them . <p> The injuries : A rare clean bill of health , apart from a minor hand injury to Sharks No.10 Pat Lambie . <p> The wildcard : Dewaldt Duvenage . Where is this smart , uncapped little No.9 in the national pecking order ? On the evidence of his fine game against du Preez , not high enough . <h> 38 comments so far <p> The Tahs problem is the coach . I sat through the disaster of Saturday and the halfback took 8 seconds to pass most balls from rucks or mauls . The crusaders &amp; sharks took on average 3 seconds .

@@4079238 <h> Small , light , and under $600 : Dell 's Inspiron M102z laptop arrives <h> If you 're shopping for a budget laptop that 's small and light , then Dell 's new Inspiron M102z is another machine to put on your shortlist . Here 's what you need to know . <p> " More fun on the run " is the marketing tagline Dell 's using for its new Inspiron M102z budget laptop , the brand 's new budget portable with AMD 's Fusion CPU technology . <p> The new machine combines better-than-netbook graphics performance at 1.56Kg - far easier on the back or arms than lugging around a 15in or even 13in full-size laptop . <p> The number of budget laptops with AMD 's Fusion CPU technology is small but growing , with HP and Toshiba among the first of the major brands bringing Fusion laptops to market . <p> If you 're looking for a cheap laptop , there 's a few things to keep in mind about the Inspiron M102z . First off , at $599 it 's several hundred dollars more expensive than a netbook . Here 's what the lineup looks like : <p> Much of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is designed to improve on the netbook experience with smooth HD video playback . The Inspiron M102z includes an HDMI port . <p> But that 's only part of the attraction of this machine , at least on paper ( we 'll reserve our final verdict for when we 've completed a review ) . In terms of screen size , the M102z gives you 11.6in , more than the Inspiron Mini 10 . It 's also a tad lighter than Dell 's 13in Inspirons , and much cheaper than the Inspiron 13z , which starts at $999 . <p> You 'll also want to consider this HP DM1 Fusion laptop which HP showed us recently . While the weight is similar and screen size the same , with the DM1 you get the better of the two Fusion chips , the AMD E350 , for $599 . At the same price , Dell buyers will have to settle for the AMDC50 ; you 'll need to step up to the $699 spec for the E350 chip . <p> Join our site to get stuck in with comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stay up to date with the latest news and reviews through our range of newsletters . <p> Email* <p> * Email address required <p> * Invalid Email address <p> I have read and accept the privacy policy and terms and conditions and by submitting my email address I agree to receive the PC &amp; Tech Authority daily newsletter and receive special offers on behalf of PC &amp; Tech Authority , nextmedia and its valued partners .

@@4099240 <h> Fall of the giants : sun setting on magazines <p> I 'm going to try and write this post without sounding like a nana . Or one of those people who say ' back in my day ' and then proceed to reference something totally irrelevant . <p> Because while I was watching the magnificent Paper Giants on ABC1 I got thinking about how magazines have changed . How they 're just not relevant anymore . Not compared to the power and influence they once wielded . <p> No matter how much of a mag junkie you may be ( your numbers may be dwindling but I know there are still some of you left ) , you can not watch a show about the birth of Cleo magazine and its early years and not make a comparison to mags in 2011 . <p> And not in a good way for 2011 . <p> There was a surprising amount of excitement a few months ago when it was announced a reality show called Park Street was being made about ACP - the magazine company ( located at 54 Park St ) that publishes Cleo , Cosmo , Dolly and pretty much every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place I began my magazine career - and ended it almost 15 years later . <p> After the surprise success of The September Issue , the brilliant documentary about Anna Wintour and American Vogue from 2009 , and the pop cultural impact of the book and movie The Devil Wears Prada a few years earlier , a local look at Australian magazines was bound to be thrilling . <p> There was much anticipation about the reality series , which promised a behind-the-scenes look at what really goes on at some of Australia 's most iconic magazines . Almost immediately , rival publisher Pacific Publications announced they too were going to film a reality show about Marie Claire and its editor Jackie Frank . <p> Park Street premiered last month and the response was not terrific . I 'm not going to bag the show or the people in it . I know them , I like them , they work hard . The market has never been tougher . I watched a couple of episodes of Park Street and it was harmless enough but , like many , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main storylines in the first episode were Jessica Mauboy being late to a Cosmo photo shoot and the threat of rain before a party to celebrate Cleo 's swimsuit issue ( Jessica eventually turned up and it did n't rain - phew and phew ) ? <p> Granted , this was a ' reality show ' . Not scripted but heavily censored . Fragranced even . After all , it was funded by ACP and many of the most interesting characters left in that building refused to be involved . Wisely . It 's a risky game to leave your reputation and potentially your career to the producers of a reality show whose own livelihoods depend on making interesting television . <p> But even if it had been a more transparent account , not that much excitement goes on in magazines anymore . There are a lot of budget meetings with the finance department . A lot of talk of ROI ( return on investment ) . A lot of celebrities saying ' no ' or asking for giant cheques . A lot of trying to get everyone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has n't been done before , something that will start a conversation and boost sales . <p> To me , what underscored the whole issue of relevance was when Cleo 's down-to-earth editor Gemma Crisp explained the editorial process that a story undergoes from conception to publication . <p> It takes a minimum of three months . MONTHS . <p> When was the last time you waited three months for something ? Life does n't happen in increments of months anymore . It happens in moments , in text messages , in Tweets . It 's fast and it 's relentless and if it takes you three months ( or even three weeks ) to get from thought to print then that 's just too long to retain the attention of your audience . <p> That 's the biggest problem magazines have in 2011 . How to stay relevant within the constraints of a dinosaur-like production process when your readers are living in a 24/7 news cycle . <p> When was the last time you can remember a magazine doing something truly daring that people spoke about ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines used to be . It was a time before the internet , when women 's liberation ( the term sounds twee now but liberation is exactly what it was back in the early 70s ) and the idea that women may enjoy sex and want a life other than being someone 's wife , mother or spinster aunty was revolutionary . <p> Imagine that . <p> Imagine there being nowhere else you could read about sex or contraception or sexual health or relationships or masturbation or even feminism . <p> Cleo - and then Cosmo a few months later - were all those things and they truly did move the social agenda forwards . <p> By the time I arrived at Cleo in 1993 , the iconic Ita Buttrose was long gone and Cleo and Cosmo were being edited by Lisa Wilkinson and Pat Ingram respectively . <p> They were still exciting times . The magazines were not nearly as political as they once had been - thankfully , many battles had already been fought and won . Battles like the right to determine your own fertility , access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tackled a more diverse agenda than perhaps they do now , with greater emphasis on the features and the quality of the writing . <p> Back then , Cleo and Cosmo still very much led the sexual agenda . Again , remember this was a time before the internet . When sealed sections still meant something . Unless you wanted to go into an X-rated shop ( something most women would never do ) , Cleo and Cosmo remained the only way women could learn about all the different permutations of sex . <p> Who else were you going to ask ? Your mum ? Your doctor ? <p> They were incredibly fun years to be working on Cleo . Lisa came up with countless genius ideas including a " scratch off Arnie 's undies " issue where she found a technology to use the material for scratchies and combine it with a nude shot our art director had found of Arnold Schwarzenegger . <p> The result was hilarious - especially when the printer did n't test it properly and it was only after all the issues were printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' undies ' , you scratched a hole right through the page . <p> Cosmo published an excerpt from Madonna 's Sex book , which has stood the test of time as being pretty out there . <p> Lisa and Pat were always trying to outdo and out-sell each other by seeing who could tread that finest of lines , being outrageous enough to spark reader interest without completely pissing off the advertisers for being too explicit . <p> We did n't always get it right . One time , when Lisa was on maternity leave , we published a " Match The Penis To The Guy " sealed section , which enraged clients and lost Cleo all of Estee Lauder 's advertising . More than a decade later , I do n't think they ever got it back . <p> A few years later , when I edited Cosmo , we did a sealed section about sex toys , which was n't particularly unusual - on Paper Giants they did something similar back in the ' 70s . <p> But we also ran a TV ad , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he slides along the floorboards in his socks and pretends to sing . <p> I ca n't remember the exact details but our ad featured some rather large dildos . It was done in a jokey way and was quite funny but Kerry Packer did n't see it that way . <p> My Editor-In-Chief and publisher were hauled into Kerry 's office and given exactly the kind of shouty , sweary treatment Ita was depicted getting from Kerry in Paper Giants . The ad was pulled immediately . <p> Of everyone who has worked at ACP and encountered Kerry , his depiction in Paper Giants has been universally rated as brilliant . He was a dynamic , exciting , outrageous , complex man . He was capable of being awful to his employees and also being incredibly kind , generous and sensitive . He was one of a kind and the magazine business has not been the same since his death . <p> Back to Paper Giants and Park Street for a moment . <p> You ca n't compare a drama to a reality show . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and now and it 's impossible not to draw the conclusion that they have lost their relevance and their influence . <p> The internet has not only sucked up their readers , it has also gobbled up their purpose : to be a way women form tribes and communicate . Now there 's youporn and any other number of sites for titillation , Google for questions about sex , and any number of websites or free newspaper magazines if you 're looking for other types of content or a magazine-style experience . Women do n't want to be spoken to anymore . They want to be part of the conversation , something which the internet allows , in fact depends on . <p> It 's the main reason I left magazines , my first true media love for online five years ago . I could see the future - my future as a reader and a content provider - and magazines just were n't keeping pace . <p> Some may say it 's disingenuous of me to write about the demise of magazines given I now publish Mamamia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time in magazines . I was taught by -and taught - some of the most incredible women I have ever met . Most of my closest friends are from that time and I look back on it with awe and gratitude and pride . <p> But that time is over . <p> Paper Giants was a timely reminder of how magazines used to push boundaries . Now , they seem to exist on a strangely distant planet where all the people look like plastic and the sole pursuit is ' perfection ' . Except that perfection does n't really exist . It 's contrived . <p> I will always be proud of the time I spent working in magazines . It 's a mistake to underestimate the good they have done for several generations of women in educating , comforting , supporting and nurturing them . As for their future , however , that remains unclear . <p> I do n't pretend to know how magazines can re-invent themselves to keep pace with the needs , wants and sensibilities of modern readers . Perhaps we 're seeing the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs are fast becoming niche items of nostalgia . <p> UPDATE : I should have mentioned that a major factor magazines find it tough to push boundaries is due to the influence of supermarkets . The two main chains account for around half of all magazine sales and thus wield huge influence on the covers and coverlines . <p> One of the watershed moments in my career editing Cosmo was when the supermarkets chose to pull an issue of Cosmo off the stand for a cover line about oral sex that it felt was too explicit ( it was ' Oral Sex Lessons ' and the story inside was sealed ) . <p> The media got hold of the story and I was forced to do interviews justifying the coverline while being careful not to accuse the supermarkets of censorship or heavy-handedness due to the influence they wielded ) . As a mother myself , I can certainly understand their wishes not to have explicit sex stories touted at the checkout where bored little eyes can read them and ask loud questions . <p> But the end result is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s and ' 90s . What we got away with then you never could now . So ironically , as the internet has taken the sting out of the raunch-factor for mags like Cosmo and Cleo , so have the retailers . Society is more conservative now than it was when I first joined Cleo in the early ' 90s . <p> Cover mounts - the freebie gifts of everything from bags to scarves , thongs to lipstick - have also eroded the value of magazines in the minds of consumers . I hated these when I was an editor and fought against them at every turn . They are a blatant way to increase circulation ( you can always tell which mag needs a boost by whomever has freebies on their covers ) but I always felt they devalued the magazine itself . Surely if a product is good , that should be enough reason to buy it without a nasty made-in-China pink umbrella ? <p> AND ANOTHER THING : When the internet began gaining popularity in the late ' 90s , there were many murmurs in the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines . It was n't . Not then . Because reading a magazine was very much a portable experience - you took it on the bus or the train , to the beach or into the bath . <p> You could n't do that with a computer . <p> But you can do it with a phone . And now that we 're all carrying around smart phones , that same reading , sharing , communicating , entertaining experience that mags used to give us is available anywhere at any time . And it 's updating in real time ( much like this post ! ) . So how do magazines compete with that ?

@@4121233 <h> Related coverage <p> Talk about a PR disaster . It 's hard to come off looking like the bad guy when you 've just lost one of the best young players in the NRL . Yet somehow South Sydney managed to do this and a whole lot more . <p> The Bunnies ' reaction to Chris Sandow 's four-year-deal with Parramatta was nothing short of bizarre . <p> They released a statement in which South Sydney CEO Shane Richardson declared that Sandow had " met his Alan Bond . " <p> It was a reference to the late Kerry Packer 's deal in which he sold Channel 9 to Bond for $1 billion and then bought it back at a much lower price . <p> Sandow has scored the deal of a lifetime . The Eels would n't confirm what their new recruit would be paid , but they certainly had plenty to spend . Do the Rabbitohs also feel they 'll be able to buy him back at a reduced price in the future ? <p> Since when do club owners reveal a player 's future salary in cyberspace ? Crowe does have form in this area though . He famously went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bags of money they chucked at Greg Inglis . <p> That little statement almost ruined the deal , as the NRL investigated whether all aspects of Inglis ' contract complied with the salary cap . <p> Sympathy for Souths should 've been everywhere you turned . Instead , it was non-existent . <p> Eels CEO Paul Osborne hinted that Sandow had felt unloved and that made it easier for Osborne to swoop . That was backed up by South Sydney winger Nathan Merritt revealing the Bunnies should 've tried to secure the services of their star half-back sooner . <p> A few Brisbane Broncos fans also contacted me yesterday to say they felt karma had come back to bite the Bunnies , after they were seen to have stolen Inglis away from Brisbane . <p> It 's hard to understand why South Sydney felt so bitter . This is a part of modern day rugby league . <p> In the past , they 've offered the likes of Dave Taylor and Roy Asotasi big money to move to Redfern . <p> Did the Eels do anything different ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the media , like South Sydney did when Craig Wing was still contracted to the Roosters in 2007 . <p> Sandow has come out as the overwhelming winner . If the Eels are paying him $550k a season , as the Gladiator says , then that is ridiculous . <p> The little number 7 is good , but is he really worth more than half a million dollars a season ? <h> The Crowd Says ( 53 ) Page 1 of Comments <p> Only a blind man could not see that Sandow is coming of age . Souths should have locked him into a long term deal . But yeah , you have to chukkle at Souths and the way they have handled this , talking about loyalty , juniors and everything in between . <p> Plain and simple , Souths got what they did to Brisbane , a good old gut wrenching spanking . Nice to see this come back to bite them , might teach them a lesson , somehow i dought it , Richo is a pillack , always wondered why they brought him back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long list of other incompitents running the game . <p> Regardless of what anyone believes of Sandow 's talent , I thought Shane Richardson 's comment was disgraceful . I normally think he 's very astute , measured and classy . He was none of those things with that comment . It was very , very poor and he should be ashamed and embarrassed . <p> Market value is what someone is willing to pay you . Simple . If Parramatta thought Sandow was worth that much , then that is how much he is worth . <p> Considering the close assocation Souths seem to have with Anthony Mundine , I 'd have thought they would be very understanding when someone decides to take Mundine 's advice to heart and " be his own man and look after himself . " <p> But apparently not . They do n't seem to take bad news very well . <p> I do n't think this will be the end of it either . I think the powers that be at Souths will put enormous pressure on Sandow for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just make his life fairly miserable . <p> You point out some terrific examples Luke -- especially with Craig Wing . The Souths football team strikes me as a team with a culture where they only perform when things are going their way and when it 's not , give up too easily and point the finger elsewhere . John Lang does n't strike me as this type of person but I think yesterday gave us a glimpse as to where this culture is being cultivated . <p> The Bunnies should all have a big cry and get our hanky out and wipe our noses . Poor old bunnies they ca n't take a trick Richo caught out sulking because he lost his playmaker and Crowie twittering about how much money Sandow is getting . Sounds like a good " soapy " . Maybe we will get the next remake of Ben Hur to be staged at Redfern Oval then we can all see some blood and guts and the real South Sydney Team might stand up and play some football . Get a life you Bunnie Boys suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it happens all the time , nothing new about this . What a beat up ! ! ! ! The South Sydney sides of old would not be whining and wailing they would just get on with it and show what their made of on the field , not playing it out in the press . I must say though it was really dumb of them to loose Sandow he is a great little player I hope he goes on to bigger and better things in the future at Parramatta , although a good half back is not all that the Eels need .

@@4133232 <h> The best Gaming PC you can build today -- updated <p> APC 's Live Builds Gaming editor Chris ( Igniserator ) Lampard is a gamer who decided at 15 to start building his own PCs to get the best gaming performance possible on his budget . He might work in IT now but says he 's still a gamer at heart with a passion for knowledge about PCs . Below is his first Gaming PC build for APC where the challenge of course is to build a system that will smash a game like Crysis but on a budget within the reach of ordinary people . All prices are in Australian dollars . <h> CORE SYSTEM updated : September 8 2011 <h> CPU : Intel Core i7 2600K -- $325 <p> I 've gone with the newest generation Intel Core i7 a processor that 's able to achieve a clock speed of 5GHz on air cooling . With such high core speeds it means it will easily handle the latest games .

You could also run a 4-fan push-pull configuration for maximum efficiency . This system basically doubles the cooling compared to what most people use so expect super low temps and noise since it wo n't have to blow to hard to cool things down . Also incorporated is a fan speed control on the pump whose level is indicated by white LEDs surrounding it . Note that a case with 2 x 120MM adjacent fans is needed . <h> MOTHERBOARD : Gigabyte G1.Sniper2 -- $429 <p> The newest board from the gamer 's division at GIBABYTE the G1.Sniper2 really hits the sweet spot with features like a Bigfoot Killer NIC for great latency times ; Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi on-board audio and high quality Nichicon MUSE capacitors . The aesthetics on this board are the best yet with the incorporated firearm shaped heatsinks and the incredible -looking LEDs . The board includes support for 2200MHz memory and SLI/Crossfire although if you are using Crossfire or SLI the PCI-E speed is limited to x8 . There 's also SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming with a side of overclocking . <h> GRAPHICS : VTX3D AMD Radeon HD 6990 4GB -- $799 <p> Choosing between this and the GTX590 was hard but however the $200 saved here allows for better hard drives for the system . Also I see no reason in paying the extra $50-$100 for better known brands unless their cards have a different cooler or are overclocked -- but if they are the stock AMD board why pay more ? They all have a two year warranty anyway . This card will easily power a 5760 ? 1080 resolution at max settings on just about any game while achieving 60+ FPS . I do plan on overclocking the card to see what extra I can get also . This item has had a price bump from limited stocks and availability so it is probably out of reach for most people till new stock arrives if you got one consider yourself lucky specially for $799 . <h> RAM : 2 x 4GB G.Skill Ripjaws X F3 -- 17000CL9 2133MHz -- $129 <p> The new speed in memory is 2133MHz and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expect to get 2200MHz + out of these modules easily . I went with only two sticks as two always overclock better than four sticks . But if overall speed is n't a necessity then another pair would be fine to add in . However I find 8GB a sustainable amount of memory for most users . <h> HARD DRIVE 1 : 4 x OCZ Vertex 3 60Gb RAID 0 -- $556 ( $139 each ) <p> These solid state drives are the ones to beat in the SSD world at the moment . The last generation SSDs were capable of 280/270MB/s but the new drives are capable of 550-500MB/s in other words double the speed of last generation . This equates to sub-10 second Windows load times and also sub-5 second game load times . That 's blazingly fast performance with no bottleneck . Expected data speeds of 1Gb/s+ ! ! ! once a RAID array is set up . <h> HARD DRIVE 2 : Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB -- $88 <p> The storage drive can be the one from your current build or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra storage speed boost . 1TB is a good place to start and the Caviar Black model keeps the transfer rates up . The reason for using only a single drive is that its fully reliable assuming SMART is enabled and running fine so all backs ups and steam games music video 's etc. should be stored on this drive for safe keeping . <h> OPTICAL DRIVE : Pioneer DVR-219L DVDRW -- $29 <p> Prices are down again on drives and this Pioneer is one of the best and also going quite cheap . I suggest you pick one of these up if you 're using a drive that 's two years or older just for the transfer speed boost that newer generation drives provide . I hate waiting for installs . <h> PSU : Silverstone Strider 1200W Gold -- $275 <p> I was taken by this PSU 's fully modular design and the gold efficiency rating . It 's also very well priced . The reason I have gone with such a large power supply is to future-proof the build as the next addition to it will probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and not as flashy as some out there also has the hammer finish . <h> CASE : Antec Twelve Hundred V3 -- $205 <p> I ended up going with the Antec as I needed a 2 x 120MM fans at the rear to support the new Corsair H100 cooler . This case also has 13 drive bays and accepts motherboards from Mini-ATX to ATX . It has a max video card length of 444MM which is massive ! There 's a front USB 3 port with the other usual suspects and also a CPU cut-out a bottom mount power supply and a top 200MM exhaust fan . This case is roomy and well ventilated ; in all a great case . 
@@4133233 <h> The Art Of Disguising Mobile Phone Towers <p> What would you rather have : crappy mobile phone service , or mobile towers scarring every visible surface ? The two are at odds , but , thankfully , there are companies whose entire business is making those radio-wave spreaders disappear . And they 're great at it . <p> We do n't want to see the angular metal giants that serve us bandwidth . The feeling is echoed by city ordinances across the country , similarly motivated to hide the mobile-service food chain . <p> Thank Southern California for keeping up appearances . In the mid ' 90s , places like LA started requesting cell towers that were n't quite as unsightly . To blend in with the natural ( and sometimes unnatural ) surroundings , mobile carriers built their towers there to look like trees -- mostly high-stretching palms that kinda sorta concealed their purpose . " In the beginning , what they called trees were just horrendous , " says Chameleon Engineering 's general manager Rienk Ayers . The blending-in technologies were just getting started , but they ended up pleasing the neighbours , which was the important thing . Keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile providers needed to get in quickly . They were happy shelling out a lot of money to get up good-looking towers ( where required ) as fast as possible . <p> After that , it became a thing . Slowly city ordinances started requiring that mobile carriers make their towers discrete , and carriers , needing the go ahead , started paying other companies to work on a disguise . Today , about half of concealed cell towers are dressed as trees , according to Ayers , because their form is the most inherently well designed for the job . Think about it : They satisfy the height requirement , multiple antenna arrays can be tucked under leaves , and a trunk is a great wire-concealing case . <p> All models need to withstand wind and earthquakes , so the main structure is typically steel-based , coated with some kind of artificial bark , which ranges from brown paint to stuff cast from a trunk mould . The high end , says Ayers , " is pretty phenomenal , though most people do n't get close enough to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really all about the leaves . Companies like Chameleon Engineering inject plastic into a frond mould over a fibreglass spine , and then the foliage is painted and treated to look like the real thing . Up to 12 antennas can be set between the green fans , and the impressive attention to detail acts as an invisibility cloak . <p> Not all towers need to tower , though , and geography tends to dictate taste . " In Saint Louis , they like flag poles , " says Steve Caldwell , VP of engineering at TowerCo . The poles do n't reach as high as trees and they hold fewer antennas , but they blend in better with the neighbourhood . Companies that do this kind of thing also whip up cell service in the form of water towers , rocks , steeples , cactuses , crosses and lampposts , too .

@@4133234 <h> Goss says ' get real ' <p> With the Gillard Government set to release the nation 's first population strategy we speak to former Labor Premier Wayne Goss who says it 's time governments squared with the Australian people . <h> Transcript <p> LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : In the Government 's population strategy released tomorrow , you wo n't find talk of population targets or the rate of expected growth - that 's too controversial . Instead it 'll be heavy on buzz phrases like " liveable communities " and " sustainability " . <p> One person who says it 's time for governments to get more honest with the Australian public over this issue is the former Queensland Labor premier Wayne Goss . As a one-time senior politician he knows it 's hard for governments to convince voters Australia needs more people , but also he has a strong grasp on the nation 's economic needs , in his current roles as the chairman of the consulting firm Deloitte and the engineering business Ausenco . <p> Mr Goss has rarely waded into public debate since he retired from the Queensland Parliament in 1998 , but he spoke to 7:30 earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of a so-called big Australia ? <p> WAYNE GOSS , FORMER QLD PREMIER : I think that if Australians are going to maintain , much less improve , their standard of living , we have to significantly increase the population , and in particular the skill level of the population . <p> LEIGH SALES : And why do you say that ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : Well , two reasons . We 're about to go into a resources boom with a shortage of skilled labour . Now if we 're going to get the benefit of that resources boom for the country , we need a greater supply of labour . The second reason is Australia is about to go through a very big demographic change . As the baby boomers retire , that 'll reduce the numbers in the workforce , it 'll reduce growth , and we 've got ta address that if we 're going to maintain , not just the economic , but also the social standard of living that we have . <p> LEIGH SALES : How prevalent a view is that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a widely-held view in the business community . I mean , it affects some sectors more than others - resources , construction obviously . But the price for labour in those sectors drives up prices generally , which will drive up inflation , and ultimately that hits everybody with increases in interest rates . <p> LEIGH SALES : Not everybody shares this view . The former NSW premier Bob Carr says that population growth is wrecking the planet . <p> WAYNE GOSS : Look , I think the environment is under strain , but I think we can cope and we should cope and the responsibility is there for the federal and state governments , and also local government , to adjust . It means they 've got to build the infrastructure , it means we 've got to have better planning when it comes to our populations , we 've got ta have greater density in our cities , particularly around transport hubs . But , I mean , you just ca n't turn your back on the world and say , " Look , we wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you look , say , here in south-east Queensland and the sort of growth that 's occurred ... <p> WAYNE GOSS : Sure . <p> LEIGH SALES : ... even since you finished up as Premier , people here already are frustrated with congestion , with a lack of affordable housing . It 's understandable , is n't it , that they would think , " Well , we do n't want more people . " <p> WAYNE GOSS : Sure . I mean , people wan na close the door behind them . But that 's not just south-east Queensland ; it 's Sydney , Melbourne and a range of other places as well . The challenge for our society and the challenge for governments , in particular state governments , is you 've got to build the infrastructure - economic and social - you 've got to have better planning . <p> And I think another problem here is that when it was raining gold bars , a lotta state governments , and the Federal Government for that matter , lifted recurrent expenditure . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut . Well , that 's hard , but it does n't relieve them of the responsibility to build the infrastructure to cater for the population . <p> LEIGH SALES : Well , the population might say , " Well they have n't done a brilliant job of building infrastructure so far , so why should we trust that they 're going to do that when we up the population by ... ? " <p> WAYNE GOSS : Yeah , and that 's a legitimate gripe . It 's a legitimate gripe . But the point is that we are going to have a population of 35 million at least come 2050 . That means we 've got to get on with the job - infrastructure , planning , skills . <p> LEIGH SALES : You say politics are tricky . We 've talked through some of the concerns that the public . You 're a former politician . How should the Federal Government sell a big Australia message ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : Well , maybe they use a different adjective . I do n't know what that adjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , I think we - I think we 've got to have a bit more honesty in the debate . I know that sounds a bit naive these days , but - both from the Government and the Opposition . But I think also business leaders and community leaders understand those twin issues of the shortage of skilled labour and the demographic change . There has n't been enough debate about the baby boomers retiring . And I think Australians have got ta understand that and understand that they are facing a reduction in their standard of living unless we address what I think is a serious public policy issue . <p> LEIGH SALES : Is it possible to have a useful population strategy without acknowledging the reality of those figures that you 've outlined - the $35 million or so - by 2050 ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : No . Look , I mean , I think people have got ta be told the facts . I mean , it 's not as if we can have a population of somewhere between 25 and 50 . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by 2050 . Let 's get on with the job of , as I said before , making sure we lift the skill level , making sure that we understand and cope with the baby boomer retirement . Because - I mean , the problem there will be some baby boomers who do not have funds to support themselves are gon na suffer in terms of their standard of living , and/or the fewer numbers of people in the workforce are gon na bear a greater tax burden to support them . <p> LEIGH SALES : Governments talk all the time about getting people out of urban areas and into regional areas . How difficult is that to actually do ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : Very difficult , and it 's been a problem for a long time in Australia , as people leave regional areas to come to the city , whether it 's for education or employment or whatever . That 's why in the resources sector you have a lot of fly-in , fly-out in terms of the workforce . But there are towns like Mackay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who are flying in and flying out , but a much shorter distance , but also supporting other industries . So there are halfway houses . <p> As well as that , I think the recent announcement by the Federal Government that they 'll allow large numbers of skilled labour to come in from overseas for major resource projects is a real plus . <p> LEIGH SALES : Can I ask you : Lindsay Tanner , the former Finance minister brought a book out recently , and he talked about the dumbing down of democracy and what he sees as a toxic relationship between the media and politics . Do you think the quality of public debate 's gotten worse since you 've been out of politics ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : Oh , yeah . I mean , I think the last 10 or 20 years , right round the world , but certainly in Australia , the level of public debate has reduced , and I think the public lose out of that . And I think you ca n't blame politicians or the media ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disappointing . <p> LEIGH SALES : And why do you think it 's happened ? <p> WAYNE GOSS : Well I think increasingly the media , particularly commercial media , is about entertainment , and that 's about selling cornflakes , and that means that , you know , if it bleeds , it leads . Understandable in terms of ratings , disappointing in terms of the quality of the public debate and the quality of the public - sorry , the capacity of the public to understand what the issues are .

But with Android having rapidly emerged as a viable alternative over the past year it reflects the growing realisation among many developers that iOS is no longer the be-all and end-all of mobile operating systems . <p> Figures from analyst firms paint a very different picture this year than last with massive growth across the board .

Yet as Android gains legitimacy ; Research In Motion works to re-energise its BlackBerry strategy with a tablet-focused derivative ; and the implications of the recent Microsoft-Nokia alliance become clear ; developers are increasingly weighing up the best strategies for taking their prized apps to more than one platform . <p> Indeed it 's increasingly common for major smartphone apps to come in iOS and Android versions with BlackBerry versions also relatively common for some games and apps that target that platform 's stereotypically business-focused audience . ? ? ? Most of our clients really want to deploy on two platforms now whereas twelve months ago it was just iPhone or just Android ? ? ? says Daniel Bradby director of Melbourne-based development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app to its portfolio . <h> Faster harder <p> Needing to build and maintain two or more versions of a smartphone app raises the difficulty level of many development projects significantly particularly for small developers . ? ? ? iOS and Android are very different platforms " says Bradby . " Someone who 's skilled in Java say doing Android is not necessarily and unlikely to understand the Objective C and XCode development environment for iOS . Having a team of developers that can maintain both of those code bases is difficult ; there 's no way we can do native development on more than two platforms. ? ? ? <p> The net result is that many projects effectively need to be written twice to support both platforms ? ? ? although lessons learnt from the first instance can typically be applied to the second project which can be completed in 70% of the time of the first . <p> This may save money for clients but it also means developers need to expand their skill sets and their project scopes to keep up with the demands of a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to simultaneously manage iOS Android or BlackBerry versions of their apps ? ? ? or to explore niche mobile environments like Nokia 's Symbian3 and upcoming Meego HP 's WebOS or Samsung 's Bada ? ? ? need to both revisit their coding strategies and skills and lay down clear guidelines for managing apps on two or more platforms at the same time . <p> Depending on the platforms you choose to support the effort of moving from one platform to another varies significantly . The fact that BlackBerry Android and Nokia all support Java for example means that experienced Java programmers may have a pretty good idea how to transfer application logic between the devices . After all cross-platform compatibility was one of the original selling points for Java and having a mature code base in Java can get you a long way ahead in the move to a new platform . <p> Yet simply working in Java is no guarantee of hitting a six : each operating system has its own idiosyncratic APIs parameter calls and so on .

Appcelerator claims over 1.5m registered developers and 12300 in-the-wild apps which are built using Javascript HTML CSS Python Ruby or PHP depending on developers ' own preferences . <p> Titanium has proved invaluable for developers like Tammy Butow who along with two co-collaborators uses it to build music apps in parallel for iOS and Android without having to worry about the nuances of each platform . " I was originally doing web development but I wanted to build for both iPhone and Android and make it as quickly as possible " she explains . " I looked at Objective C and bought a book and did a bunch of tutorials but realised it was going to be easier to use Titanium . I like doing rapid prototyping which is fun if you 're doing it as a side thing as we are . " <p> Titanium has also worked a treat for developer Wayne Buchner who recently used it to develop an iPhone app for the Golf Australia 's Handa Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform is terrific if you do n't want to go to the extent of learning Objective C or Java which a lot of people will do ? ? ? explains Buchner a long-time web developer who 's making the transition to smartphone development . ? ? ? My long-term goal is to be a native Java or iPhone developer ? ? ? but until then it definitely allows you to use your Web skills to develop mobile apps that Apple has no problem approving or putting up on the store. ? ? ? <p> Titanium is n't the only multi-platform option on the scene : an increasingly popular alternative ? ? ? and one that 's likely to become even more so as the proliferation of mobile operating systems complicates life for developers even more ? ? ? is to use industry-standard HTML5 to build web apps . HTML5 is already well-supported amongst web browser makers and becoming even more so as tablet makers work to refine the user experience in their large form-factor devices . <p> HTML5 apps need to be hosted however and that means stepping outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason many developers are turning to tools like PhoneGap an open-source wrapper that bundles HTML5 and JavaScript-based apps into a package suitable for deployment on iOS Android BlackBerry Palm Windows Phone and Nokia 's Symbian operating systems . <p> PhoneGap may provide an important bridge between web development skills and smartphone deployment but its capabilities vary depending on the target platform . For example built-in compass is only supported on iPhone and Android platforms ; audio recording is only supported on Android ; cameras are not supported on Palm and Windows Mobile ; and so on . <p> Butow has also tried PhoneGap but prefers Titanium : " PhoneGap is really easy to set up but I found it a bit hard to do things like calling native components for the iPhone or calling tabs and so on " she explains . " It did n't have as much documentation and Titanium has been way better . " <p> Developers are working closely to extend the PhoneGap libraries to utilise new features as they emerge but there 's always going to be a gap between the capabilities of the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be less important to many developers than the benefits of easy cross-platform deployment but more demanding developers almost invariably find the platforms too limited for their requirements . <p> ? ? ? We 're not convinced yet that these frameworks are mature enough to add the value they could ? ? ? says Frank Farrall a partner within Deloitt 's consulting arm which is seeing ? ? ? almost ridiculous ? ? ? growth in demand for mobile apps and has recently completed projects for clients including the ANZ Bank Australia Post and the Victorian government . <p> There a growing team of developers has recently been ramping up mobile development capabilities . ? ? ? It 's a step in the right direction for sharing business logic but we 're concerned about being able to deliver the same level of user experience that you could through a native app " Farrall says . " You might save tens of thousands of dollars using a framework but you might also come up with a less appropriate user experience . For now we 're advising clients to keep a watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? but as it stands right now they 're not ready for prime time. ? ? ? <p> Bradby agrees : ? ? ? We do all native development because we want to give the users an experience that they 're used to on that platform " he explains . " Our concern with using cross-platform tools is that you 're developing with a lowest common denominator that would only allow you to write to something that both platforms would understand and there would be compromises on the way . Our Australian Open iPad app for example provides a very deep user experience and there 's no way we could get that out of HTML or a cross-platform tool . If you 're developing on the Android platform you want to be close to the metal. ? ? ? <p> That expression does n't come from nowhere : Google 's new ' Honeycomb ' v3.0 of Android incorporates a feature called Renderscript that allows for high-performance graphics manipulation by shunting complex graphics processes to any available graphics processing unit ( GPU ) . Programming it requires some intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy or even possible to port to other platforms . <p> The lack of such capabilities is one reason why some believe cross-platform tools will struggle to keep up . ? ? ? Games will always be performance hungry and you immediately have to go down from these high-level tools ? ? ? says Powell . ? ? ? There 's just too many layers between you and the hardware or native framework and typically the performance is just too weak. ? ? ? <p> That may change however as games engines like Unity and Unreal bring highly-optimised flexible graphics environments to a range of platforms . Their inevitable transition to tablet operating systems will open up new opportunities for developers like Luke Kellett whose small team at RUMA Studios is using Unity to build a cross-platform 3D game and is more than happy with its 60 frames-per-second performance on the iPad . ? ? ? We do have a bit of a performance hit but we do n't spend 80% of our time developing an engine and just 20% of our time developing the app ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user perception is one of the major areas developers need to consider when crossing from one platform to another . Particularly given the iPhone 's market dominance many developers start building for a secondary or tertiary platform and get locked into the mindset that they must make Android or other platforms their iPhone counterparts . <p> This approach may make sense to some developers but it creates major issues for users that find themselves trying to use an app that does n't make intuitive use of non-software features such as button layouts or screen dimensions . An Android app that does n't make use of its devices ' back button for example is going to come off as counterintuitive for users and affect the strength of the app and its parent brand . <p> ? ? ? Before the frontier was web sites ? ? ? says Vlado Grancaric manager of consulting with Deloitte . ? ? ? Different browsers did different things . But now it 's the mobile side of things . You 've got to think about the cases where you 're building for different platforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designers because each device has its own way of doing things and its own interactions. ? ? ? <p> Catering for these differences can tax the patience of designers as the Deloitte team found out : while prototyping its new Bamboo incident-response management system the team not only found out that it had to hard-code some business-related functionality in the Android version that was built into BlackBerry OS but found that its designers ' efforts to replicate the iPhone version had produced an inadequate final product . <p> ? ? ? We tried to replicated it and ended up going ' That does n't work ' ? ? ? Grancaric recalls . ? ? ? We went back to designers and said we need an iPhone design an Android design and a BlackBerry design . We want to make sure that whoever 's picking that app up knows how to use it based on the device they 're on ? ? ? as opposed to saying ' this is just an iPhone app ported to Android ' . ? ? ? <p> The differences become even greater when considering platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic similarities for example but Microsoft 's Windows Phone 7 uses a completely different panel-based interface ; Nokia 's interface is different still ; and BlackBerry OS still de-emphasises complex on-screen keyboards for physical keyboards in the majority of devices that support them . <h> Plan ahead <p> One way to minimise the complexity of the transition is to architect your apps in as modular a design as possible so that data structures are kept separate from presentation structures . This makes it easier to map the data onto new presentation structures without having to totally rewrite the code says Derk Munneke chief technical officer of 2moromobile whose client list includes the Heart Foundation Nova FM Murdoch Books and Toyota . <p> 2moromobile used such an approach for its womadelaide app which fed relevant and updated festival information from a SQLLite database to an iPhone app that 's now being transferred to Android and eventually Windows Phone 7 . <p> ? ? ? It will be interesting mapping to Windows Phone 7 but it 's a really good example of why the component-based approach works ? ? ? says Munneke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can use an app configuration tool to plug components together . The actual application becomes cross-platform and each component is platform-specific ? ? ? and designed to act in the way that that platform acts. ? ? ? <p> Buchner took a similar approach when designing his golf app : ? ? ? There are live specials from the sponsors new backgrounds and so on ? ? ? he says . ? ? ? A lot of that can be controlled through a remote file that the app goes to and retrieves data that you ca n't build into the phones . You just ca n't retrieve updates willy-nilly. ? ? ? <p> With multi-platform development becoming more and more important it 's worth thinking now about how easily your apps might make the jump . There 's no one single way to break onto another platform and tools are only one part of the effort . Yet by building your skills assembling appropriate teams of developers and following a range of other tips ( see sidebar ) it 's possible to both bring your apps to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start and make the effort to keep up with the platforms your clients demand and you 'll find you really can have the best of both worlds .

@@4140238 <p> Self-control is be a tricky thing , but it 's a necessary resource to understand if you want to make better decisions and life choices . Here 's a look at how it works , and how to produce it.If we were entirely logical , we 'd be able to abandon our bad habits , curb temporary moments of insanity , and practice self-control . Our logic is paired with emotion , however , and sometimes our emotions motivate us to make poor decisions . That 's where self control comes in . Here 's a deeper look into how self control works , followed by several ways to more effectively exert your supply of self control in order to make smarter decisions . <h> How Self Control Works <p> Back when basic survival was difficult , practicing the kind of self-control we need today was n't always necessary . We 'd have to hunt for our food if we wanted to eat , and we 'd eat what we could find in order to live . Eventually we figured out that this is n't the most efficient way to work and invented one of the biggest life hacks of all time : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what was once a constant fight for survival became ( relatively ) simple . Readily available food made it possible for a surplus of certain foods which made it possible to overeat . It took a long time for this to become a serious problem , but today we face a problem of excess consumption . Shifts such as this helped create a serious need for self-control in new aspects of our lives . <p> Of course we needed to learn to control ourselves before this point , as sex , wealth and power are inherent desires , but the primary manifestations of these desires lead to immediate consequences . For example , if you go out and kill somebody to steal their property , you 're likely going to make an enemy who will want to kill you ( and potentially succeed in doing so ) . On the other hand , more contemporary desires do n't have such immediate consequences ( like being murdered ) , and so there is n't necessarily anything scary to keep us in check . For example , computers and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their side effects include tech addiction , shortened lifespans from too much sitting , and even a few pesky etiquette issues . As technology continues to satisfy our desires -- for anything from food to information -- we have to practise self control in new and different ways . The problem is , this is n't easy to do . <p> So why is self control so difficult to produce ? A lot of things contribute to self-control issues , and we 'll get into them more below , but the main reason is that indulgence is much easier than the alternative . If you want to eat healthier , a meal you cook yourself and can control is often going to be the better option . That option requires work , however , and it 's easier to make a phone call to order takeout . Is this the smarter option ? Probably not , but the short-term effect of fatty takeout is the temporary satisfaction of enjoying your meal -- potentially the same effect as cooking -- and so the long-term effects of frequent indulgence is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we like to make decisions that will make us feel good right now because that result is more urgent . If you do n't enjoy doing something ( like cooking ) , making yourself exert the energy required to cook is a lot harder and much more unpleasant than doing nothing . But this is obvious if you 've ever tried to make yourself do something you did n't want to do . The primary problem is stopping yourself from making a bad decision based on immediate desire and also motivating yourself to make the smarter choice . It is n't easy , but it is n't impossible . <h> Practise , Practise , Practise <p> The simplest way to get better at anything is to practise . As a weekly exercise , pick something you do in excess and stop for a week . Stop watching television , do n't eat out , or keep technology out of the bedroom so you can sleep better . While a week is n't going to kick any particular habit , it 's pretty easy to stop anything for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week will give you the confidence that you can control yourself . After you 've practised for several weeks , try for longer . If you can make it a month , that 's often enough time to actually change your behaviour ( which is where the name of the movie 28 Days comes from ) . Googler Matt Cutts suggests that you can more easily improve your life 30 days at a time . It 's not a new concept but it can be a big help . Tell yourself you 're going try to cut out a particular behaviour for a month and reassess once that month is over . Knowing you do n't have to stop can make a big difference , and by the time you get to the end of that month you may not care to go back at all . <h> Find Adequate Distractions <p> As we 've learned from the fairly well-known kid 's marshmallow experiment , conducted by Walter Mischel , distracting yourself can be a good method of self control . When temptation is in front of you , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself and avoid thinking about that temptation , however , it 's often enough to keep you from making a bad choice . Simple distractions , such as sitting on your hands to physically restrict yourself or having a conversation to keep your mind occupied are both easy and effective . The idea is that the more your mind and body are tied up in other actions , the less bandwidth you 'll have available to try and indulge in a particular vice . Simply put : restrict and distract yourself to avoid making poor choices . <h> Take Care of Yourself <p> You have a limited supply of self-control and exhausting it can breed aggression . You do n't want to deplete your reserves or you 're going to become very unlikable . Keeping yourself healthy on a daily basis , however , can make a big difference . Like with anything , proper diet , exercise and sleep make it easier to do what you need to do . If you can manage all of those things to the point of perfection , you 're probably not reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snack . Keeping yourself nourished throughout the day -- preferably with several smaller meals rather than a few big ones -- is one of the easiest ways to keep an adequate reserve of self-control . You 'll still have to exert that control -- perhaps when choosing what to eat -- but it 's a fool 's errand without adequate energy . <h> Fabricate Disadvantage <p> It 's hard to become addicted to cigarettes if you ca n't get cigarettes . People without the financial means to purchase a vice like cigarettes ca n't participate in that vice . Additionally , people will more readily participate in a vice like smoking if the consequences are far off . If a single cigarette will kill you on the spot , and you know this , you 'll avoid it like you 'll avoid an electric fence . Putting yourself into extreme poverty or giving yourself a deadly nicotine allergy ( if that 's even possible ) are extreme measures you 'd never actually want to pursue as a means to quit smoking . Still , they do offer some helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty obtaining a cigarette , you do n't have to exert quite so much self control . Often times this means keeping your cigarettes somewhere that 's hard to access so getting them requires additional effort . Basically , if a vice is easy to obtain , you need to find ways to make it harder . <p> Fear is also a great means of self control . It 's easier to adjust your diet or kick a habit if you truly believe it 's going to kill you or cause immediate harm . If you have a peanut allergy , you do n't eat peanuts , no matter how badly you want to , because you know the immediate consequences are pretty dire . In order to use fear as a self-control mechanism , you need to be able to make the consequences of a particular action feel immediate . For example , I have no trouble controlling my intake of alcohol and I do n't have an interest in drugs because my family has a history of addiction . I 've seen what it can do first-hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug I remember the consequences and it helps me avoid making bad choices . How you make the consequences feel immediate and influence your decisions is highly personal , but it should always be safe . You can eat donuts until you vomit so you 'll never want to go near another donut again , but that 's not really a harmless solution . What you can do is spend time with people who are the poster children for poor life choices and fearfully think of them next time you want to indulge . <p> ( If you 're curious about the science behind fear being an effective method for self-control , read this article . ) <p> Practising self-control is n't easy for anybody . It takes a lot of work , and you 'll get better at it the more you practise . With the right strategies , like the ones mentioned here , you can avoid temptation when doing so is in your best interest . If you 've got any other great strategies for controlling yourself , be sure to share them in the comments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related behaviour change . It often only works on people who are already well on the way to the desired behaviour . In other words , it may reinforce a behaviour change that has already occurred , but it is unlikely to drive change .

Although the experiences are planned and staged , Pilkington does n't know what to expect , and his reactions are spontaneous and genuine . <p> You can be forgiven if you think that Ricky Gervais has a lot to do with the show , and he does , behind the scenes . You can constantly sense him pulling the puppet strings .

@@4167230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's relevant for socialists today ? <p> The German gunboat , Panther , tried to halt French claims to Morocco in 1911 . <p> By Dimitris Fasfalis <p> June 4 , 2011 -- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal -- History , of course , never repeats itself . Yet there are lessons to be learned from past experiences , especially when similar patterns affect similar historical actors in different epochs and settings . This seems to be the case for revolutionary socialists when we compare 2011 and 1911 . Despite their differences , these are times when imperialist war threatens while a revolutionary-democratic upsurge sweeps vast areas that were thought of as stable , if not stagnant . Hence the question : what 's relevant for us on the left today in our socialist predecessors ' experience in 1911 ? <p> Threat of imperialist war <p> First , the early 20th century socialists developed an understanding of the contradictory dynamics of capitalist globalisation and imperialist rivalries . <p> On July 1 , 1911 , the German warship Panther entered into the Moroccan harbour of Agadir , while a French expeditionary force had been intervening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anti-European troubles that sparked off in the city of Fez . The German move was designed to halt French claims to Morocco , as the latter was moving quickly into the French sphere of influence . <p> The rivalry between the two powers triggered an international crisis , and , in July 1914 , Europe was on the brink of war . An agreement was finally reached in November . With Britain 's support , France obtained from Germany freedom of action in Morocco in return of so-called " commercial freedom " . On March 30 , 1912 , the Fez treaty with the sultan settled for a time imperialist rivalries by establishing a French protectorate in Morocco . <p> Debate within the German social democracy <p> The debate that this 1911 crisis triggered in the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) is where the interest lies for us today . <p> In face of the crisis , the Socialist Second International 's International Socialist Bureau asked its sections ( parties ) whether an emergency meeting should be held or not . The German SPD 's answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SPD executive committee . It read : <p> Now I give credit to Bethmann-Hollweg and Kinderlen-W ? chter for every kind of stypidity , sufficient even to lead to serious European conflicts . But in the case of Morocco I do n't think these gentlemen have a free hand . Conflicting capitalist interests come into play here , and in Germany the pro-French group is stronger ... I do n't believe the managers of our foreign policy will go any further . The biggest capitalists are keenly aware that this would harm their interests , and they will order a timely halt . Even if we were to rapidly launch a very active campaign , subordinating all questions of domestic policy and so permitting our opponents to concoct an effective election slogan against us , it is not clear that we would achieve anything . For the industrialists Krupp and Thyssen are just as afraid of Socialists as Bethmann-Hollweg. 1 <p> While the Socialist International had been campaigning since the turn of the century against rising militarism and threats of imperialist war , some leaders within the SPD were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers was not on the agenda of the rulers , since they had too much to lose from it . In other words , the wave of globalisation through exports and finance had created , so thought these socialists , a web of solidarity between capitalist states , brushing aside the threat of a European war . The pope of social democracy , Karl Kautsky , later formulated his theory of ultra-imperialism on the same basis . <p> As a member of the International Socialist Bureau representing the social democracy in Poland and Lithuania , Rosa Luxemburg received a copy of this letter . On July 24 , 1911 , she published it in the left-wing SPD paper Leipziger Volkzeitung along with a criticism of the opportunism it embodied . She wrote : <p> If Molkenbuhr 's position errs by showing too little confidence in the power of our slogans , we believe it also fails by greatly overestimating the weight of capitalist interests as a guarantee of peace ... The future course of the Morocco adventure will not be determined by German industrialists Mannesmann and Thyssen alone . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily escape the control of its originators . Starting as a silly game with matches it can flare up into a world holocaust . " Concessions " of some sort can easily shift the center of gravity to southern Africa or some other part of the world , and there give birth to completely new conflicts . We therefore hold that it is not Social Democracy 's duty to soothe public opinion , but rather to arouse it and warn it of the dangers lurking behind every such adventure in present-day politics . It is best to rely not on the commitment to peace of any particular capitalist clique but on the resistance of the enlightened masses as a force for peace. 2 <p> Luxemburg rightly argued that capitalist interests and their reciprocal relations within international trusts were not enough to prevent a war . In fact , they were part of the problem ; their competition in the race for accumulation was laying the basis for great geopolitical and state rivalries over the division of the the world into spheres of influence . In other words , global capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it and the drive towards war between the contending powers . " For the international antagonisms of the capitalist states are only the complement of class antagonisms , and world political anarchy is but the reverse side of the anarchic system of capitalist production . " 3 <p> Her criticism of Molkenbuhr 's letter also reviewed the opportunistic basis of the electoral tactics it implied . <p> ... the general conception of an election campaign as expressed by the party 's Executive Committee is , we believe , open to objection . They would have us confine our agitation exclusively to questions of domestic policy like taxes and social legislation ... Above all we must carry out socialist education in the Reichstag German parliament elections . This can not be accomplished , however , if we aim our criticism exclusively at Germany 's internal political conditions , and fail to portray the overall international context ... We must not fashion our electoral agitation as some simplistic political primer cut down to a couple of catchy slogans , but as the Socialist world view in its all-encompassing totality and diversity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ideas and method of thought , it is necessary to determine the differences between international conflicts at the beginning of the 20th century and those of the turn of the 21st century . <p> 1911 and our own epoch <p> The first striking difference between both epochs is related to the specific features of the world order . Tendencies towards conflict and tensions among capitalist powers are since the end of World War II halted from developing by the hegemonic power of the United States . Indeed , no other capitalist power can today challenge the military and geopolitical strength of US imperialism . <p> This does n't mean there are no rivalries but only that their full-fledged manifestation is stunted by the configuration of the world order . The latter however is changing : the rise of eastern Asia and of regional powers such as the " BRICs " ( Brazil , India and China ) show that the centre of gravity of the world economy is shifting from the Atlantic to the East and that a multipolar world is progressively being established , with all the uncertainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxemburg 's years and our epoch concerns the transformation of modern warfare . Total war such as the world wars the world witnessed in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945became much less probable since the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 . The reason is simple : a world war would mean , since the arms race and the nuclear build up of the Cold War , not to mention nuclear proliferation since the 1970s , the annihilation if not of humankind , at least of modern civilisation . War has thus become more restrained since the end of the two world wars , but , modern illusions notwithstanding , it has not left us . <p> In fact , the 20th century and our own times confirm the Marxist thesis that capitalism equals war . Behind us we have a century of constant fighting : the Cold War , with its ideological confrontation and its peripheral conflicts , the colonial wars against national liberation movements , the regional inter-state conflicts stemming from the world disorder since the 1970s ( such as the Iran-Iraq war in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq and Afghanistan . <p> To the extent that 1911 and 2011 share these common features , there are two lessons for revolutionary socialists to be underlined . First , the dialectical understanding of the relations between capitalist powers and states in the era of globalisation still stands as valid . Global capitalism and war are the two sides of the same coin . <p> Second , revolutionary politics can only have a global framework and national and local tactics are subordinate to a clear understanding of the dynamics of the world system . This does not mean we lose focus on the local specificities and details , but only that national political and social life is determined by the world dynamics of capitalism , and not vice-versa . <p> Dimitris Fasfalis currently lives in Paris and has written for a number of left publications , including Socialist Voice , Presse-toi ? gauche and Europe solidaire sans frontiers.

Sure , it 's funny to think about a program getting put on probation in a video game -- provided it 's not yours . Many reload their save files every time a star quarterback gets injured , so how would losing him to a suspension be any different . <p> More productive are features such as those introduced by NBA 2K11 's My Player career mode .

Students and staff borrowed 1100 books in a single hour to save them from storage . Of those 160 had n't been borrowed since 1979 . <p> ' ' Touching an icon like Fisher Library has to engender some protest . You would expect it to , ' ' Shipp says . ' ' In universities where they care about scholarship , there 's always protest . ' ' <p> Uncatalogued gems worth thousands have been unearthed at Fisher .

Shipp expects to find 18,000 more . <p> The library manager for the City of Sydney , David Sharman , says public libraries are also changing . Their function has gone from a warehouse for books to a pleasant place in which people want to spend time . There , the focus on book preservation of 40 years ago is now balanced against the demands of visitors , who want more than to sit on a patch of carpet with a book on their lap . <p> ' ' The belief at the time was that books and light do n't mix because it makes the paper fade , ' ' he says . ' ' We 've gone full circle because natural light and people do mix . ' ' <p> Libraries are becoming airier . Rows of shelves are opening out to lounges and cafes . Desks come with powerpoints for students to plug in laptops and sunlight passes over squat shelves that no longer need a ladder for access . <p> Search engines have also changed the information people look for . Requests for low-level information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - have given way to increased interest in niche information . Search engines and websites such as Wikipedia satisfy the initial demand for information . <p> ' ' Wikipedia may be right , it may be wrong , but it will give you an answer , ' ' Sharman says . <p> The digitisation of reference material , including encyclopedias and dictionaries , also delivers access to quality information at home . Library members can log on using their library card number and trawl through databases in their lounge rooms . <p> For fiction , demand in libraries for e-books has so far been small . Instead of shifting novels online , community libraries are tailoring hardcopy collections to match the interests of their members . <p> In Surry Hills , for example , the library carries extra titles on art and design .

For the nine inner-city libraries he manages , 25 per cent of visitors are tertiary students , he says , many of whom live in share houses and are seeking a pleasant space to spend time . And librarians are less inclined to hush chatter , perhaps in the recognition that their buildings are becoming meeting places for people seeking free public space , indoors . <p> In the new Ryde Library , shelves are arranged in Y-shapes according to genre . Books on health are clustered . Home and garden titles sit together . <p> ' ' Like a bookshop , ' ' the library services manager , Jill Webb , says .

@@4171230 <p> FreeNAS is an open source operating system based on FreeBSD and , as its name implies , designed for networked storage .

How did the project get started ? <p> FreeNAS 8 ties an easy to use and intuitive GUI to a powerful , stable , robust operating system to make a storage appliance . The project was started a number of years ago when a BSD UNIX enthusiast was looking around for a home file server based on BSD UNIX . When he could n't find one he created one of his own . <p> What 's new in FreeNAS 8 ? <p> In some ways FreeNAS 8 is a case of taking a step backwards in order to be able to take two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive use of Python , Django , and Dojo . In comparing it to the GUIs offered by other storage appliances on the market it really stands out . Whether you look at competing products , such as Openfiler , Nexenta , FreeNAS 0.7 , or products in a different tier , such as a NetApp or EMC , the GUI in FreeNAS 8 really stands out . <p> There 's more there than a pretty face though , behind that GUI is the latest FreeBSD operating system , 8.2 , with ZFS version 15 . ZFS is a production-ready filesystem in FreeBSD 8. x . <p> With FreeNAS 8 there seems to be a focus on expandability -- using a Django-based GUI and creating a plug-in system , for example . What was the thinking behind this ? More flexibility in terms of creating a community-driven ecosystem around the OS , or just maintainability of the core system ? <p> One of the reasons that the developers of FreeNAS 0.7 were considering rewriting it was the static nature of the GUI . Adding functionality to a FreeNAS 0.7 box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade was not something it was designed to do . As we set out to rewrite FreeNAS that was one of the major issues we wanted to solve . <p> A number of consumer-focused features ( BitTorrent , for example ) were ditched between version 7 and 8 . What was the reasoning behind this ? <p> We wanted the primary focus to be on file storage and sharing . Many of the media centre functionalities were considered prime candidates for the plug-in system . <p> Are there any features in version 8 that were particularly technically challenging to implement , or that the team is particularly proud of ? <p> The whole GUI is a fairly amazing thing . A common reaction is , " I did n't know you could do that in a web page . " <p> FreeNAS is built off FreeBSD -- is there a reason why FreeBSD was chosen as a base instead of , for example , a Linux-based OS ? Are there advantages to it ? At one point it looked like it was shifting towards being based on Debian ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability , robustness , and the fact that it has a native ZFS implementation made it a natural choice for the base for a storage appliance . <p> What is the target market for FreeNAS ? Is it mainly for personal use by people who want networked storage at home , or is it used in production environments -- would you consider it enterprise-ready , for example ? In some respects it seems to straddle both consumer and business markets -- it has features that would be great for home storage , but also features like iSCSI targeting and 10GigE support . <p> I think in some ways it does straddle the high-end home user market and the low-end commercial market . In its current form it has moved away from the multimedia centre that many people were using FreeNAS for and more towards a storage appliance . We certainly intend to get back to that role in the future , but that 's where we are at today . <p> It 's also missing the features of really high end storage , like active/active failover , a clustered filesystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't compete with the likes of a BlueArc , NetApp , or EMC at the high end . What we are finding is that there 's a lot of room in the lower end , where features like snapshots and dedup are needed , but things like active/active failover are not .

In Mexico only 2% of violent crime ever reaches the courts . <p> JAVIER MORLET : ? They are not looking for her . That ? s why I ? m very angry .

This is what people don ? t understand ? . <p> BRISSENDEN : In Juarez , the army is what stands between law-abiding citizens and this man ? Vicente Carrillo Fuentes ? El General ? the leader of the Juarez cartel and the gatekeeper to the narcotics highway north . He ? s a brutal enforcer . His henchmen often mutilate and decapitate anyone who gets in their way . Fuentes like so many of the cartel principals is still in business .

@@4171234 <h> Australia 's humans rights obligations <p> A growing chorus of international voices is telling Australia that it must do better on human rights . <p> As pressure mounts on the Federal Government over the " Malaysia solution " , Australia 's human rights record will face further scrutiny from the international community when it appears before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva today . Australia will deliver its formal response to 145 recommendations made as part of the Universal Periodic Review process . The process , to which every country in the world is subject on a rolling basis , provides the international community with the opportunity to ask questions and make recommendations about the human rights record of the country under review . <p> When Australia first fronted the Human Rights Council to commence the review in January , it was called on to answer some tough human rights questions . Six months later , and with ample time for further consultation and consideration , the time has come for Australia to give answers . <p> Back in January , three key issues topped the international community 's concern : Australia 's treatment of refugees and asylum seekers , the disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lack of a Human Rights Act or Charter . Other significant issues , such as violence against women , police use of Tasers and the rights of people with disability also received critical attention during Australia 's review . <p> In advance of its formal statement to the international community through the Human Rights Council on Wednesday , the Government has released an outline of its response which , it says , " showcases " Australia 's " strong human rights record " . <p> To its credit , the Government will accept , at least in part , more than 90 per cent of the recommendations made during the review . As we should . We are a stable , democratic and highly-developed state with a government that espouses a commitment to human rights leadership . We ought to be held to the very highest human rights standards . <p> However , while a 90 per cent acceptance rate sounds impressive , the precise nature of the commitments made by the Government warrants closer examination . <p> Close to half of the recommendations have been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate , however , to existing policies and processes , such as the recognition of Aboriginal people in the Australian Constitution and implementing a national policy to reduce violence against women . There are a small number of welcome new commitments , including a promise to " enhance " anti-discrimination laws ( which were previously to be merely " consolidated " ) and to consider increasing our aid budget to the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent " as economic and fiscal conditions permit " . <p> The Government has accepted almost a third of recommendations on the basis that they " are already reflected in existing laws or policies " . This is true in some cases , but in others the claim is dubious at best . Contrary to the Government 's response , for example , there is no Australian jurisdiction in which police-related deaths are independently investigated . Similarly , the Government 's statement that UN recommendations concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are " already reflected in existing laws or policies " somehow overlooks repeated recommendations to abolish the Northern Territory Intervention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally on the positive side of the ledger , about one-fifth of recommendations have been accepted " in part " , generally on the basis that the Government will further " consider " the recommendation . <p> This leaves 6 per cent of the recommendations that will be rejected by the Australian Government . Regrettably , these recommendations are precisely those which require real legal and institutional reform . They are also those which relate to the most persistent and significant human rights criticisms from UN human rights bodies , the Australian Human Rights Commission and non-government organisations . The government has rejected recommendations to enact a Human Rights Act and to end the mandatory and indefinite detention of asylum seekers , including children . They have also rejected recommendations designed to meaningfully address Aboriginal disenfranchisement and disempowerment , such as negotiating a treaty , compensating the Stolen Generations and strengthening land rights . <p> Announcing Australia 's response , Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said " the Universal Periodic Review is a good opportunity to demonstrate that when it comes to human rights , equality and opportunity , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can achieve more , the response to date has been a missed opportunity to actually achieve more . <p> Fortunately , the Universal Periodic Review process does not end here .

It is positive that the Government has committed to including each of the accepted recommendations in a National Human Rights Action Plan , although if this plan is to work , it must contain concrete measures and identify clear responsibilities , timeframes and targets . It is also positive that Australia has committed to provide the UN Human Rights Council with an interim report on implementation , a report which will probably coincide with a vote on Australia 's UN Security Council candidacy . <p> There are some disappointments - major disappointments - in the Government 's UPR response , but also some welcome commitments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhetoric of best practice in engaging with human rights mechanisms to the reality of best practice in implementing our human rights obligations .

And I see that- so many of the old people have gone , of course , and I think that you know , that 's one of the problems as well , that the leadership and the strength that those people had all those years ago does n't seem to be around anymore . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : There are all too many obvious livid scars on the face of Australia 's indigenous community . <p> But they are just symptoms of something profound and hard to cure . Anne Shepherd sees the source of the soul deep sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse by the best of intentions . <p> ANNE SHEPHERD : I think it actually starts with the dispossession . I think then there 's the hopelessness , the loss of culture . There 's certainly a degree of hopelessness . <p> I think the welfare system is killing indigenous people . What have we had now , 30-35 years of welfare for indigenous people ? It certainly has n't helped them . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Is there a problem with welfare dependency ? Is there a problem with personal responsibility ? <p> RICK FLETCHER , KALANO COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION : I believe there is . You know , the indigenous community struggle with this all the time . We struggle with providing services to people who are living below the poverty line and are caught in the welfare trap . <p> Finding ways out of that , Chris , are very hard , and we struggle with it , month by month . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Rick Fletcher heads the Kalano community association that services five town camps . <p> RICK FLETCHER : The effect of the apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great effect . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : He says the Commonwealth 's 2007 intervention into indigenous communities in the Territory was less well received . There were some good investments and some that are debatable . <p> RICK FLETCHER : Well ... I think the jury is still out on income management . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : But he thinks the alcohol ban that came with the intervention simply shifted the problem to town . <p> RICK FLETCHER : We saw an influx . Here at Kalano we have 140 houses that we manage . The number of people living in those houses in April 2008 was 568 . That grew to 900- over 900 in a year . And so we saw a doubling of the number of people that have moved to the town and then sought refuge with families . <p> The intervention in 2007 , for all accounts , seemed as if it was a disaster . It was like a natural disaster . <p> ANNE SHEPHERD : Certainly many , many people come in from the surrounding communities of Katherine - a large region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the party town , so they certainly come here seeking alcohol . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : The urban drift saw the number of people living rough climb to over 500 . In a town of just 10,000 , that gave Katherine the dubious honour of having the highest rate of homelessness in the nation . <p> And it has seen existing homes overcrowded , something the chair of the local health service can attest to . <p> IAN WOODS : I 've got five , seven , adults and about six kids in my house , so yeah , it is a big issue . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : From 8:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night , five days a week , Kalano 's community patrol scans the streets to ensure the adrift , the homeless and the dangerously drunk are cared for . <p> ROBERT , COMMUNITY PATROL OFFICER : Are you all right ? <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : They ask if people want to be taken home to a sobering up unit or to protective custody in the police cells . Every month , 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken to the sobering up shelter . <p> Do you think the problem with alcohol is getting better or worse , Robert ? <p> ROBERT : It 's getting worse . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Alcohol is not the only drug robbing people of their money and their health . There 's also a thriving black market in cannabis and the Pacifics ' drug of choice , kava . <p> The intervention pays for two police whose job so to detect and disrupt the organised crime rings that run the illicit drugs trade . <p> ACTING SGT KEN BRADSHAW , NT POLICE : Large amounts of kava come in and large amounts of money leave as a result of the sales of kava . <p> The street value of kava is roughly $1 a gram . It is usually sold in small deal bags of approximately 20 grams each for $20 or $30 .

They make a bit of noise ... <p> ( Road train roars past ) <p> .. and then they 're gone . <p> Julia Gillard is in the Territory this week , listening to those affected by the intervention . <p> JULIA GILLARD , AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER : I 'm seeing this with my own eyes , but I 'm trying to see it through the eyes of the people who live here . <p> CHRIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people are keen to be heard . <p> RICK FLETCHER : What I would say to Julia Gillard is that the intervention needs now to focus on giving the communities that have been proscribed under the legislation the tools and the resources to be able to tackle this problem at home . <p> ( Aboriginal dancers move down a road ) <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : The Stuart highway was closed for nearly an hour today as Strongbala took to the street . <p> STRONBALA PARTICIPANT : We 're sending a message to all our countrymen out there ( inaudible ) . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : If the first step to healing is recognising that you 've got a problem , then there 's reason to hope for Katherine . And while there 's huge disagreement about the merits of the intervention , there is one common theme . <p> IAN WOODS : Approach us in regards to our role in these decisions that the Government thinks that they are so much in control of . <p> Yeah , that 's what I would be asking . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted ? <p> IAN WOODS : Nup .

Each suggested that Ailes and Fox News are partly responsible for the Tea Party , president Obama 's falling approval ratings and the allegedly-new coarseness of American political debate . <p> In a trend-setting article , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astonishing discovery that US industrialists , long-time libertarians and brothers Charles and David Koch donate to organisations that support limited government . The article , entitled " Covert Operations " , suggested the Koch brothers were secretly funding a war on the Obama administration and were at least partly responsible for the creation of the Tea Party movement . <p> Rather than opting for the palatable and logical explanation that the Koch brothers ' philanthropic support for think-tanks like the Cato Institute was motivated by their personal beliefs and ideology ( David Koch was the Libertarian Party 's vice-presidential nominee in 1980 ) , the author suggested more sinister motives . Noting that their political beliefs conveniently " dovetail with their corporate interests " , the article goes on to suggest that their barracking for smaller government and increased personal freedom might be linked to their status as a major air polluter . Unmentioned , of course , was their support for gay marriage , and their donations to the quintessentially-liberal American Civil Liberties Union . <p> But responsibility for the Tea Party spreads far and wide , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host Glenn Beck , who appeared in stints on both CNN and Fox News , but who has now returned primarily to his radio show , also bears some of the burden . In two separate profiles for the New Yorker , first in 2009 and then in 2010 , Beck 's pernicious influence on the American public was chronicled . <p> No doubt each of these figures played some role in the rise of the Tea Party . But political movements ca n't just be conjured up at the behest of billionaire businessmen , media moguls or talk-show hosts . And they certainly ca n't be directed exclusively by them to serve their commercial interests . <p> If that were the case , what took them so long ? Why did the Koch brothers -- who were involved in libertarian activism as early as the 1970s -- not " create " the Tea Party to tackle US President Jimmy Carter , or Bill Clinton , decades ago ? And if they 're so powerful and influential , how come they 've dismally failed to achieve their cherished goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't exactly taken up the cause . <p> A much more charitable -- and logical interpretation -- is that the Tea Party is a genuine community response to the record spending and debt accrued by the US government . All published opinion polls suggest deep unease with America 's national debt and the massive increases in federal spending over the past few years . <p> Though Australia lacks the same traditional philanthropic culture and history of political activism from its wealthiest citizens , this approach is far from unique to the United States . Many Australian journalists seem eager to import the tactic . <p> For example , a report on the ABC 's youth-oriented Hungry Beast news show on the Koch brothers appeared to be entirely sourced from the infamous New Yorker article . Their report also attempted to link the backlash against Julia Gillard 's carbon tax in Australia to an Australian who worked at an organisation partly funded by Koch donations and who now runs a political blog . <p> No doubt a badge of pride for the young conservative activist Tim Andrews and his website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalism . <p> But Tim is n't alone , of course . <p> Another favourite fixture of the progressive commentariat , both here and in the US , is News Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch . <p> Despite being on the record calling for the planet to be given the " benefit of the doubt " and driving efforts to turn his company carbon neutral , Murdoch also apparently stands in the way of the Australian public 's deep-seated desire to be taxed into prosperity via an emissions trading scheme . At least if you listen to Greens leader Bob Brown , and some journalists . <p> In an extraordinary press conference last month , Senator Brown lashed the Murdoch press as the " hate media " and accused it of hindering action on climate change . <p> In an essay for Australia 's Monthly magazine -- which no doubt aspires to be a New Yorker on the Yarra -- Guy Rundle trundled out all the usual left-wing clich ? s about Rupert Murdoch , Fox News and their respective roles in derailing president Obama 's agenda and the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for The Conversation , even hinted that Rupert Murdoch , through his tabloids and -- of course , Fox News , was in some way responsible for recent death-threats made against climate scientists . Hamilton blames " conservative think-tanks " and " fossil-fuel interests " for the failure of some members of the public to jump enthusiastically at the prospect of drastic action to slash carbon emissions . <p> As much as it might disappoint some commentators , most conservative philanthropists are simply passionate about the philosophy of individual liberty and personal freedom , just as others are committed to human rights or finding a cure for cancer . Surprisingly , even ordinary people can subscribe to these beliefs , and they do n't need to be told by a reclusive billionaire or wacky media personality how to think . It might be challenging to the worldview of someone who thinks the best thing for society is ever-growing government , but smearing people as simply self-interested or pawns of commercial interests wo n't make them go away . <p> After all , the simplest explanation is often the best one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political views you disagree with . <p> James Paterson is associate editor of the Institute of Public Affairs ' Review and was a Liberal Party staffer from 2006 to 2010. 
@@4171239 <p> Australia 's cricketers have become free agents in Twenty20 and can begin signing up with the new Big Bash League franchises . Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers ' Association ( ACA ) have signed off on a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) , despite shelving negotiations over the distribution of private investment money that could come in for the newly-formed city-based Twenty20 sides . <p> The one-year extension to the existing MOU means that the players and administrators have a little extra time to come to an agreement over private investment , if and when backers begin to jump on board with the Melbourne and Sydney sides . The ACA chief executive Paul Marsh said that if private money came in before this summer 's inaugural Big Bash League , the players could still win a piece of the pie . <p> " We have no idea what value if anything is going to come from the private investment money that may come in to these franchises , " Marsh said . " Until we get some certainty around that I do n't think it would have been a smart decision for us to lock in for more than one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that we may lock in for a longer term . <p> " One thing we 've negotiated into this deal is a clause that if and when that does happen , then we 'll sit down with CA and seek to negotiate an outcome . It would be fair to say we 're a fair way apart on that particular issue , so there 'll be some pretty robust discussions on that if and when that time comes . " <p> James Sutherland , the CA chief executive , said the decision to side-step private investment had been necessary to keep the Australian game from grinding to an industrial halt . <p> " Both parties have agreed it 's not an issue today , " he said . " It may be an issue in the future and if it is an issue in the future then we will in good faith sit down with each other and talk that through . In some ways perhaps ideally it would be great to be sitting here today and say we 've locked that down and got some agreement on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pragmatic approach to the situation , we want the show to keep moving on and we want to be absolutely focused in giving players the security around their future as much as possible . " <p> The ACA has already had one major victory in the Big Bash League , with Cricket Australia agreeing to free agency as the method of recruitment . With eight teams in the new competition , which begins in December , existing state contracts will bear no relevance to who plays where , so a die-hard Victorian like Brad Hodge could end up playing for Hobart , or Adelaide , or Brisbane . <p> Cricket Australia 's original preference had been for all players to enter a draft , which could have meant a widespread scattering of cricketers to unfamiliar parts of the country . But under the free-agency model , every player will be able to negotiate his own deal with a team of his choice , which Marsh said was a significant win for the players . <p> " One of the great outcomes for us around the Big Bash is we fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , " he said . " That means players can negotiate with the teams of their choice and agree to terms , the value of their choice . We fought hard for that and we 've got to a point now where we have an unrestricted free-agency model , which is pretty rare in world sport . <p> " It 's a big change from what we 've traditionally had . We 've come to some very good solutions here . It 's going to be a change and the players are going to have to get used to having two different contracts , two different employers . It is more complex . But in time we 'll get used to it and it will become the norm . " <p> The ACA and Cricket Australia had struggled to reach common ground on the MOU for several months , with the private investment issue and a distribution of funds from a proposed redevelopment of the WACA the two key sticking points . In the end , those two issues were put aside so planning for the Big Bash League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their share of 26% of Australian cricket revenue . <p> " Australian cricket has one of its biggest summers ever coming up in terms of both fan appeal but also in terms of revenue coming into the game , " Cricket Australia 's chief executive James Sutherland said . " The launch of the Big Bash League is important to us and to the ACA because of its long-term value in helping cricket recruit young people to become cricket fans ; and the international programme we hope to announce later this week will offer current and new fans a big year of international cricket . <p> " Recognising this , CA and the ACA have agreed to defer a number of outstanding issues until next year to ensure we can all get on with planning a big summer that will be important to fans and to players alike .

Her article leaves us in no doubt as to her sway . <p> Laurie24 June 2011 <p> Abbott made a good point in parliament yesterday - even if he did not agree with all of Rudd 's policies , at least one knew where he stood on issues , what he thought . With Gillard , it is a different matter , she changes with the weather . As Abbott pointed out , Rudd was the leader that Australians elected . Nothing can change that . It was a huge mistake to put Gillard in . And increasingly Abbott is getting my vote . <p> Skye24 June 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goot enough " you are letting your tribal beliefs get in the way of rational judgement . <p> Have you met the man ? In terms of intellect he is clearly so far ahead of either Rudd or Gillard that there 's just no contest . As with Paul Keating , do n't let the public persona that 's necessary for a politician in opposition to rise above the noise and spin fool you . Although in Keating 's case it was playing to the constituency . Abbott does n't feel the need to do this , which is refreshing . <p> Ian Robertson24 June 2011 <p> As I understand it , Kevin Rudd was deposed because of his micro-management of issues and a lack of ability to manage many people ( ' 24/7 ' being a case in point ' . <p> Interestingly those who enjoyed his management and patronage were people able to be permanently ' on call ' ) . His lack of interest in backbenchers came back to bite him when it came to a ballot . <p> The wider Australian public is not privy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed in the media is positive . <p> According to those in the know , Julia Gillard has performed better that Kevin Rudd in terms of not ' micro-managing ' and having superior interpersonal skills . Of course , the Labor party will never admit that it came down to internal management and instead made the leadership change about the polls . <p> In hindsight , a better course of action for the ALP would have been an ' intervention ' of some kind of succession plan - whether or not Kevin Rudd would have accepted it is another matter . <p> MBG24 June 2011 <p> It is not surprising I suppose to discover those who remain blind to Kevin Rudd 's shortcomings mistaking the self-satisfied glow of nostalgia for a well-made fire . <p> w. hamilton24 June 2011 <p> Lyn , the real tragedy if you like is that Kevin Rudd blew it . The current situation is also a measure of his failure . Even now he can barely see why he failed , and turned so many of his colleagues against him . It 's ironic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Rudd 's way of operating have merely been taken up by Julia Gillard . It seems he is not the only one who has n't learned from what happened and why . <p> Kate24 June 2011 <p> Well said , Laurie , I could not agree more . This is one of the most blatantly biased articles I have ever read on Eureka Street . No analysis , no justification for her anti-Liberal comments . It is just assumed that this are self-evident truths , up there with " All men are created equal . " <p> Patrick James24 June 2011 <p> It is clear from the comments , what the writer prefers . We are all imperfect .. No leader is so experienced that they can provide expert leadership right across the board , and so ALL leaders have to rely on either their internal bureaucrats , or their preferred external knowledge-base . <p> So I do wonder how one could make such an emphatic observation " Tony Abbott is not " , when the other two , have shown and proved their frailties to have delivered significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters . Their views for the future are equally as flawed . <p> My question - " Are we as voters and tax-payers , expected to accept flawed public policy , simply because NO ONE is perfect , and yet we are told certainly " Tony Abbott is not " . <p> Do I see a bias ? <p> Peter Atkins24 June 2011 <p> I ca n't honestly say I enjoyed Lyn Bender 's article . Nor would I email it to any of my friends . We , my friends and I , dislike commentators who use the generic first person plural ( WE ) as if all their readers shared their position , opinions , responsibility , etc . We ( my friends and I ) had nothing to do with the deposition of Rudd . We did not vote for him or his party , so we do not claim to have elected him . Our opinion on him , either as PM or Foreign Minister , has not been been canvassed either through focus groups or opinion polls . As to the plethoric multiplicity of variables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and my friends have no credible and reliable information . While I appreciate something had to be written on the anniversary of the election by a parliamentary caucus of Australia 's first female PM , I would have preferred an article that examined and commented upon the factors , not just political but also , with deference to Ms Bender 's profession , psychological that brought about that watershed event . There is something to be said for the old adage : " The King is dead , Long Live the King ! " Let 's move forward . <p> Uncle Pat24 June 2011 <p> Perhaps the time is right for democracy itself to be revisited , incorporating the effects of human nature in our leaders and our expectations of organisational policies . Many businesses are introducing dual roles with a leader who deals with the financial aspects , and another who deals with the day to day interactions and undertakings of ' staff ' . Maybe we are asking too much of the role of prime minister , or they are taking on tasks that should be delegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number-cruncher ' is not a position the public has a vote on , and yet this role appears to have greater powers than that of the respective elected leader . We 've seen Governor General 's and caucus make decisions on the public 's behalf regarding elected leaders . Is this part of a democratic process ? Polls are not enough to gauge the public 's sentiments and this has been proven through elections resulting in outcomes not predicted through this process . <p> Now appears to be the time to review public expectations of politics as well as political obligations to the public . Journalism appears to be the preferred arena for the public voice in society today . Reviewing this is also in order . <p> SCOTT24 June 2011 <p> Rudd 's popularity was underestimated by those that installed Gillard . He was influential in getting the party elected , regardless of the fact that a party is voted in , not a person .

Public outcry at the toppling of Rudd suggested that voters have become primed to a personality-oriented election campaign that neglects the grass roots issues of each electorate . Also Rudd 's sobbing and bitterness shows he 's more concerned with his personal career path than the good of his part , the government or the nation - like most politicians I guess , especially the increasingly boorish Abbott who , like a spoiled child , predictably contradicts and opposes anything just to prop up his ego . <p> Lefty24 June 2011 <p> Lyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive rule " . But Mr John Howard served 4 terms as Prime Minister , that means that Australians elected him 4 times .

It would be more correct to say 60 per cent of Labor Party supporters want Rudd back as Leader . It is obvious that at least 60 per cent of Australians do not need a Leader swap , they need a better government . Lyn 's view is that Tony Abbott is not good enough . My view of Tony Abbott ; he has successfully exposed the faults , failures , broken promises and incompetence of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard . Tony Abbott is Pro-God , Pro-Family and Pro- Life .

It is also taking focus off of the root cause of the problems for the ALP . The main issue , as I see it is simple . The ALP needs to restore the collective and specifically the ability of Caucus to determine who becomes the parliamentary leader as well as who should hold the ministries .

What was that Bedouin proverb about lost opportunities ? The caravan does n't past your tent again for another 20 years . On that score , if Labor loses the next elections , we 'd have an Oz version of a US Tea Party for the next 2 decades . It really is n't a prospect that I look forward to for my grandchildren 's sake .

Cabinet ) dictatorially . His own fellow party members rebelled . This was not just about the latest poll , whether above or below 31% . For the record , I disagreed with the manner of the deposition , which harmed Gillard more than it did Rudd . But she won the next election as leader , and the people endorsed her government , even if it is a minority government . <p> Gillard 's poll rating is now low for a number of reasons , including some poor decisions and unfortunate statements e.g. not being good at foreign affairs , but mainly because she faces a much more energised and incredibly agressive and un-cooperative opposition than Rudd ever faced .

He ' shot himself in the foot ' ! He was a one man band . One should also not take Polls seriously . It seems to me that there is a meaningless poll every 5 minutes and their questions are always ' loaded ' . The problem with our current political leaders at both the federal and state level is a lack of statesmen/stateswomen like qualites . Most of these people lack imagination and vision . Their political philosophy and idealogy is superficial at best . The same can also be said for most Australians . Most people are apathatic about politics , because we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wars or significant natural disasters . Most of the mainstream media provide a very poor service - the coverage of news , current affairs , politics , economics , sport and the arts is mediocre and superficial . Most of the content of the popular media is trivial and celebrity nonsense . <p> The current narrative about the ALP says the party losing its soul and ultimately turning its back on those Australians it is meant to represent . The Tasmanian experience suggests the same might be said for the Greens in the Federal Parliament , who assume the balance of power in the Senate today . <p> Even if the Malaysian government guaranteed the security , sustenance and education of the asylum seekers , the human dignity of those found to be refugees would still be significantly infringed . They would be unable to enter Malaysian society equally , and they have no possibility of prompt acceptance into another society . <p> The media are not indulging in fantasies , but feeding off rumours around Parliament House and gossip from within Labor . The message is that Gillard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the party has bigger problems than an unpopular leader . <p> The international community tends to back ' democratic ' revolutions , rather than national unity , in countries of the Middle East . This is good for majority populations , but Christians and other minorities can be the losers .

@@4196232 <h> Transcript <p> LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : One of the very few Labor heavyweights who 's been happy to comment in detail about the anniversary of Kevin Rudd 's knifing is the former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie . <p> The two have a long association going back to Queensland 's Goss Government when Mr Beattie was a backbencher and Mr Rudd a senior public servant . <p> Peter Beattie 's calling on the Foreign Minister to go to the backbench and then quit politics , saying continuing leadership tensions will cost Labor government . <p> Mr Beattie joined me earlier from Washington where he 's attending a biotechnology conference . <p> Peter Beattie , in a newspaper article this week you 've called on Kevin Rudd to move to the backbench and then leave politics . What would that achieve , in your view ? <p> PETER BEATTIE , FORMER QLD PREMIER : Clearly , the leadership issue is destabilising for the party . I know it 's the first anniversary today . I do n't have any pleasure in doing or writing those sorts of things . I 'm a life member of the party , I love the party , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why I wrote it . But I think there are broader issues , regardless of who is leader , that need to be dealt with . <p> LEIGH SALES : And what are those issues ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : I think we need to deal with issues like the carbon tax . I mean , one of the problems that concerns me is that I do n't think that there is a broad enough understanding in the Australian community , and this is partly due to the brawl that 's gone on about the carbon tax , as to what it really means and why it 's so important to Australia . Australia needs to be more than a quarry and a beach . And if we have this continuing , insane , I guess , childish debate in Australia from I guess , you know , in some senses a political spectrum of views , if we continue that childish debate , Australia will be left behind . We have to understand that there is an increasing demand in the world for energy , the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest in clean coal technology . For heaven 's sake , we have to spend more money on geothermal , all the biofuels . Those sorts of things are gon na be part of the energy mix , and that 's why it 's infuriating to seize the inane , childish debate going on in Australia about the carbon tax . <p> LEIGH SALES : I 'm going to return to my first question because you did n't answer it , you segued off into energy policy . You called on Kevin Rudd to move to the backbench and then out of politics . What would that achieve ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : Look , I did that for the very simple reason that I was trying to urge , as a long-time member of the Labor Party , a sensible outcome . Everybody knows that this ongoing debate , revisiting what 's happened in the past , is not good for the Labor Party . It 's not good for the Government . It 's not good for Australia . And , frankly , that 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impasse . Now , Kevin 's hardly gon na take my advice in these circumstances , and I understand the trauma that he went through . I understand the pain he went through . But frankly , we 've got two years to the next federal election . The party has to resolve this issue . If it does n't , then frankly , we wo n't win . <p> LEIGH SALES : But if Julia Gillard were a strong leader , would n't these questions of leadership dissipate whether Kevin Rudd were there or not ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : Well , it 's easy to say that . The reality is of course that she 's in a minority government situation . She does n't have the numbers in her own right . She has to rely on a number of independents . She 's in a politically difficult situation where Tony Abbott continually seeks to bring down the Government . And I do n't believe she 's been given as much support in terms of the political position that she 's in that she 's entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday , and I do n't apologise for that . <p> LEIGH SALES : Does n't Kevin Rudd have a right to defend his record as Prime Minister , especially given the way he was removed ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : Yes , and he did . When he retired as Prime Minister , he did that . And everybody knows that doing it again after 12 months is not helpful to anybody . Look , I understand the pain that Kevin 's gone through , but let me say this : the reality is that the impasse about the leadership has n't changed . And that will continue a year on . Who does that benefit ? It simply means that Tony Abbott will be the next prime minister of Australia . He wo n't win the election , we 'll lose it . Now , I do n't wan na see that happen . I want to see the issues , the passion that the Labor Party has to implement reforms in government . I want to see that continue , which is why I wrote what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's primary vote in the latest Nielsen poll is 27 per cent , the lowest for any Federal Government in 40 years . Would n't a by-election in Kevin Rudd 's seat be potentially catastrophic ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : What I basically said was that he should consider appearing on the backbench and then an exit at an appropriate time . That 's what I suggested . Timing is of the essence here . You have to remember there are two years to the next election . The carbon tax , the details of that hopefully will be finalised in a relatively short period of time , and I believe that that issue can be turned around . If the Federal Government talks about what is needed in energy , what is going to happen in the world in terms of the energy mix , then I believe that political dynamic can change . <p> LEIGH SALES : There 've been reports that you 're looking for a Queensland seat in the federal Parliament . Is there any truth to that ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : Yeah , Leigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age . I think that 's a little bit too old to make a political comeback . And , as I said , there would be a funeral if that happened ; it would be mine - I think my wife would murder me . Look , I have no interest in going back into politics and I am not interested in anything from the party other than for the party to perform , other than for the party to win . You know , I have children . I want to see the future of Australia in the safest possible hands and I wan na see the future of Australia guaranteed . And I worry that we 're failing . We 're not doing enough in terms of clean coal , we 're trying to destroy the carbon tax argument for cheap political reasons . The future of Australia deserves more than this . That 's why I said what I did . <p> LEIGH SALES : On federal Labor 's handling of policy issues , was it a good idea to announce the Malaysia Solution without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always believe in politics that it 's better to have as much detail available before you make an announcement . I do n't want to get into each one of these issues because my point is basically when you come to explaining things in a political environment which is volatile , and volatile because we 've got a minority government , it is more difficult than when you 've got a majority government . And I had a minority government for some time ; I know how difficult it is . And I had a really intelligent independent who supported me who was actually interested in the well-being of the state rather than just grandstanding . <p> LEIGH SALES : But is the Malaysia Solution compatible with Labor values ? As a long-term member of the party , are you comfortable , for example , with children being sent to detention in Malaysia ? <p> PETER BEATTIE : Oh , look , no , of course I 'm not , and I 'm not gon na hide that . But , frankly , you 've got ta understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the ugly politics that are being played on this . I mean , frankly , if we could get a more bipartisan approach towards these sorts of issues , we 'd end up with better solutions . What I 'm trying to say to you very simply is this : Julia Gillard has operated under extraordinarily difficult circumstances over the last year . In a minority government , in a very , if you like , difficult political circumstances . Under those - in that situation , it is very difficult to get policy as clear as it should be . 
@@4196233 <h> World 's First Baseload Solar Farm Now Operating <p> One of the anti-solar arguments often used is solar farms ca n't produce electricity at night or in very low light conditions .

@@4196234 <h> Revolutionary wing gives potential lift to sinking shipping industry <p> By Damien Brown ( Producer ) <p> With rising fuel costs hitting our hip pocket and the impacts of global warming dominating the daily news a Tasmanian ship builder has decided to tackle these issues head on and hopes to revolutionise the world 's passenger ferry industry at the same time . <p> The new design has already been on the drawing board for more than a decade and looks likely to be Incat chairman Bob Clifford 's final legacy . <p> The new design , which is in concept stage , places passengers and cargo in a wing shaped structure lifted by a column of air and sitting on top of a propulsion system . <p> The engine jets the vessel to around 70 knots , or around 130 kilometres per hour . <p> Once the vessel reaches that speed , the wing lifts the structure out of the water leaving just five per cent of the ship in the water with estimates showing it then only uses a fraction of the current fuel amounts burnt by Mr Clifford 's already fuel efficient catamarans . <p> Mr Clifford says unlike other sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high speeds or hit windy or rough conditions , his wing design slows down once the propulsion system leaves the water essentially slowing it down and steadying it . <p> With such a small section of the vessel left in the water , Mr Clifford estimates fuel usage can be cut by 75 per cent . <p> He says a conventional ship also pushes ' 30,000 tonnes of water from its bow compared to the wing design pushing just 5000 tonnes or less . <p> " Once we have refined it , the wing will be able to carry 200 passengers all sitting facing forward looking out the window within the wing itself , " Mr Clifford says . <p> " The hull will be relatively small not unlike some flying boats of the past . <p> " I have already been working on this in excess of 10 years and I think we are making good progress at the moment and within five years we could very well have a small passenger version to try with economic testing with a customers , but it is probably another 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the design could revolutionise the industry . <p> " On a typical ship across Bass Strait a ship might be pushing 20,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes of water out of the way as it moves along the Strait , " he says . <p> " A ship that pushes only 5000 tonnes of water out of the way at the same speed will burn on a quarter the amount of the fuel , so light weight ships will come into their own . Not necessarily fast because you do n't have to go fast , you might have to go more moderate speeds to keep the fuel consumption down . <p> " But where the conventional ship may come down from 25 knots to even 15 knots to save fuel we 'll come down from 40 to 25 and we 're still faster , we 're still burning a lot less fuel than anybody else , so the fuel advantages are very high . <p> " I can see the industry , and this applies to us and a few competitors , have a huge opportunity ahead of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very busy in the future . " <p> Following the Global Financial Crisis , the shipping industry all but sank according to Mr Clifford . <p> However , as a ban on ships that burn heavy black crude oil is slowly coming in to many major sea routes around the world , ships that run on cleaner diesel fuels and liquefied natural gas , such as the Incat catamarans , will be more in demand . <p> " It is not happening instantly in one place , it is happening around England , the Baltic , around North America , the fuel regulations are tightening up significantly and will continue tightening up . <p> " It means travelling the oceans of the world using this crude , tar-like substances fuels ... will no longer exist , and they will from now on have to be burning high quality distillate fuel , gas or some other other form of fuel that is environmentally friendly . <p> " Fortunately for us , our ships have been burning high quality fuel already , so we have suddenly had an increase in market potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel as well . <p> " That in itself is going to create a very big market .

@@4196237 <h> Conroy denies Optus pressured over NBN <p> Communications Minister Stephen Conroy talks to the ABC 's Chris Uhlmann about what the $11 billion deal with Telstra means for the NBN . <h> Transcript <p> LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : A short time ago , Chris Uhlmann spoke with the Communications Minister Stephen Conroy . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN , REPORTER : Stephen Conroy , welcome to 7.30 . <p> STEPHEN CONROY , COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER : Good to be with you again . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : How can rebuilding a government telecommunications monopoly make it cheaper for consumers ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well the great failing when Howard privatised Telstra was that he left it as a virtually integrated monopoly . According to the OECD , according to the ACCC , we have the most concentrated telecommunications market in the country . Telstra currently has not just the fixed-line monopoly , the copper monopoly , it has the largest share of mobile phones , it has the largest share of broadband users and it 's a 50 per cent owner of the cable and the Foxtel company . So this is the most concentrated telco in the world . <p> So we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need to create an open access , wholesale network . And if you wanted to do it on the basis of equal pricing , uniform national pricing across the country , you needed to have a government-built monopoly delivering that open access wholesale network . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : And certainly what you did today though was to kill off all competition at a wholesale level . <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well I think you saw today was Telstra recognise that this is ultimately in the best interests of its shareholders . And Optus , equally , recognise that trying to compete against a fibre optic alternative with HFC , a slightly inferior technology , was ultimately going to be defeating for their shareholders . And so they took the decision to enter into a financial agreement . There 's been some speculation that we forced Optus ; it 's just not the case . Optus made a hard business judgment . They did n't wan na compete with HFC against fibre . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Will there be any unexpected costs for householders ? <p> STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a free service . We 'll knock on your door , we 'll say , " We 've come to install . " You can choose to say , " We do n't want to take the NBN fibre service . We 're going wireless . " But what people need to remember is that we 're cutting the copper . Telstra today have agreed to close down their copper network and that means that the only fixed-line alternative will be NBN 's fibre line to the home . So people can say no , but , if you want a fixed line , it 's NBN . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : This is really the only way NBN could fly , was n't it ? Without doing the deal with Telstra , it was n't gon na work ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well , the McKinsey study suggested that we could still make a return and we could still run the company , but it also did say a deal with Telstra was the best option . And that 's what 's taken a year to finalise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the best outcome . We 've got a win-win-win here . We got a win for Telstra shareholders , we 've got a win for NBN Co and we got a win for taxpayers . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Are there any risks to taxpayers from here on ? What if you do n't get the corporate finance that you need for this ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well , look , we believe , based on the NBN Cos business plan which has been looked at by Goldman Sachs , it 's been looked at by Caliburns , that we 'll be able to raise the funds . This goes cash flow positive in about the seventh or eighth year . And from that point on , they 'll be able to - NBN Co will be able to raise corporate funds and wo n't need the government support anymore . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Can you be certain that it will meet marks like that though ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Absolutely . We believe the corporate plan was absolutely a robust document . Caliburns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and they said that it was of the quality a top 50 company in Australia . That was the quality of the business plan that 's been put forward . And the directors of NBN Co are some of the sharpest minds in Australia . If you look at that board , you 'll see some of the sharpest financial , legal and business minds in Australia on that board . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Now there is an out clause in the contract , though , is n't there , so the Coalition could undo it by say August 2013 if it wanted to ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well , Tony Abbott has said from day one - he tasked Malcolm Turnbull with the job of demolishing the NBN . And Malcolm Turnbull has taken to that task with relish . But what the Opposition have to put to the Australian people at the next election in two years ' time is that they have an alternate plan . And so far we 've seen 18 failed broadband plans in the 11 and a half years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lead-up to enjoying the last election , and Malcolm Turnbull has flip-flopped around from a wireless plan - he was going wireless a few months ago , today he 's fibre-to-the-node , tomorrow he 'll probably be Alan Jones ' laser beams . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Is n't the problem that his Government has had though with delivery ? How can you be certain that you 'll hit the marks that you need to hit in delivering this network ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Look , let 's be clear : we have hired professional expertise . Mike Quigley is one of the top telco executives in the world . And he has got around him some of the brightest telco experts in the country . You 've seen a hard argument about our building costs . You saw NBN Co suspend the contract because they were n't satisfied they were getting value for money . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : And still not settled . <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well they 've got the Silcar deal , which covers 40 per cent of Australia , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the rest of the build . But we 've got the Silcar agreement , it 's on budget , it 's inside the business plan and we are confident that we 'll meet our business plan . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : So you 'll meet those marks like 35,000 active homes by the middle of this year , was n't it ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well we obviously had a decision by the ACCC . I mean , the business plan was put out prior to the ACCC making its decision about the points of interconnect , or POIs as it 's referred to . And what that did was set back the architecture . We had to go NBN and redesign some of the architecture . And so that slowed us up by three or four months . Then we 've seen it takes slightly longer , about three months longer than we would 've liked , to reach a final agreement with Telstra . But it was worth those three months to get it right . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Stephen Conroy , it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Party make the right decision ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Well , Julia Gillard has led the Government and she is doing a fantastic job in very , very difficult circumstances . You 've got a relentlessly negative Opposition who vote against policies that they actually espoused in government , that vote against sound public policies . You 've got all sorts of challenges in both international , as you 've seen just today ; we 've got the Afghanistan announcement , we 've got Greece on the verge possibly of default . You 've got a whole range of circumstances that 's required cool , steely nerve . And Julia Gillard is delivering that in spades . <p> CHRIS UHLMANN : Will the Labor Party hold its nerve ? Will she still be Prime Minister come the next election ? <p> STEPHEN CONROY : Absolutely . She is absolutely focused on ensuring that we get the Budget through , on ensuring that we continue to deliver the 200,000 jobs that we 're talking about , we protected Australians during the Global Financial Crisis . 200,000 Australians have jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be focused on the big issues . We 'll put to bed the climate debate , we 'll put to bed the mining tax , we 'll continue to rollout the NBN and we 'll resolve the refugee issue.And those are the big ticket issues this government needs to get finalised .

Naturally , until Apple makes an official announcement , we 'd take most of these with a grain of salt . That said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a lot to get excited about . <h> Apple iPhone 5 : when is it coming out ? <p> Apple is expected to make a new product announcement at the company 's annual press event in September this year .

Available in August ? It sounds unlikely . <p> An iPhone 5 announcement is imminent , according to the rumour mill . <p> It 's worth noting that all previous iPhones have been released in either June or July ( with the exception of the white iPhone 4 , which came out in April ) .

@@4196240 <p> Premise : As a collectible card game series , Magic the Gathering is known by many gamers and card game players alike as being one of the longest running and most successful card-game franchises to date . Since first release in 1993 , the game has expanded and grown into a hugely successful franchise spanning over dozens of series and generations of cards . As a result of both the intellectual challenge that the game offers , as well as the sophisticated art style applied to each individual card , Magic the Gathering ( or MtG ) is typically viewed amongst gamers as the collectible card game for adults . Unlike card game series such as Pok ? mon or Yu Gi Oh , which have had their popularity bolstered thanks to anime and cartoon adaptations , for many years , MtG has been able to stand out on its own . However , as a popular series , it too has spawned a line of novels , comic books and video game adaptations for fans to embroil themselves in . Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is the latest installment in the video game series that has attempted to capture the core gameplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time however , the game has also presented players with a few new gameplay innovations that might very well change some of the future multiplayer aspects of the series . Attempting to innovate while staying true to the roots of what made the series popular is a daunting task for any game series . The question is , has it been able to strike that fine balance ? <p> Story/Campaign : Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is the second game in the ' DotP ' series to be released on the Xbox Live Arcade , Steam and the Playstation Network . For a game based around battling collectible trading cards , one would not typically approach a game such as this with any strong expectations of story . What has been presented however is pleasantly surprising . After building up a legacy of 18 years , there is much Magic the Gathering lore that has been developed over that time . However , very little of this lore is actually explored in the card game rendition . The introduction of a small story element to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe in which Magic the Gathering takes place . <p> The world of Magic the Gathering is actually comprised of multiple worlds or dimensions . These worlds are all distinct in their own individual ways , but all share some common features , such as all adhering to the same magical and physical laws of the universe . Each world is set in a medieval era and setting , where warriors and monsters roam the lands , and the only real justice is that enacted by the strong over the weak . These different worlds are known as " Planes " . These planes are usually named after specific generations or series of the card-game , such as " Zendikar " and " Mirrodin " . Generally , the different planes do n't interact directly with each other , except through a select few who have the ability to traverse space and travel between these worlds . They are known as ' Planeswalkers ' , hence the title . In addition to the ability to traverse these different realms , Planeswalkers are also masters of the elements , able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further their own personal goals . In essence , the Planeswalkers are basically the players of the card game . <p> The story of the campaign mode begins from the moment the game is begun , told from the perspective of a Planeswalker named Gideon . Gideon recounts how his own actions is his own world had almost led to its complete destruction . Using his ability to traverse the other worlds , he encounters other Planeswalkers who share his abilities and powers , events which he describes as a " reckoning " . Learning from his battles , he has resolved to " fight the very tyrant he had become " , describing the rise of a Dragon that also happens to be a planeswalker . However , despite all of his own power and knowledge , Gideon has so far been unable to best the Dragon Planeswalker named Nicol Bolas . As a last ditch effort to save his world , Gideon summons the other Planeswalkers he had previously faced into his own plane seeking their aid . " Gather your allies " is the tagline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all during the opening cinematic . Unfortunately in playing the game itself , the story essentially dies off , as no other cinematics or plot points show up in areas other than the loading screens . Even then , the loading screens only detail information about the pasts of some of the Planeswalkers involved in the story of wider MtG lore . While this attempt at adding plot to the game certainly educates players in regards to the nature of the MtG universe , it could have been better executed . If new story elements were to arise during the game , or after beating certain levels or challenges , I believe there could have been even greater potential for players to explore the MtG universe . However , that said , the fact that some background information has been provided at all is a step up from the previous Duels of the Planeswalkers game . In the end , the story is not the most crucial element of a card game , but I do feel that perhaps a little more could have been explored . <p> Gameplay : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-electronic game should be to capture the essence of the core gameplay features within the game itself . To do so with a largely popular series like Magic the Gathering , the gameplay must also be well structured and flow well for the players . As is the case with the real physical card game , there are specific rules that have to be adhered to , or else the game will fall apart . <p> Fans of the card game series will be happy to note that the game does adhere to the conventional rules of the card game series very closely . In fact in some ways , the video game rendition is structurally better than playing the physical game . In a real life game of MtG , there are instances in which players may accidentally or intentionally deviate from the rules , thereby throwing off the pace of the game due to human error . Something as simple as forgetting to draw a card at the beginning of a turn can end up being a huge disadvantage . When playing the video game rendition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HUD , and the game will only progress in ways that adhere to the official rulebook . <p> For those unfamiliar with playing collectible card games such as this , never fear , a HIGHLY helpful tutorial mode is made available at the very beginning of the game for players who wish to run through the finer points and rules of the game . The tutorial introduces players not only to the different types and functions of cards , but also to the proper rules and progression of each player turn . By allowing the player to interact in the tutorial , players are more likely to grasp rules and concepts far better than if they were just lectured to them in a video or text block . <p> Aside from the tutorial , the game features a variety of single and multiplayer game types to choose from . One of the features I found great about the game was the use of AI controlled opponents . While for most games this features would be a necessity , one must remember that it takes at least 2 players to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need at least 2 people . However , in the video game rendition , players are able to play through against computer controlled opponents . This makes the game widely appealing to gamers and fans of the MtG series who are in the mood to play a quick card game without the need to go and find a second player with equal skills and knowledge of the Magic the Gathering card game . The different game modes also feature some of the newer new Magic the Gathering innovations . The main innovation in gameplay is a game mode called ' Archenemy ' , a game type only released last year , so not many players are yet familiar with this mode . This game basically pits 3 players against 1 , where the lone player has expanded health , and a variety of event cards to give them a huge advantage over the stock standard group . This is essentially your " boss battle " scenario . Additionally , the game also has added up to 4 player free for all , in addition to the standard 1v1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 2009 rendition . Each of these game types can be played locally or online . <p> The gameplay mechanics themselves are based around a turn-based play system in which 2-4 players duel each other , either in a free for all match , a 1 on 1 , or in various multiplayer variants . The general purpose of the game is to defeat your enemy player without being beaten yourself . Finding a creative battle strategy , or a balance between offense and defense will often tip the tides of a battle . The specific rules of the MtG card game are far too numerous to mention in a simple review , but here 's an abridged version for those of you who might be interested in seeing what all the fuss is about . In a standard match , two players begin the game with 20 health each . The purpose of the game is to find a way to defeat your opponent . This can be done in one of several ways . The first , and most common way to achieve victory , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is achieved by summoning creatures to the battlefield to attack the enemy player , or through the use of offensive spells . However , one might opt for a more creative strategy by making the opponent player run out of usable cards in their deck , or by poisoning the player with 10 poison tokens . <p> It should be noted that there are hundreds of cards available for use in the game , although it is probably worth noting what types players are likely to expect . The first and most basic sets of cards are the land cards . By playing land cards , players obtain mana to summon creatures and spells , and use abilities . There are five different types of land which correspond with the five different colors of the game . <p> The Plains , which charge White mana . White cards users typically focus on building a strong defense , and using buff spells to augment their creatures . <p> The Mountains , which charge Red mana . Red card users often opt for fast paced attacks with creatures , and will often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the need for creature combat . Perfect for those who favor rush tactics . <p> The Islands , which charge Blue mana . Blue card users tend to utilize spells which target the technical aspects of the MtG card game itself , often by using un-summoning techniques , and by stopping enemy players using spells altogether . <p> The Forests , which charge Green mana . Green card users typically play by summoning the really REALLY big creatures and damage deals , while also bolstering their own health and mana pools . <p> The Swamps , which charge Black mana . Black card users are notorious for using instant death techniques , and health draining abilities . They also have an affinity for dealing damage to players indirectly , and being able to bring fallen creatures back from the grave . <p> Each of these different color types has at least one deck built around that single color alone . For players that are just starting the game , they will notice that only two of the color decks : Green and White , are available to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more advanced cards to bolster their decks as they duel and defeat enemy Planeswalkers throughout the campaign . It should be noted though that no player is restricted to using only the one color . In fact more than half of the decks are a combination of two colors . Many people who play the real game are likely to be thankful for the variety , but a little bit disappointed if there are no decks which specifically match their play style . <p> For instance , as a player of the physical MtG game myself , I tend to favor using a combination of Red and Green cards , with my strongest decks featuring Dragons , and the mighty Eldrazzi beings . However , there is no combination deck that caters to that exact fancy . This brings up the only real major criticism I have to the gameplay . This is not so much in regards to the gameplay itself , but rather the so-called " customization feature " . The game advertises that deck customization is possible in the game , but this only accounts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific deck . And each deck only features around 16 extra unlockable cards to use . In a deck that already features 60 cards , a player would be stupid not to use those 16 . By automatically adding the extra cards to the player deck , offering " deck customization " becomes pretty redundant . <p> Now , there is no question that attempting to program the mechanics of the thousands of magic cards in existence would have required a lot of time and hard drive space to achieve . It is unreasonable to think that every card ever could be included to allow every tactic style in an electronic rendition of a long running card game series . However , if players were provided with the option to create their own decks from the cards available in the video game already , I believe this would have been a greatly welcomed feature by fans . The nature of collectible card games is the ability to discover and trade cards with one another to help bolster one 's own decks through customization . Adding such a feature would greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online multiplayer , so gamers can show off their play style to others . However , by restricting the customization to be deck specific , it waters down the experience to a degree . This does not , however , make the game unplayable by any means , but one is certainly able to see how this particular omission deviates the video game rendition from the possibilities of the real life game . <p> Graphics and Sound:The graphics utilized in this title are admittedly not a central focal point . However , as an XBLA title , I do have to admit that the design of the card battlefields are quite clever . For playing something as simple as a card game , the layout of the HUD makes it feels like something far more epic . The addition of combat sounds and animations to combat steps during play also puts forward an effective immersive illusion that makes the player feels that they are battling with actual creatures and spells as opposed to just simple trading cards . <p> What is also worth mentioning is the artwork of the cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video game , but of the card game . One of the reasons for MtG 's popularity is the artwork style of the card themselves . Each type of card has a unique scene pictured of creatures , spells or events which have been drawn and signed off by professional artists . The art style itself is also quite consistent among each card , always providing a feel of darkness and a readiness battle . <p> The sound effects of the game are pretty standard fare , with a myriad of card sounds and battle effects to compliment the animation . What 's worth noting is the background music . It is able to change depending on the game type being played , or the opponent being faced . Each time however , the pace of the music is quite slow , often featuring a rhythmical beat which is not overly stimulating to the senses . The purpose of choosing a lyric-less slow paced soundtrack provides a sense of deep thought that is to be undertaken . MtG is an intellectual game , and as such , thought is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this notion . <p> Conclusion : Magic the Gathering -- Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is most certainly a welcome addition to the Xbox Live Arcade , Steam and PSN . For fans of the card game , such as myself , you will find much to like in this new rendition of a long running legacy . I often make a personal point of trying not to hold games that are reviewed to the candles of other games . Each should be able to stand out on its own . However , I feel that the developer should have looked at the customization issue a little longer . It was the major criticism of the first game , and it has n't really been altered or addressed in the second installment . Game companies should , fundamentally , learn from past errors and correct them in future installments . However , as it stands , DotP 2012 stands up on its own very well , even without the advanced customization feature . Regardless of whether you 're a fan of the card game itself , or just looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is definitely worth a go .

" I 've built up a really good friendship and opening partnership with Simon over the last two years and I 've had a lot of fun batting with him , " Watson told AFP . <p> Katich , 35 , who had been extremely consistent in the years leading up to his axing , had called the decision " absolutely ridiculous " , an outburst which Ponting said was justified . <p> With 2928 runs at 50.48 since he was recalled to the Test team in 2008 , Katich has been not only Australia 's most reliable batsman but among the most bankable in the world . In that time only Alastair Cook has scored more runs . <p> Watson had formed a productive opening partnership with Katich in the last couple of years , adding 1523 runs in 28 innings at an average of 54.39 . He felt that Katich could have gone on for some more time instead of being forced out . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of good cricket still in him . Being an opening partnership you do become a lot closer because you are taking on the best bowlers in the world together and you need a mate out there to be able to help you out . " <p> Katich 's axing is the latest move by Australa 's selection panel in a bid to rebuild the side following a home Ashes loss and a World Cup quarter-final exit . Watson was earlier appointed deputy to new captain Michael Clarke as Ponting stepped down after the World Cup exit . <p> Stastics speak better than the commentators , selectors and others . Let us all accept that Katich has been one of the top test batsman in the world for last few years and deserves to be in the team . I am sure he can perform well for another two years .

I think Cummins has a huge future ( if fit ) , but I 'd like to know why he got a contract ? Why ca n't cric Oz have rookie contracts like the States ? That means that a Katich would n't have to make way for a Cummins or more appropriately a Maddinson ! Also with a greater workload across 3 formats - surely 25 contracts which originated over 10 years ago ( well before T20 ) , should n't the central contracts be raised to 30 ? I 'd like to see 22 test/1st class , 3 ODIs , 2 T20 &amp; 3 Rookie contracts being the make up of the 30 central contracts . <p> hyclass on July 1 , 2011 , 4:52 GMT <p> @tomhedley and @Blake Houston , feel free to watch the youtube videos on those Sth African innings ... Hughes 115 vs Sth Africa and Hughes 160 vs Sth Africa . You will see him before Nielsen got hold of him.This attack has the worlds best bowler , with a test strike rate of 39-that compares highly with most greats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a combined 1100 test wickets.These guys do nt need 5 days to work a batsman out-not even a session-its their profession and they are among the best ever at it.You will wonder what the criticism of this then 20 year old is all about.He scores all around the wicket off any length.Like all batsmen , he has greater areas of scoring strength , but the idea that he has only one shot is exposed as incorrect in these pre-Nielsen videos.Nielsen had Watson to open in his original Ashes blueprint.He said as much.Hughes was so good in Sth Africa and in the county lead up to the 09 tour , that he ruined Hughes game to justify Watsons inclusion . <p> tomhedley on July 1 , 2011 , 1:13 GMT <p> One last thing , how does Hughes feel when Watson and Ponting have publicly stated that Katich should still be there ? Shambles ! <p> tomhedley on July 1 , 2011 , 0:32 GMT <p> @all Australians . My main point really is do any of you think Australia will be a stronger side with Hughes rather than Katich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , get rid of the old guys then you must be mad ! This is International Sport , domestic cricket and A tours are for promising youngsters ! <p> tomhedley on July 1 , 2011 , 0:15 GMT <p> @Kaze , maybe you should read that 20/20 article as well ! You 're going to another decade when he looked exciting and got dropped , then had his technique changed for the worse ! He 's a walking wicket and could do with a few years of piling up the runs in state cricket , is that unfair ? How can you drop Katich for him now , it 's crazy ! Your comparison with Steve Waugh is ridiculous , I do n't see Hughes bowling much and batting 7 . If Hughes stops playing the short ball he 'll start leaving long hops outside off stump , that might be an issue for him ! <p> Kaze on June 30 , 2011 , 16:10 GMT <p> @tomhedley Go ask Dale Steyn and co. how badly Hughes plays . Hughes is flawed but he s young and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your point . With your line of thinking Steve Waugh would never have played test cricket again after he got dropped . And if you did n't know , Steve Waugh had problems with the short ball early in his career too . <p> RightArmEverything on June 30 , 2011 , 12:43 GMT <p> Bring back Dirk Wellham , Ray Bright and Len Pascoe . <p> tomhedley on June 30 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> @hyclass . I 've read it and I sympathise with him , unfortunately it looks like you 've ruined an exciting player , possibly terminally . My comments were only facts about how the kid plays now , hopefully he can turn it round but he should be making a shed load of runs for NSW rather than taking Katich 's place in the Test team . <p> tomhedley on June 30 , 2011 , 8:30 GMT <p> @hyclass , I 'll find it and have a read , I trust you , you sound like you know what you 're talking about . <p> on June 30 , 2011 , 7:00 GMT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly right about his shots , he only has 1 good shot , which is the cut shot . @ charlzy , mate dave hussey is 33 , not 35 and Brett Lee well he 's a star performer , but it was really unfair to give Lee , Ponting and Hussey contracts and not give Katich one . Its because Katich only plays tests that he is less needed . The reasons to drop katich were stupid , given his great performances in last 3 years . Good luck Australia , if ur not going to pick your best XI players to take the field what chance do u have of winning ? <p> charlzy33 on June 30 , 2011 , 7:00 GMT <p> @Meety Sorry i was making a statement for test cricket , his a top one day bowler , wouldnt count on him being there for 2015 world cup though so still does n't deserve a contract in my opinion . His stats in test cricket do look good , but for a decade he bowled along side Mcgrath and Warne , the batsmen had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wickets . After the retirement of Mcgrath and Warne when he spearheaded our attack he showed that he does n't trouble quality batsmen just cleans up the tail . <p> Meety on June 30 , 2011 , 5:29 GMT <p> @charlzy33 - no problems with your opinion except " ... Brett Lee , a bowler retired from test cricket and not that good a bowler anyway ... " Mate he is arguably the greatest ODI bowler of ALL TIME . Check his stats . The fastest bowler to 300 ODI wickets - that took 15 matches LESS then Waqar &amp; 29 LESS then McGrath . NOBODY on the list of all time ODI wicket takers has a better S/R then what Lee currently has . Bond over a very short career ( games wise ) , has an identical S/R . Under that scenario - keeping a player who is capable of performing very well in both short formats of the game out of a contract list of 25 is not a big stretch ! BTW - Lee 's test record is superior to J Anderson &amp; Z Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 of the best pace bowlers in the world ( Steyn is on a whole other plain ) . <p> on June 30 , 2011 , 4:53 GMT <p> The delusional decisions from CA continue .

I think Chappel brother really do n't like old player and want all australian and indian old palyers to be retired as soon as possible . <p> Average of 50 in last 2 years is great when australia is losing and they did not give contract to their best batsman in bad time . Its not moving forward , it like killing the system it self . <p> hyclass on June 30 , 2011 , 4:36 GMT <p> With respect to your views on Hughes @tomhedley , i suggest that you read the article , ' T20 could kill tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light.It quotes D'Costa , Clarkes mentor , talking about what happened to Hughes in 2009 . Its the first time ive seen anyone stating they 'd talked with the people involved and knew what happened.Up to playing for australia before the 2009 Ashes , Hughes as an opener had faced short pitched bowling every game without any difficulty.He had nine hundreds on 3 continents including 2 in one test against an attack with 1100 test wickets.Only one explanation fits all the facts and his sudden change of fortunes.Hughes was ordered , BEFORE the 2009 Ashes , to change the way he plays , because Nielsen wanted a text book opener like Watson and because he had an Ashes blueprint excluding Hughes.He said as much.At 20 , Hughes was ruined by trying to change his style for a coaches whim.The humiliation this 22 year old was left to deal with should be Nielsens . <p> on June 30 , 2011 , 3:06 GMT <p> The Aussie selectors have tried to make a statement and assert their authroity by sacking Katich all in the name of " moving forward " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been out of the team with injury ( and who does not play the shorter formats ) The same thing happended to Damien Martyn after the 2005 ashes loss- they picked a soft target to take the blame , even when others performed worse than Martyn . If Katich is to go , then so must Hussey and Ponting . Clarke has been around long enough and the selectors should have faith in him to mentor newcomers . But they know that he is not up to the task , so feel the need to keep Hussey and Ponting. ( by the way , I believe aust Cricket needs all three for at least the next 12-18 months but thats just my opinion ) Australian Cricket needs men in charge who are not afraid to make the harsh decisions when needed and will stop puissy footing around . <p> hyclass on June 30 , 2011 , 3:04 GMT <p> The evidence overwhelmingy supports those indian supporters regarding Chappell.In recent times , for australia , his comments have included:the Shield should not be concentrating on silverware by keeping experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of australias ' fall from grace.He also named Warner as a possible test player and is somehow a selector and ' talent spotter ' . He changed the Centre of Excellence and the Futures League and badly weakened both , decisions on the latter being revoked by a review committee.He has shown an obsession with youth that is entirely unsupported by results.His insidious presence has badly undermined australian cricket already and he must be removed.For supporters of Shaun Marsh , his record suggests , that if he plays test cricket , we can expect a hundred every 10 games and a fifty every 3 games-that games , not innings-averaging in the mid 30s at a strike rate in the mid 40s.Nowhere near Katich.How many tests will that win us ? <p> charlzy33 on June 30 , 2011 , 2:51 GMT <p> Cutting a 35 year old opening batsmen when we have decent opening batsmen options at first class cricket would n't be such a terrible decision if Brett Lee , a bowler retired from test cricket and not that good a bowler anyway and David Hussey , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the selectors are focussing too much on one day and 20/20 cricket instead of test cricket . <p> farkin on June 30 , 2011 , 2:46 GMT <p> Hilditch got Chappel in so they could dump him " Katich " and for hilditch to keep his job longer <p> tomhedley on June 30 , 2011 , 2:12 GMT <p> All you can do is laugh at the Australian selectors , struggling team drops most successful batsman ! As an Englishman I feel sorry for Katich but happy that he wont be playing against us again , easily the biggest Australian wicket in the past couple of years . Now every fast bowler will be quaking in their boots at the prospect of Phil Hughes not being able to play the short ball , not being able to drive , fending at things outside off and being unable to play off his hip !

It 's a catch-22 situation : - ) <p> Nerk on June 29 , 2011 , 23:26 GMT <p> Katich has never been one of the selectors favourites . The only reason he got into the team is by sheer weight of runs . Hell , he even had to move states to try and push himself into the eyes of national selectors . So it was no surprise when he was dropped despite his wonderful form over the last couple of years . Some players who shall reamian nameless *cough CLark *cough* *cough* Ponting *cough* Johnson will have more patience from selectors soley because they are liked by the selectors . To be fair though , the selectors have brought in S.Marsh , who is very Katich like in temperament and style and can no doubt do a wonderful job for Australia . <p> Kaze on June 29 , 2011 , 17:51 GMT <p> Why are all these Indians commenting on Ponting and Chappel are they that insecure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson .

And both of those things are contradictory to the spirit of the convention and we think they are unnecessary and should n't be in there . <p> I think I heard one of my successors CDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that oh yes but they 're very unlikely that they would ever want to do that . Well I would hope it is very unlikely . But if it is unlikely and we do n't want them to do it then the provision should n't be in our legislation . <p> PETER MARES : What are the attitudes of serving military officers to this bill ? I mean is the Government acting on the advice of the armed forces in going down this route do you think ? <p> PETER GRATION : Opinions are mixed . On one side there are those who see the tactical advantage of using these weapons who are very concerned where they are continuing to be interoperable with the Americans . And that tends to make them want the legislation to be loose . <p> But there are others who are concerned with the thrust of what we Australia , the course we started off in 2008 which is to get rid of these weapons for all time and concerned that the way we are drafting the legislation now sends a couple of messages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are more concerned with our relations with the United States and secondly the example it may set to other countries around the world watching what we do . <p> PETER MARES : And are these weapons , I mean is this a hypothetical issue or is Australia currently involved in military operations with the United States where cluster bombs are used for example in Afghanistan ? <p> PETER GRATION : Yeah the answer is yes . <p> PETER MARES : And so if the bill were changed in the way you 'd like to see and made stronger , what would that mean for Australia 's operations with the US in Afghanistan ? <p> PETER GRATION : Well I do n't believe there would be any significant effect at all . <p> What it does mean is that Australians who may be , using a current word , embedded in American headquarters or involved in planning would not be able to participate in planning for the use of the cluster bomb . <p> Similarly Australian forces could not call for American support using cluster bombs . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at all .

@@4251239 <h> The full story ... <h> How stolen masterworks were recovered <p> MARK COLVIN : Late in July 1994 , thieves broke in to an art gallery in the German city of Frankfurt . Two of the three masterpieces they got away with were late works by the great British painter JMW Turner . They were on loan from London 's Tate Gallery and between them they were worth 24 million pounds . <p> What followed was an eight-and-a-half year hunt across Europe to find and retrieve the two Turners . The man who coordinated it for the Tate was the gallery 's director of programmes , Sandy Nairne , and he 's written a book about it Art Theft - The Case of the Stolen Turners . <p> Far from the glamorous world of films like the Thomas Crown Affair , he makes it clear that it 's a murky business of organised crime with links to drugs and arms smuggling . And since the gallery ended up having to pay some of their insurance money to get the pictures , back , it 's a legally and morally ambiguous world too . <p> During a long and fascinating interview which you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored those issues with me and told me the story . This extract begins with the recovery , six years on , of the first picture . <p> SANDY NAIRNE : By 2000 we managed to , eventually after a lot of toing and froing get the first painting back but only one of them . And then there was ? <p> MARK COLVIN : Only one ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Only one came in 2000 and we then , I thought that we might get the second one maybe six months later but we had five different occasions between 2000 , when we got the first and 2002 , five different occasions on which we were fully operational , we were ready to exchange the fee for information . <p> We , on a couple of occasions I had a van in southern Germany in Frankfurt ready to pick up the second painting because of course you do n't want to be giving a fee and find you 've got a 12 million pound painting in your hands and you do n't know where to put it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a very new world , a very different world on the other hand I supposed I 'd say there 's a lot of parallels with what one does in museums because you have to do a lot of things very discreetly in a museum anyway , you have to deal with a lot of negotiation , you have to keep a lot of confidences , you have to persuade people of things so maybe it 's a parallel world of some kind . <p> MARK COLVIN : In some ways I 'm wondering why you wrote a book and not a film script ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Well there have of course been film scripts and one of things that I get to in the book in the second half , is of course the fact that this is an area surrounded by the kind of mythology of film . I mean none of us can think about art theft without thinking of the Thomas Crown Affair or thinking back to , I do n't know , earlier films like Topkapi and Rififi . <p> MARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a whole tradition and of course that tradition is actually in some ways rather unhelpful because it has these very particular stereotypes . The sort of debonair art thieves and this notion that sort of you know , hidden criminal collectors of art . So the whole field is ? <p> MARK COLVIN : Yes criminal , crime fiction is full of shadowy figures in their castles or their hideaways ordering up Rembrandts . <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Exactly so the difficulty about my story is that because it 's true it does n't have as much flair perhaps as what people think it should have and it does n't have the debonair characters perhaps . <p> MARK COLVIN : There 's no equivalent of Raffles the gentlemen thief ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : No there certainly is n't . I mean I did have a fabulous investigator Jurek Rokoszynski , known as Rocky . He was an incredible character who helped , I mean he was the really crucial part of getting the recovery to work . <p> I mean he did the negotiations with the solicitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , I mean who knows whether there is a film element to it , but I just felt that a book that is straightforwardly told this story was important . <p> Because of course nobody , everybody is very cautious about talking about high-value art theft and one can understand why . People do n't want to discuss it and yet it goes on , I mean not all the time luckily but it does happen and I felt that it was really important to try and tell the story . <p> MARK COLVIN : So how did you get the second one back ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Well after we had these five failed attempts in which in each case you know there was misinformation or people got nervous or disturbed or worried about the police being too close or things being in the wrong place eventually , eventually in December 2000 , by this point I was also having to actually negotiate with my investigator Rocky had retired from the metropolitan police , was actually enjoying having a great time doing freelance sailing work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Burgs ( phonetic ) in Frankfurt as to when the painting might arrive I was also negotiating with Rocky who was offshore the northern coast of New Zealand so I had to fly him back from New Zealand to get him at exactly the right time to help make sure we could recover the painting appropriately . <p> In the second case as in the first I actually had with me the senior Tate conservator Roy Perry because as you can imagine one of the great fears for me was that I would organise a fee for information , we 'd all be there a canvas would turn up but what if it was n't the Turner ? What if there had been enough time for criminals to make a copy ? So I had to have with me somebody who could absolutely with total certainty say this is the real thing . This is the real Turner painting . <p> MARK COLVIN : And so how did you make that exchange ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : We knew of a particular hotel in Germany in Frankfurt where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the trunk out of the boot of the car . Go up in a lift frankly avoiding the lobby area and go straight up to an upper level of rooms and we 'd hired a room . <p> And that room was known to our contact and our solicitor collaborator came in with a canvas bag and brought it out of the canvas bag and there it was and it was an astonishing moment . I knew of course that it was the Turner . Although I formally had to get Roy to examine it very carefully against the conservation records and the photographs . <p> MARK COLVIN : It was undamaged ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Unbelievably . It was undamaged . Well perhaps not unbelievably because I think the criminals whoever had these paintings they knew what they were worth , they knew that these two pictures started being worth 24 million and probably worth somewhere between 35 million and 40 million by the time they came back . <p> MARK COLVIN : We 've already established that these people were not gentlemen crooks or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen paintings ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : It 's very difficult to piece it all together and I can only , even in my , this book I 've done , can only be a partial account and I 'm not an expert either as a criminologist or as an expert in criminality more widely but what one senses is two things . <p> One is that as there 's been a greater clamping down on money laundering and the movement of cash around the world for very , very good reasons at the same time it has caused , I think criminals to look for other means to transfer value illicitly in criminal terms . <p> And I think what one senses with paintings like this there can be a kind of knocking down to maybe 10 per cent of the value so that they were worth 24 million in real terms , they might be exchanged in criminal terms to 2.4 million . And actually what they means ? <p> MARK COLVIN : So they become a sort of form of currency ? <p> SANDY NAIRNE : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency but I always thought sadly the frames which were Turner 's original frames were lost , we never got the frames back , but I always thought it was quite significant that if you took as they did , somebody did , you could then fit the two pictures very , very neatly in the boot of a Mercedes and that 's a pretty neat way of moving even 2.4 million of criminal currency or criminal collateral , it is a pretty neat way of doing it . And the fact that they came back undamaged , unscratched meant that people , whoever had them , knew . <p> I think the other factor can be a certain kind of chutzpah and this is through analysing other high-value art thefts that for certain criminals there can be a real kind of chutzpah element about having done this and being able to claim and flaunt even the fact that they 've done it to other criminals . <p> MARK COLVIN : Sandy Nairne , then director of programmes at the Tate Gallery , now director of Britain 's National Portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you can listen to or download a 25-minute version of that interview on our website from this evening . 
@@4251240 <h> Sexual Video Games Are Good For Us <p> Recently , I curated an exhibit at Brooklyn 's Babycastles arcade , currently housed in a Williamsburg show space where indie games are on display in hand-made cabinets , alongside a lineup of bands . <p> I picked sexual games ; even what some would call deviant games . <p> I wanted people to understand something very special about games ' power of expression , even if I had to push their comfort zones to do it . <p> I chose two games from renowned indie designer Anna Anthropy . She sought to articulate the gruelling and emotional nature of BDSM relationships through the cruel old-school arcade dynamics and bondage themes of Lesbian Spider Queens of Mars and Mighty Jill Off . I picked Beautiful Escape : Dungeoneer , a fascinating narrative-driven title about a fetishistic serial killer ; I selected Hey , Baby , a game designed as a statement against street harassment , a game which fulfils the fantasy of women literally armed against sexual predators . <p> Finally , I chose a Japanese sex game about gender-bending , called Yin Yang : X-Change Alternative . I thought that it 'd be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the exhibit 's pieces . Much to my surprise and joy , it was popular among curious attendees . <p> Instead of passing by the arcade cabinets on their way to watch the bands , guests to Babycastles demonstrated a fascinating willingness to ask questions about and try all the games . They were wildly enthusiastic and demonstrative . I gave so many tours my voice went hoarse , and I felt a strange and bizarre sort of pride that folks who were quite literally your average man and woman from off the street were curious and excited to see what kinds of statements games could make about identity , relationships and sexuality . <p> Babycastles : Bad Bitches , as I titled the exhibit ( named after the Kreayshawn track ? ? ? Gucci Gucci ' ) was n't meant to be especially heavy or deep . What I most wanted to do was invite mainstream players to participate in the conjunction of silly , strange and deeply personal that games that deal with issues of gender , sex and subculture can create . I was pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> *** <p> Some of the earliest writing I ever did on games was in this little column at GameSetWatch I called " The Aberrant Gamer " In it , I aimed to focus on all the little bits of undiscovered deviance I saw in games that , to my mind , no one seemed to notice . At the time I consumed all kinds of games blogs voraciously , but most things I read focused on things I did n't need to be told and that I had never really longed to be told . <p> You 've had that feeling , have n't you ? Lots of times , do n't you read reviews of games you 've already played just to see if they agree with you ? Sometimes , do n't you read game articles just to identify yourself in them ? And that 's fun and all , but here 's the thing . For a long time in my teens , my favourite thing about video games -- the weirder and more obscure the better -- was that there were so many rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frame 2 look just a little bit too comfortable with each other , or when Silent Hill 2 's convoluted symbolism pointed to male sexual frustration and resentment . And no one was writing about that . <p> It 's not that I was a huge deviant or anything ; no more than teen girls generally are , especially those of us who were growing up alongside the internet . Today 's teens are desensitised as a rule , and they will never know what it felt like to " log on " to the din of a garbled , hissing modem-dial and have an entirely unfamiliar world of images and cultures open up like a foreign country , ready for the visiting . <p> Nowadays , the web can still surprise you . There are people who have taken escapism to an extreme . There are people who have devoted themselves rather intimately to the fictions of The Legend of Zelda , Harry Potter , Pokemon , and Final Fantasy VII . You would n't think there was much to chew on there as far as " sexual deviance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alchemically , prized and archived it ( the fruits of their labors are not hard to find online , if you 're feeling adventurous ) . <p> Even if you 're not into that kind of thing yourself , it 's a little bit fascinating , is n't it ? What is it that people find within these simplistic worlds to get aroused by , to fall in love with and to fetishise ? It 's strange to us , yet perfectly natural to fans of those subterranean channels . <p> The idea that video games in particular lend themselves to unusual cultural sideroads has fascinated me since I was young , almost from the time I figured out what fanfiction was . Some of that sensation of foreign encounter , of unfamiliar curiosity , could have been chalked up to the cultural divide between ( at the time dominant ) Japanese versus Western games : We faced symbolism with odd archetypal yet unfamiliar roots , the sort of things that led pretty twins to hug a little too tight or that meant upskirt shots were par for the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wanted articles that were n't about gameplay features , but that analysed subtext ; I wanted writers to say , " hey , maybe I 'm not sure what this means , but this is strange , is n't it ? Why does this game look like this , why does it feel like this ? " <p> Unable to find others with theories about , for example , the female protagonist in Haunting Ground , I just started writing those kinds of things myself . I would n't even claim I wrote all that well at the time . If I found an audience , it was probably because I 'd wildly underestimated the volume of folks who were poking around in offbeat video games , recognising the same archetypes , wondering the same things I wondered . <p> If I 'd been a man , perhaps the Aberrant Gamer column would n't have been so successful . Maybe if I had n't been a young woman , people might have called me a creepster , might have wondered why I spent so much time exploring games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build bridges from the underbelly of one culture to another . Might have wondered why I 'd go to the trouble of seeking out and installing the " UnDress " patch on the child-raising sim Princess Maker 2 . Would they have ? <p> I do n't have answers to those questions , even years later . But I know that the column was enormously successful . Called out of hiding , hundreds of people mailed me , visited my blog , shared my curiosity about games ' ability to explore sexuality , identity , all of mankind 's kept secrets . And we still love these kinds of things : to grab a recent example , Atlus ' Catherine is the cause of much anticipation , drums up much hope and curiosity among you , only on the promise of prettily-presented adult sexual complexity . <p> Among " us " , I should say , because we do n't lose that appetite for weirdness . We 're interested in sexuality . We want more of it , because with psychological and social complexity comes the promise of adulthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomprehensible clues we 've been chewing all along . <p> Maybe interactive entertainment has an ability you and I do n't have : To articulate strange things , deviant things , the moth's-wing flutters of our secrets , our sexuality , our emotions . Maybe we notice strangeness , and we want to hear somebody else say it , we want to hear somebody else explain it , because the game has done so well at touching parts of us that we do n't have words for . <p> I 've since realised something : What I wanted , in those times , when I was digging around for those flavours of the unfamiliar that I called " aberrant , " was proof that video games could speak to human identity , all the private spectral shades thereof . I hoped that they could help us glimpse compelling inner worlds of others through psychology , sociology , inter-relationships , sexuality . That 's why I wrote that column back then . <p> And games about romance and sexual identity -- the less-familiar the better -- are still so appealing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death are the two constants of human life , then given how many games we have exploring murder and death , I want to see them evaluating all kinds of avenues for sexual expression , too . <p> The Bad Bitches exhibit runs for the next few weeks at Babycastles ' 285 Kent location in Williamsburg , Brooklyn ( official info here ) . Hopefully you can come check it out . And if you ca n't , next time you notice unusual subtext in the games you love , rest assured : You have friends who are trying to find ways to talk about it . By being interactive -- a conversation between creator and player , a dance between expression and interaction -- video games can communicate primal things about human identity that no other medium can . <p> Leigh Alexander is editor-at-large for Gamasutra , author of the Sexy Videogameland blog , and freelances reviews and criticism to a wide variety of outlets .

It has all the heart , drama , dynamics and humanity he , presumably , recently attempted with At Any Cost ? , but which he and co-writer Mohammed Khadra succeeded in drowning at birth , by way of the most patronising , didactic approach and offensive economic rationalist imperative . <p> This is , in so many ways , a near-to-perfect theatrical experience from , as it were , the bottom-up . The writing is acute , even if its trademark device of unfinished sentences is overly exploited to the brink of annoyance . The cosy Stables stage has been deployed optimally , better than ever , by Griffin Theatre Company artistic director Sam Strong and designer Victoria Lamb . <p> Practically every centimetre has been utilised , and ingeniously , too : a doorframe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other rooms , other parts of a house , home and lives ; intimacies and secrets accumulated over a lifetime , just as ice cream-makers and fondue sets consume the garage space . <p> A gauze curtain and Verity Hampson 's precise lighting design hides a 50s vintage back room behind the lonely deathbed , making for an expansive , wholistic set , a veritable suburban home away from home . And the subtle fades of lights calibrate the undulations of mood beautifully . This is award-worthy craft indeed . <p> And what about the craft on stage in this double-hander , featuring Linda Cropper and Russ Kiefel ? It 's superb . Well , ok , my partner had a point when she said she could " see the script " during some tracts from Kiefel , but this might be because it 's early in the season and he fears a " moment " .

It 's a truly great play . A tough one ( it 's no stage version of a chick-flick , I assure you ) . A tear-jerking one ( you should 've heard the sobs , seen the tissues and down-turned mouths , and that was probably just the guys ) . Almost a momentous one .

It is n't based on the average of the actual fares bought , because the airlines keep them confidential , but on a weighted by size of route assessment of trends in published best discount economy , restricted economy , full economy and business class between Australian cities .

It needs to induce travellers to trust it with their lives , but if it continues to sell at deeply discounted fares to do this the Singaporean owners of Tiger Airways will see their investment plunge even more deeply into loss . <p> If you have a look at the BITRE website you will see that both of those large falls in the Full Economy ( Feb 2008 ) and Restricted Economy ( Jun 2011 ) fare indices were actually caused by changes in fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copied the footnotes off the BITRE website below : <p> " June 2011 change to Restricted Economy index : In June 2011 both Virgin Australia and Jetstar introduced simplified fare structures .

She is right to advocate for those who have suffered from inept and bungled adoptions , and unfairly secretive donor and surrogate conceptions . But we live in an age enabled by technology , and we must learn to manage these previously unimagined possibilities . <p> Adoption , for example , was based on a myth that still dogs us -- the myth of the correct and perfect conception . Young women who conceived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegally ) blackmailed into surrendering their babies . The recipients of this wrongly conceived child were deemed to be the more suitable parents . To maintain the myth of their correct parenthood , many denied that their adopted children were not their biological children . Many deceptions in official and unofficial adoptions have been bizarre such as grandparents raising a child and maintaining that the mother was the child 's sister . Or a woman returning to the family after a short absence , having never been pregnant , and declaring that she has " had a baby " . <p> The maintenance of an ongoing falsehood meant that some adopted children became enraged adults who felt their identity had been falsely concocted and then shattered . <p> So how does this inform us in today 's brave new world of donated eggs , sperms and wombs ? <p> It is not merely a selfish sense of entitlement that drives the desire to have a child . The yearning for family and belonging is profound and exists across cultures . <p> In today 's more enlightened times we no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charade of a false marriage in order to conceive . Just yesterday federal Finance Minister Penny Wong announced that she and her partner were expecting their first child with little fanfare . We are far more enabling of single parenthood and do not force young women into institutions and to remain hidden until the birth of their child . <p> So where does this leave us regarding IVF and donor conception ? Honesty and access to information seem to be the key . It can be right to allow another to raise one 's child . Some people are unwilling or inadequate parents . But our judgment of what constitutes the " right kind " has been clouded by narrow 19th century thinking . <p> Many women and men may find themselves without a partner or without the possibility of unaided conception . So are we to consider that only " natural conception " is right ? How many children might be denied a beautiful life if we insist on this notion of a " right conception " . <p> In my counselling work with adoptees , relinquishing mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly brought home to me that the rights of the child are best served in an open , honest loving home , supported by an accepting community . This can occur whether parents are partnered , single , gay or straight . <h> 53 comments <p> I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by Maggie Miller . It is very simply a case of giving all the rights to the person desiring a child and none to the child itself.I am sure we all want things that for reasons , both fair and unfair reasons , we can not have . People need to treat their desire for children in the same manner.As long as we continue to make everyones personal wishes come true by any possible means in this regard , we should expect problems . Was n't it just this week an article about a bitter breakup between a lesbian couple and the problems on the birth certificate between the sperm donor and the lesbians and who has what rights ? Are n't we just creating more complications ? What if the child grows up , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state for denying them access to a father or for gay fathers , a mother ? <p> What gives anybody the ' right ' to ignore another persons ' rights ' to fulfill a personal desire ? When will we accept that we can not have everything we want and especially so when it means ignoring the ' rights ' of another human being . It is not simply an issue about the desire of a gay couple to have a child , or 2 , or 6 children , it is about the children 's rights and the sperm donors rights and how much more complicated it all becomes for our society . <p> Commenter <p> Vanessa <p> Location <p> WA <p> Date and time <p> August 10 , 2011 , 8:51AM <p> You have to be very careful drawing comparisons in this debate : if you think about it , Sabiha 's child would have grown up in the same village as her ' donor father ' and had thus a much better chance of working out who her father was , coming to terms with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

If life is so meaningless without having them , then life will be an intolerable burden placed on them . <p> Commenter <p> Evangelina <p> Location <p> Sydney <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vanessa , <p> Nonsensical assertion that children could grow up and sue the state for " denying them access to a father " . Under what law ? Under what precedent ? Even though you would clearly love to arrange society in neat , heterosexual pairings for life , you can not guarantee any child , under any circumstances , access to both of their parents . Thing is , parents can die . They can walk out and never come back . And if they stay , there 's still no guarantee that they wo n't be abusive or neglectful . <p> In short , you ca n't guarantee a kid any better of a deal with their biological parents than with adoptive parents . Actually , it usually goes the other way around , as adoptive parents are screened so carefully , and tend to be better educated , older and wealthier than the parents giving children up for adoption . Not to mention the most obvious factor , which is that the adoptive parents desperately want a child whereas the biological parents do not . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , so that puts paid to your notion that the kids would get " access to a father " if they were n't adopted . <p> But really , all my arguments probably do n't amount to squat with you , because you 're dead against the notion that gay couples should be allowed to raise children .

@@4276231 <p> But over the last decade , Google has been one of the biggest -- and most successful -- acquirers in the tech industry , and owes a lot of its success to these smart buys . Its core search advertising platform and most of its biggest new businesses , including Android , YouTube , and display advertising , all come from other companies . <p> Here 's Google 's top 16 acquisitions by value and show what happened to them . <p> #16 : Android mobile platform , " up to " $US50 million ( estimated ) Last October , Google M&amp;A chief David Lawee called the 2005 acquisition of Android -- the mobile phone platform started by ex-Danger leader Andy Rubin -- its " best deal ever " . Less than three years after launch , it has become the most popular smartphone platform in the world . <p> #15 : Aardvark social search , $US50 million Google paid about $US50 million for social search Q&amp;A service Aardvark in February 2010 , but has n't really done much with it yet . However , there are hints in Google+ code that suggest that Aardvark -- or what 's left of it -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> #14 : Jambool social payment platform , $US70 million Google bought this mobile-payment platform in August 2010 . Onlookers assumed it would be part of Google 's social networking efforts . In fact , the team was put to work on in-app payments , and earlier this month Google said it would shut down the Jambool Social Gold service in May , and replace it with its own in-app payment system . <p> #13 : Invite Media ad platform , $US81 million Google bought this ad technology company last June , making its 24-year-old founder Nat Turner a young millionaire . Invite is a demand-side platform ( DSP ) , which helps ad buyers place their wares on ad exchanges , and has n't yet been integrated into Google 's other ad-buying products . Google recently wrote a blog post explaining when advertisers should use Invite versus the Google Display Network . <p> #12 : Feedburner RSS tools , $US100 million In June 2007 , Google paid $US100 million for this company , which creates tools for advertisers and users to manage RSS feeds . It 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake of Twitter -- which is now run by former Feedburner founder Dick Costolo . <p> #11 : Like.com visual search , $US100 million+ Google bought this visual search company last summer , and put the team to work building a search vertical for women 's fashion called Boutiques.com . <p> #9 ( tie ) : Applied Semantics , $US102 million David Lawee may think Android is Google 's best acquisition , but from a pure ROI perspective it 's hard to beat Applied Semantics , which built AdSense -- the paid search advertising platform that 's still responsible for most of Google 's revenue and profits . <p> #9 ( tie ) : dMarc automated radio ad placement , $US102 million This one was a mistake : in 2006 , Google paid $US102 million for this platform for automatic placement of radio ads , and offered a whopping guarantee of up to $US1.1 billion based on performance . But the business never took off , and Google shut the program down in mid-2009 . <p> #8 : On2 video compression , $US133 million Google tried to buy this video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a higher price and eventually got $US133 million in January 2010 . Last year , Google announced it would open-source the VP8 video codec it acquired with On2 , and rename it WebM . Google has since tried to push WebM as a replacement for H.264 , a much more widely used standard for web video . <p> #7 : Slide social gaming , $US228 million ( estimated ) Google bought the social gaming company behind SuperPoke last August for $US228 million ( the price was originally reported at $US182 million ) . Slide still operates as a separate entity within Google , and does n't seem to be contributing much to Google+ , the company 's new social networking initiative . Instead , it 's out there creating standalone mobile products like photo-sharing app Photovine . <p> #6 : Admeld , real-time bidding exchange for online advertising , $US400 million ( if regulators let it go through ) Google announced plans to buy Admeld in June to boost its display advertising business . Regulators announced last month that they 're taking a close look at the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- regulators also took a second look at ITA and DoubleClick , and both of those deals eventually closed . <p> #5 : Postini email security and services , $US625 million Google bought this company in June 2007 and integrated its add-on email services , like spam-blocking and archiving , into Gmail for business users . It 's been a critical part of Google 's enterprise apps business ever since . <p> #4 : ITA travel service , $US700 million Google made a $US700 million bid for ITA , which compiles flight information for airlines , travel agencies -- and rival search engines . The bid garnered complaints from competitors who rely on ITA 's service , but the feds eventually approved it with conditions . <p> #3 : AdMob mobile advertising , $US750 million Android is all about increasing mobile search usage today , but Google hopes to make mobile advertising in general into a huge business . That 's why it paid $US750 million for AdMob in November 2009 . Since then , however , AdMob execs have left -- including former CEO Omar Hamoui ( pictured here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going so well . <p> #2 : YouTube video sharing site , $US1.65 billion It looks like a no-brainer now , but when Google bought the video-sharing service in 2009 , it was a huge risk : YouTube was full of copyrighted content that users uploaded without permission , and faced potentially billions in lawsuits . Google skillfully negotiated contracts with content owners and instituted a reasonable takedown policy , and as a result YouTube has thrived -- analysts estimate it 's now profitable and earns more than $US1 billion a year . This year , Google is increasing headcount by 30 per cent and is hiring tons of new ad sales people . <p> #1 : DoubleClick display ad technology , $US3.1 billion The 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick launched Google into the display advertising business . It 's been a mixed bag . Google boasts that it 's making $US2.5 billion a year from display , but about $US1 billion of that is from YouTube .

They do spend allot of money on patent lawsuits , and many have struck deals with Microsoft and apple , agreeing to pay royalties . However , the use of android os can cut the cost of developing a smart phone by up to 90% , and as they are sold at the same price as the other smart phones , it leaves an incredible amount of room to pay the royalties , and still make a large profit . <p> Google 's an advertising company .

@@4276239 <p> Of course , the recession was famous not only for sparking a huge monetary crisis around the world -- it was also an opportunity for filmmakers , writers , and scholars to comment on the American situation and way of life . In the crop of post-GFC films , there are resonating themes of the value of money versus . the importance of family , reminders that the career is n't everything , and questions of the capitalist society in which the States exists within . <p> The Company Men is yet another one of these recession-inspired films , with an impressive cast including Ben Affleck , Chris Cooper , Kevin Costner , and Tommy Lee Jones . With such a stellar lineup and such a relevant issue , it would be safe to assume the film is brilliant -- even Oscar-worthy , like Jason Reitman 's 2009 flick , Up in the Air . However , assumptions can often be wrong : The Company Men is an attempt to gaze into the middle-class working home , but the gaze is narrow-minded , clich ? d , and at parts , it 's just plain dull . <p> Plot <p> The plot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cutting jobs after the 2010 recession hit them hard , and as a result Bobby Walker ( Ben Affleck ) is terminated from his position . Bobby tries to find another job , expecting it to be easy ; however , he is greeted with stacks of long lines of people waiting for queues , and full rooms of recently terminated employees chanting " I can do it " . Soon , Bobby is left with no job and no redundancy package ; his wife goes back to work part-time in order to support the family , but it is n't enough to maintain their expensive lifestyle . When Bobby 's brother-in-law offers him a job at his construction company , he reluctantly takes it in order to feed his family . <p> Ben Affleck looking slightly pensive . <p> At the same time , Phil Woodward ( Chris Cooper ) is dealing with the fact that his job is on the line at GTX , and Gene McClary , one of the executives , is struggling not only with the company 's dramas but at having to terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mediocre : typical suburban family 's life gets turned upside down , but in doing so realises there is more to life than just a job . It 's clich ? because it 's so relatable and we 've seen it all before on the news and in the movies -- and sure , it 's a great insight into the world of the shattered American dream , but I just did n't enjoy watching yet another one of these films . There was no unique spark to it ; rather , the film chugged on and on like a broken record . <p> If there is something to be praised upon in The Company Men 's narrative , though , it is the fact that it shows three different perspectives of the recession : the employee who has been terminated , the one who worries about termination , and the employer who has to deal with letting people go . To be able to see all the sides means it is a very well-rounded film in terms of presenting points of view , and is definitely better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Characters <p> The main characters in the film are Bobby Walker , Phil Woodward , and Gene McClary ( Tommy Lee Jones ) . All three were ( or are ) involved with GTX Corporation , and all have been affected by the circumstances . Affleck gives a solid portrayal of Walker as a man who is hit hard by his circumstance and eventually has a change of attitude ; you can see the pain and resignation in his face when he realises he may never get his old life back . With that being said , his character is still too cookie-cutter for my liking and Wells just did n't push the development far enough so Walker ends up being someone that is too forgettable . Cooper 's character , Phil Woodward , is equally as cookie cutter ; however , this guy does n't evoke sympathy so much as he made me want to give him a good hard smack on the face . Instead of being a strong character that takes his situation and does what he can , he hopelessly tries to hide in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of those who are terrified of termination , but he really did n't inspire any emotion in me and , to be quite frank , the narrative would have been fine without him . <p> Tommy Lee Jones as Gene McClary . <p> Hands down , in The Company Men , the shining performance was delivered by Tommy Lee Jones . His character was one that was more complex than the rest , and he shed light on the rather elusive position of the boss that actually has a human side . While many were getting frustrated with their bosses during the GFC , McClary is a rare peek at how painful life can often be for those who are higher up on the corporate ladder . <p> The other characters do not feature too much in the film , however what did frustrate me was how passive all the wives of these men were . True , their husbands pull in a six-figure salary , but the women seem too much like housewives to be really considered as a part of the mid-to-upper class family . Where Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look into the struggles of a working family , he instead opted to keep the women passive and present a very one-sided portrayal in terms of gender . <p> Audio/Visual <p> Visually , the film is not innovative but it certainly does get the point across : a slightly blue filter accentuates the film 's depressing notes at the beginning of the narrative , and shots are largely all close-ups so the anguish on everyone 's faces is visible . The homes are chosen for their ability to portray the luxurious lifestyle these men lead , and sweeping shots show expensive sports cars at every angle . In short , the film 's visuals do exactly what they 're supposed to do , and for that Wells ca n't be faulted . The film would n't have worked with any other style or form of editing , so it 's good that in this respect , Wells hit the mark . <p> Bobby Walker ... obviously getting terminated . <p> The soundtrack is uplifting -- perfect for a story that seeks to restore a bit of faith in spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . There 's not too much else to say , as no tracks stood out , but overall it was a complementary film to the narrative . <p> DVD Extras <p> The DVD comes with plenty of extras , as you would expect from a film with many big names . There 's audio commentary from Wells , a " Making of The Company Men " segment , the theatrical trailer , some deleted scenes , and -- surprise , surprise -- an alternate ending . <p> Yes , you most certainly do get your money 's worth from this DVD . The best part of all , though , is the alternate ending -- we all wonder what films would have turned out like if there was a different ending , and Wells has given us exactly that . This set of extras is about as in-depth as a film could possibly get , and the director 's commentary is always a great way to hear a little bit about the vision behind the film . <p> Final Comments <p> While The Company Men is n't a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells played it far too safe , and while playing it safe means you ca n't fail , it also means it 's very difficult for people to remember your film . Tommy Lee Jones ' performance was one of the standout moments in the film , but with a clich ? d storyline , stereotypical characters , and no real visual elements to make it stand out , The Company Men is a film that you 'll watch and eventually forget . 
@@4276240 <p> Imagine a Sylvester Stallone alike screaming that , dressed as Rambo , firing a machine gun and bazooka simultaneously whilst marching round a battlefield laying into some pesky communists . Do I even need to carry on with this review ? <p> The follow up to 2010 's highly successful Toy Soldiers ( the review of which can be found here ) , Toy Soldiers : Cold War is at its core a tower defence game , with a few unique traits and a good bucket of personality thrown in . Unlike its WW1 predecessor it takes a cold conflict and turns up the heat ; it 's Russia versus America , and it 's anything but subtle ! <p> Gameplay : <p> The main campaign has 10 levels , with one tutorial session . The plot sees you working against an ever escalating Russian threat , moving through different locales ( Europe , the Middle East , the US ) and defending them in the name of freedom and democracy . Not that the game places any emphasis on plot and politics -- as the developer 's website makes very clear -- you 're here to " BLOW EVERYTHING UP ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with 80 's style toys , in a kids bedroom , nothing deadly serious . <p> Enemies come at you in waves , which can be hurried on at your wish . Units can be placed only in particular areas , and as you collect cash from defeating enemies or destroying the environment you can upgrade to more deadly versions . Bosses crop up at the end of some levels , and instead of a tower you defend your toy box , so far , so tower defence . <p> What makes Toy Soldiers stand out is the ability to drop into the action and take control of your turrets . Standard units like the machine gun and anti-air unit are point and shoot affairs , with secondary fire options such as grenade launchers and an ever entertaining missile cam that let 's you make otherwise impossible longshots . Shoot enough of the flag carrying Russians in this mode and you earn yourself a barrage , essentially a power up ( the Rambo episode mentioned above comes courtesy of the Commando barrage ) . <p> In early levels you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you want to fend off the hordes in later levels or on harsher difficulties , you 're going to need to get in on the action and take over from the ( very good ) AI . Jumping into the units and controlling their fire yourself is the only way to earn those sometimes game changing barrages . <p> Also on hand are battery powered toys ; helicopters , jets and tanks that can bring you that extra fire power in times of crisis , or whenever you just feel like running over some infantry ! They are definitely the most powerful units available in the game , and do add another level of strategy as you can only use them for a certain length of time before having to let the battery recharge . They do create some of the games few problems -- it is very picky on landing helicopters to recharge , and do n't hope for any mid-air collisions between airborne units -- you 'll just pass straight through each other without so much as a sound effect . <p> The strategy element is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with certain units only fitting in to different sized areas , it 's usually fairly obvious what needs to go where . There are five difficulty levels on offer so there is sure to be something for everyone , no matter how savvy they are with tower defence . There are also plenty of things to keep you coming back after the main campaign is over , with each level boasting medals , decorations and challenges . <p> If you fancy more of a challenge there is also a survival mode to dive into , and it 's a great way to quickly crank up the difficulty -- the pace is much faster than the campaign on normal level and the extra pressure makes it a lot of fun . Tire of shooting all those Russians ? A handful of minigames are on offer too , mostly variations on target shooting but enjoyable and addictive all the same -- leaderboards are always an incentive to get better ! <p> Multiplayer : <p> Multiplayer is a two player versus match , giving you a chance to play as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American side as far as abilities go , but have different designs , and the Commando in particular is given a nice Russian twist . It does suffer from the same problem mentioned in Capsule Computers review of the first Toy Soldiers game -- if the 2 players are equally matched , you can be there for a very long time with not much happening . I found that the co-op options available actually made for more interesting gameplay than versus , as both players have full control options and earn their own money , so can often end up totally undermining each other 's gameplan . You can co-op any of the main modes , including survival . <p> Audio &amp; Visual : <p> For an XBLA game Toy Soldiers looks fantastic , the cartoon style follows the toy box theme without making it chilidish and the individual turrets are all easily identifiable in battle and highly detailed . The levels have a lot of detail that will probably go unappreciated unless you go flying into it with one of the battery charged units , and the menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep track of the medals you 've earned and your standings compared to your friends . <p> The music is perfectly suited to the tone of the game , all synthy American guitar rock on the menus and ' Victory ! ' Screens . The unit sound effects are realistic rather than cartoon like , a good decision that gives the weapons impact -- all the more important when you can actually fire them yourself . The army men who run your arsenal occasionally shout out entertaining snippets , and of course the Commando barrage is always entertaining . It 's just a shame there is n't more of this humour throughout the game . <p> Overall : <p> Minor nitpicks aside , Toy Soldiers : Cold War is a really enjoyable title . I went into it knowing very little of what I was in for , and found myself easily losing hours to the game . The action twist keeps the pace going and involves you more in the gameplay , cleverly distracting you from the fact your turrets are being blown to bits while you unleash hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearted tone is pitch perfect , although I do wish the developers had cranked up the humour a little . Expand the scale , throw in some well written cut scenes and Toy Soldiers could make an excellent fully fledged game ( it 's very easy to forget that it is actually an XBLA title ) .

@@4331238 <p> In the past five years or so , the Dragon Quest franchise as a whole has made quite a resurgence on the Nintendo DS . With last year 's release of Sentinels of the Starry Skies and 2011 's remake of Realms of Revelation , there is no doubt that this established RPG powerhouse has kept the DS off life support , and now Nintendo are looking to further the trend with the release of Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 . <p> If you are unfamiliar , the Dragon Quest Monsters series has been around for about 12 years now and works a bit like Pokemon . Players are sent throughout various locations , where they can " scout " ( instead of capture ) monsters and then train , breed and battle to build an ultimate team all while progressing through a small plotline . Joker 2 fits like a glove into the series as most of the same elements apply , but now with over 300 monsters to scout and synthesize and a ton of extra features packed in that are sure to make fans water at the mouth . So how well does this follow-up hold that legendary Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsters : Joker 2 . <p> Story In Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 , players take the role of a young hero who has big dreams to become a master monster scout . His ambitions are so big in fact that stows away on an airship that is headed to the world 's biggest competition for the sport . Things quickly turn chaotic for this mischievous hero though as the ship crashes onto a mysterious island and nearly every passenger is now missing . Given this situation , it is now your job to take control and become a one-man search party while coming face to face with the many ferocious beasts that roam the landscapes of the island . <p> As far as a RPG 's story goes , Joker 2 is rather light on characters and the usual bubbly atmosphere that we have seen so prominently displayed in the main Dragon Quest line of titles . That is n't a bad thing at all though , as this adventure still has several captivating quests that all are full of twists and turns around every corner . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passengers , there is n't a whole lot of character interaction , which is kind of a given . Thankfully , the small cast within make the most out of the situation as each run-in is memorable due to each NPC boasting larger-than-life personalities that make rescues and standard progression that much more rewarding . <p> The true stars of this title are not humans though , as this island is filled to the brim with monsters . Some of these creatures are as simple as a Slime , while other breeds consist of giant beasts that are truly intimidating based on their large stature alone . That is yet another beauty of this game though , as everything on the island is completely unknown and it is your job to uncover all of the secrets of this large and mysterious setting through exploration . This is yet another specialty of the series though and most fans will instantly cling to the age-old formula found within this installment as while things may feel more secluded , the " if it ai n't broke " approach utilized goes miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gameplay Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 features a varied amount of gameplay , with players needing to focus on several different elements at once to progress through . First and foremost , this title is all about recruiting a team of monsters to battle the many opponents on the island . If you have ever played the first Joker game , things work about the same as far as traveling goes as your character must complete a main objective before moving on to the next area . Moving your character is as simple as using the D-Pad and due to each monster being visible , players will never have to worry about random encounters as most of the world 's inhabitants can be easily avoided by simply walking around them . <p> At the start of the game , one randomly selected monster will be assigned to your team and you will then be fully ready begin scouting and battling monsters . Scouting is done by engaging any foe to battle , selecting the appropriate action , and then having your squad storm the potential party member with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doing damage ) . Once this goes into effect , a small meter will appear that displays the chance of success . The more powerful your overall team is , the better the success rate . Luck plays a huge role in this technique as well , as I have actually had successful captures with just a 9% chance of victory . Most players will soon learn that failing in this method is a common occurrence early on and if a scout is botched , the monster can easily take offense and gain an attack boost . If this happens , you will have no other choice but to either flee or defeat the enemy and try again at a later time . It can be a bit disheartening to fail with scouting , but I can easily say that each time I acquired a party member , it was an exciting moment that made all the grinding and stat-raising pay off ten fold . <p> The 300+ monsters in the game are broken down into eight separate groups known as " families " . These consist of slimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and separate each monster into their own specific category for synthesizing ( we will get to that in a moment ) . Every creature also possess their own unique skill set as well , with each set consisting of several abilities that can be earned by leveling up . Some of these abilities can be used in battle , while others supply boosts to HP , defense , or attack stats . While most battles are not mandatory , grinding is very prominent within and you will quickly learn that defeating nearly every foe that comes in your path is the best way to create a well rounded squad . Thankfully , I never found grinding in Joker 2 to be too overbearing or monotonous due to the large variety of monsters within as well as the in-depth customization that works wonders into keeping everything feeling fresh . While much of the roster is made up out of palette swaps , these advanced skill upgrading mechanics make each feel monster feel distinct and useful in their own unique way . <p> Battles themselves are pretty much the same turn-based fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series . Players can either assign specific orders and select a specific enemy to attack , or they can simply pre-set a party member 's tactics where healing , magic , offensive , or defensive maneuvers are automatically used . Each player has six slots available to place their current and substitute squad in as well , so if all three active party members faint , their backup will act as a full replacement . If a monster is in trouble or needs an item to enhance the odds of victory , the player can step in and use that item without taking away a turn from your team in battle . Monsters can also equip weaponry , which can increase attack points based on the item given . <p> While some items can be found scattered about the varied landscapes , a lot of goods can be easily purchased with the currency collected from battles . This is all done at the crashed airship at the start of the game . Along with a bank , players can utilize a vending machine in this home base to spend gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to an easy to use " Zoom " function , anytime more herbs or better upgrades are needed , you can quickly warp back to this destination and refill on supplies . As you progress further , this shop of sorts can be upgraded with machine parts , which in turn delivers new goods that can better protect your current party . <p> The biggest element of Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 is without a doubt synthesizing monsters . After a member of your team reaches level 10 , they automatically qualify to be mixed with another to create a much more powerful creature . Back at the airship , the lovable Dr. Lump is the guru on this , and any two monsters that meet the requirements can be combined at anytime the player desires . This feature not only opens up more breeds , but also enables players to continue evolving monsters until they are at the peak of their potential . These ultimate creations are so large that they take up 3 party slots at once , which is as rewarding and awesome as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of this though as each new monster starts off at level 1 . To assist in the grinding ( and to make you feel like all your time with the previous incarnation did n't just go to waste ) , parents can pass on traits and abilities to their spawn , which broadens the customization of each player 's recruits even more . <p> Sure there are a good number of quests to partake in , but scouts looking for that extra competition will be delighted to know that this island features it 's own Monster Scout Challenge , hosted by Don Mole . These challenges have the player take part in battles in waves of three with no scouting or switching permitted and can even progress the story once a round is completed . After each set , it 's always a good idea to go back and grind a bit more as well as these battles continue on by rank , with more powerful foes waiting right around the corner . <p> As you can probably tell by now , there is a lot of content and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to take in though , I never felt too overwhelmed as every feature compliments the next and blends into the quest driven gameplay with nearly perfect results . The menu system and map ( which is readily available on the bottom screen ) also keeps everything well organized and even a rookie to the series will feel right at home in a short time . <p> Online Much like it 's predecessor , Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 also has quite a few online features . Taking a page from Dragon Quest IX 's book , players can put their game in tag-mode and " tag " other owners of the game , enabling for the scouting of their prized monsters . Nintendo are set to enlist scouts to join up in weekly Wi-Fi tournaments as well , which will let players from all over the world test their squad 's battling capabilities . If you own either Dragon Quest IX or VI , you can also " tag " those titles as well and enlist and battle monsters from both games . I used this function quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout those primed opponents from the past , but you can also re-battle each and use the function as a tool for grinding . <p> Graphics/Audio It may be pretty late in the DS ' lifespan , but Joker 2 pushes the handheld to it 's limit with the large and detailed environments . Monsters also look fantastic as each are fully animated and can come off as either cute or menacing based on the design given . Fans of the series will also be pleased that the same art-style has been fully applied here with our spiny-haired protagonist and slimes fitting right in with the visual aesthetic that the Dragon Quest series is known for . Little features like weather changes and animated backdrops also go a long way to deliver some atmosphere to the island and make exploring even more enjoyable . <p> As far as music goes , this title treads closely to the same soundtrack stylings we have seen in just about every game from the franchise in the past . When a large beast is near , the music will also change quickly to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if anything will put you on the " edge " in this title , it is having that beat strike up when you least expect it . My only complaint with the music however is that there just is n't enough variation .

Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 lives up to this trend by smoothly blending several mechanics together to make one of meatiest experiences this year . Much like the Pokemon games , this title gives an unprecedented amount of customization and choice to make each player 's personal squad different from the next while giving a campy and fun little plot to partake in along the way . Now if you are not a fan of grinding , then this game really is n't for you . If you enjoy the rewards after labor though or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 is an absolute must for any DS collection and just feels like a fresh breath of air for the aging handheld .

If Mario does happen to wander behind some scenery , as he 'll often be enticed to do for hidden items and areas , his silhouette will be visible through it , showing where he is and what he 's doing . Think Super Mario Sunshine , without the pointless iris-in effect . We 'll have to trust the designers to not put anything too dangerous back there . <p> Elements of most Mario platformers are apparent , but its strongest influence is Super Mario Bros. 3 , arguably the pinnacle of the 2D Mario games .

Its reappearance was one of the first things the world learned about 3D Land , when it was revealed in the logo . Its use in the new game amounts to pretty much what it did in SMB3 -- use it to whap your enemies or coin boxes , or flutter it during a fall to slow your descent . In practise , it unfortunately now has little effect on your falling speed , reducing its usefulness somewhat . <p> Its most useful power in its last appearance was flight .

Screw the third instalments of Battlefield , Killzone and Modern Warfare -- this is my most anticipated title for the remainder of 2011 .

@@4345238 <p> Arkedo Studio has returned to the Playstation Network with the second installment of the highly successful Arkedo Series . Entitled SWAP ! , this puzzle game follows a binge drinking ( milk , that is ) cat on his quest to return to the grand castle through a series of colour matching puzzles , a far cry from their previous title , JUMP ! . This twin stick puzzle game is challenging but exciting . The speed of the game changes and offers a few modes of play . The visuals are colourful and bright , while the music , although not memorable , fits the game well . However , the game does suffer due to its over reliance to the simplicity of its game mechanic and the staples that puzzle games bring . <p> Gameplay The gameplay can be described in one sentence : four match puzzle game . The core mechanic revolves around that style of gameplay . It is a classic formula that has never tried throughout the ages ( Connect Four anyone ? ) . It is also twin stick , the face buttons have no input in this game . The left stick is used to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blocks in any of the four directions . The controls work well and are quite comfortable . With the added fact that the blocks can move as far as they can without any repercussion , the quest for those points can seem like a breeze , if you know what you are doing . Power-ups are present in the game , including temporary halt of the blocks , as well as coins and treasure chests to boost the score . Combos , a staple of puzzle games , are also present . <p> The modes on offer are more numerous than that of JUMP ! , but by only one . There is Castle Mode , which acts as the story mode of the game . King Kat , the protagonist , has had a night of binge milking and does n't remember the activities of the previous night . The story covers the journey home to his Castle , played out in five levels . These levels can be a challenge when the speed of the game increases to the higher levels . Then there is Arcade Mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective of collecting points before a game over . Then there are the Challengers . Each challenge has a set objective , like doing a combo or achieving a certain score . The challenges are unlocked after the completion of Castle Mode , to keep the players coming back for seconds . <p> The mechanic is reliant on simplicity . Being a downloadable title , this is understandable . Many downloadable titles have hit it big time by sticking to the basics . I will mention Limbo as a prime example . It is basically a 2D platformer at its core but its art direction , storytelling and complementing mechanics made it a very compelling game . However , with the four match puzzle genre , there has to be a certain degree of originality or creativity so that the player would n't turn it off and walk away . I do n't see it with SWAP ! . Yes , playing the game was fun , but only when speed was a factor . With JUMP ! , at least there was some sort of variation . Despite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Visuals and Music The visuals heavily differ from those of JUMP ! . While JUMP ! was based on the 8-bit era , the SWAP ! art style tends to focus on the cute factor . To be honest , this was done very well . King Kat has this simplistic design but still looks cute . His expressions during the game reminds me of the facial expressions in anime , which I did enjoy . I even glanced at them during gameplay . The blocks are colourful and easy to look at , which is good considering that is all you will e looking at . The menus are well designed and fit the overall art style . <p> The music is quite generic and unmemorable . However , it does fit well with the game and some of the tunes are easy on the ears . Each of the stage music complements the gameplay , despite its generic tone . So does the main menu theme . Its cutesy aswell , so it blends in with the overall art style . Just do n't expect any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . It was great but too generic . <p> Overall SWAP ! is a great game . The gameplay can be enjoyable and fun and the visuals are colourful and cutesy , fitting the overall tone of the game . The music is not bad but not memorable either . The problem is that the mechanic is basic and it can get boring if there is nothing happening . Its over-reliance on the simple mechanic restricts the game to cross new boundaries that other downloadable titles manage to do . Its lack of original spin on the genre will make it fade into the shadows of already established puzzle games . Despite that , it is a well-built game with the tendency to have fun at times found . The higher speeds of the game will provide a challenge , testing your nerves and skill .

As you 'd be aware , alcohol abuse is rife in Aboriginal communities - not just in the Territory of course , but all around the country . Not only do the new Territory laws make a licence mandatory , you have to produce an ID to buy takeaway alcohol too . Here 's Sara Everingham . <p> TED EGAN : It 's hot , and it 's become sort of customary to greet people with a handshake and here 's a stubby and let 's find time to talk . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM , REPORTER : It 's long been known there are few things Northern Territorians like more than a drink . It was Ted Egan the musician who went on to become the Northern Territory 's administrator who captured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EGAN : I always have to remind people that my song is not about excessive drinking , it 's about convivial drinking . And I do n't resile from the fact that I did write the song . <p> DENNIS GRAY , NATIONAL DRUG RESEARCH INSTITUTE , CURTIN UNI. : I think alcohol consumption in the Northern Territory 's about 50 per cent greater than it is in Australia as a whole . And along with that there are higher rates of alcohol-related crime and health problems . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM : The man in charge of Royal Darwin Hospital 's emergency department Dr Didier Palmer is on the frontline of dealing with the perils of alcohol abuse . During his 15 years working in the Northern Territory he 's seen many tragedies . <p> DIDIER PALMER , ROYAL DARWIN HOSPITAL : This week 's alcohol tragedy is a simple car accident where a young man , 24-year-old man T-boned another car . The 60-year-old passenger looked initially OK and turned out to have an intra-cerebral bleed , so he bled into his brain . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most visible , but the overconsumption of alcohol is not confined to that community . <p> DENNIS GRAY : A few years ago we did a study and it showed that if every Aboriginal person in the Territory were to stop drinking tomorrow , the Territory would still have significant alcohol-related problems . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM : The Territory Government estimates alcohol abuse costs $4,000 per adult - that 's four times the national figure . Now , the Northern Territory Government is trying to turn the problem around , with what it 's calling the toughest alcohols laws in the country . Rolled out three months ago , the laws mean anyone buying takeaway alcohol has to show photo ID , which is scanned to make sure banned drinkers are not served . <p> DELIA LAWRIE , NT MINISTER FOR ALCOHOL POLICY : We 've made it as quick and simple and easy as possible . It 's a seven second swipe at point of sale , and you can go on . But for the 1,500 Territorians today who are on the banned drinker register , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEADER : It is a misguided notion that people need to recognise alcohol as being the problem when they should recognise that personal responsibility is the key here . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM : At this small supermarket in Darwin , owner Carol Valles says at first the new measures inconvenienced some customers . She tells the story of a woman in her 80s who tried to use her birth certificate to buy a bottle of sherry . <p> CAROL VALLES , LIQUOR RETAILER : It was a 1928 birth certificate , but you can not use them ; you can only use a driver 's licence or some government ID . <p> TED EGAN : A lot of people are nothing short of appalled that someone raises queries about the community 's ability to handle alcohol , and most people say look at me , " Look at me : I 'm your exemplary drinker . " ... But I think it 's very important for all of us to examine where we are with alcohol and I do n't think it 's a bad idea at all to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinkers lists includes people who 've committed alcohol-related crimes or been caught for high range drink-driving . People taken into protective custody three times in three months also end up on the banned list . There 's also a special court for alcohol-related crime and a tribunal for reviewing cases . Both can order people into treatment . <p> DENNIS GRAY : We know that treatment for alcohol-related problems is effective , and if we can get people who are dependent on alcohol into treatment , I think that 's a positive thing . <p> DELIA LAWRIE : Early signs are good . Certainly our streets are quieter , our parks are quieter , our shopping centres are quieter . Early indication from police is that assaults have dropped about 15 per cent . <p> SARA EVERINGHAM : But police also say there is evidence some banned drinkers are finding ways around the laws and getting access to alcohol on the black market . <p> GRAHAME KELLY , ASST . COMMISSIONER , NT POLICE : If we can identify a person who 's supplying alcohol to people who are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the banned drinker register themselves . <p> DELIA LAWRIE : We 've dramatically increased the fines for sly grog sales up to $33,000 .

But even those who see alcohol as a social lubricant are also concerned about the serious problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big issue in frontier life and the NT is still largely a frontier .

@@4392235 <h> Without balance that paywall will not stand <p> As of Monday , The Australian online went behind a paywall . At the moment , you can sign up for a free " digital pass " that 's valid for three months , but after that , as the blurb says , they will " send you an offer " . <p> Presumably one you ca n't refuse . <p> I wrote last week that I 'm willing to support the paywalls major media organisations are establishing because I believe such organisations are the only way to ensure that the boring , routine journalism that democracy requires in order to function gets done . I received a lot of dissent about that opinion , none of which I found very convincing . But I 'll deal with those arguments another time . <p> For now , I just want to talk about the experience of using the Oz 's new paywall . <p> Inevitably there have been teething problems . The redesigned website has been a bit unstable for me , and in fact , for most of the first day , not only could n't I access articles - because they were behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up . I gather other people had the same problem . This seems to have been fixed . <p> Also , I download the iPad app and it would n't open . I emailed their support people and got a quick response suggesting I try deleting the app then reinstalling . They also suggested I make sure I was using the latest iPad operating system . I replied I 'd already tried deleting and reinstalling it and that I had the latest software . They wrote back and said I should reinstall the app and asked if I had the latest operating system . The same exchange happened again . Sigh . Still , someone then offered to ring me to see what they could do . In the end it was n't necessary : I deleted the app , rebooted the iPad , downloaded the app again , and it worked . <p> What I 'm still having an issue with is that when I swipe from section to section , it takes a few seconds for the new page to load . Yes , first-world problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age app . <p> More annoyingly , the very first news story I opened took me not to the story but to a full-page ad . I do n't mind ads , but please , not delivered like this . <p> Then there was the missing link on the website . I noticed their Media Diary section said that the full text of Laurie Oakes ' Andrew Olle lecture could be found on " p.27 " . Pretty funny , I thought : a website giving a page reference instead of a link . Inevitably , I mocked them about this on Twitter and one of their journalists kindly sent me the link . The problem was , when I clicked the link , the text of Oakes ' speech was behind the paywall . Um ? Why was The Australian charging for content they did n't own and that was freely available elsewhere ? <p> The same journalist , Nic Christensen , seeing my complaints about this on Twitter , fixed that too . <p> But all of this raises a serious issue about paywalls , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Requiring people to pay for content puts news organisations well and truly in the customer satisfaction business , and I doubt they are prepared for the demands that come with it . People are going to expect the technology to work and they are going to expect their opinions on content to be taken seriously . <p> Journalists are n't used to being retailers , but increasingly - especially for those who have a presence on social media - that is what they are going to become . <p> They are going to have to realise that , just like the shop assistants at Myer , they are now the public face of their company , so when their paying readers complain about stuff , they are going to have to overcome the journalists ' tendency to dismiss all criticism as the whining of partisan cranks , and actually deal with it politely and efficiently . Nobody should underestimate what a revolution this is . <p> News Ltd are obviously banking on the idea that The Australian produces enough quality journalism to generate enough subscriptions for the site to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not very , in my view , and at least part of the answer has to do with partisanship . <p> ... The Australian is ground zero for hardline , anti-Labor , so-called " campaigning " journalism , a position that has solidified since federal Labor came to power in 2007 . This editorial disposition has made them a laughing stock amongst at least half the market for serious journalism they are going to need to make the paywall pay . <p> My basic point is that , in a big market like the US , a news organisation can afford to pursue a partisan audience because the niche is still likely to be large enough to be profitable . So Fox News can be as biased as they like because even if they alienate everybody on the left , there are enough people on the right to keep the station in the black . I doubt this is true in Australia . <p> My guess is that there is a genuine market out there for a decent , serious , national online newspaper and that people will pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a niche , a small subset of the total market for news . I really do n't see how dividing it further , along partisan lines , is a winning economic strategy . <p> For instance , just how many people are going to read a few paragraphs of Janet Albrechtsen 's latest rant in support of Andrew Bolt and then feel an overwhelming urge to cough up cash to read the rest of it ? And ditto for the site 's full list of rightwing bloviators ? <p> It ai n't going to happen . In fact , the undiluted presence of such writers is going to scare off a sizeable number of potential subscribers , people who are willing to pay for news and opinion but do n't want their faces rubbed in hostile views and slanted news coverage . <p> I 'll reiterate : I think it is important to pay for journalism . But in a small market like Australia , a mainstream news website with pretensions to be " the heart of the nation " can not prosper as a niche within a niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paywall will fail unless they change their editorial stance . When you are passing yourself off as a serious newspaper , you ca n't continue to insult half your potential ( already small ) audience and expect them to pay you . So until they offer more balanced news coverage , and leaven their ranks of rightwing commentators with some credible people from the left ( and no , I do n't mean disgruntled , failed and bitter former Labor politicians ) they will struggle . <p> As the Murdoch era ends , future bosses of News Ltd will either have to move The Australian back to the political centre or close it down.Tim Dunlop writes regularly for The Drum and other publications .

' <p> Robert Gordon Menzies ( look him up ) jolted the nation with this electrifying insight in 1956 when he signaled the importance of pursuing post war trade opportunities in Japan , at a time when memories were raw and the electorate had forgotten his pre-war enthusiasm for selling pig iron to the land of the rising sun . <p> What matters about business opportunities in Asia is how well and how shrewdly they are identified and developed , with a full appreciation of the sovereign , cultural and legal realities . <p> Scoot is a 100% owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines operating from there to wherever , in time , it sees the right opportunities , and accessing those markets as an internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controlled by Singaporean owners . <p> It is , with one difference , a carbon copy of the international arm of Jetstar in Australia . It is a vindication of the Qantas decision to launch that international arm , which is not the same as Jetstar Asia , Jetstar Pacific or Jetstar NZ . <p> The difference is that Qantas also bases three of its A332s at Changi Airport to fly into and out of Australia and New Zealand and in due course with more jets , anywhere that the government of Singapore likes , using labor paid under Singaporean terms and conditions , which can be summarised as higher super levies , much lower taxes , and somewhat lower salaries , keeping in mind that Singapore lacerates itself over being cost uncompetitive against Thailand , Bangladesh , Indonesia , the entire Mekong delta states and the Phillipines . <p> Thus Scoot is Singapore Airlines ' version of Jetstar international ( Australia ) .

Almost all of those passengers who can not fly Qantas all the way to London after the northern summer timetable kicks in next year are going to chose Singapore Airlines , Emirates or Etihad to fly all the way on one brand , especially if several of them earn Virgin Australia points . <p> Scoot may look like a vomit comet with its custard colored splash lines , but it will put even more pressure on Qantas and its Jetstar franchise than seems to generally understood by those who cut and paste Qantas press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted privileges of the Qantas Chairmans Lounges . <p> Come on Ben .

Just because Singapore has Government backing does n't guarantee success every where it flys ( unlike some who are using their airlines experience &amp; brand as a line of credit ) .

Three months ago , his first child , James , was born . <p> What are you going to feed him , I ask in an interview ? ' ' Exactly what I grew up with , ' ' he says . ' ' Nothing out of a can . ' ' But surely baked beans would be permissible ? ' ' Absolutely not .

Steam some asparagus , poach an egg and serve it with crusty bread , simple as that . <p> ' ' Everything that you put in your mouth , just keep it real , because there 's a lot of rubbish out there . ' ' <p> Calombaris remembers his parents driving into the country to collect wild greens , and heading north to buy oranges - in a time when it took effort to find food . The result was a greater respect for what you ate , and less waste . When a chicken was cooked , you cooked not just the easy meat , but the necks , hearts and gizzards , the whole bird . Food is just too easy these days , Calombaris laments . <p> You might think that three years on the set of the highly commercial MasterChef would make a man more careful with his words , but Calombaris 's willingness to bag margarine and baked beans ( and his unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of ' ' she 's hot ' ' about teachers accompanying students in the audience ) suggests a man who just ca n't help speaking his mind . <p> He 's not pushing sponsors ( I suspect when he mentions pureeing carrots for his baby in his Thermomix - and note later that Thermomix is listed as a ' ' friend ' ' on his website - that he is touting a brand with which he has a commercial connection , but it seems not . No commercial link at all , his assistant says , just a product he likes . ) Nor is he delivering a smooth public relations line . Not even on the subject of MasterChef . <p> ' ' MasterChef is taking me nowhere , ' ' he says in response to my question about the influence of the show on his success and his future . He means his future does n't depend on the show . ' ' At the end of the day , MasterChef is just a thing on the side that is happening for me . How long it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He respects the program , and believes it has done a whole lot of good in the community , with kids taking a huge interest in cooking , he says . <p> But it seems his life as a chef and restaurateur is his passion . After MasterChef , he will step back into the kitchen , with ' ' a lot of things to learn , a lot of things to conquer ' ' . <p> Still , it 's difficult to imagine him settling into one kitchen . Calombaris 's restaurants ( co-owned ) are the Press Club , where he transforms the food of his Greek heritage with the techniques of molecular gastronomy ; the Little Press and Cellar , opened this year ; the Hellenic Republic , ' ' traditional Greek tavern cuisine ' ' ; St Katherine 's , with a Turkish grill and woodfired pizza oven , opened this year ; the Maha with its Maltese chef and co-owner ; and the French PM24 , ( 2010 ) headed by Philippe Mouchel . He even has a place in Mykonos in Greece , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on his Press Club food . All of that in five years . <p> He 's about to open a pasta place called Mama Baba where he goes so far as to have the flour specially milled and processed for the restaurant . His father , he offers by way of explanation , was half Italian as well as half Greek . <p> If he opens in Canberra , it will be his first venture outside Melbourne , other than the place in Greece . <p> Calombaris told the Canberra demonstrations about visiting a little restaurant on one of his regular visits to Mykonos , where the person he was with kicked off his shoes to feel the pebbles on his feet while he ate fish near the ocean . This so inspired the Australian chef that back in Melbourne , he tried to re-create the experience with a dish that has two elements - raw seafood on one side of the serving dish , and pebbles mixed with juniper and bay that you 're meant not to eat , but to touch while you eat . <p> Calombaris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprayed the room with rose-petal perfume , infusing the scent , before people ate a dish he had created ( with the help of his patient Press Club pastry chef , Lisa Van Zanten ) called Aphrodite , in which a tree with edible petals stands in a garden of edible soil ( biscuit crumb ) , planted with ' ' magic ' ' mushrooms and other edible bits , including ' ' twigs ' ' made of salt and vinegar chocolate . The mushrooms had a white-chocolate shell with powdered beetroot and Pop Rocks inside ( the magic ) , and were stuck to a meringue foot . His point is that eating is about all the senses - and it 's a point exploited to great effect by Heston Blumenthal in Britain . <p> Calombaris 's restaurant empire amounts to 300 staff so far . Given the collapse in the days before we meet of Tony Bilson 's restaurant empire in Sydney , I ask him whether he ever fears that he has taken on too much , or become too big . <p> ' ' I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's the fear that stops him becoming complacent , he says , the reminder that he has people 's livelihoods in his hands . He has become good at delegating and appointing the right staff - so ' ' whatever I want I will pretty much get ' ' . <p> Calombaris has always had this boisterous energy and impatience for new projects - he recounts his mother being told at parent-teacher interviews about her son 's lack of concentration , and in an interview with the Melbourne Age recently , he had another anecdote , after the birth of his own son : ' ' My mum came to my place a month ago with this dog lead in a bag , and I said , ' What 's this mum ? We never had a dog . ' And she said , ' We had to put this on you when you were little . I hope James is n't going to be like that but we thought we 'd bring it just in case . ' ' ' <p> His school performance , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad reader , I 'm a bad writer , I can count a bit . ' ' But when he started in restaurants , success came fast . Calombaris told the school students that when he employs a young person , he 's not so much interested in their knife skills as their attitude - respect your body , be clean and tidy and be healthy . And expect some pain . ' ' It 's not going to be easy . You are going to come into work crying and I did plenty of times , but it will all come together . ' ' <p> Calombaris might live life ' ' at a million miles an hour ' ' , but having a child has brought more than one blessing - it has slowed him down , even if just a little .

@@4416240 <p> Do you have friends , girl(/boy)friends , family members or other social activities that need to have any substantial time investment within ? How about a job that requires you to work to live , do you have one of those ? If you 're going to be purchasing this game , which I would heartily recommend doing , you may find yourself skipping out on them for just one more turn . Might and Magic Heroes VI is the latest turn based strategy game in a long line of games within the Might and Magic franchise . It features a ( very ) lenghty single player component , a very nice multiplayer component and a custom game mode , for if you want to practice or just want some quick action without the story getting in the way . <p> Story : <p> In Might and Magic Heroes VI , the story begins within the tutorial levels ( which do n't actually feel like tutorial levels , hooray ! ) with the Duke Slava investigating the return of Demons within his domain , The Griffin Duchy . The plot thickens when he needs to team up with his races mortal enemies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his lands . Of course , for any other game , this would have been the entire arc within the story . However , in Might and Magic Heroes VI it is not . The plot takes a turn for the worse when Duke Slava is murdered by his own daughter a few years after his fellow Dukes of Haven stage a skirmish on him for collaborating with Orcs . <p> The death of Slava sets the games story up for each of the playable races within the game , Haven , Necropolis , Sanctuary , Inferno , Stronghold and features one hidden arc . Unlike most games , each races story is pretty standalone and are all unlocked at the same time ( after the completion of the tutorial ) and can be played simultaneously and in any order . Of course , you ca n't play any mission within the story at random , you will have to do the missions within each race sequentially , but you can go back and do any previous mission . <p> The story of Might and Magic Heroes VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have played in a long time , with some missions taking several hours to complete . Add on to that , the fact there are multiple storylines to complete and you 'll find that the game is incredibly long . The only problem with the length of the story is that you find yourself so immersed with it , that you 'll constantly tell yourself ' Just one more turn ' right up until you look at your watch and realise that six hours have passed and you still want to continue for one more turn . <p> If a really decent story that keeps you engaged over a potentially long game is something that you want , I 'd advise checking this game out for that reason alone . <p> Audio / Visuals : <p> The graphical component of Might and Magic Heroes VI is probably not it 's strongest point . In fact , I 'd say that this game is n't designed to portray things realistically , and as a result , has a graphical system that best suits the style of the game . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buildings and units at the same time , for multiple factions across huge maps , it 's probably best that the graphical style is as simple as it needed to be . <p> Of course , that is n't to say that the models are bad , rather , they 're just simple . I often found myself zooming the camera in ( using the scroll thing on the mouse ) to take a closer look at some of the creatures in the game . In my opinion the simpler style gives each unit a bit more personality than they would have recieved if they were photo-realistic . Let 's take a look at a water elemental for example . If this was to be a photo-realistic creature , it would be incredibly clear and appear as a water-like human body , barely discernable by eye . But using this graphical style , we get this nice blue monster that is much more appeasing to the eye and is that much more believable within the setting of the game . This logic applies for all the creatures within Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI features a large quantity of audio within the game . There are sounds for every unit within the game , as well as background scores for combat , overworlds and factions . There are also a wide array of sound effects for weaponry and spells . <p> The orchestral score fits the theme of the game quite well and does n't get in the way of the pre-recorded dialogue during storyline moments . The pre-recorded dialoge was also of a great quality , with each voice actor accurately portraying their character quite well . <p> Ultimately , I believe that the games visual style suits the game amazingly well , even if it 's not the games strongest point ( that 's the gameplay , shh ... spoilers ) . The audio also adds a very nice level to the game that further enhances the experience . Players will not be dissappointed in these regards . <p> Gameplay : <p> In Might and Magic Heroes VI , players take control of a Hero of a specific faction and load them up with armies of creatures to fight against other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple , and it is , but it can very quickly become complicated . <p> Each hero in your control has their own experience points and inventory , as well as their own armies to use while engaging with enemies . Some races are better suited to having multiple heroes roaming around , each with their own armies , while other benefit from having a few heroes with very large armies . The game is all about learning your chosen team and levelling up your heroes in ways to compliment your teams strengths . <p> The idea in MMH6 is to capture various points , such as sawmills and goldmines to increase your flow of resources into your kingdom to allow you to upgrade your towns . Upgrading towns is important as you 'll need them to recruit new creatures for your armies . <p> Combat in the game takes place over a grid , and much like travel on the overworld , it is turn based . Only , unlike the overworld , the battlegrid determines the play order of creatures based on initiative , with the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Unlike most strategy games , each individual creature does not represent one actual creature , it instead represents a stack of creatures which is essentially each individual creature of that type within an army . By increasing the number of a specific units stack , you make the overall stack stronger which makes individual units within the stack harder to kill . And if you 're playing Necropolis , you can keep your stack at maximum using the right unit and spell combinations . The way you set up your hero and units within your army is crucial to winning in MMH6 , using your units correctly or in smart ways will yield a much higher probability of winning . Play to your factions strengths . <p> As I stated in the Story section , the game is very addictive . You will always find yourself wanting to play for just one more turn , regardless of if you just had that one more turn or not . Each turn seems like an incredibly quick ordeal , but you can do so much in one turn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feels like you can accomplish so much more on your next turn because of what you have done on your previous turn and it keeps on stacking until you 've wasted an entire day on a custom game against 5 other bots just to see what the custom games were like . And you 've won so many battles so far , if you keep going you might just win . Keep on going , just one more turn . <p> One last feature I want to talk about is the multiplayer . This can be done online , offline on a single PC ( HOTSEAT ! ! ! ! ! ) or even over LAN . This makes MMH6 ideal for having guests over , or even an title to play at a friendly LAN party . The hotseat mode takes me back to the days of playing HoMMIII at home with a small group of friends . Such a good game mode and I 'm glad it was included . <p> This is one game that I 've had to force myself to stop playing ( just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to play Heroes of Might and Magic ( I-III ) and am loving the square grid over thehexagonal grid used in the older games . It makes fighting on some of the more exotic arenas much more easier to navigate ( like the lillyponds that are narrow in the middle , as opposed to the big open plains ) . If you loved the classics , then returning to this will make you feel at home . <p> Overall : <p> Might and Magic Heroes VI ( I 'm not sure what 's with the rebranding of the title , I much prefer the older longer title Heroes of Might and Magic ) is an amazing game that captures the feel of the classic games while still retaining something for itself . It 's an incredibly long game , with the story and the like , but offers much replay value in the form of added difficulties , custom games and an ever long multiplayer .

@@4421231 <h> Trade Minister Emerson discusses free trade <p> Federal Minister for Trade Craig Emerson joins Lateline to discuss the agreements reached at the APEC meeting in Hawaii . <h> Transcript <p> ALI MOORE , PRESENTER : Our top story is the push for reduced trade tariffs which emerged from the APEC meeting in Hawaii which wound up today . <p> Australia 's Minister for Trade Craig Emerson was deeply involved in the talks and joined us just a short time ago from Canberra . <p> Craig Emerson , flesh off the plane from Hawaii , many thanks for joining Lateline . <p> CRAIG EMERSON , MINISTER FOR TRADE : My pleasure , Ali . <p> ALI MOORE : This Trans-Pacific Partnership includes Australia , the US and seven others along the lines of Singapore and Vietnam , Chile and Peru . No Japan , no South Korea , also big trading partners and no China . <p> We 'll get to China in a moment , but given we already have a free trade agreement with the US , if they 're the only major player in this partnership , how valuable will it be ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : The partnership already constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if Japan came in , and also today there were expressions of interest from Mexico and Canada , but even if Japan came in , it 'd be a third of the world 's GDP . So a third of the global economy is a big proportion and those countries are expressing interest which , if they did join , would take it to 12 . <p> ALI MOORE : So as it stands now though can you quantify the gains , particularly over and above that free trade agreement we already have with the US ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well we 've done a lot of the heavy lifting over the last 25 years in reducing our own tariffs , in fashioning the open and competitive economy which has actually contributed to two decades of recession-free , strong economic growth in this country . <p> Some other countries have also been doing that , perhaps not quite as much as us , and so there would be more market opening and that 's more opportunities for our exporters . Obviously they say to us , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they want access to the region 's markets and that 's what the Trans-Pacific partnership would improve . <p> ALI MOORE : But with Australia , the US and the seven other nations that are currently signed up , although it 's not quite finalised , but can you put a number , can you quantify the benefits from those nine countries ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : No , and I was asked this in Honolulu with the Prime Minister . It is a concept that 's taking shape and frankly , if an economist came along and said he or she had estimated the benefits at a particular number of billions of dollars , they 'd be pulling your leg . <p> What you really need to do is examine what business is seeking , and what business is seeking , what farmers are seeking is better access to these markets and that 's what the Trans-Pacific partnership offers . <p> It has this unique ingredient , Ali , at the moment : and that is political momentum . I was in the room with president Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the president 's really strongly committed to this . That 's the biggest economy on Earth . <p> And so when you 've got the president of the United States seeing this as his baby , something that he wants to deliver , well that 's good news because they are indicating through a statement that they volunteered that they want to eliminate all tariffs over time . So that would be a very big gain for Australian exporters . <p> ALI MOORE : And a bigger gain , as you said , if Japan comes in and also South Korea , but how realistic is that ? It would have to be a long haul because Japan would have to make very significant concessions particularly on the agricultural front , would n't they ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Yeah , it would and the significance therefore of Japan indicating an interest is this : that they are signalling that they 're prepared to reform their domestic economy . <p> They do want to engage more closely with other countries in the region . They have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . And Japan realises that it needs to reach out and integrate itself more successfully , but that does mean domestic reform , which has proved too hard for Japan for a very long time . <p> So that 's why this is so significant . Because the prime minister of Japan and the ruling party are saying they are prepared to tackle the necessary domestic reforms , including in agriculture . <p> But what all nine TPP partners have said is this : we want to maintain a high level of ambition and we want to maintain the very rapid pace of negotiations , so we 'll do that . And then of course Japan 's interest will be the subject of consultation with each party , as will Canada 's , as will Mexico 's . <p> ALI MOORE : A high level of ambition , as you said . Eliminating tariffs . The main tariffs in this country are on automobiles and textile , clothing and footwear . Would those tariffs have to be eliminated for the TPP to work , for this partnership to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would . They 're down to ... <p> ALI MOORE : Over what sort of time period ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : There is n't a specified period , but the really landmark decision that was taken in Honolulu was that tariffs would be eliminated over time . And we 're very pragmatic about this . <p> Other countries will not be committing to eliminating them on the day of implementation of this agreement . Better to make the adjustment manageable and to have those phase-downs in a way that is manageable for their domestic economies . And in Australia ... <p> ALI MOORE : Do you have a sense of what 's manageable in this environment , because of course you 've got a battle on two fronts . On the one hand the unions say now is not the time to cut tariffs , the little tariffs that do remain because of the high dollar , and the Greens on the other hand say that , for example , this would force Australian farmers to compete against low-wage economies , and of course you 'd need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRAIG EMERSON : Oh , well , I think we 'd be looking to the Coalition to support this . The Liberal part of the Coalition has come out positively today . The National Party component of the Coalition has come out negatively today . Every day they are looking more and more like the One Nation party , and I suppose the legitimate fear is that the Barnaby Joyces of the world , preaching economic Hansonism , are having a pretty strong influence on Mr Abbott . <p> But you 've got others like the deputy , Julie Bishop who does actually believe in the open , competitive economy and a number of backbenchers , so let 's see how it unfolds . <p> But the truth is Australia has done nearly all of the necessary heavy lifting over 25 years so why would we now say that we do n't want to be part of a partnership involving the biggest and third biggest economies on Earth . This is now time to cash in on those opportunities . <p> ALI MOORE : The unions would argue the tariffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competitiveness of those sectors . Do you sacrifice that to be part of this broader community ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well I do n't think that a 5 per cent tariff , phased down over time , is going determine the economic future of industries in this country . <p> ALI MOORE : Then why have them in the first place ? Why not get rid of them now ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well , indeed , indeed . Bearing in mind that when the Hawke Government was elected , tariffs on automotive vehicles and components were 57.5 per cent . They 're now five . So the ... <p> ALI MOORE : So if you had your druthers , would you take away that five today ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : I 'm just saying the future is not in tariff protection ; the future is open and free trade , which the Prime Minister said today : we have nothing to fear from free trade . We benefit from it . Our exporters benefit from it . And the answer is no , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking anyone to remove tariffs overnight . Other countries wo n't be doing that . <p> But , you 're right in terms of the remaining tariffs , 5 per cent on auto and it 'll be 5 per cent on textiles , clothing and footwear by 2015 . And yet , the 48 least-developed countries of the world already enjoy tariff-free entry of their textiles , clothing and footwear into Australia . <p> So , that remaining tariff wall from 2015 wo n't be doing a lot of work on textiles , clothing and footwear when the big producers of basic items of textiles , clothing and footwear already have duty free or tariff free entry into Australia . <p> ALI MOORE : Let 's look at China ; not part of this agreement . As one commentator described it , this partnership focuses on labour , the environment , intellectual property protection , rules against currency manipulation and favouritism of state-owned enterprises . It 's almost as if it has been deliberately designed to exclude China . <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well that 's not right . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-owned enterprises in its origins , if you like . Its philosophical origins are not all that different from China 's . <p> China itself is a great trading nation for us . We get a lot of our prosperity from trading with China , and all APEC countries would be welcome over time if they can demonstrate and want to demonstrate the same high level of ambition . Indeed , one of the real attractions of this Trans-Pacific Partnership is that they are all APEC economies . Three more APEC economies just in the last , what , 48 hours have expressed an interest in joining . And the real vision for APEC itself , which is an Australian creation , is a free trade area for Asia and the Pacific , which would include China , which would include China . <p> ALI MOORE : But as you said , you 've got to meet the hurdles . And you would be aware that president Obama has made some very frank and indeed tough comments by diplomatic standards aimed at China . He says the US is fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough is enough " is the direct quote . He 's demanded China stop gaming the international system and create a level playing field . " We do n't want them to take advantage of the United States . " Are they fair comments ? Do you support them ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well , as I say , we have a fantastic trading relationship with China . We would like China and every other country on Earth to continue opening its economies up to trade , because for Australia , trade equals jobs for our working people . <p> ALI MOORE : But do you think they 're gaming the international system ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well I do n't want to get into a running commentary on China . We have a great relationship with them . We have rules under the World Trade Organisation , and our Prime Minister , Julia Gillard , is spearheading a new way of approaching the Doha rounds . And bear in mind that China is a member of the World Trade Organisation , joined in 2001 , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pathway blocked by a roadblock , into its constituent issues and then bring them home one by one . That 's us again , Australia , advocating free and open trade , which includes China - which vitally includes China . <p> ALI MOORE : But as I said , you 've also - you 've heard the comments from the president . Chinese officials have made two comments . One is that they refuse to abide by international economic rules that they have no part in writing . The other that if they 're not in the partnership , it will lack heft . <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well I think a partnership that consists of nine economies and possibly three more , including the first and third largest economies in the world is big , is big . There 's no doubt about that . <p> And it will , I think , continue to expand over time , because it 's got political momentum . There 's an absolute commitment not to just have some pretty words and some wrapping on it , but something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like . That 's what we 're seeking and that 's what the president is seeking . And I think that 's really good news . <p> You know , when there 's all this protectionism around the world , to have the president of the United States , to have all 21 APEC economies today committing to a standstill on protection , not only to 2013 , which the G20 countries have committed to last week , but to 2015 , and that includes China , is a great achievement . <p> ALI MOORE : Of course this announcement does come , this partnership comes just a couple of days before Australia and the US is due to announce closer military ties . If you put the two together , and America 's stated aim of returning to this region of being stronger in this region , what do you think that means for the Australia-China relationship ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : I think the Australian-China relationship will go from strength to strength . That 's the truth of it . And as Trade Minister , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seeking to broaden and deepen our integration with China and with this , the Asian region in the Asian century . <p> You would n't want to be any other place on Earth than Australia that 's locked into the growth that 's occurring in the Asian region in the Asian century . No accident , Ali . A result of visionary leadership , much of it by previous Labor governments , Hawke and Keating , and now Julia Gillard launching this white paper exercise called the Asian Century white paper is designed to broaden that integration . <p> ALI MOORE : It 's also I guess no accident ; it 's a lot to do with our geography . But is n't it logical that China will see this partnership , this Trans-Pacific Partnership , as a vehicle for the US to expand its influence in the region ? And couple that with the military announcement , that it could be a potential source of tension ? <p> CRAIG EMERSON : Well , I do n't think so . More trade is better trade . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic powerhouse wanting to open up its borders and trade with the fastest growing region on Earth . <p> I mean , I 'd see that as a bit of flattery , actually , that the United States is indicating through president Obama and secretary of state Hillary Clinton a little earlier saying that America wants to plug into the Asia Pacific century . Well good on American . <p> Australia 's here and we want to work with America , with China , with Japan , with all of those APEC economies . And yeah , sure , geographically , you 're right : we 're in the region . We 've got minerals . That 's a blessing , given the industrialisation and the urbanisation of China . <p> But we would n't be able to take advantage of that without the economic reforms of the last 25 years initiated originally by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating to create the open and competitive economy , now continued by Julia Gillard . <p> And then you 've got the contrast of the economic Hansonism , almost a fortress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , seeking to prey on anxieties about the future .

It works in tandem with Mazda 's ' i-stop ' start/stop system , extending the length of time the engine can be in shutdown mode . <p> Conventional regenerative braking systems in hybrid vehicles use an electric motor/generator to recover kinetic energy produced at the brakes during deceleration . The recovered energy is stored in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor to increase efficiency . <p> Unlike these systems , Mazda 's i-ELOOP does not need a dedicated electric motor or battery . i-ELOOP incorporates a 12-25 volt variable voltage alternator , a low-resistance electric double layer capacitor and a DC/DC converter .

The converter reduces the electricity from 25 volts to 12 volts before distributing it to the vehicle 's electrical components ( climate control , audio system , etc. ) and charging the vehicle battery where necessary . <p> i-ELOOP is the latest development in Mazda 's SkyActiv series , which aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions across the entire range by implementing efficient powertrain components and lightweight materials . <p> Mazda calls i-ELOOP ' Step Two ' in its Building Blocks strategy , following the development of i-stop ( Step One ) .

@@4438234 <p> Overview There are very few games that could pull off such ridiculous ideas as well as the Saints Row series has done . 5 years on from the original , Saints Row : The Third has really solidified the position of the series in the world of gaming . It has seemingly moved out of the shadow of GTA and other sandbox titles , offering a truly unique and fun experience in addition to becoming a much more polished , complete game . But how well does the story and depth of the game compete with the countless chart topping titles available at the moment ? Well you 're going to have to read the review to find out . <p> Story Following suit from the previous two games in the series , Saints Row : The Third is essentially about you and the 3rd Street Saints regaining control of the city . Since Saints Row 2 , the gang had established a media empire in addition to controlling Stillwater and becoming international icons . However following an unexpected turn of events when attempting to rob a bank , the Saints leaders find themselves in jail and their control of the city threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your hearts crazy desires ) , Shaundi and Gat get released from prison as a result of a bribe from International crime organisation The Syndicate , only to be taken to the leader of Phillipe Loren . An offer is made to the Saints , with the expectation that they will give up two-thirds of Stilwater 's revenue . You reject this offer and in true Saints style set off a gun fight as you make your escape from Loren 's private jet . <p> Without giving too much more away , you eventually set foot in Stillwater again , finding most of the control has been taken by The Syndicate , and it 's now of course your job to lead the Saints back to supremacy . The Syndicate is composed of three new rival gangs , The Luchadores , Morningstar and The Deckers . <p> Sounds pretty similar to the previous two games , right ? Unfortunately it 's true , they have n't strayed too much from the structure of the first two games , however that being said , by result of the three rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater fluidity and overall turns out to be pretty engaging . Instead of driving around and picking a gang to target , thereby muddling up storylines with each other , you get a far smoother story . <p> Gameplay Freedom is something that Saints Row : The Third really thrives on . You can play the missions at your own pace and wreak havoc whenever and however you please . Access to vehicle and weapons is generally pretty easy , with most special vehicles you use in missions being added to your crib garages for unlimited use . <p> If you 've played the previous two games , you wo n't find it all too different in terms of controls . There have been a few button switches as well as the inclusion of some more character abilities and pretty cool combat moves ( not to mention the parachute that you can make appear whenever you fall or jump from high places ) . <p> The missions on a whole are pretty similarly structured to Saints Row 2 but there is still a fair bit of variety to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the game , which may seem short but given all the activities and city-wrecking you can do , as well as the novelty Whored mode , you wo n't find yourself getting bored too quickly . <p> One of my favourite additions to this game is the upgrades . Your cash is now a lot more useful than previously , with the option to improve a whole variety of things including physical abilities and weapon upgrades . You now get an hourly income from the city ( not real time ) , which you can improve through purchasing stores and buildings as well as by completing missions . <p> Disappointingly , AI has n't really improved much . Although things get pretty crazy when you 're surrounded by enemies with various explosives flying around the place , they do n't really make much attempt to stop you from taking them out . That being said , the inclusion of " specialists " helps a bit as they tend to be slightly more difficult to take out . <p> " Brutes " are also a new addition . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast of a person who becomes your " homie " pretty soon into the story . The Brutes take a fair amount of ammo to kill , and will sometimes come equipped with flamethrowers or mini-guns ( both of which you can pick up after you 've killed them to use as a temporary heavy weapon ) . Taking out a brute is rough , taking out multiple all the while the enemy gangsters are firing away at you is not such a cakewalk . <p> Visuals To be honest , this is probably the weakest area of Saints Row : The Third . The visuals are n't bad by any means , but they just are n't up to the same standard that we 're growing accustomed to . The character models look quite good and the cut scenes are animated very nicely in most cases . However , as in the previous versions , there is a real lack of continuity and detail in the environment . Cars still fade into obscurity once off the screen , as do the people walking the streets . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would elevate this to an excellent game rather than just a great one . <p> The customisation options really help spice up the visuals , with a vast array of clothing choices , not to mention skin colours . Having a nude metallic green , bearded transvestite with a zombie voice really supports the whole craziness angle this game is going for , and that 's before he/she is wielding a oversized , fatal dildo . <p> Audio As always the game boasts a great variety of music on the soundtrack for the radio stations , including Kanye , Deadmau5 , Benny Bennassi , The Bloody Beetroots and of course some funny ads , news reports and spoofs for good measure . <p> The voice acting in the game is another great component , featuring Daniel Dae Kim , Sasha Grey , Danielle Nicolette and of course Hulk Hogan . Your character as well has the choice of 7 voices ( 3 male , 3 female and 1 fun-loving zombie ) , allowing for some differentiation in character personalities and fitting into the scripting really well . <p> Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of humour thrown in with your games , then you 'll love Saints Row : The Third . It 's daring , it 's violent , it 's oh so silly but most importantly it 's fun . You can no longer write it off as an attempt at copying the GTA series as it has really come into its own with this release , and has firmly positioned itself in the game market . The story is engaging enough and the activities will keep you playing for hours , and when paired with the Co-op and Whored mode it really does offer good value for money . Of course the visuals are still somewhat lacking and there seem to be a few kinks that will need to be resolved with a patch , but overall it 's a well-polished , well executed and hell of a fun game to add to any gamer 's collection . <p> Post a Comment <p> Cypher <p> Saint 's Row 2 was hilarious did n't expect anything less in terms of comedy . <p> http : **30;230;TOOLONG ? id=100000269751272 Nicolas Durand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it deserves a higher rating but I have just started it so what can I say ? <p> http : **44;262;TOOLONG nicd <p> This is a great game so far and I think it deserves a 10 , however I have just started it so I ca n't really argue my point ...

@@4453233 <h> The Only Video Game Journalists To Get Action Figures <p> Today , GamePro magazine ceases to be . Which for lovers of print is a bit of a sad moment , given the fact it 's been around since 1988 . <p> In that time it 's previewed , reviewed and wrote about a lot of games , but for me it 'll always be remembered as the only video game magazine to ever get its own line of action figures . <p> Yes , as bizarre as that sounds , for a little while there GamePro was in business with toy company Joyride Studios and was putting out action figures based on its editorial team . <p> Between 2002 and 2003 Joyride and GamePro released as a joint venture a number of lines of video game action figures , most of them based on licensed properties like Metroid , Zelda and Sonic ( there were even planes from Medal of Honour ! ) .

They had them adopt characters with both fake names and comic book-style avatars , initially as a smokescreen to cover for the fact the magazine did n't have many writers , and later just because it stuck and readers seemed to like it . <p> Some of these alter-egos included Bro Buzz ( former EIC Wes Nihei ) and Fart of War ( CGW and 2K Boston 's Shawn Elliot ) , but not everyone had the honour of getting their own toy . Only the big names like Miss Spell , Dan Elektro ( Activision 's community man One of Swords/Dan Amrich ) , Major Mike ( former EGM writer Mike Weigand ) and Dr. Zombie ( Francis Mao , who now works at Capcom ) ended up in plastic form , each in the likeness not of the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the premise was such a lure that the editorial figures -- of which " only " 2500 of each were ever made -- tried to encourage multiple purchases by making 100 of them limited editions .

It astonished us with its huge open world , wicked sense of humour and the detailed 3D graphics that made Liberty City a character in its own right . Later GTA games may have built on its success , but Grand Theft Auto III was the quantum leap for the series and an indicator of just what the PS2 was capable of . <h> Shadow of the Colossus ( 2005 ) <p> This Playstation 2 title saw hero Wander attempting to save a woman 's life -- so far , so predictable -- by slaughtering twelve Colossi . But the quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling over the massive bodies of these massive creatures in order to destroy them was like no other game , but it was the way in which its storyline developed that was genuinely surprising .

As well as getting social media darling Stephen Fry to narrate the game , Sony handed players the keys to the kingdom , letting them create and share user-generated levels . With over five million levels created to date , it proved to be a masterstroke , pointing the way to a socially-networked future for gaming where players are creators as much as passive participants . <h> Resident Evil ( 1996 ) <p> The game that brought survival horror to the masses , PlayStation 's Resident Evil frightened the bejeezus out of us .

Her approach to archaeology , backflipping her way around ruins and slaughtering wildlife , may have been novel , and her ludicrously-inflated bosoms did n't help to dispel any of those stereotypes about gamers , but it was the puzzle-based gameplay and incredibly fluid 3D graphics that made the game a hit . <h> Crash Bandicoot ( 1996 ) <p> This PlayStation platformer pitted Crash Bandicoot against mad scientist Doctor Neo Cortex and kept it simple with smashing boxes full of Wumpa Fruit , exploding TNT crates and some of the best graphics we 'd ever seen .
