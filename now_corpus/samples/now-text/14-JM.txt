It can not be that this is occurring in our society with impunity : that people are being murdered by gang members , " Anthony told legislators , noting that the bill was not intended to persecute innocent people but , rather , to make people think twice about joining criminal gangs . <p> Anthony said that the judiciary would determine whether or not suspects accused of committing an offence were indeed members of a gang . <p> He said that while citizens have the right to assemble , they do not have the right to assemble and form criminal gangs . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect .

So we must ask ourselves the question : what kind of society are we creating when we introduce a bill such as this in its current form ? " <p> Rigobert warned that the Anti-Gang Bill could result in some of the rights to which St Lucians were entitled being infringed upon . <p> " This piece of legislation , in my opinion , will entrap most of the young men in our communities who simply sit on the block . So the question must be asked , therefore : is there an inherent class or geographic prejudice in here that the form of recreation that some persons , depending on their social circumstances can afford , is really to sit on a block ? " <p> Frederick said the bill was likely to attract a litany of litigations from people who might think they are being victimised . <p> " I see this piece of legislation as a lawyers ' paradise . Lawyers will make a lot of money off this piece of legislation because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they will challenge it , Mr. Speaker , ( because ) quite a number of the sections are indeed too draconian , " he added . <p> Late last month , Prime Minister Anthony told the nation that his administration would pursue its agenda against crime relentlessly and that efforts would be made to enact the Anti-Gang Bill at the next sitting of Parliament . <p> The Anti-Gang bill is seen as one of the measures being pursued by the government to deal with the upsurge in criminal activities here . The others include a review of the legislation that allows for the remission of sentences for convicted murderers as well as revisiting the Bail Act " to tighten up on the grant of bail to accused persons , especially those convicted of gun related crimes " . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@4620234 <h> Ministry saves millions from teacher-leave reform <p> YOUR EDITORIAL of February 11 , 2014 raised concerns that the Ministry of Education might be losing its resolve to reform the arrangements with the nation 's teachers . The facts indicate otherwise . <p> Since portfolio minister Ronald Thwaites ' Sectoral presentation to Parliament last May , there has been a quiet but resolute man-agement of retirement , study-leave and vacation-leave app-lications , which has saved expenditure of about $750 million . <p> This saving has been achieved by filling retirement vacancies without adding to the gross numbers in employment , by aligning advanced study to classroom responsibilities , and by replacing , internally , more than 90 per cent of the eight-month leave taken during instructional days . This pattern will continue , and is entirely consistent with the existing Code of Regulations . <p> In this regard , the ministry is heartened by the recent pro-nouncements of Patrick Smith , senior secretary , member services of the Jamaica Teachers ' Ass-ociation ( JTA ) , acknowledging that normally , " teachers are not entitled to vacation leave outside of school vacations " . <p> No leave outside holidays <p> This is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teachers in public-educational institutions shall not normally be eligible for vacation leave with pay in addition to school holidays . " However , the practice has been otherwise . <p> There is no plan to take away the leave entitlements of teachers , so Mr Smith need not fear . But there is definitely a resolve by the Ministry of Education to manage leave arrangements in a way that causes least disruption and expense to the schools and , by extension , the taxpayers . <p> While the ministry is restricting the granting of study leave to targeted subject areas , it is supportive of the delivery of continuing education through modalities that minimise disruption to school operation . <p> In this regard , persons , especially teachers , interested in educational advancement should pay close attention to the opportunities for professional advancement through the National College for Educational Leadership ( NCEL ) . Several hundred principals , vice-principals and aspirant school leaders have been , and now are , engaged in a comprehensive course of institutional leadership geared specifically towards excellent management of Jamaican schools . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as most of our teachers are ambitious for professional advancement and are not afraid of accountability . <p> Better placement <p> The underemployment of as many as 1,500 teachers in the nation 's schools is also a matter that the ministry has been addressing . The education system needs these personnel , but not where they are tenured . There are about 200 schools with fewer than 100 students where the teacher-student ratio is 1 to 12 , or fewer . These schools are underperforming in the majority . <p> Side by side , there are other schools where the teacher-student ratio exceeds 50 to 1 . This is a grossly inefficient use of taxpayers ' dollars , as well as human resource , in the education sector . <p> We believe it is in the interest of student attainment ( the goal of us all ) and teacher effectiveness that rebalancing and relocation should take place in deploying instructional personnel . <p> The Ministry of Education is committed to this task . protocol has been developed for con-sensual relocation whereby the affected teacher will carry all the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new post . <p> It goes further : After a year of relocation , either the teacher or the receiving school can request a reversion to the original post . It is good to hear the commitment of the JTA to assist the ministry with the process . Progress must be made in time for the new school year in 2014 . <p> In addition to the adminis-trative reforms outlined above , the ministry is overseeing the introduction of the Jamaica Teaching Council bill , which is aimed at promoting professional standards among educators . The bill is now in the hands of the National Council on Education for review . The views about the interests represented in the composition of the Jamaica Teaching Council are being considered . <p> The ministry is open to negotiation and amendment to the proposed legislation , not-withstanding four years of consultation .

You have to ensure that your buildings are sound and built to code and engineering specifications and that you look also at seismic engineering , " said Richard Thompson , acting director general of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management . <p> But before the new building code - on which significant work has been done to replace the current 106-year-old legal code - can become law , the Building Act must be passed . <p> Dwight Wilson , senior director of technical services and major projects in the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development , said the Government is on track to have the new legislation passed by the end of next month . <p> " The Government of Jamaica , through the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development , has taken the matter of the building code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seismic Risk and Safety Forum in Kingston last month . <p> " After several years of trying to get the act passed , we feel that we are now at the stage where we are on the final lap and are gearing and pressing full speed ahead to have the act passed by the end of this financial year , " Wilson added . <p> There are , however , some remaining hurdles to cross before the bill can become law , including the parliamentary debate process and concerns raised by a working group that has looked at drafts of the proposed act . <p> several concerns <p> The concerns , according to engineer Noel DaCosta , who has worked on the new building code - modelled off the International Building Code of the International Codes Council of the United States - include : <p> Ambiguity surrounding the roles of building practitioners ( implementers ) and building professionals ( designers ) ; <p> That local authorities should be able to contract certified professionals as code officials ; <p> Issues of monitoring building use and the mandatory inspection of certain buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Stop Notices ' ; and <p> Confusion among various certificates of compliance . <p> " Our concerns have been communicated to the chief parliamentary counsel who will hopefully make the appropriate amendments and pass the bill on to the legislative committee of Cabinet , who will then take the bill to Parliament where it may be examined by a joint select committee , " said DaCosta , a past president of the Jamaica Institution of Engineers , speaking , too , at January 's seismic forum in the capital . <p> Still , despite the progress , after years of waiting , some stakeholders are sceptical over whether the new code - which currently resides in the Bureau of Standards as a set of voluntary standards - will finally become law . <p> " I have a newspaper clipping from April 1983 ... .

@@4620237 <h> Songwriters form the base of Jamaican popular music <p> Songwriters have often been treated with scant regard and recognition for their contribution towards the success of recordings . More often than not , it is the singers - and the musicians , to a lesser extent - who are mentioned whenever a recording hits , while the writer dwells in the realms of the unknown . <p> Truth be told , there have been many instances in Jamaican popular music where the performer and the writer are one and the same person , and in such cases , authorship recognition is more instant . <p> Jamaica has a rich tradition of songwriting genius in both categories that stretch way back to the mento era of the early 1950s and extend forward to the present dancehall period . <p> Whereas an overwhelming majority of current-day deejays and singers write their own songs , many of the earlier artistes had their songs written for them . <p> There were persons at that time who just entertained a certain level of egotistic pride in writing songs solely for the purpose of having them sung by others . <p> There have , however , been unique cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very songs they intended others to do . <p> Two remarkable examples are those of Ernie Smith 's I Ca n't Take It , a 1967 ballad , and Jimmy James ' Bewildered and Blue , an extraordinary R&amp;B cut , almost a decade earlier . <p> Smith , endowed with a voice of steel befitting a radio announcer , had , in fact , come to Kingston from the country , seeking a job in that field . <p> When that fell through , he reached for a contingency plan . That plan came in the form of a song he had written for someone to record . <p> Taking it to Federal Recording Studios along Foreshore Road ( now Marcus Garvey Drive ) , he presented it to producers Ken and Paul Khouri . <p> DRAMATIC TURN <p> But things took a dramatic turn , as Smith related to me in an interview years ago . <p> " I basically presented myself as a songwriter because I did n't see myself as a vocalist . I told them I had this song , and could they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a band coming there at 2 o'clock . Why do n't you just stay and sing it ? ' And that 's how I got into the business , " said Smith . <p> The tear-jerking ballad not only launched Smith 's career , but became a sure hit with audiences all over the island . <p> Its effect was felt abroad , some seven to eight years later , when Johnny Nash did a lovers ' rock cover version under the title Tears on My Pillow . <p> It was for Smith , an unfortunate title change which created some royalty mixup , since there was another song with that same title by the group Little Anthony and the Imperials . <p> In Jimmy James ' case , he presented his composition of Bewildered and Blue to producer Lyndon Pottinger of Tip-Top records . <p> Inter-cepting him on one of his visits to Jamaica , he said , " Dem time deh , everybody a write songs , so when I write the song and went to Herman Sang , I told him , ' I just write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer .

Andy also wrote Marcia Griffiths ' early recordings , jumpstarting her career . <p> Andy also wrote Delroy Wilson 's 1966 semi-rocksteady tearjerker , It 's Impossible , in which he had Wilson pleading : <p> Wherever you may be , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise and know that you were wrong <p> ' Cause I ca n't love another , no matter how I try <p> ' Cause it 's impossible . <p> Two years later , he wrote for Griffiths and himself the romantically charged Coxson-produced hit , Always Together . <p> Rewinding to the mento era of the early 1950s , we find the story of a man named Everard F. Williams who wrote for various artistes some 80 per cent of mento hit recordings . <p> Although his writings have never been fully ventilated , they can not be taken lightly , as they form the basis for the perpetuity of one of Jamaica 's national treasures - mento music , Jamaica 's first commercially recorded popular music , and its only indigenous brand . <p> Williams ' lyrics were mainly informative social commentaries , laced with humour and ambiguity and delivered in flowing poetry : <p> When the rainy weather was raising cane <p> The dry weather house could n't take the strain <p> All the house began to leak <p> And the whole foundation squeak . <p> Dry weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay , someone pay mi rent . <p> It is estimated that Williams wrote some 50 songs for The Chin 's Calypso Sextet , The Ticklers , Hubert Porter , Count Lasher and others . <p> His humour , ambiguity and suggestiveness is particularly poignant in the recording , Big Boy , where the title character questions his teacher . <p> Is catty high , is catty low ? <p> Will catty stand up to any blow ? <p> Is catty deep , is catty wide ? <p> Is catty something that I can ride ? <p> Williams then concludes the recording with the teacher 's response : <p> Catty is the same as pussy cat <p> That is sleeping on the mat . <p> It would perhaps take some half-dozen articles to delve into Williams ' heroics as a songwriter for other artistes , but his take on Monkey 's refusal to accept humans as their descendants is very interesting :

@@4620240 <h> What does it mean to be a signatory to a Hague convention ? <p> The recent report of plans to review the adoption laws and the procedure for adopting children in Jamaica is welcome news . There are many frustrated adopters who may consider restarting the process and still others who steered clear of pursuing their desire due to their perception that the process is tedious . <p> From the perspective of the Child Development Agency and the Adoption Board , the adoptions that are difficult are the ones that are arranged privately . In other words , although all adoptions must proceed through the Child Development Agency , rather than allowing the Child Development Agency to match an adopter with a child , many persons identify a child who they wish to adopt and then make the necessary application to the Child Development Agency . It is these cases , they say , that have the most hiccups . <p> Also high on the list of problematic adoptions are those in which the adopters wish to emigrate with the child . In the case of adopters from the United States of America ( for example ) , one important criterion is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition of ' orphan ' as set out in the United States Immigration and Nationality Act . Under that extended definition of ' orphan ' , the child must either have no living parents , or a sole or surviving parent who is unable to care for that child and has irrevocably consented , in writing , for the child to be adopted . <p> Many Jamaican children who are available for adoption may not properly fit within the definition of orphan . However , if Jamaica was a signatory to The Hague Convention of May 29 , 1993 on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption ( Hague Adoption Convention ) , potential adopters from the United States of America would not have to overcome that hurdle to adopt a child . Different considerations would apply , such as the fact that both of the child 's parents could be alive at the time of the adoption . Provided that they are incapable of caring for the child , and irrevocably consent to the termination of their legal relationship with the child and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted . <p> Protect children , families <p> I have often questioned why Jamaica is not one of the contracting states to The Hague Convention . I would love to know the answer , since the convention is intended to protect " children and their families against the risks of illegal , irregular , premature or ill-prepared adoptions abroad . " The convention also seeks to promote the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child ( Art . 21 ) and " to ensure that inter-country adoptions are made in the best interest of the child with respect for his or her fundamental rights . It also seeks to prevent the abduction , sale or traffic in children " . <p> From my perspective , it would seem that the objectives of the convention are compatible with Jamaica 's desire to secure our children 's welfare - to prevent unlawful adoptions and human trafficking . From my experience , it is often the relatives of Jamaicans living in the diaspora who wish to adopt Jamaican children . I , therefore , ask whether those efforts could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

But he will not be coming alone . As it happens , Ngugi wa Thiong'o has been working hard at the ensuring a remarkable future for African writing by fathering two up-and-coming writers , the novelist Wanjuki wa Ngugi and the poet and novelist Mukoma wa Ngugi . The three writers will share the stage for the very first time anywhere at Calabash 2014 reading from their recent works and representing the rich and expanding tradition in African writing . <p> Ngugi wa Thiong'o belongs to a small and impressive group of writers whose fictional work is matched easily by their contribution to larger socio-political and intellectual thoughts about the world in which we live . Ngugi 's most recent books include two volumes of a planned three-part memoir , Dreams in a Time of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of the Interpreter ( 2012 ) , which trace the development of this fiery and often controversial writer who famously declared in 1986 that he would devote himself to writing exclusively in his native language , Gikuyu . It has been widely recognised that the three novels by Ngugi that are in fact translations from the original Gikuyu , namely A Devil on the Cross , Matigari and Wizard of the Crow constitute some of the most innovative examples of modern fiction coming out of Africa . This prolific author has never slowed down in his scholarly and literary output and his work continues to shape areas of academic scholarship like post-colonial literature . <p> The son and daughter of Ngugi who have discovered their own passion for writing are creating their own reputations for trying to chart the experience of Africans on the continent and abroad . Wanjiku 's wa Ngugi 's debut novel , The Fall of Angels , leaps with lively abandon into the world of the thriller with a New York-based soccer mom caught up in a complex of human trafficking and other criminal intrigues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys . Wanjiku wa Ngugi is credited for the multiple twists and turns in a plot that has excited readers of the genre and others .

Mukoma , in many interviews , shows himself to be a serious scholar , activist and thinker on matters pertaining to world culture and the position of Africa . He has published several books already including a highly praised collection of poems , Hurling Words at Consciousness . He is also the author , most recently , of the novels , Black Star Nairobi ( Melville , 2013 ) , and Nairobi Heat ( Melville , 2011 ) .

What could be called the climax of the event took place Saturday evening at Trinidad 's Academy for the Performing Arts when the prestigious OCM Bocas Prize ( and Hollick Arvon Prize ) was awarded . <p> The OCM Bocas Prize includes an award of US$10,000 and has two stages . First , panels of distinguished judges vet three genres separately - poetry , fiction , and non-fiction - and determine the best books in each category . Next , the chairs of the poetry , fiction , and non-fiction panels , joined by the overall chair and vice-chair of the prize , form a final prize jury to select the overall winner from the three genre winners . If it sounds confusing , it is . <p> The announcement of the award was preceded by short pre-recorded videos by the three winners . Poetry winner Lorna Goodison spoke about her book of poetry , Oracabessa , saying that " a lot of the poems are informed by an engagement with fine art " ( Goodison is also a painter ) and with outsiders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antoni discussed his novel As Flies to Whatless Boys , noting that he did n't wish to write a strict historical novel but , rather , an intimate family portrait . Further , he said , " it 's up to us to take our place on the world stage , " meaning , as he explained later , that Caribbean writers have to continue raising the bar , to demand the best of themselves and of each other . " It 's the only way our art will grow , " Antoni later commented . Speaking of his award-winning and nominated non-fiction work Writing Down the Vision : Essays and Prophecies , Kei Miller indicated he would always think of himself as a Caribbean writer and said " that 's where my imagination resides " . Miller 's recording ended with beautiful lines that appear in a powerful reflection on homophobic violence in Jamaica , a piece he later read from on the last day of the festival . <p> The presenter of the OCM Bocas , no less than Linton Kwesi Johnson , indicated " the selection was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge only once before , for the Whitbread award . He described Antoni 's novel as a " humouress and poignant tall tale " and Goodison 's Oracabessa as a " fine accomplished collection of poems which was written at the height of her craft and which complements her memoir Harvey River . He underscored the power and importance of Kei Miller 's writing and vision . <p> When Antoni was called to the stage as winner , he thanked his publisher , Johnny Temple of Akashic Books , as well as fellow writers Goodison and Miller . He recounted that Goodison had told him the day before " you ca n't compare oranges and mangos . " Antoni 's acceptance speech was brief . He then announced he would split the award money between all three writers . <p> Antoni 's decision was unprecedented but seemed to make perfect sense . What poet in the Caribbean , or anywhere else for that matter , could go up against Goodison at this point ? Fittingly , perhaps , Oracabessa is dedicated to maybe the only person who could , Derek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 and in attendance at the ceremony , as were former winners Earl Lovelace and Monique Roffey . And who has surpassed Miller for challenging the damaging silence around untold stories and truths ? <p> In a later interview with me , Antoni claimed that Bocas is the best thing to have happened to Trinidad . Attendance at the festival makes quick sense of his claim . The festival is full of workshops , interviews , readings , and lectures , and includes a wide range of considerations and topics - from the literary to historical to sociological and much more . Certainly much of the festival 's success is due to the work of the festival 's programme director , Nicholas Laughlin , who creates , with the work of many others , a tightly penetrating schedule of some of the best minds . This year , the programme included options as diverse as a stimulating interview conducted by scholar Gabrielle Hosein with Guyanese-American writer Gaiutra Bahadur , author of Coolie Woman ( a groundbreaking work about social history and family which focuses on Bahadur 's great-grandmother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently nominated for the George Orwell Prize , and a debate on crime and violence in Trinidad . <p> However , Antoni also made it clear again that three genres ca n't be put together in the same prize category and suggested maybe Bocas could perhaps rethink how and also when it gives the award . His ideas prompted a reflection of Samantha John 's words , host of the Bocas announcement ceremony , who indicated that the Bocas prizes are not national prizes but prizes which seek to recognise the Caribbean as a family . <p> Perhaps it is not surprising that Antoni 's As Flies to Whatless Boys focuses on and grows out of a consideration of family . The backdrop of the novel is 19th-century German inventor John Adolphus Etzler who created a Tropical Emigration Society ( TES ) , circa 1845 , in London and travelled to Trinidad with poor families and idealists in the hope of setting up a socialist utopian community . <p> Antoni referred in interview to Etzler as a great visionary but indicated that not much had been written about the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antoni spent 15 years researching and writing the novel and accumulated much information about Etzler , though it is the William Tucker family ( part of Antoni 's own ancestry ) who emigrates to Trinidad with other members of the TES which provides the real core of the work . <p> When asked about his own background and upbringing , Antoni offered one word : " confused " . He said he was born in Detroit by mistake to parents originally from Trinidad . When Antoni was two , he moved back to Trinidad and , then , to the Bahamas . Around the age of 14 , Antoni started returning to Trinidad , where he still has family , and , at one point , lived there for a couple of years . He was educated in the US , lived in Barcelona for several years , as well as Miami , and presently resides in New York . When asked if he felt if he were part of the writing community in Trinidad , Antoni was definite . " Yes . Certainly . They are my community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the launch of As Flies to Whatless Boys in Trinidad , has always insisted on Antoni 's Caribbeanness . Antonti claimed his major influences are William Faulkner , Gabriel Garc ? a M ? rquez , James Joyce , Shakespeare , Toni Morrison and Jean Rhys . <p> Amongst other publications and literary accomplishments , in 1991 , Antoni published his first novel , Divina Trace , for which he was awarded , in 1992 , the Commonwealth Writers ' Prize for best first novel . In 1997 , he published his second novel , Blessed is the Fruit , and in 2005 , his third , Carnival . When asked what he was working on at the moment , Antoni replied , " Not a thing . " <p> Attending this year 's NGC Bocas Lit Fest , including the ceremony which announced the OCM Bocas Prize , revealed not only the wealth of talent but also the vibrant interlocking arts of the Caribbean .

The festival , which took place in New York City April 28 , 2014 to May 4 , 2014 , followed the PEN American Centre 's tradition of highlighting freedom of expression and the fostering of cross-cultural dialogue among writers , artists and citizens around the globe and saw over 100 writers from 30 nations participating in a wide range of activities including readings , debates , one-on-one conversations , participatory workshops and performances throughout the city . <p> The annual Pen World Voices Festival is the brainchild of celebrated author Salman Rushdie , then-president of the PEN American Centre , who , in 2004 , had the idea of initiating an international literature festival in New York City - something which had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with writers from around the world , offering first-hand cultural and political experience from different countries and offering a vantage point from which to develop a deeper understanding of the intellectual landscape around the world . It is the only international literary festival in the US , and the only festival with a human rights focus and , over the course of the last 10 years , has presented over 1,500 writers and artists from 78 countries , speaking 56 languages . <p> This year 's 10th anniversary theme was ' On the Edge ' and got underway , despite the inclement weather , with a series of short politically focused speeches by prominent international writers at the full-to-capacity Great Hall at Cooper Union . Highlights , for me , were outgoing chairman Rushdie 's quietly passionate speech , which addressed the parliamentary election in India and the recent efforts in the country to suppress speech ; the Syrian poet Adonis , who is annually considered one of the favorites to win the Nobel Prize , and who read his work in Arabic , his voice vibrating with fury while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; Rushdie 's successor , author Colm T ? ibin 's stirring essay about living as a gay man in Barcelona during and after the time of General Franco 's death ; and the Tanzanian political cartoonist Gado , a lovely man who was staying at my hotel and who introduced himself and engaged my fellow Caribbean writers and I in thoughtful conversation in the hotel lobby later that night . His presentation at the opening was especially trenchant , speaking in concert with a slide show of his provocative work , which pillories everything from the storied Chinese investment in Africa ( of particular interest to this Jamaican who is concerned with the future of Goat Islands ) to racism . <p> I was singularly thrilled to be asked to be part of this year 's festival , which included two other writers from the Caribbean region , Barbara Jenkins of Trinidad and Tobago and Joanne Hillhouse of Antigua .

Women writers , we agreed , did n't need the unnecessary nastiness and competition .

This year the safari saw 19 writers paired with 19 hosts in their private apartments , for simultaneous readings in intimate salon-style settings with itinerant audiences who , armed with maps , checked out readers of particular interest to them in the various apartments whose front doors were adorned with yellow balloons to indicate where readings were being held , and asked questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Pia and Bobby Harden , a genetically-blessed interracial couple ( she 's a TV writer and he 's a musician ) who fed me after the readings and engaged me in convo as though we were old friends . <p> Readings are tricky .

I was slightly nervous because it would be my first international audience , completely outside of my sphere of reference . When I read in Trinidad in 2012 , at least I knew they were Caribbean people who 'd understand my accent , where I 'm coming from , etc .

@@4633237 <h> Tariff suspensions to make smartphones cheaper for Jamaicans <p> The Council of Trade and Economic Development of CARICOM has granted approval for Jamaica to suspend the Common External Tariff ( CET ) now charged on smartphones , paving the way for the removal of the 20 per cent duty on such devices as of July 1 . <p> In making the announcement by way of a statement to the House of Representatives yesterday , Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips said the decision to remove the duty was taken in light of " the increasing use of smartphones to enhance business communications and operations generally and the resultant improvement in productivity " . <p> It is the second time in two months that the Government has removed duties on electronic devices which are used as phones and computers . <p> Last month , Parliament gave permission for the 20 per cent duty charged on phablets - phone tablets - to be removed . <p> At the time , the minister said that with the rapid changes in technology , it was felt that the classification was prejudicial , as many tablets had similar characteristic to phablets . <p> He said it was therefore felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same as computers , therefore granting duty-free concession status . <p> STAMP DUTY ADJUSTED <p> In the meantime , Phillips said further to consultations with players in the hospitality sector , the additional stamp duty that is payable on alcoholic beverages would be reduced . The specific additional stamp duty regime on alcoholic beverages - wines , liqueurs and cordial - is to be decreased from US$1.60 to US$1.00 per litre , while the specific additional stamp duty on beers is to be reduced from US$0.90 to US$0.60 . <p> The revenue measure will become effective on June 1 . <p> Phillips said Cabinet made the decision after it was recognised that the unification of tax rates would have put undue burden on the tourism sector . <p> Parliament recently approved modifications of the alcohol regime to unify the special consumption tax ( SCT ) , which now applies to alcoholic beverages . The measure will see a duty of $1,120 per litre of pure alcohol being paid on such beverages . At present , overproof white rum attracts an SCT of $960 per litre of pure alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per litre of pure alcohol rate . The imposition of the rate on the tourism sector was delayed by a month . <p> The minister said the Stamp Duty Act is to be amended to provide for a reduction in additional stamp duty on alcoholic beverages . He said a rigorous calculation of the revenue to be garnered from the alcohol measures revealed that significantly more revenue would be received . <p> He told Parliament that in order to minimise the impact on the tourism sector , the Government is embarking on the reduction of additional stamp duty in the amount of $200 million . <p> SHAW WANTS MORE <p> While he welcomed the announcement , Audley Shaw , the opposition spokesman on finance , said the Government should go further and roll back duties , as local rum producers have been made uncompetitive as a result of the new regime . <p> Tax changes have also been proposed for laws governing the free zone and business process outsourcing ( BPO ) , as well as the tourism , subsector . <p> Shaw said the Government would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fiscal incentives regime . <p> The aim of the amendments , as proposed by Phillips , is to provide general consumption tax concession that was previously enjoyed on goods and services by free zones , in particular BPO entities and the tourism accommodation subsector . <p> Among the measures that are to take effect is the expansion of the inputs allowed as productive inputs relief to include motor vehicles to certain sectors . The amendments will provide for a 100 per cent relief in relation to the CET chargeable on motor vehicles . <p> The sector currently pays CET of 20 per cent . <p> Under the new regime , the rent-a-car sector will be allowed to import up to 800 vehicles per year ; contract carriage operators can import a maximum 50 vehicles per year ; and tour operators will be able to import a maximum 20 vehicles per year .

My problem is that her mother gave her another man 's name and now I need to do an amendment or add my name to her birth certificate ASAP . I know I have to do a DNA test . <p> I already know she is mine and she has been living with my parents from she was two years of age . I spoke to someone in the court system and they told me that in order to do anything I will have to find the man whose name is on her birth certificate . I have two months to make all this happen and I live in the States . <p> Someone told me something about just adding my name and keeping her current one . Is this possible ? <p> I must , before I go into the substance of your letter , deal with the fact that your daughter being now 18 years of age , is an adult . As a consequence of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another man by her mother as her father at the registration if her birth , she must in her own right be a part of it . <p> So if you are applying for a declaration of paternity , apart from her mother consenting to your application , your daughter must also consent or join you in your application . As she is an adult , you can not apply for her passport , she must do so herself . <p> I can not help but wonder why you all waited so long before trying to do anything about this . You must have known since she was a baby or at least when she was about two years old when she went to live with your parents . You all must have had sight of the contents of her birth certificate and you could have applied easily and simply for the entry of this other man 's name to be altered to yours and to also have your particulars included in the register . <p> Anyway , you say you have two months to act as you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to sort out the necessary documentation , an important part of which must be proof that you are in fact her father . <p> The first way to achieve your goal is that you should of course apply ( or cause the application to be prepared and filed on your behalf by a lawyer acting for you ) to the Family Court for a declaration of paternity and consequential orders . This should be done in the court that serves the parish in which your daughter resides with your parents , or that in which her mother resides . Her mother will , of course , be the defendant named in your application as she caused the wrong man to be registered as the child 's father . It should be explained to the intake officer of the court that your application would be a consent order application based on your admission of paternity ( with your DNA result in hand to make assurances sure , if you have it and so save time ) ; and the mother and your daughter should be encouraged to attend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternity . Consequent upon these being done , the earliest date for the hearing of the application could be arranged with the assistance of the officers of the court . <p> However , both the mother and your daughter should also attend the hearing of the matter and personally attest to their consent to your application in the course of the proceedings in court . If you are all present on the date set for the hearing and meet the required evidential burden and those who should give their consents do so clearly and freely , then your application ought to be granted that day , and the declaration of your paternity and the necessary consequential orders for the rectification of the entry in the register would also be made then and there . Directions should be requested of the judge that the formal declaration and order be drawn up and submitted for signature that same day because of the urgency of yours and your daughter 's situation . Once sealed copies ( ask for two ) are delivered to you , you can then rush off to the Registrar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the register to be effected .. <p> Another way you can try , is that there is provision in the Registration ( Births and Deaths ) Act that at any time after the registration of the birth of a child and a father 's name is not registered as it ought to have been entered in the register , that you and the mother of your daughter can do a joint statutory declaration in which you both acknowledge the fact that you are the father of your daughter and apply for your name to be entered as such . If the Registrar General is satisfied with the declaration and any other evidence required had been produced ( eg the consent of your daughter to your registration as her father , she being now an adult ) the Registrar General may authorise such an entry of your name and particulars as the father . <p> However , I suspect that this provision may be interpreted to relate only to instances when no name of a father appears in the register . You should , however , go to the Registrar General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting such a declaration from you and the mother and a supporting one of your daughter to get noted on it as the father . They may also require a statutory declaration of the man named and registered as the father , but it is for them to decide what they would deem to be satisfactory . I can not say anything definitive about what their conclusion would be , though I do have a good idea what it would be . <p> Lastly , there is also the provision in the Act relating to the correction of errors in registers of births and in registration and entry books . The correction you want is not of a clerical error , which is done on the authority of the Registrar General by the officer designated for the purpose . <p> Your error is an error of substantial fact , and for such errors the Act provides that they can be corrected by entries being made in the margin but without any alteration of the original birth entry , by the officer who has custody of the particular book . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alteration should be paid and that you , as the applicant for the connection of the error , should go to the office with a statutory declaration in which you have stated what the error in your daughter 's birth entry is , and what the true facts are and what you are applying to be done . The mother must also make a similar statutory declaration and I would suggest , so must your daughter , and one or two other credible persons who know the truth of your paternity and how the other man come to be registered as father . <p> If the Registrar General 's Department is satisfied with the contents of the statutory declarations , then they may act under this provision in the Act . You must realise , of course , that the means which is absolutely certain of success is a declaration of paternity made by the Family Court , where such an application would be dealt with quicker than one made to the Supreme Court . <p> As your time is short , please arrange that your application and the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter are done and filed and arranged in the Family Court as quickly as possible on your behalf . I therefore strongly suggest that you retain the services of an attorney to assist you with the application and all that must be done to ensure that your application is successful in the quickest possible time . <p> I wish you and your daughter the very best and hope you proceed with your paternity application immediately and that you succeed . <p> The contents of this article are for informational purposes only and must not be relied upon as an alternative to legal advice from your own attorney . <h> Comments <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@4633239 <h> Columns <h> Towards a new development trajectory in the Caribbean <p> WITH the untimely passing of Norman Girvan , the last Caribbean political economist of the earlier critical tradition , a major gap in radical ideas needs to be filled . These ideas must come from a new generation of researchers willing to take the lead , and who have the practical problems of the region at the heart of their concerns , drawing on Girvan 's and others ' very rich insights . <p> Indeed , the history of the English-speaking Caribbean has been punctuated by several important opportunities for learning and transformation . One of these most recent experiences should indeed have been the Economic Partnership Agreement ( EPA ) , yet to be fully implemented in some jurisdictions . The end of preferential access to European markets had several precursors for which it seemed Caribbean policymakers , institutions and the private sector were ill-prepared . <p> The expansion of the European Union and global economic restructuring , based on World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) rules , meant that preferential trade access was untenable . Indeed , in several respects , the WTO and other multilateral agencies have not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experiences of transformation in richer countries . However , it might have done past leaders and policymakers well to lay the groundwork for inter-generational dialogue and put in place mechanisms for institutional learning . Indeed , existing perennial challenges have implications for structural change that is necessary for development in the Caribbean . <p> Caribbean economic institutions have experimented with various strategies and organisational forms to stimulate economic growth . From state-driven industrialisation , to import substitution , infant industry protection -- somewhat derailed by global rules -- industrialisation by invitation , trade-centric growth , and new forms of liberalisation have had mixed results at best . Industrialisation , to a large extent , has been premature , except in the larger states , like Trinidad and Tobago , Suriname , Belize , and to a lesser extent Jamaica . These varied approaches have been consistent with the ebbs and flows of the global economy into which the region has long been integrated . Notwithstanding the radical approaches advocated by the New World Group , it has been difficult to identify a distinctive and truly self-sustaining model . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts -- that have hitherto been misunderstood or ignored -- that could potentially have a transformative effect in fashioning fit-for-purpose economic institutions . The impetus for such learning and hopeful transition seems to be absent or fragmented . There is thus a need to draw upon these various experiences as inputs in formulating a new paradigm . <p> For the private sector , the situation is indeed very complex and dire , as historical regimes tend to create path dependencies , resulting in inflexible structures and risk aversion . Existing economic structures produce particular opportunities for investment given globally integrated supply chains , over which small developing countries have little control . East Asian countries have , however , shown over time that they can break away from these rigid structures and become global players through effective learning mechanisms and economic strategies . Thus , all is not lost . These complexities demonstrate that adopting a learning approach through understanding historical constraints , tapping into resources , forging appropriate partnerships , and incrementally creating advantages based upon existing technologies and niche product markets can be a game-changer for the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and systems that support such technologies would not bring about desired results . To build capacities requires time , effort , understanding and investment . <p> Indeed , investment is crucial to acquire technologies and develop human capital in order to innovate . In the present economic circumstances , regional states may not have access to customised financial instruments for innovation projects . Additionally , the markets for innovative products and services from the Caribbean need to be identified , if not created . On both of these fronts , brokering partnerships with Caribbean expatriates who own and operate firms , consultancies , and who belong to business associations abroad can help boost productive capacity . Gaining relevant market intelligence , serving as intermediaries to penetrate new markets and sources of risk capital and knowledge to diversify product/service offerings are some benefits . <p> In the final analysis , putting the Caribbean on a new growth trajectory requires optimising these important assets , a focus on learning , and releasing unproductive hang-ups .

If temperature falls below 2.5 celsius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to Food . <p> Heron says that the dry-ageing process breaks down the collagen that holds all of the muscle fibres together which can make a steak tough . The process changes beef by two means . First , moisture evaporates from the muscles , and this creates a greater concentration of beef flavour and taste . Second , the beef 's natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscles , which leads to a more tender beef . <p> The process of dry-ageing forms an external ' crust ' on the meat 's surface , which is trimmed off when the meat is prepared for cooking . The process complements the natural enzymes in the beef by helping to tenderise and increase the flavour of the meat .

This is particularly true if it 's a ' bagasse ' board , accountable to no one . <p> As minister of environment and housing , Easton Douglas announced in 1995 that the Government had started to develop a policy for controlling access to Jamaica 's beaches .

So I really do n't have much faith in the capacity of the NRCA to protect the public interest . <p> CONSPIRACY THEORISTS <p> Two Sundays ago , I watched that episode of Anthony Bourdain 's travel series , ' Parts Unknown ' , which focused on Jamaica . Avoiding the well-known all-inclusive hotels in and around MoBay , Bourdain turned to Portland , where Jamaica 's upscale tourist industry started . And he did n't paint the usual portrait of the island as ' paradise ' . He got it right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . The programme was n't aired on CNN in Jamaica . Conspiracy theorists immediately came up with a wicked explanation . It was because Flow is owned by Michael Lee-Chin . He came off so badly in the show that he stopped the company from airing it . <p> When I checked with Flow , I learned that CNN sends targeted feeds to different markets . We get the Latin American and Caribbean feed . Bourdain 's show is not on our feed . It 's now on Vimeo.com . Hopefully , either TVJ or CVM will negotiate the rights to air the episode . We all need to see it . It 's not a pretty picture of our country . The landscape is beautiful and the food is appetising . But the disparity between the rich and poor is rather ugly . <p> " WHAT KIND OF PERSON ? " <p> Perhaps Michael Lee-Chin should have been much more cautious about exposing himself to Bourdain . This is how Bourdain introduces him : " There are those who believe that the area can come back ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels and resorts and restaurants for wealthy visitors as it once was . <p> " Take this place , for instance : the Trident hotel . Expensive , luxurious ! Best of all , I 'm the only guest . Oh , did I mention that it comes with a castle ? What kind of person would own a building like that ? Who ? Why ? Then this man arrived and kind of answered that question . All of this belongs to Michael Lee-Chin . Local boy-turned-billionaire . One of the richest men in the world . And my host . He 's invited me for dinner . " <p> With guests like Bourdain , you do n't need gatecrashers . Down the road at GoldenEye , St Mary , Chris Blackwell , another host , gets the full Bourdain treatment . It 's a case of show me your friends .

" <p> Apparently forgetting that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly . One of the insistent fishermen tries to tell the truth as he sees it .

Mi seh just stop buct talk ! " Bradshaw forces the fisherman out of the interview . And then descends into a pseudo-philosophical rant on " tolerance " ! <p> The star of Bourdain 's show is Cynthia who , with her partner Dennis , runs a cookshop on Winnifred Beach in Portland . It 's the only public beach for miles . The Urban Development Corporation ( UDC ) tried to capture the beach for private use , promising that the public would still have access .

However , five years later those amendments are yet to be debated in Parliament . <p> Grant argued that the delay in enacting the legislative changes to the operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars in lost revenue . <p> " We have come to the place now that courier services have taken the space of the postal service in package delivery , and from where we sit I do n't think the Government is recognising the revenue that it is losing because of the lack of necessary transformation , " stressed Grant . <p> " Private entities that are doing mail and courier services should be paying a licence fee to the Post and Telecoms Department , and from my understanding those fees are not being collected .

@@4661237 <h> Academic accreditation : truths and falsehoods <p> I start off the discussion with an article by Dr Witford Reid in The Sunday Gleaner of September 7 , 2014 . Dr Reid , who obviously in his article is speaking on behalf of Northern Caribbean University ( NCU ) - the former West Indies College - raises two concerns . The first having to do with the University Council of Jamaica and Northern Caribbean University and the second having to do with University of the West Indies . <p> In the first concern , obviously seeking to advance the cause of NCU , Dr Reid states " that NCU was the first institution to obtain accreditation from the UCJ for two of its science degrees . During the ensuing years , the University of Technology ( UTech ) came on board , and as they say , the rest is history . For eight to 10 years , NCU was the only tertiary institution with accredited degrees from the UCJ . UTech started after it received university status " . <p> I must begin by addressing many of the errors in Dr Reid 's paper . It is important to get our dates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to Dr Reid 's paper . <p> Error No. 1 : The first tertiary institution to receive UCJ accreditation was the Jamaica Theological Seminary , which , under its then president , Dr Noelliste , received accreditation in March 1991 for two programmes : the BA in arts and the BTh in theology . <p> Error No. 2 : The College of Arts , Science and Technology ( CAST ) , before it became UTech in 1995 , received accreditation for its Bachelor of ( Electrical ) Engineering degree programme in May 1991 . <p> Error No. 3 : The Northern Caribbean University - mid-level associate degree programmes - the ASc in biology and the ASc in business administration were accredited in October 1991 . These were not the first to be accredited by UCJ , as claimed by Dr Reid . <p> Error No. 4 : Several other institutions , for example , the Caribbean Graduate School of Theology ( CGST ) - first accredited in April 1993 - were accredited during the early years of the UCJ accreditation process . UCJ was established in 1988 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process mentioned under Error No. 2 above . The UCJ was formally established in July 1988 under a JLP administration . The government changed in 1989 , and the new minister of education was initially suspicious of the UCJ concept of accreditation and the fact that CAST had been established as a degree-granting institution . He had initially been sold on an earlier PNP concept of the idea of an umbrella organisation known as the College of Jamaica . <p> The chairman of UCJ ( Dr Irvine ) was removed and a new chairman , Dr Keith Panton , the president of Alcan , appointed . Dr Panton used his two positions to reject the legitimacy of the CAST BEng engineering degree for Alcan employees in terms of their equivalence with the UWI BSc Eng degree . CAST decided to use the UCJ accreditation process as a test case .

These were : that both the CAST degree-granting process was nationally reputable and that the degree was accredited and technically equivalent to that of UWI for Alcan . <p> UCJ Accreditation of UWI Programmes <p> I now return to Dr Reid 's second concern . He alleges that the UWI has adopted an arrogant academic attitude in not seeking accreditation from the national accrediting body , the University Council of Jamaica ( UCJ ) . Some history is important . <p> The University College of the West Indies ( UCWI ) was established in September 1948 . For the early days of its life , UCWI was an associated college of London University . The umbilical cord to London University was formally cut in 1962 under the leadership of vice-chancellor and campus principal , Sir Arthur Lewis , with UWI being established in its own right . This would have been 26 years before the UCJ was established . UWI could well have given some guidance to the UCJ . <p> National , regional and long-established universities such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have their historical legitimacy and credible procedures to justify their standards . Clearly , UWI needs to maintain its standards , but its history has proven this to be so , and where academic and professional standards are tested , these are normally tested by professional organisations such as those in medicine , engineering , architecture , dentistry , etc.

After three days of torturous miscommunication and bad vibes , I left halfway through the workday one day with my tail between my legs . Dear God , get me out of this . Battered and bruised , I felt I had lost my mojo . The depression was particularly acute because I could never imagine that I would ever be sad in Paris . After all , one only need slip down a side street , look around at the well- balanced architecture , order a glass of wine or savour some sweet pastry to be made whole .

And so off we were to the outskirts of the city : the Bois de Boulogne Park . Sixty-seven euros later , we arrived at this spectacular glass spaceship that seemed about to take flight . <p> Anchored on girders of wood and iron , there are dozens of billowing sails of glass reflecting the natural light and the green park in various ways . The voluptuous swirls are perched over a pool of water which reflects the building while the building reflects back as if the water and the structure are in dialogue .

Audaciously , as of this past October , the much-anticipated Louis Vuitton Foundation Contemporary Arts Museum ( $143m ) can justifiably be added to this well-worn must-see list . <p> The Vuitton Contemporary Arts Museum is the first privately funded major cultural institution in France .

There was one man who put a small photograph of his newborn baby underneath a tile . There was another who left his urine DNA in the cement .

@@4663238 <h> Columns <h> Stronger US dollar and lower oil prices : Effects on the Caribbean <p> CARIBBEAN countries whose value is fixed to the United States dollar should benefit , at least in the short term , from the fall in oil prices and the strengthening of the American currency . Oil prices fell to below US$65 a barrel for the first time in five years , while the US dollar strengthened against every major currency , including China 's yuan . <p> In a general sense , the reduction in the oil price will benefit all countries , particularly the developed nations whose working population will have more disposable income and will spend more on goods and services , such as tourism . In turn , this will help to rejuvenate economies worldwide for as long as the oil price remains low . <p> The further and specific benefits to countries whose currencies are linked to the US dollars should come in three important ways . <p> First , the cost of energy has been among the biggest and most variable costs bedevilling every business in the Caribbean , especially manufacturing and tourism . Lower prices for oil -- if governments and oil-importing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of energy to businesses , improving their financial performance . On that basis , businesses should rally their profitability and either pay more taxes to the government or expand their operations , including by employing more people . Consequently , domestic economies should improve to some extent . <p> Second , since less US dollars will be needed to pay for oil imports than over the last five years or so , the foreign exchange reserves of these governments should increase ; bettering their capacity to pay for all their imports . <p> Third , the debt of most Caribbean countries is denominated in US dollars . The major exception is the debt to China that is linked to the yuan . When , in recent years , the value of the yuan was increasing against the US dollar , this was a worry . Now that the yuan has weakened against the dollar , servicing the Chinese debt should be easier , though it might not be a long-term prospect . <p> Taking the second and third points above the foreign currency exposure of the countries , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US dollar , will be considerably improved -- at least for now . <p> In the Caribbean , the countries with fixed exchange rates to the US dollar are : Antigua and Barbuda , The Bahamas , Barbados , Belize , Dominica , Grenada , St Kitts-Nevis , St Lucia , and St Vincent and the Grenadines . They are members of the Caribbean Community ( Caricom ) along with Haiti , Guyana , Jamaica , Trinidad and Tobago , and Suriname . The currencies of the latter-named countries float against the US dollar , so they are unlikely to be affected in the same way from the strengthened US dollar . <p> If the governments and business sectors in the countries with fixed exchange rates take advantage of the lower price for oil , and the strengthened US dollar , by taking measure to boost their exports and their tourism , they will not only improve their foreign exchange situation , they could hedge against any future crisis in the global economy and in their own economies . <p> Of course , tourists from the European Union ( EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of their holidays to the Caribbean will rise since almost every hotel in the region quotes prices in US dollars . In this circumstance , hoteliers would be sensible to take advantage of cheaper energy prices to adjust their prices so as to continue to enjoy a significant share of the EU market while consolidating their place in the US . This calls for joint planning and implementation by the hotels and tourism authorities of all these countries , both individually and collectively . <p> In other words , to benefit both from lower oil prices and the currency peg to the US dollar , there must be greater investment by governments and the private sector in productivity so as to raise their competitiveness . <p> For those countries whose currencies are not pegged to the US dollar , their options are different . But , they too benefit from lower oil prices . Therefore , the productive sectors of their economies should enjoy a fillip to improve exports , uplift their private sector , and reduce the cost of living to the general population . They could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange reserves , both to service existing debt and to hedge against any future challenges to their economies . However , the strengthened US dollar will increase the price of imports from the US and the cost of tourism from Europe . The balance is that their exports to the US and their tourism from the US will profit . <p> In the Caribbean , there has always been a debate over whether or not exchange rates of currencies should be fixed . So , two further issues arise about currencies in the 15- nation Caricom community group which , in addition to the countries , already named in this article , include Montserrat , a British Overseas territory . <p> The first issue is one of devaluing their currencies . In a sense , for those countries whose currencies are not linked to the US dollar , a devaluation has actually occurred -- at least with the US . An actual devaluation , generally , while making their exports and tourism cheaper and more competitive , would place a greater burden on local currency liabilities and also raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank governors and ministries of finance will undoubtedly continue to consider carefully . <p> The second issue is the creation of a single currency for Caricom countries . This would not be an easy objective to achieve , though seven of them ( in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union ) already have it . It has been on the agenda of Caricom since 1990 , although a few years ago work toward its realisation was " paused " . However , if anything , the financial crisis of the last few years , and the present situation , suggests that constructive work on a single currency , or some alternative that would allow for greater currency co-operation , would better inform how Caricom countries could work together -- as they must -- to address the financial challenges of now and the future . <p> Sir Ronald Sanders is a consultant , senior fellow at London University and former Caribbean diplomat .
