But what we do is help organisations on how to effectively carry out corporate responsibility programs or projects . But the main thing is using Marketing as a tool that leads to development in Nigeria and Africa . <p> Who are your clients ? <p> The thing is that we have clients but I can ? ? ? t talk about them in order not to let out our plans . But I can talk about clients we ? ? ? ve had in the past . We ? ? ? ve worked with Oando on their Adopt A School Project . We were involved right from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you come about the Adopt A School Project ? <p> It came up during a training related to a program me we had with the NYSC .

We use marketing as a tool to achieve this . <p> Are you also involved in the implementation of these initiatives that you come up with ? <p> First of all , we carry out research on what projects are needed in a communities and the interest of the companies . Based on that , we can now device means through which the projects will be communicated to the companies . We then work together with the companies to see to the implementation of those projects . What are your plans to make sure that people have access to your services ? <p> What we do is to use the main media to reach people , especially with the popularity of the Website , people are dealing more with the global level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in our community .

The difference between ? our PR and those of other marketing outlets is that , we don ? ? ? t just use PR as a means of creating awareness , we also ? open the minds of our clients at a new , fresh , more effective ways of also creating awareness , which is also as effective as PR .

We also have partners but I can ? ? ? t really say anything about them now . But we have partners that we work with . <p> How are you coping with the complexity of the Nigerian Situation ? <p> First of all , one has to be passionate about what one is doing . Even when things are not happening the way I want it , I ? ? ? m still happy and confident about what I ? ? ? m doing .

That ? ? ? s why I have both the educational and professional background to work with the EDIF on development . I also have my Masters in Corporate Governance and Responsibility . So , I ? ? ? m not just doing it in a haphazard but professional manner . <p> Considering the nature of your job , have you ever been harassed by men ? <p> Not really , it depends on how you present yourself . That ? ? ? s why I take my time to dress appropriately at all times .

Like I said earlier , because I ? ? ? m passionate about what I do , I still enjoy it even when things are not working the way I want . Regrets only come when I ? ? ? m forced into doing what I don ? ? ? t want to do . <p> Do you do any sport ? <p> I love swimming and horse riding , going for walks with friends , ice skating .

@@1786235 <h> We own Yori Yori not Bishop -- Bracket <p> Source : nigeriafilms.com <p> The love of music brought the duo of Bracket together at the niversity of Nigeria , Nsuka . Nwachukwu Ozioko aka Vast and Alli Obumneme aka Smash have been great friends and their song Yori Yori keeps making the waves but lately the duo are embroiled in a controversy about who owns Yori Yori . Amobi Clems aka Bishop claims he wrote the song but the duo disagree and throw more light on the issue and insist the song belongs to them.Excerpts : <p> What informed the name Bracket ? The name came from K barrister who was actually meant to sponsor us but it did n't work out because then we had a very big crew and we never knew that it was just going to be the two of us . We had about ten of us in the group then so we just called it South Bracket . K barrister now said we should remove the " south " and we were left with Bracket . <p> How long have you been together ? Well , we have been together since 1999 although we had many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . We wanted to make it like G Unit , a foreign group . We wanted to be like Tupac and co . All we wanted then was to imitate them but we found out that this was not what Nigerians wanted because if you are African you have to play African music . <p> How did you guys meet ? We met through school shows , because we grew up in the same neighborhood at Nsuka very close to UNN . That was how we met . <p> Is Yori Yori your song ? Yes it is our songBut Bishop has been saying the song is his ... If it is his song , let him come and sing it and let us listen to his voice . You know we all have freedom of expression . You can say whatever you like . If he says he owns the song he should prove it . Although he was once a member of the group , but Yori Yori is not his song . The only thing he had in the song was the " rap " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Initially you guys said he left because of his studies .... so why did n't you just say he left the group ? <p> We did n't say that , because he was our brother and we did n't want anything that would dent his image . You see , even when he was not in the group we used to talk to him but recently maybe somebody advised him otherwise .... to blackmail us ... he just changed and he started saying that you guys said I went back to school but you drove me away from the group . So our management felt it 's high time we told the press our own side too . Basically the thing is between him and the management and not us . <p> Is he still your friend ? Yes he is , but he is the one going about painting the picture that we are enemies . You see we wanted to push this aside and move on . We wanted him to come to us and make us friends again but he went on listening to wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing as bad as wrong advice ... it kills . He should come to us and let 's talk as brothers . <p> What inspired Yori Yori ? It was the media . During the days of Happy day it was n't really good but because the media was still writing about us even when we were out of the scene for three years we thought we still had some things to offer , so we decided to do something special for our fans . That was when the inspiration came but we were n't really feeling it then and the same Bishop that is now making allegations against us said we should give it Faze ' beat and we told him we can not copy it . <p> He said we should give it to the producer to produce and God knows that we are telling the truth . Bistop never wrote a verse in the song aside the rap and it was cleaned off when he left the group . Honestly , it was him ( referring to Nwanchukwu ) that wrote the song . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he left the group . He could have said that too but thank God he left the group before we wrote that song . Bishop does n't write songs , so he should stop what he is saying and face his work . <p> What is your relationship like with P Square ? They are more like brothers to us . It 's been a long time we met them . Since we did the happy day song we have been friends . We call them our brothers . <p> Is music a family thing ? Alli : Yes it is in my family ... we love music because when my grandfather was still alive , you know he stayed alone in a very big compound . He would make drums , the local guitar and he played it all alone . Even when I was small I used to play music all alone too . <p> Nwachukwu : Mine started from the choir and also I had siblings who were in the choir too ... so I can say it 's a family thing too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It 's been a long time because when you are underground as an artiste and you have not made it you have a dream that one day you will get there . But we started taking it seriously when we released Happy Day . <p> Was there any objection from your parents ? Well sometimes , they would support you when it 's going well but when it 's no longer going well , they would then say " We do n't think this is really working out well , so go face your studies squarely . It was n't regular ... but they were so particular about our studies . <p> Was there a time you were so frustrated you wanted to pull out ? <p> Ha ... that happened a lot of times .... we had several experiences that almost made us pull out . Even before we did Yori Yori we wanted to go our separate ways . But by the grace of God we are still together .... unfortunately the third guy is no longer here and it was n't our fault but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what really happened then let it be . <p> Was there any event that really made you feel so bad ? <p> I remember when we went for Star Quest 2002 , it was so frustrating because we had no money and from UNN then we had to go to Enugu . We had to hustle for transport fare and what have you . Infact , we hoped we could win a prize and get money from there but we did n't win anything . We were left with nothing and dropped at the audition . <p> We went about borrowing money and we were insulted but some people helped us . Also , you know sometimes your parents wo n't give you attention because you are a musician . Sometimes we were unable to afford our school fees . So it 's very frustrating . But we still thank God for the experiences we had . <p> What is the main challenge you are facing now in the industry ? <p> The main challenge is that the face and the name grow bigger than the pocket . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artiste rises to a certain level some people see you as a god and people 's expectation for our next album would take a lot of hard work because people 's expectation right now about us is high . <p> How do you cope with female fans ? Well for that question we would say , business for business , pleasure for pleasure . <p> Are you into any relationships ? Nwachukwu : I do n't know about him o ! But as for me it is still complicated right now . <p> Alli : I 'm single but not searching.If you had not done music what would have done ? Alli : If I had not done music I could have been a lawyer . Though I 'm reading Psychology now . <p> Nwachukwu : Well I wanted to be like you , a Journalist . You know I am a Mass Communication student . <p> How has it been combining academics with music ? We thank God .... had it been that UNN was not on strike we could have finished this session and by next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but we are not . So it 's affecting us really bad . <p> Are you sure music has not affected your studies ? Of course it has because we are not always in class but we try to balance things and make sure we read and go for our exams . We make sure we go to class as frequently as we can . 
@@1786236 <h> Ajukwu : The Night Mask in Nigerian Politics <p> Dr. Chimalum Nwankwo In certain parts of my home State , there are great masquerades known for their multi-plex capabilities and potency as ancestral spirits at festival times . <p> Their characters and images speak to so many things at once . The Agaba and the Mgbedike probably top the list in their violent excursions , cult medicine aided , when gatherings demand agitation and the motions and gyrations associated with pain and pleasure at once . It is the funeral of a stalwart . <p> There is cosmic tragedy . Some festival of renewal with ancestral spirits is at play . It is , in short some kind of grand event.These are masquerades whose fanfares are abrasive and unapologetic . There is of course the Ijele , known for its excess and grandeur . <p> There is the stilt riding Izaga , elegant and ungainly at once.There is the Ojionu , whose restlessness whether at rest or in his prance of a dance and witty twits is another vortex of excess . There are quite a few remarkable others , and it is pointless to name or keep naming to exhaust the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they represent in relation to the cult of ancestors , muo , mmonwu , mmanwu . There is ? a dignity and pride they bring to all ceremonies and celebrations ... those cultic mysterious spirits . <p> I have not included in my list a masked spirit called the Ajukwu which operates only at nights . If he has dignity or pride , nobody knows . <p> The music and drums which summon this spirit is reflective of something so deeply cultic and insidious and menacing that not even his acolytes want to be associated with him during the day.Even during those rare night outings , the whole ritual of appearance is like a secret initiation , forbidding in its access with its ambiances of evil . <p> The experience comes with such exhausted fear and drain of positive feeling that by early morning when the whole show terminates in fatigue and pointless fear , the audience goes home with little or no memory of what ought to have been the cleansing from all great rituals and drama . This thing is strange ... because despite such conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day Nigerian politics , a politics of all comers , makes one wander into all kinds of strange alleys of consciousness searching for answers.We can not dispute that we are a people of excess . So do the day time beautiful masquerades in our politics cut it in the dignity and pride we associate with conventional day time performance whether it is with excess or no excess ? <p> Or have all degenerated into the insidious and cultic and menacing and tragic pointlessness of the Ajukwu , the night masked spirit ? Perhaps we should just look at the politics and politicians as the night audience looks at that night masked spirit , shrug our shoulders and walk away in perplexity and wonder ... But why these dark reflections ? <p> They were driven by the unprecedented character of the politics surrounding the Nigerian presidency . After weeks of agon and agony regarding the absence and ill-health of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , the giant of Africa , with a population of around 150 million people , the drama wins shoddy and botchy resolution with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night masked spirit . What kind of resolution is that ? Does the country ? not have some shame left in her consciousness ? <p> The presidency sneaking back to his country via a bizarre dramatic performance ? Do Nigerians understand how ridiculous the country looks in the eyes of the world ? <p> Can these politicians not see that if they had been telling the truth to the nation and the world about the President 's health , that return was a grand opportunity for the man to stand before the national and world press and affirm that truth with an address that dispatches the entire humiliating controversy with finality . <p> Such would have thereby saved everybody 's face : the presidency , the opticians , the whole nation . Making the return an Ajukwu night masked spirit show only says something like you guys ai nt seen nothing yet . Tighten your seat belts . To be continued ... <p> Most truly patriotic Nigerians who live abroad now share one collective prayer . May the president live long . If he does not , a transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a country , the Nigerian nation is already damaged goods with so much trivialized in dignity and integrity . Nigerians have neither been kind nor thoughtful regarding ?

There is consistency in the cuts , in the communication of the theme and how it translates to each piece within the collection . <p> Apart from the cut which will be extremely flattering to the feminine frame as it made to accentuate her curves , the sleeves and necklines are definitely a strong point to these designs .

And indeed , one of my crimes with the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) is because the PDP did not win that election . I was not ready to allow rigging in the territory . But the elections got worse and I agree it ? ? ? s time for Nigerians to rescue their country . <p> We thought you were a member of the PDP . <p> I think I am still a member of the PDP . But I don ? ? ? t know for how long . I was very active in the PDP Reform Forum and we are trying to see what internal changes we can bring about in the party . But we are not making much progress in the party . I am still a member but I don ? ? ? t know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At age 50 , I have been assigned responsibilities at higher levels , at a relatively young age . And having attained age 50 , I think my role , being whatever it is , is to encourage and inspire younger people to be active in politics and to be active in public office and stand up to protect their future . <p> I am 50 . I am old . I am on my way out . But what I can do , I think , is to get young people to understand that being actively involved in politics is important . Politics is not for criminals only . It is for decent people . That is how it should be . <p> And getting into public office is desirable because we can ? ? ? t change our country unless we have a public service that works . <p> When I was young , I did not know that . I only figured it out over time . And this is what I want to spend the rest of my time : contributing to movement , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into our politics and into governance . That is what I think is my role . <p> If at 50 , you are old , what about those in their 70s that want to contest the 2011 election ? <p> They should not contest . And if they do , we should reject them . These people I call the ? ? ? crowd of 1966 ? ? ? are the people that terminated our First Republic . They have been ruling this country in a critical manner . They should leave us alone . <p> They should retire and let the younger generation give this country a new direction . We don ? ? ? t want them . And if they come out , Nigerians should reject them . <p> What is your take on the PDP zoning arrangement ? <p> I have given my opinion on zoning system , even when I was in exile . I think zoning is a system that excludes a larger percentage of the population contesting for any office . I think it is wrong . I think a country like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . <p> So , the positions of the president , the governorship position of the states , chairmanship of the local government , should be thrown open to everyone that is qualified and aspires to that office and let the people pick who is the best . <p> We should not have presidency by allocation or governorship by allocation or on geographical basis . Nobody chooses where he is born . The fact that you are from Lagos and I am from Kaduna is accident . We didn ? ? ? t choose where we are . <p> So , on that basis , when we begin to pick leaders on where they come from , I don ? ? ? t agree with that approach . It has been my opinion over and over . I believe the presidency of this country should be thrown open to people who are more qualified to contest and make Nigerians make their choice . <p> Let Nigerians say we want another Northerner President or we want someone else . But it is not for people to sit down in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any position . I am against it . I believe in merit above anything else . <p> Does that mean that President Goodluck Jonathan should contest 2011 election ? <p> Yes , President Goodluck Jonathan is qualified to contest 2011 election in my view . And even if ( former ) President ( Olusegun ) Obasanjo has a brother from Abeokuta ( Ogun State ) , who is qualified to contest , I have no problem about that . <p> I have no problem with someone from Sokoto or Kaduna who wants to contest . It should be thrown open . Let the choice be that of Nigerians . It should not be a few people saying that half of the country should not contest . I disagree with that . <p> What your reaction to the House of Representatives members who fought ? <p> I think it is unfortunate . But having said that , you know parliaments do engage in that kind of brawl . The Japanese parliament and parliaments of many other countries engage in it . It is not something to be concerned about . Definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do think that the House of Representatives should find a better way of sorting out of their differences and I don ? ? ? t think the best way to do it is to suspend the members who disagree with you . It is not democratic if you say a member accuses you of corruption , you should suspend him . <p> I think there should be transparency and the allegation be investigated . I was investigated by Yar ? ? ? Adua administration for three years . I came back to Nigeria to defend my name . So , people should stand up to defend their names . <p> To resort to blows , I think , is unbecoming of people who are supposed to legislate for our country . I think they would learn over time to settle their differences in a better way . <p> If Nigerians knock on your door and say you should come to be their president , what would be your reaction ? I am not a candidate for any office . I have said so several times because I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the best of my ability . I think it is time I stepped by a little and push forward others . And , I don ? ? ? t think 150 million people of Nigeria can come to my house and ask for that . If that happens , it will be a different thing entirely . <p> But let me say that politicians play this game . They will say , ? ? ? Oh , you know it is my people that forced me to go ? ? ? . No , you yourself want to go and that is why you instigate your people to force you to go . I believe Nigeria has many talents from every part of the country and there are many who want to be president and they are also good . And if I sight some of them and I have it in my mind to support them , I will work with them in a way to make it possible . For me , I want to take a break . <p> When you were in exile , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . It was a traumatic experience that you can not visit even your enemy . I missed Nigerian food . I missed many of my friends and family . Some of my family friends died and I couldn ? ? ? t attend their funeral ! <p> But that was God ? ? ? s wish and I think there was a clear purpose to it that I have to go through that to learn a few things . I also improved myself by acquiring more degrees while in exile . I finished my law degree with the University of London . I got my Masters from Harvard . <p> So , it is not all wasted . It is hard a lot to be kept away from your country , be denied the renewal of your passport , and for your family to be detained at the airport when they visited you . <p> All this is part of life that one has to take as part of experiences to learn from and move on in life and do whatever you think you can to make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your position on the Uwais ? ? ? s Panel reports ? <p> I think my respected elder brother , Justice Uwais and distinguished members of his panel , did a very good job . And I think that the recommendation of the panel should be implemented in its entirety . It is true that they consulted Nigerians . <p> And if it requires the government to ask Nigerians to do a referendum to show their support for that reform , let them do it . It is only when we have credible election that we can link governance and accountability to the people so elected . <p> And unless we have that , those ? ? ? elected ? ? ? would continue to operate with a culture of impunity . There is no alternative to credible elections . If we don ? ? ? t do it now , we will do it one day . So , why not just do it now ? <p> And state creation ? <p> I am against state creation . I think we already have many states , many of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this oil revenue , some states can not pay salary . And I think that this country operated better when we had fewer states and regions that were competitive and were large enough to be viable . <p> I am against state creation because it can never solve any problem . It is just to create jobs for some people . You have more commissioners , more governors , more Special Assistants . But in terms of development , you can not see the benefit . I am against creation of more states . <p> If there is a way to merge some states back , I will support that but I know it is not possible . What is done can not be undone in the constitution . We can therefore step back and make what we have viable . <p> Many of these states , I say can not collect enough taxes to pay half of their workers ? ? ? salaries . So , without the tax paid , what can you call viability ? We started with three regions . It became four , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how are these states going to be viable ? How can they deliver ? <p> If we have to divide Lagos , I ask , to how many states ? Lagos has 15 million people . If you want to use the population as a criterion , we have to divide Lagos . But Lagos in its federated mega city , it is not viable . <p> And Fashola is doing a great job . He is really showing Nigerians that this thing can work. ? Nigerians are not a disorganised people . They can be made to work . What we need in our states is good governance as we are seeing in Lagos and in some states in Nigeria , and not more states .

Abdullahi , head of chancery Nigerian embassy , DC , and one BabaKura Babagana , Protocol officer at the Nigerian presidency entered into a contract deal with Executive Limousine Services LLC , an exotic transportation company based in Georgia Avenue , DC . <p> The contract was signed on April 6th , 2010 by Yusuf Abdullahi , and Babakura Babagana as agents of the Nigerian Embassy , while the CEO of Executive Limousine Services , LLC represented the transport company . In the contract package the embassy requested for 16 exotic vehicles to convey the Nigerian president 's entourage during the summit .

According to the contractual agreement the cost of the services from Executive Limousine Services was for $142,000.00 ( One-hundred , and forty-two thousand Dollars ) . <p> According to reliable sources the sum of $10,000(ten-thousand) was paid to the transport company as advance payment , with full balance to be paid after the summit . Days after the completion of the summit , officials of the Nigeria delegation party retained the 16 exotic vehicles , and their chauffeurs . The vehicles were used for transporting officials to both official assignments , and personal engagements . A source at the DC downtown hotel where most of the officials resided confided that the exotic vehicles were also involve in taking the officials to the malls for shopping , making several runs daily . <p> A day after the delegation attended a party organized by the South African president Jacob Zuma ; officials of Executive Limousine Services approached Babagana Babakura , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made additional payments totaling a little above $80,000 ( eighty thousand ) . <p> When the officials began to request trips to the Airport to depart to Nigeria without paying the balance , Executive Limousine was able to reach head of Chancery at the Nigerian Embassy Mr. Yusuf Abdullahi who at this time feign ignorant of the remaining balance , according to sources he bluntly refuse to pay the balance . The CEO of Executive Limousine reached out to Babagana Babakura who happens to be the protocol officer in the presidency and after consultation with Mr. Abdullahi another payment was made which brings the total payment to $120,000.00 ( one-hundred , and twenty thousand ) leaving a balance of $22,600.00 ( twenty-two thousand ) , at this time the services from Executive Limousine Services was reviewed and was given a pass mark , and according to them the remaining balance will be given to Mr. Abdullahi of the Nigerian Embassy to pay the Transportation company . <p> Six months after the summit the remaining balance of $22,600 has since not been paid to Executive Limousine Services , the company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their contractual terms , and settle the balance of the deal .

As few rich Nigerians clinked glasses and popped champagne for the country 's 50 years of nationhood , a vast majority were not sure where the next meal would come from as they wallowed in abject poverty . Is it not an irony that a nation blessed with abundant resources , including the black gold -- oil , is helplessly hugging the lower rungs of the poverty index ? Finance Minister , Mr. Olusegun Aganga calls it a paradox . How else can one explain a situation where government officials reel out statistics all the time that our economy is growing while unemployment and other poverty indices are galloping at an alarming rate ? Aganga recently told a meeting of the National Economic Management Team , the World Bank and employers that , " real GDP has been measuring six per cent or higher in the past five years " . Yet , figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that unemployment increased from 11.9 per cent in 2005 to 19.7 per cent in 2009 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it imperative for governments and their agencies to explore all possible job creation strategies , especially as some experts have listed job creation as Nigeria 's greatest challenge . This is more so in the Niger Delta , where joblessness has become an incubator for youth restiveness and militancy . According to Mr. Volker Treichel , a Lead Economist with the World Bank , more than 40 per cent of the youths in the country are unemployed , a situation that has made the country a hot-bed for youth restiveness . " Youth unemployment is rising in the country causing unrest and other social problems , " he said . Another official of the Bank , Mr. Richard Sandall , laments that despite Nigeria 's oil wealth , the job market has continued to shrink , noting that it was only with job growth that the country could meet its commitments to poverty reduction . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> At a recent international conference in Oslo , Norway , leaders from government , labour , business and academia tackled the rapid increase in unemployment and underemployment since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvassed a broad international commitment to a job-focused policy response to the global economic downturn . The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund , IMF , Dominique Strauss-Kahn summed up the views thus : " The international community must respond to the very real impact the crisis has had on working people . Tackling the jobs crisis is not only critical for a meaningful global economic recovery , but also for social cohesion and peace . " <p> Available statistics from the International Labour Organisation , ILO , show that unemployment has gone up by more than 30 million worldwide since 2007 . IMF and ILO representatives agreed at the conference to work together on policy development in two specific areas . First , they agreed to explore the concept of a social protection floor for people living in poverty and in vulnerable situations , within the context of a medium-to long-term framework of sustainable macroeconomic policies and strategies for development . They also agreed to focus on policies to promote employment-creating growth . <p> Taking a cue from what is happening at the international arena , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radwan , declared that job-creation was the need of the hour in Nigeria . " Only the private sector can do this . Government can empower and facilitate , " he stated , supporting his position with sobering statistics .

" Over 50 per cent of the youths in the urban areas are unemployed . It is a very disheartening situation for parents who labour strenuously to educate their children . The state of affairs has assumed the dimension of an economic and social crisis . There is a relationship between rising criminality and unemployment .

The development agencies , which include the oil companies , the federal , state , local governments and the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC , must pay more attention to job-creating programmes . Although , agencies like the National Directorate of Employment NDE have a mandate to combat mass unemployment and articulate policies aimed at developing work programmes , they have not made sufficient impact . The same can be said of the National Poverty Eradication Programme NAPEP , which was set up to create jobs so as to decongest the labour market . <p> Recently , NAPEP and the NDDC reached an accord to join forces to fight poverty with programmes that will support economic activities in communities in the Niger Delta . The National Co-ordinator of NAPEP , Dr Magnus Kpakol , said the only way to succeed in the fight against poverty is for institutions to leverage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the country 's population which is out of the production process must be empowered to contribute to economic national development , he said . <p> He told the NDDC management during a courtesy call at its headquarters in Port Harcourt that NAPEP had programmes which could make the communities engines of economic activities . " One of such programmes is the Village Economic Development Solutions Scheme through which anchor processing activities are being established across the communities . " Mr. Chibuzo Ugwuoha , the NDDC Managing Director , said that the tasks of NAPEP and that of the commission dovetail into each other so well that it would be very easy for the two institutions to work together . He assured that the two agencies would collaborate in the fight against poverty . <p> He noted that the NDDC had already embarked on educational and skill-acquisition programmes to enhance the capacity of Niger Delta youths to acquire the requisite empowerment that would make them competitive in the present global setting . There is no doubt that the youths put through skill acquisition programmes need proper mentorship and monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , various agencies of development and different tiers of government have engaged in a number of skill acquisition programmes . The major reason why the impact of such endeavours has not been felt is that the graduates are usually not given seed money to start their own businesses .

@@1790237 <h> Why broadband is still expensive in Africa , by Makau <p> An Information Technology expert , Mr Tom Makau has given reasons why the cost of broadband and other ICT infrastructure are still high in Africa even with the arrival of undersea cables . <p> He said though , Africa has witnessed an unprecedented growth in internet and VPN connectivity in the last 5 years through the launch of several satellites serving the continent and the landing of a number of submarine cables on African shores , that a lot still needed to be done to make broadband in the continent more affordable , because the rapid uptake of mobile internet has increased penetration and awareness of the merits of being online . <p> According to him , broadband is still expensive in Africa because the continent does not share the same Internet history with the rest of the world coupled with the high costs of laying cables in Africa , stressing that the prices would remain relatively high compared to other regions due to the high CAPEX and OPEX of infrastructure in Africa even with the arrival of fiber capacity . <p> Mr Makau who was speaking on the topic " VSAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collaboration Conference , 2010 held recently in Lagos by IwayAfrica Nigeria Limited , revealed that some Internet Service Providers , ISPs have tried to emulate US and EU pricing without considering these historical facts , making the ISPs start offering poor services as they struggled to stay afloat in the business . <p> He said the liberalization of telecom sector and diminishing dependency on the incumbent operators has ensured that end users have a variety of last mile technologies to chose from ; ensuring that power was shifted from provider to customer , and arrival of more international capacity . He added that price wars among ISPs have intensified ISPs shifting from offering what he described as dumb pipes to smart pipes to their customers . <p> The IT expert said for ISPs to offer lower prices to customers without compromising service quality , Africa must develop and host local content and applications . <p> This was in addition to the markets providing critical numbers needed to take advantage of economies of scale , even as the regulatory environment must be fair to operators . <p> Speaking further , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kenya disclosed that VSAT is one thing that would reduce the cost of broadband in Africa .

He has had about 22 solo and over 90 group exhibitions of his works in and outside the country . Some of his works are currently on display in the exhibition hall of Terra Kulture as part of Nigeria 's anniversary celebration . <p> The foremost artist here , shares memories of what it was like when he first became a professional artist as well as tales of his numerous achievements . Enjoy it . <p> How has it been as artist ? <p> I was born in Ibadan , capital of Oyo state in 1948 , though am an indigene of Ikorodu in Lagos state . I first graduated from the Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria in 1972 with a specialization in painting . I was head of the Fine Arts department , Yaba College of Technology in 1986 , director of the School of Art , Design and Printing in 1990 , deputy rector of the college between 1992 and 1996 , the national secretary of the Society of Nigeria Artists between 1972 and 1980 , fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 and 2008 . <p> I retired in 2008 . I am also a recipient of the National Productivity Order of Merit award of the federal government of Nigeria , 2004 . <p> Inspiration ? <p> My works generally are creative expressions which are inspired by a summation of my visual , emotional , physical and even spiritual encounters and my innermost feelings on a particular issue . I often try to capture human activities and moods in nature like the forest , market square etc , and I pay attention to material exploration . <p> Your journey to fame , how did it begin ? <p> Very rough , I must say but I am glad I persevered , otherwise I would n't be talking about my numerous achievements and exposures today . <p> I must not fail to mention here that if I had succumbed to my parents ' advice and dabbled into the profession of their choice for me , I may have been living a miserable life right now . I remember in those days , I used to hide my drawings under the table for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really blame them because there was no serious regard for artists in terms of financial success at that period , besides , many were living meaningless lives . <p> It was a huge battle between my folks and me as they almost broke down in tears when I broke the news that I had been admitted into the University to study Art . <p> Kolade Oshinowo <p> Well , somehow , I managed to convince them that Art was what I wanted to study by all means . I wo n't forget the kind of knock we used to receive on the head when caught drawing . <p> Thereafter , I started lecturing in higher institution and at the same time , got involved in both one-man and group exhibitions as I mentioned earlier . Generally , it has been worth it but I wo n't fail to say here that professionally , there were hiccups here and there but I was determined to fulfill my dreams . Otherwise , I will be answerable to God . <p> How ? Yes ! God gave me this talent and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to Him , I will be seriously questioned on what I did with my gift . <p> Looking at your profile , you have made impeccable achievements . What has been the driving force ? Nothing in particular made me go into Arts . I just knew I was tailor-made for it . So , at a point , self revelation made me start seeing things differently . It was like I saw myself as a genius , even at that early period , because I was able to do what my peers could n't do . This motivated me the more and I kept doing something more outstanding during any production so as to be announced and relevant to the society . <p> One would have thought that monetary reward motivated you ? No , money never moved me . Art , especially this genre , is more about passion , self-actualisation , in terms of being known as one who is creative and dexterous enough to produce sculptures , paintings , print and so on . Money could come in later . <p> But the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terra Kulture are in millions . You are getting it all wrong . And I think that many young artists today are making the same mistake . Fine , Art is lucrative because , of course , it is very expensive to put together and that is why they say it is for the rich . Nevertheless , money must not be the issue , otherwise it will reflect on the works . <p> And I tell you this : Artists who paint to sell fail because they do n't sell . I also think this is a reflection of what we have today in the art industry . You will discover that there is a wide gap between the old and the young artists . Many works from younger artists no longer reflect the rich diverse cultural heritage of our country . <p> It looks as if our kind of visual art is endangered . The same thing is happening in the music industry where highlife is gradually becoming obsolete . Once you tune in your radio or turn on your TV set , it is hip pop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> This is the reason I keep saying that I can never retire . So long as I have strength and my hands are still attached to the sockets , I will continue to hold exhibitions . <p> At 50 , how do you rate the Art industry ? So far so good , there has been a lot of improvement . As you can see , we keep recording an increase in the number of emerging artists , joining the established in exhibitions . Even in terms of quality of works , I can say we are getting there and I 'm glad that more organizations are getting involved with art matters . <p> But I want more corporate bodies to get involved in sponsorship of exhibitions featuring old artists so that upcoming artists can learn one or two things from our works . <p> They wo n't be disappointed in anyway . Just take a look at these works ( pointing at his paintings on display ) . They are pure original . No duplicate , in fact , you ca n't beat it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Some take so many years like 10 years to finish . So , Nigerians should n't allow us to retire untimely . <p> How do you relax ? How else is proper for me to relax than romancing with my work tools ? I feel very fulfilled when I 'm in my studio . It 's no longer strenuous as it has become part of me. 
@@1790239 <h> CNEF battles CMAN to force down cement price <p> Emma Amaize WARRI- THE Cement New Entrants Forum of Nigeria , CNEF , has launched a two-pronged campaign to force down the price of locally manufactured cement to N700 per 50 kg bag at retail shops by 2015 , saying the Cement Manufacturers Association of Nigeria , CMAN , in collusion with some government officials , were ripping off Nigerians at the current factory gate price of N1 , 300 . <p> Chairman of CNEF , Prince David Iweta told Vanguard , that 95 per cent of the raw material , limestone , used in producing cement is obtained freely from the Nigerian soil , and if government extended the same support it was giving to CMAN to the new entrants to run their local cement plants , they would contribute about 12.2 million metric tones to the market and sell cement at a factory gate price of N500 . <p> He said , " The new entrants with own land terminals will require 5 ( five ) million tonnes ofcement License each issued by the Federal Government to cover up to 2015 to support their effort in building their own backward cement plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major manufacturers that are celebrated today have been granted and imported over 30 ( thirty ) million tonnes of cement each for longer period of 10 years that afforded them the opportunity to achieve the claimed huge investment in local cementproduction " . <p> Cement <p> His expressions , " We shall expose CMAN by revealing the cost of producing limestone , the cost of power , the cost of gypsum , and the cost of labour and overhead charges by sensitizing Nigerians by serious campaign with substantiated figures as to why they must not buy a bag ofcement above N700 per bag of locally manufactured cement . After all , limestone , which is 95 per cent content as raw material is freely obtained from our oil " . <p> Prince Iweta , who is the chief executive of Madewell Portland Cement , Sapele , Delta state , said that when President Umaru Yar'Adua of blessed memories granted import licenses to new players in 2008 , thus setting a level playing field for all players in the cement industry , cement price was forced down price from N2,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is still sending cold down the spines of so -called manufacturers , who are trying to construct road blocks on the ways of new entrants that are determined in ensuring that cement price come down to as low as N500 per bag by 2015 " . <p> Cabal <p> He disclosed that with the exit of Yar'Adua , relevant authorities in collusion with CMAN , issued fresh license for 2.5 million to selected cement manufacturers , excluding members of the CNEF , which led to the former embarking on massive importation of cement by opening Letters of Credit for over 35 shiploads of cement in anticipation of cancellation of import license mid-year 2010 . <p> " The Ministry erroneously did not consider Madewell Portland Cement with functional Land Terminal in Sapele , Delta State and Reagan Portland Cement with Land Terminals in Calabar , Cross River State both firms are sited in the South -- South region . Gateway Portland cementwas also denied license . These are investors that have invested in the cement industry each with over N2.5 billion in Land Terminal alone , which is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nigeria " , he stated . <p> Poser <p> Prince Iweta asked , " Fellow Nigerians from the above figures , which group is flooding the market with imported cement , manufacturers or importers ? <p> " The so- called manufacturers are the major importers of cement into this country from 1999 till date yet they are pointing accusing fingers to importers for unbridled importation of cement . The cement manufacturers are afraid of competition of the new entrants into the NigeriaCement Industry by embarking on cheap campaign with selfish purpose in mind " . <p> Collapse of buildings <p> Furthermore , he asserted , " We want to use this medium to extend a wake-up call on the Standard Organization of Nigeria ( SON ) to ascertain the quality and strength of the cementrolled out of local cement factories to avoid the collapse of buildings in Nigeria , such has happened in Abuja .

This information is verifiable from the Nigeria Customs and the Central Bank of Nigeria . If above is found to be true , who then is engaged in unbridled import of cement ? <p> Self-sufficiency deception <p> He also debunked the claim by cement manufacturers that they have attained self sufficiency incement production . His words , " It has been reported in several newspapers recently thatcement manufacturers have attained self sufficiency in cement production for Nigeria by 2011 . This is another misinformation toward deceiving the government and the good people of Nigeria by preventing government from allocating import permit to deserving cement import terminal owners to allow CMAN members alone import the large quantity of cement for which they have established Letters of Credit , thereby creating room for few players to exploit Nigerians with high price and inferior cement quality " . <p> " We are compelled to challenging the cement manufacturers to shut their foaming mouths to the press and be patriotic . How will a group feel that 150 million Nigerians will accept the story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price is selling at N1,300 per bag of 50kg at the gates of local manufacturers instead of N500 which the same bag of cement is sold in China , Taiwan , Spain , Egypt , Iran , Turkey , India , Japan , to mention a few Countries that have attained self sufficiency in cement production contrary to claims by Nigeria Cement Manufacturers supported by collaborators in government " , he added . <p> Manufacturers supply inferior cement <p> " Experienced has also revealed " , he stated , " that current local manufacturers not only supply inferior cement quality when compared to imported cement , some manufacturers/importers make arrangements with foreign manufacturers to supply them with cement produced with 75% limestone , 20% slag waste of steel factories and 5% gypsum , which is cheaper to cementproduced with 95% limestone content and 5% gypsum , which is of better quality and strength . This is to earn them huge profit because Nigeria undermines quality because of their brand house-hold names . <p> " This group in producing their cement locally , they reduce the gypsum content below 5% recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn more profit at the detriment of innocent Nigerians . This is because gypsum is the most expensive raw material in production of cement . <p> " It is still fresh in the minds of Nigerians what Dr. Iyochia Ayu went through when he tried to protect the investing rights of his people when the Federal Government of Nigeria was to sell its own share of the cement factory in his state , Benue Cement Company ( BCC ) . It has just been brought to the notice of the new entrants that the Federal Government of Nigeria has concluded sales of its equity holding in the Onigboro Cement Company in Republic of Benin to a cementmanufacturer in Nigeria without advertising or involving all players in the industry in Nigeria but sold directly to one company . The danger in this deal is that the quantity of cement share from their daily production will find its way and dumped in the Nigeria market by way of import by land , no duty paid owing to ECOWAS membership . Again this is by a manufacturer that is one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers have claimed that there are unsold inventory at their various storage facilities in form of bagged cement and clinkers and valued N45 billion , this is a big lie . The same group alleged that the problem is caused by unbridled cement import which is their handiwork from above analysis . <p> ' Big joke ' <p> " Cement Manufacturers boasted about their readiness to export their products to other Africa States , which they know is another big joke because their product can not sell in other African Countries for the simple reason that the retail price of 50kg bag of cement in Ghana is N1 , 100 , N900 in Liberia , N800 in Cameroon , N800 in Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , all these prices are for imported cement into these countries . Should they try what they boasted , their business empire will collapse over night . One more reason why they will not consider export is because they are used to abnormal profit by exploiting Nigerians with over pricing " , he said . <p> Prince Iweta made it abundantly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to producing cement using local limestone because it is far cheaper to producecement locally compared to imported cement and its associated import challenges , but CMAN members were not happy with this laudable efforts of late President Musa Yar'Adua of encouraging new entrants into the industry . <p> " The reason for unsold stock by some crying members of CMAN is as a result of their monopoly/duopoly exploitative intentions by embarking on over ambitious Cementmanufacturing projects with a view to keeping others away and selling the product at high price . <p> " The same group has infiltrated some banks with specific instructions not to lend to competitors in the industry . Do the rich cry ? It is unfortunate that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is taking side with a section of same industry instead of playing a neutral fatherly role of ensuring sustainable growth in the construction industry of this country toward 2020.

Amongst the latter was Osita C Agwuna who made the famous call to revolution and went to jail .

There was Michael Imoudu , the famous labour leader , who led workers in numerous confrontations against colonialism . He was such a torn in the flesh of colonialism that the British detained him for most of the Second World War . <p> There was his fellow unionist , Nduka Eze who while fighting the colonialists on the political level was also engaged in wars against their transnational corporations like UAC . In mobilising workers for anti-colonist struggles , Eze argued that " the continued existence of a bureaucratic and imperialist ( British ) government constitutes a very grave danger , it impoverished the workers , it dislocated the equilibrium of Nigerian national economy and ... postpones the unity of the African people towards the attainment of political freedom " . <p> Another was Kolawole Balogun who at a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British out of the country .

This is the age of action-plain , blunt and positive action ... <p> This iniquitous British Government is determined to keep us as slaves forever and the only way out , as I see it and as I know it , is for every one of us to declare himself free and independent and be resolved to stand by that declaration and damn the consequences . I have nothing against the person of George VI of England . <p> But I hate the crown of Britain with all my heart because to me and my country men , it is a symbol of oppression , a symbol of persecution , and in short , a material manifestation of iniquity ... I hate the Union Jack because , save Britain , wherever it goes , far from uniting , it creates a division . It feeds and flourishes on confusion and dissension . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts-this ugly representation of that satanic institution , imperialism . " He went to prison for two years and on release became the president of the Freedom Movement in January 1951 . <p> It is erroneously asserted that our independence was secured " on a platter of gold " . This ahistorical claim ignored Nigerians who were drenched in rivers of blood such as the 1947 Burutu massacres and those of Iva Valley two years later . <p> It ignores the sacrifices of the heroes mentioned above and those of men like Heelas Ugokwe , a postal worker who in the midst of a countrywide crackdown on anti-colonial activists , carried out an assassination attempt on Colonial Chief Secretary , Hugh Foot . He stabbed him with a jack-knife from behind but Foot was rescued by a messenger . <p> In court , Ugokwe revealed that his target was the British Governor , but because he could not reach him , he decided to assassinate Foot . He accused the British of carrying out massacres of Nigerians and that if the British officials who murdered Nigerian coal miners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set free . His only regret , he told Justice S.B. Rhodes was that he did not succeed in assassinating Foot . The judge gave Ugowe the maximum life sentence . <p> The non-recognition of these uncompromising nationalists is either a manifestation of a marginal knowledge of our history , or an ideological hangover which banishes from our official thought process , people who frontally confronted the British colonialists and damned the consequences .
