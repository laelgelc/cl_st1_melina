A 2012-gun attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut killed 20 children and six others . There have been 26 such incidents in the United States last year .

Highlighting a number of statistics , it has been said that the law enforcement agencies of Bangladesh are involved in these extrajudicial killings . <p> Let 's take a look at extrajudicial killings by law enforcement in the United States . Turkish media outlet TRT World has provided vital information about the United States being at the top of extrajudicial killings by law enforcement . According to a report published on June 1 , 2020 , a total of 7,666 people were killed in police shootings in the United States in the seven years from 2013 to 2019 . Of these , 1,106 were shot by police in 2013 , 1,050 in 2014 , 1,103 in 2015 , 1,071 in 2016 , 1,095 in 2017 , 1,143 in 2018 and 1,098 in 2019 .

According to the report , 996 people were killed in police firing in 2018 while the number was 987 in 2017 , 963 in 2016 , and 995 in 2015 . <p> The Associated Press-AP , USA Today and a joint survey of researchers from North-Eastern University found that the United States had the highest number of mass killings in any year in 2019 . <p> In 2020 , there were 996 extrajudicial killings in the United States .

Expressing concern , he said : " The United States does not take such action on its own . <p> In the backdrops of recent events , it is right to say that countries like the United States or Canada should now look at themselves in the mirror . It is high time to change the spectacles they wear for analyzing the human rights situation in Bangladesh . <p> Apart from international laws and norms , extrajudicial killing is also an act of " violations of basic human rights , " and it overrides due legal process and " right to justice .

The country has imported 5,000 MW of solar PVs in the last 5 years with 2,380 MW of imports in 2021 alone . <p> Since renewables are still a fledgling industry , the reliance on expensive imported oil-based power has escalated the nationwide electricity tariffs to more than PKR 27/unit , pushing consumers to switch to solar solutions for power consumption . <p> The cost volatility of fossil fuels has intensified the global urgency to decarbonize and increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports of clean technologies are expected to climb over the next decade , putting serious strain on the country 's already limited foreign reserves . <p> The Chinese imports remaining relatively cost-effective to local production have consequently catapulted Pakistan into an import-driven energy transition , pricing out the small-medium scale market players . <p> The State Bank of Pakistan 's ( SBP ) finance facility for renewable energy is the only local concessionary financing scheme available , however , import restrictions by the central bank and private banks limiting funds to the collected repayments make it a difficult ordeal for the new applicants . <p> Also , the scheme is limited to a plant size of up to 50 MW , compelling the developers to explore foreign financing options . <p> Securing foreign lending though is almost as laborious as local , given the fragile economy , low credit rating and political uncertainty . <p> The growing speculation over a possible ' default ' has exposed international commercial banks and lenders to additional risks . These lenders who were already hesitant to lend now offer terms that are not financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of 4.25% over LIBOR have now incremented significantly as lending entities look to secure themselves against all possible risks . Even with the projects going through , the tariff requires to be indexed heavily against dollar parity which shoots up the energy prices . <p> Sudden revisions in tax policies create an environment of uncertainty , promoting mistrust between investors and the authorities . <p> The intricacies of tax laws and lengthy bureaucratic processes make it difficult to provide a clear understanding for market participants to plan and prepare for the future . For example , a common concern raised by the developers is the tax authority 's abrupt revision of income tax provisions/exemptions . <p> These abrupt revisions create a bureaucratic back and forth leading to unnecessary delays and appeals in the courts incurring additional costs for the developers . <p> The delay in payments by CPPA-G to Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) is also a major cause of concern among investors and discourages potential future market players . <p> At present , the receivables from CPPA-G are already 7 months overdue . Several investors complain about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they have to cover through short-term finance arrangements . <p> Additionally , the State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) restricts IPPs from converting their received payments into dollars which can be utilized for debt repayments at a later stage . As a result , the exchange rate fluctuation during this period creates a financial gap , putting an unfair liability on the IPPs . <p> The authorities in Pakistan need to consider these predicaments as issues of paramount importance . Investor confidence is only a fine margin . <p> The key to earning their trust is to ensure adequate protection for them against all possible risks . As far as investor facilitation and foreign reserve problem are concerned , the central bank can for the time being permit the RE imports that are self-funded by the investors in all major currencies like RMB , USD , AED , EURO etc . Establishing robust RE markets will require back-to-back investments in the future and long-term continuation of policies is vital for securing that capital . <p> The examples of our neighbours , China and India are worth looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-needed capital for advancing RE share in their respective energy profiles . <p> A level playing field for all stakeholders , removal of bureaucratic hurdles as well as the continuation of policies will alleviate investor concerns and help develop a self-evolving ecosystem of RE in Pakistan . <p> The article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Business Recorder or its owners

@@97294234 <h> Governance for local governments : Part - I <p> This article is divided into three parts . The first part deals with ' why local government ? ' The second with experiences during the 2001-2009 period and finally in the third part it proposes a governance system for local governments . <p> Why local government ? The World Bank in its 1997 report asserts that governments are more effective when they listen to businesses and citizens , and work in partnership with them in deciding and implementing policy . Where governments lack mechanisms to listen , they are not responsive to people 's interests . <p> The devolution of authority to local tiers of government and decentralization can bring in representation of local business and citizens ' interests . The visibility of the results achieved by the resources deployed in a specific geographic area maintains pressure on government functionaries . Public -- private partnerships . including NGO -- public partnerships have proved to be effective tools in fostering good governance . <p> The World Development Report ( WDR 2004 ) has argued that the accountability of governments to local communities and marginalized social groups will increase by assigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and make them electorally accountable . <p> The 1973 constitution did specify only two tiers of government -- federal and provincial . It is only after the 18th Amendment in 2010 that a new clause -- Article 140A -- was introduced which states that " Each province shall , by law , establish a local government system and devolve political , administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments . " <p> The Supreme court has asserted and directed the holding of elections of local governments on several occasions . Unfortunately , unlike the detailed distribution of powers between the federal and the provincial governments clearly defined in the constitution , there is no such provision for local governments . This vagueness and ambiguity has been used by the provincial governments which have been struggling to come to some reasonable piece of legislation since 2010 on the functions and powers of this tier . <p> Logically , once the provincial governments were devolved , adequate powers accompanied by sufficient financial allocations out of the divisible tax pool and grants from the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local governments . How is it possible for Punjab , with a population of 110 million people and 36 districts covering an area of 205000 sq km , to respond to the disparate needs of citizens in the delivery of essential services ? DG Khan and Faisalabad , for example , have very different requirements and a uniform one-shoe-fits-all approach that is the characteristic of an overcentralized system wo n't simply work . <p> The present culture of concentrating authority in power centres at Islamabad , Lahore , Karachi , Peshawar and Quetta has not only alienated the population living in the peripheries , but reduced its productive potential also -- and to no small extent . It is little surprise then that our research found 80 districts whose ordinary citizens are living in miserable conditions , according to the Deprivation Index , and remain almost criminally starved of their most basic needs . <p> The political parties that introduced this article in the constitution do not realize that meaningful empowerment of communities through decentralization and delegation of authority , in which the local government system plays a crucial role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmony in our society and ensure access to basic public services in an efficient and equitable manner . These outcomes will not only help mobilize additional resources at the local level but also improve the efficiency of resource utilization . <p> The present state of disaffection and discontentment with the government would also be mitigated if public goods and services of everyday use to the citizens become available to them at the grassroots level . Local communities know their problems and their solutions much better than anybody else . It has also been found that for direct delivery by the government , the transfer of responsibility for these services to lower tiers of governance improves access by the poor . <p> Local government management of schools and hospitals involving communities and demand-side subsidies to the poor , monitored and under the oversight of government result in a favourable outcome in education and health . As these political parties will also contest elections , they will be represented at that tier of government too . Thus , the credit for citizen satisfaction , efficient allocation of resources and better access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , the myopic and self-centred approach adopted by all major political parties and resistance to empowerment and strengthening local governments is highly incomprehensible as in actual fact it simply entails the transfer of power from the provincial and national legislators and the ministers to the locally elected nazims or mayors of the districts . Those seeking to preserve their status , clout and influence should opt for local nazim positions rather than becoming MPAs or MNAs . <p> The 2001-2009 period : It would be useful to make an objective assessment of the local government system that existed in Pakistan between 2001 and 2009 . There were many flaws in the 2001 system , including the fact that the functions of law and order , revenue records , and land administration and disaster management should have remained with neutral civil servants and not transferred to the nazims . In that event , the offices of the deputy/assistant commissioner should not have been abolished , thereby diluting the writ of the state . <p> The executive authority of the newly created post of district coordination officer -- DCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or her although s/he was expected to perform duties relating to maintenance of law and order , removal of encroachments , price controls , and the like . As the powers of recruitment , transfers , postings , and disciplinary actions continued to remain vested in the provincial departments , the diarchy proved to be fatal for the effective functioning of the devolved departments . <p> The gap between law and actual practice remained wide to the detriment of the public at large . Corruption at the district government level could not be contained given the inadequate supervisory arrangements evolved by the provincial governments . The provincial secretaries retained considerable administrative authority over the district bureaucrats and used these powers to undercut the efficacy of the elective nazims . A tripartite confrontational mode in which the provincial ministers and secretaries aligned themselves against the district nazims was responsible for most of the practical difficulties faced by the citizens in access to services . <p> The degree of fiscal decentralization remained limited because the districts continued to depend upon the province for resources , did n't have the powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to levy service or user charges . On the expenditure side , the fixed and growing expense of salaries , wages , and allowances paid to the staff devolved to the district governments ( although they continue to be provincial servants ) did not leave much surplus for either maintenance , operational , and development expenditure . <p> Over 90 per cent of expenditure of local governments was financed by transfers from the provincial governments . Lack of enhancement in local fiscal powers was a major weakness in the process of fiscal decentralization . <p> The share of local governments in the provincial allocable pool was about 40 per cent but their share in total public expenditure was only 13 per cent . Resource mobilization at the provincial and local levels remained substantially under-exploited . Land revenue accounted for less than one per cent of the agricultural income while the effective rate of property taxation of rental incomes was about five per cent as opposed to the statutory rate of 20 per cent or more .

Though a sad reflection on the failure of other state institutions , including parliament , it provides the only remedial avenue amidst the existent polarized and caustic environment where every activity is perceived as a life-and-death situation . <p> After a humiliating drubbing the opposition cabal received at the hands of the PTI in the recently held Rajanpur by-election , a feeling of complete political obliteration of the incumbents has intensified , thus accentuating the tension further . <p> Having abjectly failed to address the political challenges thrown their way by Imran Khan , the ruling cabal and their handlers are trying to eliminate him on the basis of some flimsy technical ground reflected in the cases which have been registered against him . Another assassination attempt can also not be discounted .

Some media reports suggest the government 's unease with being pressurized to comply with all prior actions agreed with the IMF ahead of reaching a staff level agreement to facilitate the release of the economic bailout . Understandably , the government is unwilling to do this fearing a massive political cost that it may have to pay . <p> To add to the government 's agony , the Supreme Court has ordered that elections for the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) should be held within the constitutionally stipulated period of ninety days . In KP , the governor has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been authorized to give the date for elections in Punjab where the governor had not signed the dissolution order . <p> If Rajanpur could be an indicator of the prevalent mood in the country , these elections are likely to throw up strong PTI governments in both provinces which will be for a period of five years . Thus , the party will be ruling in Punjab and KP when the general elections are held throughout the country later this year , giving it a distinct advantage at the hustings . It is yet to be seen whether the government and other relevant state institutions accept this verdict and take urgent steps to complete the electoral process within the period as defined by the SC , or they practise defiance to subvert its implementation . <p> Ever since the execution of the regime change operation and the installation of a cabal comprising convicts , absconders and under-trial criminals , it has been palpably clear that they were not interested in elections in the country and would rather rule by diktat of their handlers and masters . <p> Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional path and replace it instead with a fascist brand aimed solely at driving fear among people to keep them from supporting Imran Khan . This tactic has backfired to an extent that their own political relevance has been effectively jeopardised throughout the country and , consequently , they have been forced to resort to the use of unconstitutional means to survive in the annals of power . With the passage of time , even that seems to be slipping out of their grip and they may soon be left totally rudderless adrift the stormy currents , staring into their political oblivion . <p> What a turnaround the country has witnessed in the last ten months ! A government that was inducted riding the bandwagon of support from the powerful quarters and planning to rule to eternity has been effectively reduced to shreds .

Every democratic mindset would be thinking in terms of holding more elections rather than less . For example , let 's think in terms of a four-year term of the assemblies instead of the existing five . Let 's think of giving more power to the people at the grassroots level and more opportunities to them to exercise it in a free , fair and transparent manner . <p> The stress should be on empowering people rather than the one per cent illicitly created beneficiary elite which has swindled the state and its promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has wreaked destruction in the past and , if allowed to perpetuate further , it would bring the country down as is being speculated by pundits in the existent environment of an administrative and economic bankruptcy , aggravated further with a complete moral collapse across all echelons of society .

It is only through strict adherence to the constitution , and the rule of law that flows from it , that the state can be saved from the blushes of the looming default and an administrative paralysis which it has virtually suffered from since the induction of the criminal cabal . <p> Free and fair elections would only be the first step , and not the only step , to put the country back on the rails .

Yet , Google spent 157 days of computer time to set this current Pi record . <p> Aside from refuting rote-learning scolds , my point is to draw attention to good practices that make a Pi champion .

The impact of colonization on our ways of thinking , learning , and perceiving the world has been profound , and it continues to shape our attitudes and beliefs in ways we may not even be aware of . For instance , many of the ideas and concepts we take for granted as universal and objective are , in fact , products of a particular Western perspective that has been imposed on other cultures and societies through colonialism .

In an earlier hearing , Ramila claimed that the decision to leave her parents ' house was made out of her own volition but this proved to be very far from the truth . Ramila 's case is rare-typically , victims of forced conversions do not have the means to access legal recourse and are largely ignored if they choose to go down that road . <p> Forced conversions of kidnapped Hindu girls are routine and endemic in Sindh-girls as young as 12 have been abducted from their families , trafficked to locations far from their homes and made to marry men who are often twice their age .

In October 2021 , a parliamentary committee scrapped a proposed bill for outlawing the practice , citing ' an unfavourable environment ' when it was rather evident that the bill was scrapped due to pressure from hardline political elements in the country . The state 's failure to protect religious minorities from abuses by non-state actors has only increased the incidence of forced conversions .

So much so that it has culminated into the latest existential predicament where the luckless people of Pakistan are stuck between a rock and a hard place -- a political elite not capable of governing and powers that be not capable of changing . <p> Democracy -- or whatever passes for it nowadays -- has had a chequered history in Pakistan . Not only because of the asymmetric power of the establishment but also -- and mostly -- because of the poor performance , weak ideals and hunger for power of the political parties and their respective leadership . <p> We only need to visit the recent past to confirm the notion that political entities tend to run with the hare when out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The late 80s and early 90s are a great example of this hypothesis when turn after turn , PML(N) and PPP played into the hands of the final arbitrators of influence to bring each other down .

In the 2000s the PML(Q) was formed to lend a helping hand to General Pervez Musharraf and all and sundry within the political spectrum went along for the ride in expectation of flexing even the smallest muscle of authority ! After the exit of Musharraf , the PML(Q) was relegated to the status of political orphans and hounded from pillar to post . Around 2018 , the PTI enjoyed the fruits of being the chosen ones and the PML(N) and PPP were dragged through the courts -- judicial and public opinion .

It is quite apparent that in our country unfortunately that may not be the case but it still does n't preclude us from asking more of our leaders . <p> First -- improve performance and governance .

Due to the conflict in Ukraine , climate change and the global crisis of the Covid pandemic , supply systems around the world are on the brink of collapse .

This is not a time for war . Everyone should try to find ways to get back on the diplomatic track . Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24 , 2022 , against the US-led imperialist war alliance NATO 's continued expansion into Eastern Europe and Ukraine 's complicity in that plot . And this is where the global recession began . <p> The plight of the poor in every country is dire . <p> Developed Western countries including America , Britain , Germany , and France have been helping Ukraine with weapons , technology and other necessary aspects since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperialist camp was to put Ukraine on the path to conflict and seize Russia 's vast natural resources . Just like in the past , the Americans recklessly attacked Arab countries like Iraq and Libya . During the discussion at the UN , India 's representative also pointed out the limitations of the proposal . He said the proposal is not compatible with New Delhi 's desired solution to end the war that has been going on for more than a year and a far-reaching peace . Russia also knows that occupying Ukraine is no longer possible . And anti-Russian Western countries also need to understand that overthrowing Putin is not so simple . If Putin is cornered , the whole world , including Ukraine , may become more miserable in the future . China is on Putin 's side . This relationship between the President of China and Putin is not a personal matter . It should be seen from the perspective of international politics . Now in this situation , the G-20 conference was held in India . In the first week of March , the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held . <p> The heads of state of the Western countries , including US President Joe Biden , who has visited Kyiv , now have only one goal to provide more weapons to Ukraine . <p> Even European countries like Switzerland and Sweden , which were the pioneers of the peace process , have now joined the ranks of these arms suppliers . There is no disagreement that what Russia is doing under the leadership of Vladimir Putin is wrong . Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Putin and publicly urged him to stop the war . He did not support this war . But does continuing to arm Ukraine and fuel the conflict bear a message of peace ? A year has passed since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict .

Therefore , equipment for Rooppur nuclear power plant is coming from Russia via India . As previously discussed , it was later stalled for some time due to US pressure . But India managed to uncomplicate it through diplomatic missions . As a result , the relationship between India and Bangladesh is getting stronger .

The situation of China 's terrible conflict with America will become more complicated . And anyway , China is not ready for any war . Not for World War III . Narendra Modi has also started a track-two dialogue with China . The discussion also suggested that Russia should stop the war in Ukraine and that Russia should not be targeted again by Ukraine .

Followed by the last report in 2020 , the latest investigation by the EU Disinfo lab in 2023 has once again exposed the never-ending Indian obsession which promotes anti-Pakistan/China narratives . Carrying the older trajectory , the " non-existent " sources and ghost " experts " are further evidence of the toxic disinformation campaigns launched by the world 's largest democracy . <p> Journalism plays an important role in people 's lives . It helps to create awareness on current events around the world . The dissemination of news in the modern era , however , lacks boundaries due to digitalization .

Whatever the medium , the message communicated to the public plays an important role in influencing the public mind and opinions . Yet , the truth is that facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked with authenticity instead of yellow journalism . <p> There are different actors in the field . Previous White House Director of Communications , Anthony Scaramucci for example aptly stated that bad actors exist , which produce bad sources .

Yet , two of the mentioned speakers informed EU Disinfo that such an event had never existed . <p> In 2021 , ANI quoted the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs ( CPFA ) , which is a think tank that does not exist . A thorough investigation discovered that some of the reports do not belong to real individuals . For instance , a report titled ' Deception Games : Pakistan 's Eyewash Action against Terror Groups ' , authored by ' Ronald Duchemin ' was cited by ANI , but there was no evidence to support Duchemin 's existence or expertise on Pakistan .

Does this disinformation campaign impact the stability nexus between India and Pakistan or China ? The more India is engaging itself in disinformation warfare , the more chaos will be in public thus , stability will be at stake . As a result , not only will stability be affected but the credibility of Indian news agencies will also nosedive .

@@98744233 <h> Magnanimity in politics <p> The ongoing political turmoil in Pakistan reminds me of Edmund Burke who was an Anglo-Irish statesman , economist , and philosopher . He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses , either by the monarch or by specific factions within the government . " Magnanimity in Politics " , said Burke , ' is not seldom the truest wisdom , and a great empire and little minds go ill together ' . <p> In the last almost 3450 years of recorded history , only 268 have seen no war . Hence , war remains one of the constants of human history , and has not diminished with civilization or democracy and it has remained the ultimate form of competition . The causes of war are the same as the cause of competition among individuals : acquisitiveness , pugnacity , and pride ; the desire for food , land , materials , fuels , and mastery . While states based on the inherited instincts of people may not be as restrained as individuals bound by the law of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feel unrestrained in misuse of power especially when in rule . The agitated opposition also acts recklessly and the state seems teetering on the brink of collapse . We have in the recent past seen similar examples in the USA , India , Turkey and Sri Lanka . Nevertheless , Pakistan has experienced such mayhem more often and consistently which begs introspection . <p> Politics is defined as the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups , or other forms of power relations among individuals , such as the distribution of resources or status . The major types of political systems are democracies , monarchies , oligarchies , and authoritarian and totalitarian regimes . The branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political science . Aristotle is regarded as the father of political science . He was a great Greek philosopher . He was the first one to give a working definition of political science . Political theory involves the study of the history of political thought as well as problems in contemporary political life that have a philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics means undertaking activities that are aimed at improving someone 's status or increasing wealth and power within an organization or the country , without much concern for fairness or foul ; how many politicians and their mentors can escape this observation ? <p> The word democracy comes from the Greek words " demos " , meaning people , and " Kratos " meaning power ; in the middle of the 5th century BC it denotes the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states , notably Athens . So democracy can be thought of as the " power of the people " : a way of governing which depends on the will of the people . Democracy is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation , or to choose governing officials to do so . A democracy is a society in which the citizens are sovereign and control the government ; did it ever happen in Pakistan ?

The five characteristics of Democracy are Elected Representatives , Independent Judiciary , Civil Liberties , Organised Opposition Party , and Rule of Law . How many democratic basic principles and characteristics are adhered to in Pakistan ? As the answer is depressing , let 's explore the reasons . <p> It may seem like stating the obvious but the basic reason remains the majority of the legislature gets elected by the dint of money , ethnicity , tribalism , and religious exploitation , etc. instead of meritocracy as in vogue for the Judiciary and the Executive . Thus the political elite has cunningly involved the able other two pillars of the state in the power and swag sharing through intermarriages and business partnerships .

There is no shortcut to an acceptable democratic system that embodies the basic principles and characteristics of democracy that ought to begin by ensuring meritocracy including higher education , competence , unblemished character and reputation for the election of the legislature through a transparent electoral system . The Judiciary and Executives have to be 100 percent apolitical which has to happen as an institutional imperative for the sake of the state and the people .

The current political acrimony and mayhem remind us of 1971 and 1977 like devastating environments that must be avoided . The military should let the politicians handle the self-created havoc and avoid getting dragged in once again . The wisdom lies in learning from history and not repeating it .

The tomb-contained was prepared for sleeping with mattresses and sleeping bags and it was only possible to enter the crypt through a ventilation shaft next to the church 's main entrance because the crypt entrance was covered with a tombstone .

@@99240231 <h> Insinuating Inundations <p> It is strategic to saddle abstract forces with material outcomes in the aftermath of any untoward situation . The benefit reaped by absolving oneself is astronomical while the self-inflicted wounds owing to the recalcitrance portrayed in admission of incompetence is inordinately apocalyptic . Pakistan has disproportionately braved the brunt of torrential rainfalls of biblical proportions yet attempted to exonerate itself through frail substantiations . Regardless , nations which do accord requisite appreciation to their obvious and obliterated shortcomings orchestrate conditions conducive to proliferation of their resilience in face of any proceeding accident . It has been , however , substantiated by reports of World Weather Attribution that the disastrous magnitude of rainfalls in Pakistan was caused by Climate Change . Nevertheless , the ability of Pakistan to mitigate the effects of these natural events is called into question . Nature has eventuated its task of manifesting wrath but the resilience of a nation is critical to survival of its nationals . <p> So , the rudimentary prelude for progression of this nation stems from the confluence of strategically designed soft power and the statutorily substantiated hard power from the perceptible receptacles of jurisprudence . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacitation of Pakistan in face of unabated rainfalls is reprehensible outcome of decades of insouciance and disregard on the part of the state . Thus , there are multi-faceted problems germinating from the submerged national landscape which engender substantial hector and lessons for potentially consequential future . Among them are economic , demographical , international and geographical lessons and the solutions for their adequate resolution . <p> In the economic field , Pakistan has been battered by dwindled finances and fragility of immediate revenue generating mechanisms . The loss caused by the floods has been calibrated , according to the reports by Al-Jazeera , to stand at $40 billion which tantamount to 10th percent of Pakistan 's GDP . The hard-earned infrastructures of financially frail masses along with the national crops have been ubiquitously destructed with ensuing economic cost for Pakistan . According to National Flood Response Coordination Centre ( NFRCC ) , destruction of crops across 8.25 million acres has exacerbated the economic situation of country in wake of the concerned rebellious floods . <p> This has led the country to articulate clamours for its deteriorating economic conditions globally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Disaster Management Authority and its provincial counterpart bears ample testimony to the fact . Resultantly the lesson to be learnt lies at the impoverished heart of the problem which is to establish vibrant financial institutions and economically cater to the existing ones which are blatantly bereft of adequate money . The inadvertent brunt of these economic costs is braved by citizens in proceeding years . To substantiate , efforts are underway by Ministry of planning to reduce Public Sector Development Programme ( PSDP ) from Rs800 billion to Rs500 billion . In successive years , Pakistan will spend further less than its contemporarily available meagre budget amounts . This teaches lesson of how reactive actions siphons off states from their own revenues when the culpably ignored avenues of preventive and pragmatic planning 's remain out of focus for responsible authorities and citizens . <p> The projected Gross Domestic Product of Pakistan is estimated -by Ministry of Finance- to dwindle to 5% , the prognostication of International Monetary Fund further lowers the threshold at 3.5% . Consequently , per capital income of country also remains prone to decline which causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way forward lies in the proactive charting of domestic course on which the nation must tread to attain the bare minimum economic support through its ( own ) state exchequer in face of any cataclysmic event . Further , establishment of local bodies must be considered as regional centres of economy are not only adequately remunerative but they provide immediate resources . Along with , establishing grassroots level bodies for fund collection will cultivate trust among natives and legitimise the position of these " community assistance " centres . Consequently , masses will contribute to these people-centric bodies with alacrity and strengthen their resilience in face of any climatic disaster . <p> In the demographical domain , unabated population and the asymmetrical proportion of state resources paints a clarion portrayal of approaching conflagration . The problem must be attributed to the ineptitude of successive governments as receding sand of management from lubricated palms of state has caused population to be swelled at such exorbitant magnitude . The presence of hundreds of millions with little to no regulation on their migration patterns must rattle the conscience of concerned authorities . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population creates concrete impediments in way of providing relief to masses . Country remains inhabited exponentially thus eclipsing the chances for further accommodation . <p> The lesson learned by floods against this backdrop is the imperative urgency to curtail the unfettered population explosion . Had the spiral of population abated retroactively , the statistics of victims would have been decreased . Although being cognisant of crucial revenue generated by population , the loss braved by majority of impoverished citizens in wake of flooding of 2022 forces the latter argument to weigh stronger . So , the responsibility must be shouldered by United Nations Fund for Population Activities and Pakistani authorities to robust the edifice of population control so that the loss of current proportion must be sliced in proceeding cataclysms . <p> In the International realm , the abstract dream of " bilateral cooperation " shattered due to the empirical realities in face of national flood assistance appeals . The false consciousness of " external saviours " diminished with the dawn of compelling evidence suggesting the blatant indifference by world in face of an inundated Pakistan . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Million of aid . This amount pales into glaring insignificance in face of the magnitude of disaster . Moreover , according to Voice of America China has provided $59 million of aid for floods in which $17 million are injected by Chinese Civil Society . The ceremonialism of these charities underline the indifference of countries based on their national interests . <p> The strategic and economic utility of any country inadvertently persuades its global counterparts to assist it in times of despair . Parenthetically , Pakistan must learn the lesson that world is tainted by its domestic concerns and any attempt to rely on foreign assistance decouples the country from prudence . Resultantly , the way forward lies in accentuating the urgency to enhance domestic productivity and strategic utility through means of technology and education . The intellectual development of a nation is harbinger of its global alliances . The nation must embark on a journey to build staunch foreign associations by capitalising on national " utility " in international arena . The concept by Henry Kissinger of " Co-evolution " must be kept as bench mark for developing regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within domestic enclaves of Pakistan but to generate " deliberate " assistance from foreign quarters -on the pretext of the state utility- must be the way forwards for policy makers . Nevertheless , this must not generate fragments of complacency within executive quarters . This suggestion must catalyse and stimulate foreign office in its pursuits for the eventuation of pragmatic anticipations in national interest . <p> In geographical landscape , Pakistan stands inexcusably ignorant as the modus operandi of public settlements is blatantly unregulated . For instance , preponderant factor in germinating cataclysm stems from the deliberate reluctance of successive governments to rein in elite encroachments on rural lands . The culpably imprudent impunity manifested in actions of these land encroachers causes hector for displaced masses and national geography The result of these contemptible and criminal activities is displayed in form of formation of millions of informal settlements which are prone to any approaching natural disaster . To establish this , according to Pakistan Slum Developers Map and United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction around 12 million out of Karachi 's 16 million population resides in informal settlements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprehensibly neglected owing to their unofficial status and are bereft of adequate material infrastructure . So , it goes without saying that why Karachi bore the most brunt of national floods and what lessons Pakistan needs to learn . The way forward lies in institutionalizing construction and introducing geographical manoeuvring for state subsistence . The concerned dormant authorities must awake from their strategic hibernation and proactively protect the national landscape from future cataclysms . <p> To encapsulate , Pakistan has accentuated its certain interests on expense of its other crucial arenas which needs to be ameliorated at breakneck pace . It is never too late albeit it is not , arguably , too early to galvanise resources and strategies to uplift the drowning nation . Pakistan has amalgamation of aforementioned repentances which are adequate to capitalise upon and build a vibrant future .

@@99240233 <h> PTI 'S fascist agenda <p> As taken from sources of Southern Methodist University , Dr. Joseph Goebbels was the Third Reich 's propaganda minister . After the WW2 , US soldiers came upon a massive notebook that Goebbels had dictated . It contains his propaganda guiding concepts . They are described in Leonard Doob 's 1950 essay based on Louis Lochner 's ( 1948 ) translation of the diaries . Here are the basic principles of Gobbles ' propaganda ; <p> Repeat lies till accepted as truth . <p> There is no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals . For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger , and this will always be " the man in the street . " Arguments must therefore be crude , clear and forcible , and appeal to emotions and instincts , not the intellect . Truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology . <p> Propaganda must facilitate the displacement of aggression by specifying the targets for hatred . Black rather than white propaganda must be employed when the latter is less credible or produces undesirable effects . <p> Avoid abstract ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ideas . Use stereotyped phrases . <p> Give only one side of the argument . Continuously criticise your opponents . Pick out one special " enemy " for special vilification . <p> Did PTI information managers derive their hate campaign against state institutions from Goebbels 's principles , this is the most important question being analysed in this paper , but before that , we would like to quote another example of mass mind control and injection of hate from the pages of pre-WW1 America . <p> Woodrow Wilson , who was elected President of the United States in 1912 , assumed office in 1913 with what was widely regarded as a neutral foreign policy . Wilson set out to keep the United States out of WW1 , which started in 1914 , and to use the nation as a peacemaker for other nations . <p> In August 1914 , Germany , Russia , France , and a great number of other nations were involved in fighting in Europe . Wilson offered assistance to the Allies in 2017 despite his best efforts to avoid war . The continued attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convincing the American public of the war 's necessity was Woodrow Wilson 's and his administration 's greatest obstacle . This brought about foundation of a promulgation machine called the Creel Board , which transformed the serene American public into a warmongering country inside a range of a half year . <p> PTI 's information managers appear to have been influenced by Joseph Goebbels and Nazi propaganda apparatus built by the party in early twenties in 20 century as well as Creel Committee of Woodrow Wilson . <p> Khan 's media handlers and devious backers from London and North America began assembling their own Creel Committee , which would spout " Hymns of Hate " around the clock , originally directed against the political establishment and then focusing on the Army , ISI , and its rank and file . A covert effort was made to transform IK from a politician into a cult leader in parallel with these " hymns of hate . " <p> This helped Imran Khan get support from disgruntled youth who were searching for the ultimate savior , but it also gave his close-knit support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pakistan 's strongman who could turn dirt into gold . The PTI had been developing a narrative that the Pakistan Army was the albatross around Pakistan 's neck and needed to be dismantled and rebuilt in accordance with the cult leader 's objectives . <p> The Army and ISI were to be undermined , and a chasm was to be created between the top leadership and the rank and file . In an effort to upend the Pakistan Army 's chain of command , storytelling , trivia , insults , and dark gossip were initiated on social media , particularly by a group of disgruntled and runaway retired veterans who are playing in the hands of hostile intelligence agencies . While defending their devotion to the PTI , these so-called insiders have continued to wage violent media assaults against the senior leadership of the Pakistan Army and the ISI . <p> It may also be important to compare the era of PTI regime with previous political parties to debunk the propaganda of human rights violations being propagated by Imran Khan and his head honchos today : <p> Serious violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political workers during Imran Khan 's regime .

Due to the PTI 's fascist politics , the European Union started considering the termination of Pakistan 's GSP and status . <p> Imran Khan 's cult followers were incited by indoctrination against political rivals . The unfortunate incident of attack on political rivals inside the premises of Masjid-e-Nabawi is a case in point . Imran Khan uses political leaders , allies and party activists as toys for his nefarious ambitions .

Given that the TTP has served as an ally in recent times and is an ideological extension of the Taliban , it perhaps makes sense for Kabul to keep pushing for talks , but Pakistan can ill afford to fall for this again . And rightly so , Islamabad has unequivocally told the interim Afghan government that talks can only be considered if the terrorist outfit surrenders and lays down arms . <p> According to sources , this proposal was put in front of Pakistan when Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited Islamabad last month . The clear-cut refusal shows that there is now clarity of thought and action .

More importantly , the residents of areas that bore the brunt of the war on terror and the resurgence of the TTP have put their foot down and are demanding the state to ensure that peace and stability is provided to them after years of loss , trauma , and suffering . Kabul of course will continue to advocate for talks as it is hesitant in taking its ideological cousin head-on .

Consequently , the policy interest rate would also decrease , he added . <p> The minister stated that there was a customary practice of forming two committees within the Federal Board of Revenue ( FBR ) -- one for business-related issues and the other for technical matters . <p> He said that the FBR chairman will obtain his approval on the matter , and the committees will be formed by Monday .

@@99619230 <h> Whither Noah 's Ark ? <p> A recent migrant boat disaster off Greece involving hundreds of lives onboard begs to awaken the human conscience if ever there was one . If we ca n't build a Noah 's Ark to save illegal migrants at sea , let us atleast build a Guantanamo-like detention centre in every maritime nation to rescue , restrain and hold such " heinous criminals " until deported . <p> Centuries ago , Noah single-handedly built an ark and saved humanity . Today , his descendants still struggle to find a water-tight solution that focuses on the last mile segment of an international humanitarian crisis of deadly proportions -- deaths at sea in derelict unsafe vessels . <p> Yes , it 's the migrants ' fault . These " heinous criminals " should n't have left their " homelands " to illegally enter another country and " steal " their resources . Yes , they should have been sane enough to refuse passage in a derelict unsafe creaking rust tub crammed beyond its capacity . Alas , if wishes were horses , beggars would ride ! No one leaves home unless the risk of dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to live back home . <p> It 's not a question of emotional blackmail of States who can rescue migrants at sea but a question of coordinating emergency responses to save lives . <p> Also , let us not enter into the great debate regarding State 's responsibility . Yes , a State of origin should be able to provide well for its citizens . Yes , a transiting State should crack down on the human-smuggling international networks that exploit human insecurities . Yes , a maritime State should exercise effective Port State Control to deny the operation of derelict unsafe rust-tub-like small boats from its shores . Yes , an adjoining maritime State should effectively patrol its waters to disrupt such human-smuggling attempts through seas of its jurisdiction . Yes , a destination State should build an effective programme to deny entry of such illegal immigrants in hordes lest they become a burden on its population . A State should do all this , and more . More so the States that are on the originating end of the problem bear the greatest responsibility for preventing such migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been eventually trapped in this vicious circle facing a certain death at sea ? It 's not a question of emotional blackmail of States who can rescue migrants at sea but a question of coordinating emergency responses to save lives . It is more of a case of a human 's right to live and a human 's responsibility to save lives . <p> Saving lives at sea from shipwrecks has been an ancient concern . Noah did it then by building an ark . And lately , when Titanic sank to its full doom in 1912 , the world scrambled to put together an International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea also short-titled SOLAS convention . And then we have the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue as well as focused legislation by the name of the Migrant Smuggling Protocol to the UN Transnational Organized Crimes Convention ( UNOTC ) . All these international legislations focus on the sacrosanct subject of the safety of life at sea . Thus in disasters like the current one at hand , it is the States from whose shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and States in whose vicinity these boats transit come under greater focus . The question of the right to visit the board and search a vessel/boat/flag flying another flag in international waters is very clear in international maritime law , and when human lives are at stake , the States have all the legal wherewithal to board such vessels for early rescue . However persistent maritime disasters point towards a deviant practice which needs to be looked into by the international community . <p> We must remember that illegal migrants are victims of an international mafia which exploits their economic fears and lands them on derelict unsafe ships . States enforce laws for unsafe joyrides in entertainment parks ; why not do the same at sea which is universal jurisdiction as far as Search and Rescue is concerned . Search &amp; Rescue is an international obligation and a Mariner 's first duty at sea ; so why do we tolerate criminal delay or neglect ? <p> Finally , I leave Hobson 's Choice for the reader . The world by and large made and accepted Guantanamo Bay to restrain dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar facility to retain such illegal migrants until their cases are decided and they are either given asylum or deported ?

@@99619233 <h> Pakistan 's Education Enigma <p> A remnant of the colonial era , the Pakistani education system is nothing short of an absolute disaster . Turning out more and more cataclysmic with each passing day , it is crippling the very core , and diminishing the hope for any improvement in future . The structure of education in Pakistan is ludicrous really . It is absurdly incongruous with the international standards . Corruption , bribery , dishonesty , deceit and nepotism are the fundamental values of our educational apparatus . The dereliction of pedagogy in Pakistan is the result of the heedlessness of governments and the imprudence of the people responsible . The situation is not grim just in ghettos and villages , but horrendous even in cities . <p> There seems to be in place a ' separatist agenda ' in the Pakistani educational structure . Those who are privileged end up in some fancy private university , and those who are left behind , seem to be quite lacking in every respect . This segregation has caused an increasing degree of polarisation of ideas and attitudes . The two sections view each other as some unknown species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at the bottom end . The two groups have a language barrier , ideology differences , and dissimilarity in the way of perceiving things . <p> We all hear the governments swanking their efforts on how strenuously determined they are for increasing the literacy rate in the country . Still , Pakistan remains one of the worst places in terms of educational performance . Although the education ministry claims the numbers to be 62.3% , most of these ludicrous intellectuals are a product of the ' hallowed ' Open University aka AIOU . In its preposterous effort for eradicating illiteracy in Pakistan , it has caused its educational demise . Owing to the AIOU , every second person is holding a master 's or even a doctoral degree . Clerks at the government departments , even incapable of arranging files , are highly qualified in terms of degrees , thanks to the AIOU . The notion here is not discouraging or criticising the idea of distance learning or remote education , but pointing out the quality of education , which is extremely poor compared with the world standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their rulers . <p> This system has supported the nourishment of fiscal as well as moral corruption . The very reason people chose this approach is that they know that by spending a few bucks , they can make people do their assignments and , by spending some more , they can clear the exams also . The other day , a guy was boasting about how he cleared his MPhil exam , despite leaving the answer sheet empty just because he got some reference there in the examination section . The piece of paper called degrees is not the only reason one needs universities or colleges for . Rather these institutions are in place to enhance your intellect , groom your personality , nurture your capabilities and prepare you for a future where you might play the role of a productive citizen . <p> Except for a few institutions , and that too of the private sector , the country 's educational arenas are an utter flop . Professors do everything except for educating students , and discuss everything except for education . The system has confined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called syllabi or curriculum . Our syllabus is not only decades old , but absurd also . The curriculum takes full care of limiting students ' minds to those narrow boundaries where they confine themselves to what 's written in the textbooks . Children are studying exactly similar books to what their parents or probably grandparents did . Perhaps this is the reason that we except for a few exceptions have failed to bring up individuals that could benefit mankind considerably . The world has progressed to the extent of creating synthetic human embryos , and we are making our students memorise books , and telling them how to decorate their answer sheets to impress the paper checker . <p> Parents flow cash , sending their children to schools or colleges in the morning , the preparatory classes in the afternoon , another coaching centre in the evening and some great intellectuals still feel the need for hiring tutors at home . They read books like crazy , staying awake at night . They prepare for the memory test which is held annually . Memory tests aka ' board exams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational structure . <p> The board exams are a ruinous aspect in this regard . Words can not describe the ruination in Sindh where students , who do n't appear for exams at all , end up topping them . In Lahore , which is thought to be better in these terms , the situation is no different . Even at the main examination centres , situated adjacent to the board office , bribery and cheating are common practices . The examination staff makes the exam room hell for those who deny following the routine . <p> In public institutions , the student-teacher relationship is in a deep depression . The two who need to be the closest so that they might exchange experiences , have alienated themselves entirely . This has caused a depletion of the respect for mentors among students . Teachers in Pakistan proudly enunciate how they keep students hushed in their classroom , which is rather something to lament upon . Students who raise a question are discouraged because teachers are not competent enough to answer their queries . Teachers prefer teaching students at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that their " sarkari naukri " is safe enough not to be disturbed by some random student 's complaint .

New and rational propositions are discouraged against traditional and ridiculous interpretations and arguments . The system focuses on imprisoning minds to think in a typical or backward manner . The students are forced to memorise the text rather than focusing on its practical application . The people called academia or intelligentsia do not exist in Pakistan . The VCs view universities as their estates with them being the rulers . Professors remain absent from classes and focus on maintaining their relations with the potent people . <p> We need some perspicacious minds which can revolutionise this otherwise sinking system . We need to appoint the right people to the right places so that they might initiate and expedite the restructuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Education breeds confidence . Confidence breeds hope .

@@99676238 <h> Deadlock Broken ? <p> It appears that the Prime Minister 's direct conversations with IMF functionaries might finally be breaking the longstanding deadlock . This could mean that the government could still secure the remaining tranches of the existing External Fund Facility ( EFF ) with the IMF , stipulated to expire by June 30 . <p> Naturally , this deadlock can only be broken if there are changes made to the recently announced budget and next year 's revenue and expenditure mechanism . Experts had consistently pointed to the government 's failure to raise its tax targets to the IMF-required levels , and it seems that this is one of the first changes made . An additional Rs215 billion is to be made through taxes imposed , and while the Finance Minister has stated that the objective is not to pass the burden off for these on the public , the inability to tax the wealthy effectively makes Pakistani taxation more regressive than our finance officials would like to admit . <p> There is also to be a cut in spending -- Rs85 billion 's worth -- to ensure that the4 government stays within stable limits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will not come out of the already-meagre development spending header , although where this shortfall will be adjusted has not been announced . <p> There is also an expectation that one of the changes the government will have to make going forward is to remove the stringent controls on imports and allow for the free market to function without intervention once again . This is naturally needed for production to resume as normal in all sectors , although with rising debt commitments and another IMF programme expected to add to this burden , it is likely that uncontrolled imports will be unsustainable unless Pakistan improves its production in import-reliant sectors and industries . Even with this sudden positive change in the talks between the government and the IMF , there is still some distance between the two , and it is hoped that this is bridged in the coming week before the deadline for the EFF elapses on June 30.

@@99785232 <h> Experts call for withdrawal of subsidies , tax exemptions to industries <p> ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to withdraw unnecessary subsidies and tax exemptions given to the export-based industries , mostly on energy prices , experts said . <p> " Subsidies have adverse effect on industries and damage their competitiveness , " said Dr Ishrat Hussain , former governor of State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) . He said that subsidies and tax exemptions are short-term solutions , not long-term ones . " Subsidies and tax exemptions can not guarantee competitiveness and high growth of an industrial sector , " he added . Dr Ishrat was of the view that concessions to the industry , especially on energy tariffs , is catastrophic for the economy of a country like Pakistan which is already dependent on loans to meet its budgetary expenditures . He said that despite pumping billions of rupees in export-oriented industrial sectors each year in the name of subsidies and concessions , the country 's exports are still below expectations .

" These subsidies to the industry are rather a burden on national exchequer if we analyse their long-term repercussions , " Dr Aneel said , adding that the government is borrowing excessively to absorb the cost of these concessions . He said these subsidies of electricity and gas tariffs are among the reasons of circular debt in the energy sector of the country . The Government of Pakistan in October last year announced a revised subsidy plan for five export-based industries . According to the plan , per unit electricity cost for these five industries was agreed at Rs19.99 per unit . However , the worsening economy forced the government to suspend the electricity package in March 2023.

If he was polite ( unlike many of my friends ) he would have scoffed . " Chinese ? Pagal hogaye ho ? Why would I waste my money on a Chinese product ? " To be honest , I would not have blamed him for saying so , because in those days the idea of a Chinese brand as a contender in the global market was far-fetched . However , today , Chinese brands have become household names across various product categories . <p> Take mobile phones . After the demise of Nokia and Blackberry , there was a time when the only options were Apple and Samsung . Today , brands like Huawei , Oppo , Realme , Vivo and Xiaomi have grabbed a substantial share of the market -- both locally and internationally -- and challenged the established giant 's hegemony . A remarkable shift that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , times have changed , and these stereotypes no longer hold true . Chinese brands have risen to the challenge and are delivering high-quality products that rival , and in some cases , surpass their Western counterparts . From smartphones to electronics , home appliances to automobiles , Chinese brands are making their mark and earning respect . <p> The success stories of Chinese brands span various industries . In the automotive sector , companies like NIO , Geely and BYD , have gained international recognition for their electric vehicles . Geely 's acquisition of Volvo and its subsequent success is a testament to China 's growing influence in the automotive world internationally . The same can be said of the Pakistani market , where with the introduction of brands like BAIC , Changan , Chery , DFSK and Haval . One may argue that it will take time before they pose a serious threat to the Japanese or Koreans , but in my opinion , it 's not a matter of if , but rather of when , as we have seen in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics , brands like DJI ( known for their drones ) , Lenovo ( a leader in personal computers ) and TCL ( high-quality televisions ) have made significant inroads globally . Chinese brands have not only caught up , they have surpassed expectations , challenging established players and gaining recognition for their innovative products . <p> So , what establishes the perception of a brand and its products ? In a cutthroat world of competition , it boils down to three factors : quality , innovation and customer experience . Recognising this , Chinese brands have made significant strides in each area . <p> Firstly , quality is no longer a concern . Chinese brands have invested heavily in R&amp;D , manufacturing processes and quality control , and today it is not uncommon to find Chinese products that match or even surpass the quality of their Western counterparts which are often manufactured in China . A major reason for this improvement in quality can be attributed to an increased shift in demand for local rather than western brands by Chinese consumers for whom the novelty of foreign brands has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with buying local . According to an article in Forbes , in 2011 , 70% of smartphone sales in China came from Apple , Nokia and Samsung , but currently , eight of the top 10 smartphone brands are Chinese , with Huawei , Oppo and Xiaomi in the top spots . According to a 2016 McKinsey report , over 62% of Chinese consumers prefer Chinese brands over foreign ones if the quality and price are perceived to be the same . This increase in volume demand for local products has allowed local manufacturers to reinvest in their quality-related processes . <p> Secondly , Chinese brands have shed their reputation as copycats and have become synonymous with innovation . They may have started with making ' me too ' imitations of western brands , but they have moved beyond this and become pioneers in their own right . Take Xiaomi ; while the company initially gained attention for emulating Apple , it quickly evolved into a powerhouse of original ideas and cutting-edge technology , offering consumer electronics across a wide range of categories . Then there is Tiktok , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiktok 's global success can be largely attributed to its innovative short-form videos and smart backend algorithm that has redefined content creation and consumption . Chinese brands have embraced innovation as a core value , leading to breakthroughs in various industries . They are no longer playing catch-up ; they are setting the pace and driving global trends . <p> Thirdly , Chinese brands have recognised the importance of providing exceptional customer experiences . They understand that it is not just about the product but about the overall brand experience . Companies like Alibaba have revolutionised the e-commerce landscape , making online shopping a seamless and enjoyable experience for millions of consumers worldwide . Brands like Shein have adopted a customer-centric approach , focusing on convenience , speed , and personalised service . Another example is NIO , an EV manufacturer , which has come to be known as the Tesla of China . Along with a fast-charging infrastructure , what sets NIO apart from Tesla and other local competition is their battery swapping technology ; unlike regular EVs , which need to be charged anywhere between 20 to 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can visit any of their battery swapping stations and have your battery swapped with a fresh one in less than three minutes . If this were n't enough , the brand offers emergency assistance and concierge services ; their showrooms , called NIO Houses , are more like clubhouses for owners and their friends and are equipped with caf ? s , libraries and lounges if they want to relax while their car is being serviced . <p> It is safe to say that Chinese brands have learned from the successes and failures of their Western counterparts and have taken their quality , innovation and customer experience to new heights . <p> Looking ahead , the future for Chinese brands seems promising . With a massive domestic market , abundant resources and a strong focus on innovation , these brands are poised for growth . Their success at home has given them a solid foundation to venture into international markets , where they can leverage their competitive pricing and advanced technology to gain a foothold . <p> Challenges , however , still lie ahead . Chinese brands need to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the curve as well as overcome residual doubts . <p> To conclude , Chinese brands have defied expectations .

Despite pressure from Zelensky , Ukraine was not invited to formally join the alliance . The Nato charter requires all member countries to come to the defence of any member country that is attacked . Considering the ongoing invasion by Russia , US President Biden astutely rejected Ukraine 's pleas for immediate membership , saying " This would bring us into a direct war with Russia , something we want to avoid " . <p> At the same time , the US and other Nato member countries repeated their commitment to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression , " as long as it takes " .

In the early days of the war , US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asserted a US goal of leaving Russia greatly weakened . Not much was said about exactly how that would happen . And in fact , what does it mean to try and ' greatly weaken ' a country , even a declining power , with thousands of nuclear warheads ? <p> In the meantime , the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine , occupied by Russia , has been largely turned into rubble .

Ukraine on the other hand is facing a serious risk of becoming a rump , or a landlocked state for all practical purposes . <p> Sadly , for all supporters of Ukraine , the recently launched , long-awaited Ukrainian counteroffensive does not appear to be making a meaningful difference on the ground . The fact that the US has just started to ship cluster bombs to Ukraine appears to be somewhat desperate . This is ammunition that over 100 countries have pledged never to use , due to the threat they pose to civilians in a post-war scenario . <p> There is a high risk the war may grind down to a stalemate -- an outcome Russia may be willing to live with , but that can hardly be acceptable to the people and leaders of Ukraine . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of waiting out its opponents .

@@100187232 <h> Messages from Karbala <p> As this week sees Muslims worldwide observing ' Muharram ' -- the first month of the Islamic year that begins on a note of sorrow -- the tragedy surrounding the massacre of Imam Hussain ( a.s ) on the 10th day of this month , reinforces powerful and enduring messages . <p> The tragic day of the massacre , remembered as ' Ashura ' , almost 1400 years ago saw at least 72 of the followers of Imam Hussain ( a.s ) , the grandson of Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) also brutally martyred . <p> Their bodies were mutilated by a military force of between 30,000-70,000 soldiers . The carnage -- unleashed after Imam Hussain ( a.s ) refused allegiance to Yazid bin Muawiya , the caliph at the time -- has no parallel in history . <p> The massacre was followed by the capture of women and children accompanying Imam Hussain ( a.s ) . Their campsite was burnt , they were brutally enslaved and forcibly taken on a 900 kilometers harsh journey first to Kufa and then to the court of Yazid bin Muawiya in Damascus . <p> Nowhere in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain death while carrying along women and children of his household . The tragedy of this journey after the massacre was unprecedented , as history fails to record the exact number of captives who left Karbala versus the number who arrived at their destination . Many children fell off the backs of camels as they raced ahead , leaving no trace of them . <p> In brief , if the massacre at Karbala is remembered for its brutality , its legacy has been preserved for all times to come by the patience , resilience , endurance and defiance shown by the survivors thereafter . Yazid 's ability to ensure peace was soon rocked across his powerful empire after the captives reached his court , and accounts of their ordeal became public . <p> The prisoners were kept waiting for three days in the historic ' Souq e Hamidiya ' -- a bazaar near ' Umayyad ' mosque in Damascus which housed Yazid 's court -- as preparations were ordered to lavishly celebrate the ruler 's victory . But as news spread of the events at Karbala , a powerful backlash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release of the prisoners . <p> History has carried powerful accounts notably of Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) , the younger sister of Imam Hussain ( a.s ) , of publicly rebuking Yazid and his followers . Her eloquence remains unparalleled , especially given her personal tragedy during this epic journey . She saw off two of her teenaged sons , Aun bin Abdullah ( a.s ) and Muhammad bin Abdullah ( a.s ) , join the martyrs of Karbala . <p> A powerful sermon by Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) in Yazid 's court has been preserved in history as a shining example of her defiance against powerful odds . Chistopher Paul Clohessy , a respected catholic priest in his book ' Half of My Heart -- the narrative of Bibi Zainab , the daughter of Ali Hazrat Ali a.s ' narrated her memorable words ; " Even if your Yazid public speech has brought down calamity upon me , I make light of your power , I find your scolding astonishing and I deem your censure excessive " . Referring to the massacre at Karbala , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blameless corpses and the mothers of the wild beasts efface them . Even if you took us as booty , you would find us an imminent loss , when you do not find anything but what you have perpetrated " . <p> Paying a rich tribute to Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) in the aftermath of Karbala , Clohessy wrote : " In spite of all she has suffered , she completes her task on a note of utter trust in the excellence and the sufficiency of God " . <p> Twice during this terrible journey , Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) stepped ahead to block the likely killing of Imam Zainul Abideen ( a.s ) , the teenaged son of Imam Hussain ( a.s ) who was among the prisoners and carried the lineage of his father for times to come . Historical accounts also record the exemplary role of Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) for bravely blocking Yazid from handing over Bibi Sakina ( a.s ) , the under-aged daughter of Imam Hussain ( a.s ) to a Syrian man who wanted to enslave the child . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release from Damascus just did not end the tragedy surrounding Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) . Her mission in life during gatherings became that of spreading the message of her slain brother and narrating the tragedy of Karbala . <p> Soon , the patience of the empire ran thin and Yazid ordered the governor of Madina to banish her from the city of Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) , to silence her words . By most historical accounts , Bibi Zainab ( a.s ) was likely martyred just seventeen months later in Damascus , a city best known worldwide for hosting her final resting place . <p> Hajjah Chahnaz A Kbaisi-Hazari in her book ' Who is Zaynab ' wrote : " The name Zaynab S.A. is associated with dignity and courage ; parents choose it for their daughters because it represents everything that is valuable and worthy and demonstrates the height of human achievement " . <p> Writing about the significance of events surrounding the prisoners of Karbala following their capture , subsequent travel and imprisonment in Damascus , Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Al-Hakim in his book , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wrote ; " These women and children bore the second portion of pains and calamities . It may even be said that this portion the massacre at Karbala being the first portion equals that portion borne by Imam Al Husayn and his menfolk and companions " . <p> The message of Karbala is especially relevant to people struggling worldwide today , encouraging them to carry on in the belief that their sacrifice will indeed pay off in the future . The period of mourning that begins this week for the victims of Karbala from almost 1400 years ago powerfully exhibits the strength of the tragedy and its compelling legacy as passed on from generation to generation . Ayatollah Al-Hakim aptly wrote : " The revolution of Imam al-Husayn a.s is not a revolution for a handful of days ..... It is a revolution that continues and remains ..... for everyday is Ashura and every land is Karbala " . <p> The writer is an **25;458;TOOLONG who writes on political and economic affairs .

@@100187233 <h> Enter PTI 2.0 ? <p> By Editorial Board <p> July 19 , 2023 <p> We may soon have a case of too-many-parties , not-enough-politicians in the country -- given the rate of mushrooming parties . Days after being thrown out of the PTI , reportedly over his failure to respond to a show-cause notice , former chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak has formed a new party , the rather obviously named Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians ( PTI-P ) . Bigwig politicos from the province have already joined Khattak , including former KP CM Mahmood Khan . It had initially been reported that about 57 ex-assembly members joined Khattak 's party but soon after a list was provided to the media , nine of those whose names were circulated distanced themselves from the new party . Reports indicate that some others may do the same . This too seems to be in keeping with the New Party Trend these days : when Jahangir Tareen launched his Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party ( IPP ) , even those who were present at the launching ceremony distanced themselves from the newly formed party in Punjab . Will Khattak 's PTI-P be a damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political observers are cautious in this assessment since they say that the dynamics of Punjab and KP are quite different and the future of Khattak 's party could be bright . Khattak retaining the ' PTI ' abbreviation -- while adding ' parliamentarians ' -- is also a clever move since by the time the next general elections are held , the PTI -- the original PTI , that is -- will likely not have too many willing candidates to contest the polls . This is not an exaggerated view seeing the trouble the PTI chairman and his party are in and talks of another ' purge ' once the PDM government 's tenure ends and a caretaker government takes charge . This should give Khattak the momentum his party needs just before the general elections take place and more big names from KP are expected to join his party over the coming weeks as per some experts . <p> It is believed that , despite Imran Khan 's popularity , it was Pervez Khattak 's politics that got the PTI a win in the KP elections in 2018 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , if one recalls , there was also talk that due to Khattak 's grip at the local level in the province , Imran had opted for Mahmood Khan to replace the former as CM , somewhat ' sidelining ' Khattak with a federal ministry . In KP politics , Khattak is seen as a seasoned politician , a man who has been part of the PTI 's negotiating committees in the past , and someone known for firm yet non-confrontational politics . If he is successful in accumulating enough disgruntled electables from the PTI in KP , he may be able to form the next government in the province -- something that will not be taken well by the JUI-F and other political parties that are eyeing the coveted KP government with the fall of the PTI . <p> This may also be a lesson in some hard irony for the PTI and Imran Khan , who had been gleefully announcing a split in the PML-N for years ( all that talk of ' sheen ' coming out of the ' noon ' in the PML ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or strategic differences between Nawaz and Shehbaz , the brothers are -- at least on the face of it -- standing together in one party . With just a few weeks left before the end of the PDM government 's tenure -- whether assemblies are dissolved a few days earlier or not -- the next elections are going to be interesting -- and not just in the centre . We have a new party in KP , a whole new set of alliances going on in Balochistan and Punjab still up in the air . The future of Khattak 's party depends on many factors , one of which is Imran Khan and his party 's future .

As per the WHO , 20.5 million children did not receive " one or more vaccines delivered through routine immunization services " in 2022 as compared to 24.4 million children in the previous year .

Pakistan ranks eighth in terms of countries with the most ' zero-dose ' children -- with 611,000 children not receiving a single dose of the DTP vaccine .

That so many of our people continue to suffer from diseases that the wealthier countries of the world have all but overcome highlights the need to improve delivery of immunization services and crucial health services in general .

There is also the need to dismiss the persistent anti-vaccine propaganda and fake news that discourages families and communities from vaccinating their children and , in the case of polio , even leads to attacks on vaccine workers . This ugly sentiment reared its head during the Covid-19 pandemic when anti-vaccine rumours were rampant , showing that many people still remain suspicious of vaccines regardless of the clear scientific evidence to the contrary . Dispelling this mindset once and for all will require more targeted messaging from the government about the safety of vaccines and their indispensable nature when it comes to saving us from disease and death .

He also talked about the 20th century in which information flow was controlled and many disastrous events like the Khojaly genocide had been denied proper placement in international media . <p> Participants of the forum confirmed the reality that the acceleration of industry trends has prompted local and international media outlets to rethink and re-design their business models as technological progress penetrates every segment of modern society and significantly impacts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new media products and services . <p> As the new development phase of the modern era , known as " Industry 4.0 , " brings many new concepts related to media and presents an array of challenges for traditional and digital media , therefore , the Shusha Global Media Forum focused on analyzing trends in the media industry globally , strengthening national opportunities , expanding and developing international cooperation , and exploring innovative opportunities . <p> The majority of the speakers were of the view that the growth of digital communication and information technologies had accelerated the development of the global information society and provided for the modernization of the media to meet new challenges . Leading sector practices enable information to reach a wide audience in a short time using multiple channels and here was the big risk of mingling fake news with true news . The rapid and wide spread of information and disinformation is a global issue due to the instant digital transformation of content into products . <p> Media practitioners emphasized that communicating information in the right form , at the right time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local and global agenda and considering the value of information in people 's social consciousness and the important role of information and communication technologies gains a completely new meaning , accompanied by the constant changes in the tools , producers , and consumers , as well as the role of media in different processes . <p> The urge for traditional media to remain relevant as a source of news in the race against new media types provides a favorable ground for the development of many new concepts , principles , and new types of media content in journalism . The changes emerging in the field of media demand greater use of new types of journalism and wide application of new trends in a diverse environment for the more successful delivery of news to the target audience . <p> Speakers were of the view that the process of media integration into the global network is about combining different technologies on a single platform and the design of new products , as well as the dissemination of information from one source by different methods and technical means simultaneously . In today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient and prompt access to information from various sources , thereby increasing the amount of digital information . <p> Participants agreed that the transformation had created new and broad opportunities for a greater number of people to interact with each other and join public discussions and the role of the media in daily life and the scope of its influence kept growing and had raised questions to reconsider the working principles of the traditional media and the role of the media in modern societies . <p> A number of participants expressed their concerns that the transmission of information to millions of people in a short time by using new means and tools had a serious impact on the quality and credibility of information being transferred to the end users . <p> In the new media environment , the intermediary activity in the transmission of information differs from the activity of traditional media sources . While traditional media outlets , such as audiovisual and print media , are the main producers of news , online media with little investment in news production is critically challenging the traditional news industry . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised serious threats to the credibility of news because investigating the credibility of information , checking the transparency of information , and verifying data are time-consuming and expensive processes while users want to get information about an event " instantly " , thereby increasing the risk of receiving fake information . Speakers were of the view that consumers share responsibility through making conscious decisions of checking what kind of source of material they are opting to read . <p> Participants were of the opinion that increasing media literacy was of pivotal importance to combat false or misleading information and harmful or illegal online content and definitely contributes to media diversity and pluralism . <p> The Chief Editor Dispatch News Desk ( DND ) News Agency Agha Iqrar Haroon was of the opinion that today 's fake news was n't a new phenomenon rather fake news was born when the first newspaper was published but at that time fake news was called " propaganda " . Yesteryear 's propaganda is today 's fake news . Nothing has changed in dynamics if you talk about real journalism . User takes responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting news . Moreover , Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is bringing more fake information and user should only get connected with reliable news sources . <p> " Every professional editor understands that his/she is the prime target of those who wish to install fake news ( propaganda ) it is up to the skills of the editor how to keep clean his/her media hub from being used by others for their ulterior motives " , commented Iqrar Haroon . <p> Important points raised by speakers are hereunder : <p> " Disseminating unbiased and fact-based news , as well as preventing false and misleading information , is one of the main conditions for the creation of a healthy information environment , namely given the overall developments on the global landscape . Indisputably , in an environment of crisis , unexpected or difficult-to-predict force majeure events , the existence of mechanisms to inform the public , as well as prompt and professional journalism , is of critical importance for the delivery of accurate information about the events from the first source to the relevant channels . Journalists , acting under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important mission by collecting and delivering full information about the developments on the ground , and in many cases increase the prospects for long-term progress and peace . <p> A session was also delegated to " Conflict journalism " as it is one of the most essential areas in journalism , serves to bring serious human rights violations , war crimes , and other issues to the attention of the international community , implement international humanitarian law and contribute to the prevention of its violation . In this respect , ensuring the safety of media representatives for journalists to fulfill their professional duties and serve society is one of the most pressing issues of recent times . For this purpose , it becomes more and more critical to research and develop a range of advanced and successful strategies to protect journalists ' safety and to provide them with the necessary equipment " . <p> The forum participants had an opportunity of interacting with President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev who had a three-hour-long candid communication with foreign journalists and shared his ideas about emerging media and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While appreciating the positive role of media in nation-building , President Ilham Aliyev said that media keeps him updated about what is going on across the country and such information helps him to manage good governance and mitigate injustice if it happens anywhere in the Caucasus country . <p> President Ilham Aliyev shared his political , administrative , and foreign affairs philosophy that has brought exceptional economic growth , remarkable social and political stability , and exemplary defense and strategic success to Azerbaijan under his leadership . <p> Azerbaijan 's president said that social as well as traditional media are excellent tools for getting information about what is happening in the country and it helps to mitigate bureaucratic glitches by providing information if something wrong is happening anywhere in the country . <p> President Ilham Aliyev was of the view that responsible media plays a pivotal role in good governance because it is a counter-check over the bureaucratic system . 
@@100316232 <p> Back in olden days , Mughal Kings often resorted to hire services of robbers , looters , and bandits to kill a perceived traitor or a dissident from within their court whom they could not publicly kill , prosecute , convict , or imprison . The modus operandi used to be that such dissident and influential minister of the court was first persuaded to undertake a holy journey which is known as Pilgrimage to Mecca . Somewhere in the wilderness of jungles and deserts during the long tract between India and Hijaz the present-day Saudi Arabia which homes the Holy site , the target would be killed by bandits , robbers or looters : Safe method ! the king had undeniable alibi and the dirty job is done , away from the kingdom and without causing any ripples at home . <p> Modern states developed about 200 years ago with institutions such as Parliament , Judiciary and the Executive in place , the state was also expected to come clean when dealing with such perceived delinquents .

There are no formally hired contractors . However . Instead , the dirty job is put to auction amongst criminal mafias and whosoever can best deliver is paid head money in advance . Recent brutal killing of Harjeet Singh Nijjar in Surrey , BC Canada is a case in point . <p> On June 17 , 2023 , Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot down on point blank in broad day light in the parking lot of the biggest Sikh Temple of Canada , the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara of which he was also President . Nijjar 's assassination shocked and outraged the Sikh Community around the world particularly those who support the creation of Khalistan , a sovereign State in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was known to his co-religionists for avid activism for Khalistan and was recognized as the face of ongoing Khalistan Referendum in Canada . At the time of his death , he was organizing a voting event in Surrey on September 10 . <p> Hardeep Singh Nijjar <p> Nijjar 's death is not just another killing on the streets and neither has it any light implications , rather it signals grave and rising concerns coming out of new model adopted by the Indian State to deal with dissidents living abroad . <p> The " crime " of the notable Canada based Sikh leader was his active involvement in an entirely peaceful campaign -- the global Khalistan Referendum -- being undertaken around the world including Canada seeking the votes of Sikh population on the question of creating an independent homeland in the Indian governed region of Punjab . Besides what Nijjar publicaly and privately divulged regarding threats to his life from mercernaries hired by India , other well-placed sources have also claimed that Nijjar was under credible threat to the extent that just days before being gunned down , the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brave and extremely committed Sikh sovereignist could not appreciate the seriousness of the threats and was gunned down on point blank for promoting the cause that he believed in . <p> Dealing with secessionists. separatists etc. at home or abroad is recognized as a legitimate function of any state but it is always prohibitive of use of violence . International legislation and practices exist to support action against such elements , e.g. , prosecution if violence is incited , requesting red warrants , seeking extradition and deportation , however , the dilemma Indian government seemingly faces is that there exists no credible evidence , beyond the rhetoric allegations , of Nijjar 's involvement in any criminal or violent activity . Add to that , that the activism for Khalistan Referendum , contrary to the wishes and lobbying of India , is not considered by the western democracies as any " crime " at all , let alone terrorism -- a label that India wishes to associate the secessionist voting exercise with . <p> For the countries particularly the west , the point to ponder and reflect upon is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with popular movement such as Khalistan Referendum could shamelessly hire private mafia and assassins to murder targets abroad . Nijjar 's assassination is clearly a strong signal that the India could unleash at a reign of terror at will whenever and wherever it wanted . <p> Time has come for western democracies to address this rising trend of blatant violation of sovereignty by India within their borders on their soil wherein dissidents of India are being silenced through brutal killings . The fact that in some cases the relevant country already had intelligence well before human targets were put to death adds insult to injury . Apparent failure to stop such heinous crimes against humanity in Canada as also in other jurisdictions is a challenge to world conscience . Political activists for instance Chinese , Russian and South Asian dissidents living in the West have already been killed by unknown criminal gangs during past few years .

This instrument would facilitate frictionless transactions while simultaneously championing philanthropy and promoting innovation . <p> What is Shariah Compliance in Finance ? To gain a deeper understanding of the prospects of Islamic Coin , we need to explore what Shariah compliance in the financial sphere means . <p> ?

This approach also encourages sustainable development by mandating businesses operate responsibly towards society and the environment . <p> Islamic Coin aspires to anchor itself upon these principles when launching its cryptocurrency . While these tenets make sense theoretically , their practicality is a different matter .

A Fatwa signifies an " opinion " from an Islamic authority asserting conformity with Shariah principles . This means Haqq can now assert that it has earned recognition and stands at the precipice of a revolution in Islamic finance . <p> While a positive Fatwa is n't legally binding , it offers assurance of alignment with the precepts prescribed in the Quran and Islamic teachings . However , not all Muslim authorities capable of issuing Fatwas agree with this Fatwa . <p> Islamic Coin aims to persuade practicing Muslims that its use can economically uplift the Muslim community . It intends to accomplish this while maintaining Islamic values via the application of block chain technology and other innovations . <p> The Driving Forces behind Islamic CoinThe key figures orchestrating the project present a fascinating amalgam of expertise .

@@101072230 <h> Electoral Uncertainty <p> As per the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) , the process of fresh delimitation of national and provincial assembly constituencies can be completed by December 14 , at the earliest . This means that conducting the general polls in 2023 may not be an option . We can expect more polarisation in the political arena , with a few parties like the PTI already vowing to contest this decision through the Supreme Court ( SC ) . Accordingly , the path forward remains to be turbulent at best and all eyes are now on whether all relevant authorities will be able to expedite the process and conduct elections fairly soon , if not within the constitutional requirement of 90 days after the dissolution of assemblies.The Council of Common Interests recently approved and notified the results of the digital census and as per the ECP , delimitation of constituencies can not be possible before December 14 .

In fact , such a reaction is to be expected since the government had been touting the promise of timely elections ever since it came into power , and the fact that all political parties had emphasised upon its importance.At the same time however , it is equally important to recognise that this process is essential for conducting fair elections and is rather tedious in nature .

Akin to this , Iran holds strategic importance for Moscow , potentially enabling the creation of a North-South corridor . This corridor could enable Russia -- a significant oil and grain exporter -- to transport goods through the Persian Gulf , connecting Asia and Africa while circumventing the Black Sea and northern Europe . Similarly , Argentina , which had persistently pleaded for the BRICS membership citing the rationale of integrating Latin America for the sake of continental equilibrium , is currently grappling with a currency crisis due to recent devaluation , but still it is a substantial middle-income nation .

Their propositions resonate harmoniously with the pursuit of an equitable , efficient , and harmonious global structure . This infusion of constructive ideals from the BRICS bloc radiates positivity , bestowing a revitalizing influence upon the world stage . This year 's BRICS summit has captured the criticism of certain Western nations . They view the prospective enlargement of BRICS as a " threat " or a Beijing-driven manoeuvre to fashion it into an anti-G7 force , countering Western influence .

@@101313236 <h> The vicious cycle of circular debt in energy sector <p> Circular debt , a term that has become synonymous with Pakistan 's energy sector , refers to the cascading cycle of non-payments throughout the energy supply chain . This phenomenon has been a persistent challenge for Pakistan , with its roots deeply embedded in the structural and operational inefficiencies of the sector . <p> The genesis of Circular Debt in Pakistan is the result of several factors . <p> Subsidies and Tariff Disparities : The Pakistani government , aiming to protect consumers from high electricity costs , often provides subsidies . However , delays or inadequacies in these subsidies lead to a revenue-cost mismatch , which is a significant contributor to the circular debt . While subsidies are intended to make electricity more affordable for consumers , their mismanagement has contributed to the circular debt crisis . The government 's well-intentioned efforts to shield citizens from soaring energy expenses have inadvertently strained the energy sector 's financial health . When subsidies are not allocated in a timely and accurate manner , the gap between the cost of generating and distributing electricity and the revenues generated widens , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy sector in Pakistan faces challenges like transmission losses , power theft , and aging infrastructure . These inefficiencies inflate the cost of delivering electricity , and when tariffs do n't cover these costs , the debt accumulates . Addressing operational bottlenecks is a critical step in curbing the circular debt cycle . Transmission losses , often attributed to outdated infrastructure and technical inefficiencies , result in a significant amount of electricity being lost before it reaches consumers . Power theft , another issue , further exacerbates the problem . Modernizing infrastructure , employing advanced technologies to reduce transmission losses , and implementing strict measures to prevent power theft are vital to minimizing operational costs and stabilizing the sector . <p> Payment Delinquencies : State entities and government departments sometimes delay or default on their payments , exacerbating the debt situation . Government entities owe a substantial portion of the circular debt due to their delayed or incomplete payments . Implementing streamlined payment systems and enforcing penalties for payment defaults can significantly alleviate this burden and prevent the domino effect of non-payments throughout the supply chain . <p> Regulatory Hurdles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power generation , often face bureaucratic delays or political considerations . Transparent and efficient regulatory mechanisms are essential for preventing the escalation of circular debt . Tariff adjustments that accurately reflect the actual cost of power generation and distribution must be made promptly to prevent revenue shortfalls . Political considerations and bureaucratic hurdles must be minimized to ensure a fair and sustainable energy pricing structure . <p> Global Market Volatility : Pakistan 's reliance on imported fuel for power generation makes it vulnerable to global oil and gas price fluctuations . Delays in adjusting these cost changes in consumer tariffs can lead to debt accumulation . Mitigating the impact of global market volatility requires a balanced approach . Developing a diversified energy mix that includes renewable sources , such as solar and wind power , can provide a buffer against the volatility of fossil fuel prices . By investing in renewable energy , Pakistan can enhance energy security and reduce its susceptibility to global market fluctuations . <p> - Advertisement - <p> As of 2023 , the circular debt stock reached a historical high of Rs 2.5 trillion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CD flow overruns of PRs 387 billion ( 0.5 percent of GDP ) relative to the Circular Debt Management Plan ( CDMP ) from early-FY23 . <p> The alarming scale of circular debt underscores the urgency of implementing comprehensive measures to address the issue . A debt burden of this magnitude not only cripples the energy sector but also has far-reaching implications for the overall economy , hindering growth and development . <p> What does Circular Debt really mean ? <p> Financial Strain on Power Producers : The accumulation of energy sector circular debt has been on the rise . This accumulation puts a strain on power producers , affecting their ability to procure fuel or maintain operations . Power producers , caught in the crossfire of payment delays and rising operational costs , face financial instability . Insufficient funds hinder their capacity to procure necessary resources , invest in technology upgrades , and ensure smooth operations . This strain can lead to a downward spiral , with reduced energy production and an increased risk of power outages . <p> Stifled Investments : The persistent issue of circular debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure upgrades and modern technologies in the energy sector . Investor confidence is crucial for the growth and modernization of the energy sector . The shadow of circular debt discourages both local and foreign investors from committing resources to energy projects . This lack of investment translates to delayed infrastructure upgrades , hampering the sector 's ability to meet growing energy demands and adopt cleaner and more efficient technologies . <p> Power Outages : Financial constraints can lead power producers to reduce or halt production , resulting in power blackouts , which have been a recurring issue in Pakistan . Power outages are not merely inconveniences ; they disrupt daily life , hamper industrial productivity , and strain the economy . As circular debt continues to mount , power producers ' ability to generate electricity consistently diminishes , intensifying the risk of power shortages and blackouts . The resultant disruptions in energy supply have a domino effect on all sectors of the economy . <p> Economic Setbacks : Industries suffer from inconsistent power supply , leading to reduced production and economic slowdown . The diversion of funds to address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy is essential for a country 's economic prosperity . The persistent circular debt issue disrupts the energy supply chain , causing industries to operate at suboptimal levels . Reduced production not only affects revenue generation for businesses but also hampers economic growth and development . Additionally , the redirection of funds to tackle circular debt detracts from investments in critical infrastructure and social development projects . <p> Eroding Consumer Confidence : The frequent power outages and deteriorating quality of power supply erode consumer trust , leading to increased payment defaults . A dependable energy supply is fundamental to maintaining public trust . However , frequent power outages , voltage fluctuations , and inadequate service quality undermine consumer confidence . In response , consumers may resort to delaying or defaulting on payments , further exacerbating the circular debt crisis . Rebuilding consumer trust requires not only improved service delivery but also transparent communication about the efforts being made to address the issue . <h> Circular debt , while a complex issue , is not insurmountable .

Transparent and fair tariff adjustments are crucial to maintain the financial health of the energy sector . Regulatory bodies must be proactive in assessing the actual costs of power generation , distribution , and infrastructure maintenance . Timely adjustments that align tariffs with costs can prevent revenue shortfalls and reduce the accumulation of circular debt . <p> Boosting Operational Efficiency : Modernizing infrastructure , leveraging technology to reduce transmission losses , and implementing stringent measures against power theft can bring down operational costs . Modernizing the energy infrastructure is an essential step toward reducing operational inefficiencies . Advanced technologies such as smart meters , grid automation , and demand-side management can minimize transmission losses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power theft , such as stricter penalties and improved monitoring , can curb revenue losses and contribute to the reduction of circular debt . <p> Streamlined Payment Systems : Digital payment solutions and ensuring timely payments from government entities can alleviate a significant chunk of the debt .

Digital payment solutions can streamline the payment process , ensuring that payments are made on time . Moreover , ensuring that government entities and other major consumers fulfill their payment obligations promptly can prevent the accumulation of debt at the source . <p> Diversifying Energy Sources : Investing in renewable energy can reduce dependency on volatile global fuel markets , offering a more stable cost structure . Diversifying the energy mix is a strategic approach to reducing Pakistan 's vulnerability to global fuel price fluctuations .

In the case of India , they have lately focused on the GST ( Goods &amp; Services Tax ) and lev ? eraged its digitised transactional val ? ue to in turn spur the nation 's tax-to-GDP ratio .

Narratives also play a key role in global poli ? tics . There is a mixed narrative and debate on BRICS and the way China has asserted its influence . It depends on how one views the developments . <p> The criticism of BRICS is that it does not have any planned and well-elaborated membership criteria . Therefore , becom ? ing part of BRICS does not actually mean much . It also does not have a well-chalked-out strategic direction for what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRICS would be . It should also be kept in mind that there are limits to cooperation among rival states in the Middle East .

China is their new hero , at least in terms of optics . To them , China is the big country that is out there to build con ? sensus , cooperation , and address issues like regional rivalry . Recent diplomatic developments like the Saudi-Iran d ? tente are considered a Chinese masterstroke and a diplomatic win .

During these periods , they have wished to extricate themselves from the quagmire of conflict that could end up toppling governments and kingdoms . The Middle East has been in the eye of the storm for too long . Con ? sequently , it wants to see a world of certainty , predictability , and stability . China offers just that . <p> China proposes to put an end to potential and anticipated cri ? ses in the Middle East through diplomacy . This is a relief for many apprehensions that the region has had . How long that will last is yet to be seen . Its durability is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears to rest for the moment . <p> BRICS boasts to represent 40% of the global population and a quarter of global GDP . With six influential states join ? ing the mechanism , the total wealth would be around 31 tril ? lion dollars . However , where China lacks is a durable regional mechanism that can actually perform and bring about change at the grassroots level . <p> This requires cooperation and foolproof economic mecha ? nisms outlined by the states . At the moment , the Middle East ? ern countries have not outlined a proper mechanism for coop ? eration . It is still in a nascent stage . The region is recovering from decades of wars , like Afghanistan , and is infested with ter ? rorist organisations operating from the Far East to Africa . <p> Economic stagnation , terrorism , and regional rivalries are some of the many issues that plague the regions of the Far East , Asia , the Middle East , and Africa .

@@101457239 <h> Finance ministry expects slow but steady recovery of economy <p> ISLAMABAD-The ministry of finance has noted that inflation outlook has deteriorated , and there is heightened risk to external stability . " In Pakistan , the inflation rate has been volatile in recent years , influenced by various factors such as currency devaluation , energy , and food prices in global market . The Pakistani rupee has experienced significant depreciation in recent years , influenced by various risk factors such as trade imbalances , external debt , political instability , and global economic conditions , " the ministry of finance said in Fiscal Risk Statement FY2023-24.The State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) is actively responding to increasing inflation by raising the policy rate . Moreover , the government is also focusing on taking effective policy , administrative and relief measures to control inflation and stabilize the economy . A slow but steady recovery of the economy is expected . According to provisional estimates of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics , Pakistan 's real GDP growth rate is 0.29 percent in FY2023 . Over the medium-term , growth is expected to rise to the levels even higher than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually reach to 5.5 percent in FY2026 . A gradual decrease in the inflation rate due to improvement in domestic and global factors and PKR stabilization are expected over the medium term.The pace of economic activity during FY2023 has been significantly constrained due to several factors , such as demand compression measures , losses in agricultural production caused by floods , uncertainty regarding the resumption of the IMF program , a difficulty in meeting external financing needs and maintaining foreign exchange reserves . The inflation outlook has deteriorated , and there is heightened risk to external stability . The uncertainty surrounding the future adjustment path in energy prices is the main upside risk to the inflation outlook . However , a potential moderation in international commodity prices may contribute to a reduction in inflation . Further , exchange rate adjustments , passing on the impact of energy price increases , and interest rates on higher side would enable the prices to decline over the medium term . Subsequently , it would follow the expansionary monetary policy and improvement in fiscal space in view of decline in mark-up payments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year can bring macroeconomic and fiscal benefits in the medium-term.During the first half of the current fiscal year , there was a noticeable decline in average international oil prices , which is expected to continue soon amidst concerns of a global recession . The government has forecasted a reduction in the current account deficit to USD3.7 billion in FY2023 , which appears feasible . However , this projection is subject to certain risks . A more significant than expected slowdown in global demand could have a negative impact on Pakistan 's export outlook and workers ' remittances . Furthermore , global , and domestic uncertainty also pose a downside risk to this forecast . On the upside , a larger than anticipated slowdown in domestic demand or a relatively sharp fall in global commodity prices could improve the current account deficit and reduce fiscal risk.The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit by implementing measures such as expanding the tax net , rationalizing subsidies , and promoting economic growth . However , the challenge of rising debt servicing could hinder the reduction of the fiscal deficit . Three scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks . The scenario 1 projects/simulates the reactions of revenues , expenditures , and fiscal deficit in a situation where government can have access to low-cost availability of financing options ( reduction of 2 percentage points of interest rate on external debt and 4 percentage points in domestic currency interest rate ) . It is expected that the net federal revenues will remain at 6.7 percent of GDP , federal expenditures will eventually reach 9.7 percent of GDP whereas federal fiscal deficit will touch 3.0 percent of GDP.The scenario 2 elaborates the responses of revenues , expenditures , and fiscal deficit to reduction of 50 percent in non-tax revenues against baseline projections . The net federal revenues will decrease to 5.3 percent of GDP , federal expenditures will remain at 10.6 percent of GDP , and federal fiscal deficit will increase to 5.4 percent of GDP . The scenario 3 highlights the reactions of revenues , expenditures , and federal fiscal deficit , if growth rate remains below the projected rate by 0.5 percent every year in the medium term.By FY2026 , the net federal revenues , federal expenditures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.0 percent , and 3.9 percent respectively . Federal fiscal deficit is more sensitive to low non-tax revenue collections than decrease in interest payments or GDP.The Government of Pakistan has initiated several policy reforms to restore fiscal discipline and debt sustainability , safeguard monetary and financial stability , and maintain a market determined exchange rate ( to rebuild foreign currency reserves ) . Key initiatives to manage macroeconomic shocks include the following restrictive monetary policy through higher interest rates , both to reduce inflation and help address external imbalances -- monetary tightening has resulted in 8.75 percent increase in the policy rate since April 2022 .

@@101846233 <h> The climate-hunger nexus <p> Pathways to resilience are never easy , but as global and national stock takes suggest , it is the only way forward for countries seeking to save their populations from growing climate stress . The UNFCCC defines climate resilience as a whole-of-society capacity to anticipate climate risks and hazards , absorb shocks and stresses , while reshaping and transforming development pathways . <p> With COP28 coming up in UAE , the fact that the last G20 meeting in India underplayed climate commitments already indicates that the countries responsible for 85 per cent of global emissions are not ready for transformational action on mitigating their carbon footprint enough for keeping 1.5 alive , or moving towards carbon neutrality . What that means is that in the near-term at least we will have to expect higher temperatures and higher exposure to the risks climate emergencies bring . If developing countries are to face the future with some degree of wellbeing , then populations will have to be protected from climate disruptions that will only grow . One of the key lessons learnt from the last few years of climate emergencies is that every disaster or slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that limit options for shelter , healthcare , and of course enhance fragility . Higher risks of poverty and food insecurity invariably follow . <p> The National Adaptation Plan Pakistan introduced in July 2023 is , like other such plans , not meant to function as a stand-alone set of actions . It is designed to prioritize interventions that prepare the country for changing its model of development , planning , managing disaster risk and resourcing resilience . It targets agriculture along with water , as principal sectors for substantive reform actions that are long overdue . Why ? Because agriculture is still the backbone of Pakistan 's economy , supports 40 per cent of its labour and accounts for 20 per cent of its GDP . It is critical to Pakistan 's growth , employment , poverty reduction and food security ambitions . <p> The entire Asia-Pacific region is facing the stress of growing scarcity , hunger , food price inflation , with agricultural workers living on the edge of poverty compelled to work in the heat outdoors despite rising temperatures . The UN FAO says that 418 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 375 million in 2020 , which tells us that the entire region has no option but to adapt . Agricultural workers in countries with low or medium human development were among the worst affected by exposure to extreme temperatures , ( according to the UN HD index ) suffering almost half of the 295 billion potential work hours lost due to heat in 2020 . Women remained the most vulnerable and malnourished as in almost all the labour cohorts , while they carried added burdens of transporting water from source to home for their families and farm use . <p> Given that Pakistan is already 40 per cent food insecure and projected to be at 60 per cent by 2050 or earlier , it is clear that conventional governance is no longer the path to a sustainable or self-reliant future . Climate change has triggered extreme weather events , droughts , flooding , sea level rise and heatwaves , that have critically impacted agricultural productivity , soil quality and led to shrinking crop yields and poor livestock health . Land , water and labour are all under stress as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by 1.5 to 4.2 times below field potential , and 2.1 to 5.6 times below international best practices . <p> Changing consumption patterns , dietary habits , supply chain disruptions in imported fuel , fertilizer , and growing populations have all challenged both the price and demand for food all over the country . Food inflation , in fact , has defined new levels of deprivation for both the urban and rural poor in Pakistan . At the Sustainability Project 's impact findings , a worrying growing year-on-year decline in food systems resilience has been noted for all of the Asia Pacific region . From this author 's own findings , Pakistan is clearly in a recovery trap , where countries have little time to recover from climate disruptions before their agri-water systems have little time to sustainably recover , let alone embark on better , yet unfamiliar and locally untested practices . <p> Despite a few sub-national actions to begin conserving water by blocking inefficiencies in the Indus basin irrigation system , no serious interventions have been made in Pakistan to check the decline in agricultural productivity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put agricultural land under stress , particularly in Punjab . In the delta region waterlogging and salinity have reduced productivity of the soil by 35 per cent or more , while in extreme cases of sea intrusion the soil is completely unfit for cultivation in what was once a flourishing Indus delta area . <p> Climate-smart agriculture is not always low-cost as an adaptation strategy but it is one of the most popular interventions all over Asia , where technology is harnessed for optimising agriculture , with tunnelling , precision irrigation , and crop diversification among the commonly favoured . In Pakistan , pilot projects initiated in some areas have worked , while in other areas they have been found to be expensive compared to conventional methods of farming . In most cases , CSA has not been scaled up at any transformational level for several reasons , including lack of financing but also because fit-for-purpose changes have not been incentivized in an environment of weather and water-timing uncertainty . Policy coherence to assist smallholder farmers across line departments is absent , while consistent executive will to drive innovation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incentivize conventional farming with flood irrigation , high extraction of ground water and over-use of pesticides as the norm . <p> Local innovation or knowledge-creation is limited . Research extension services in agricultural curricula are anaemic and hidebound by tradition instead of innovation . Policymakers are driven to sub-optimal solutions even to make technical recommendations , which ultimately boil down to consultants who parachute in and out with their favourite biases intact . Reports and policies are made in order to tick the right boxes where needed and quietly shelved when difficult decisions that challenge the status quo are needed . Public purchasing of agri-commodities , state intervention in support pricing , agriculture taxation , water distribution and waste , land usage that exploits natural capital instead of conserving it are all part of the policy mix . <p> Despite a growing and clear need for adaptation practices in many countries , fiscal space is shrinking globally for financing reform . Empowering vulnerable groups , especially small farmers under stress , is crucial to building resilience in any climate-stressed ecosystem , where the country 's natural capital is subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber theft . <p> Pakistan has made some gains in recent plans for replenishing mangrove and mountain forest cover , but the scale of investments needed for recharging just the Indus basin that sustains 90 per cent of agri-based livelihoods range from $11-19 billion . Local inclusion and empowerment of communities from a bottom-up effort is perhaps the only way forward in the near term , with displaced farming families from 2022 megaflood being given new land titles to woman owners in Sindh . This builds in local incentives to not over-extract ground water , till the land with better crop rotation and look to the long-term health of the soil . <p> The mountain to delta plan for adaptation ( NAP 2023 , GOP ) prioritizes agriculture because growing food , managing rangelands , livestock livelihoods is fundamental to Pakistan 's current economic structure .

Among the recommendations made in the report , strengthening the shock-responsive capacity of existing social protection programmes like the BISP is key . It also calls for building the capacity of the national and provincial disaster management authorities , because in the last climate disaster in 2022 Pakistan had over 10 million people exposed to acute food insecurity . It also pointed to high amounts of external indebtedness as part of the problem , especially related to food imports . The crisis is cross-sectoral , as the NAP says . That is the only way to address it , not in policy and departmental silos . <p> The writer is the former federal minister for climate change and environmental coordination .

Almost as a parting shot , on Friday , a three-member bench headed by CJ Bandial restored corruption cases against public office holders in a majority 2-1 verdict , approving PTI Chairman Imran Khan 's petition challenging amendments made to the NAB ordinance by the PDM government last year . This verdict was not a surprise for many in the legal fraternity who had ' expected ' Justice Bandial to strike down some amendments to the NAB laws before he retired . This verdict , too , will be remembered as part of the outgoing chief justice 's tenure that saw a heavy judicialization of politics .

At one of his earlier farewell dinners hosted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CJP Bandial had taken exception to the opinion that he was leaving behind a divided superior judiciary and said that the only difference that exists among the judges is whether constitutional cases can be heard directly in the apex court or not and that there was " no contradiction " among them on constitutional principles . <p> But to many these words may ring hollow . For the past year at least constitutional and legal experts have pointed out that Pakistan 's top court under CJ Bandial was not just divided but that the rather public and vocal airing of differences between the apex court judges has left a bitter judicial legacy . However -- and this is important -- all this has not happened in a vacuum ; the past decade has been more or less the same , with most former chief justices having left similar ' political ' and controversial legacies .

Going by the study , it would seem that when it came to favouring some judges over others , the perception may not be entirely wrong . <p> The incumbent chief justice 's legacy -- ' tarnished ' according to some -- may be remembered for a bitterly polarized judiciary where judges wrote scathing notes , how the top court was dragged into political disputes , and how its judgements -- sometimes contradictory -- led to a perception that one political party was being ' facilitated ' .

While it is vital to investigate any such claims , it is equally essential to acknowledge Pakistan 's longstanding policy of strict neutrality in international conflicts.Pakistan 's Foreign Office has vehemently rejected these allegations , emphasising that the IMF bailout negotiations were focused on implementing critical economic reforms . The attempt to portray these negotiations as part of an arms deal is , in their words , " baseless and fabricated . " Pakistan 's defence exports consistently adhere to stringent end-user requirements , further highlighting the nation 's commitment to neutrality.The Intercept 's report has cited internal documents from both Pakistani and American governments , as well as sources with knowledge of the arrangement .

In the past , reports have suggested Pakistan 's involvement in supplying arms to Ukraine through third parties . On every occasion , both Pakistan and Ukraine have categorically denied such agreements . Ukraine 's foreign minister reaffirmed this during his visit to Pakistan , emphasising that no arms deal existed between the two nations . Former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also echoed this sentiment , asserting that Pakistan had not signed any military supply agreements with Ukraine since the conflict began.Furthermore , the allegations overlook the numerous challenges Pakistan faced in securing the IMF bailout . The country 's foreign reserves were rapidly depleting , and its economy was in a precarious state . To obtain the bailout , Pakistan had to implement stringent fiscal measures , navigate through stalled negotiations , and demonstrate its commitment to economic reform . It is a disservice to reduce these multifaceted efforts to a simplistic arms deal.Maintaining neutrality in international conflicts is not only a matter of policy but also a reflection of Pakistan 's commitment to peace and stability .

The polls regarding Lok Sabha would initiate sooner than that of Rajya Sabha . These elections are of massive importance and would not only have domestic spillover effects but also regional . Modi 's BJP party is contesting against an alliance of opposition parties . While BJP is trying hard to secure the crown for the third consecutive time , opposition parties are trying equally hard to prevent it . For this purpose , opposition parties have set aside their differences and an alliance of over 28 political parties is forged . This grand alliance is named The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance ( INDIA ) . As symbolic as the name is , INDIA has set for itself a lofty goal because the indicators of surveys are weighing towards the likelihood of BJP-led alliance bloc named National Democratic Alliance 's ( NDA ) success . India Today CVOTER ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabha elections NDA is poised to win 300 plus seats while the opposition alliance , INDIA might reach a moderate sum of around 200 seats . This survey complemented another survey in which the 54 percent respondents believed that BJP would assume the office for the third time while 33 percent inclined towards the success of INDIA . With such gloomy prospects one needs to uncover the leverages that Modi is going to utilize for his re-election campaign . <p> Since assuming office in 2014 , BJP had used ideological tools coupled with securitization of non-political issues to maintain relevance in the public . BJP had controlled the narratives and dominated the political and national discourse to the extent that opposition parties have struggled to hold ground since then . With the exception of selling ultra-nationalist propaganda and polarizing the society on extreme RSS-centric ideological grounds , the Modi government had little to convince the public to vote for them for the second term . And in came certain ' terrorist attacks ' that shifted the attention towards age-old national security matters , just in time . Pathankot Incident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then finally the Pulwama attack in 2019 occupied much attention towards the end of the first term . Modi 's adventurism in the form of Balakot ' surgical strike ' further strained the India-Pakistan relations . Pakistan responded to the surgical strike , and two Indian Fighter jets ( MiG-21 ) were shot down . Indian pilot Abhinandan was captured . This tit-for-tat response was totally unexpected by the Indian side that wanted Pakistan to absorb the blow of the strike without any retaliation . Modi dexterously used the events in his favour and three months later , Modi was re-elected as the Prime Minister for the second time with a BJP dominated Lok Sabha . <p> While Pakistan kept on distancing itself from the Pathankot , Uri and Pulwama attacks , India used this issue to malign Pakistan internationally and Modi gained popularity domestically . Consolidating his power centrally and trickling down his idea of erection of ethnic-state frenzy state by state , Modi passed two controversial laws ; Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 and Abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir via article 370 . Satya Pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IIOJK ) in an interview has said that the government of PM Modi had hid the facts of Pulwama attack , and used the incident to malign Pakistan . <p> Narendra Modi has terrorized Muslims of India .

While there is a lot of hope that we are near complete eradication of poliovirus , it is important to understand the risks that are involved . Polio eradication was a long and hard drive for Pakistan , where sometimes superstition and misperception around the polio drops and at other times , attacks on polio teams surfaced as major hurdles .

The annual target faces risks from low imports and a stronger rupee , which could dent its customs revenues by Rs250 billion for the entire fiscal year , including Rs180 billion in the remainder period . <p> The IMF was informed that the FBR would hardly achieve its Rs9.415 trillion targets if imports continue to remain in the negative territory . <p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average exchange rate in these four months remained at Rs291 to a dollar compared to an average rate of Rs299 during the first three months of the fiscal year , indicating a strengthening of the rupee . <p> However , over the past ten days , the rupee has been on a continuous downward sliding path , as expected due to Pak-IMF talks . <p> The shortfall in customs revenues will also have implications for sales tax and withholding tax collection at the import stage , and as a result , the FBR 's import taxes could take a hit of Rs560 billion , said the sources . The IMF was informed that this gap of Rs560 billion would be covered by better performance in the collection of taxes at the domestic stage . <p> During the first four months of this fiscal year , the FBR collected Rs2.75 trillion in taxes , exceeding the four-month target by Rs66 billion despite a shortfall of Rs69 billion in custom duties in just four months . <p> The IMF was informed that as against the annual target of Rs1.324 trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rs1.324 trillion custom duty collection target had been set based on an assumption of over $60 billion in imports . <p> The IMF inquired about the robustness of domestic tax collection , to which the authorities replied that they were hopeful to continue the momentum on the back of higher profits by commercial banks , better collection of taxes from the real estate sector , and increased revenues from tobacco and beverages . <p> The sources said that the government will now provide the IMF with a month-wise plan of revenue collection for the November-June 2023-24 period . <p> After making an assessment , the IMF will inform Pakistan by the end of next week whether it needs to bring in a mini-budget to cover the gap or not . <p> A day earlier , the interim finance minister mentioned in a meeting that the Rs9.415 trillion annual tax collection target was low for the FBR for this fiscal year , representing a 31% increase over the previous fiscal year 's actual collection . <p> The finance minister urged the FBR to aim for a tax collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84% growth over this year 's projected collection of Rs9.415 trillion . <p> Income tax returns plan <p> The FBR also briefed the IMF about progress in filing annual income tax returns and the plan to increase it further .

He said that Pakistan was facing political and economic crises . <p> The PML-N leader said political parties should sit down together and do " electoral adjustments " ahead of polls where possible .

Siddiqui called on all stakeholders to have the third tier of government intact as a condition for holding general elections . <p> Siddiqui further said that the roles , resources and departments under the control of the third tier of government should be constitutionally enshrined .

@@103990238 <p> Israel 's reprisals against Palestinian civilians after the Hamas attacks of October 7 , 2023 have killed thousands of children . Out of the 2.2 million Gazans , some 1.7 million have been displaced . More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed -- many in schools and hospitals . More than 100 United Nations ( UN ) aid workers have died -- more than in any conflict in the UN 's history . As of this writing , an unprecedented 51 journalists have been killed . This targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure is jarring . It calls for a sober accounting under the principles of International Humanitarian Law ( IHL ) . <p> However , humanitarian law aspects should not obfuscate Israel 's other ongoing crimes against the Palestinian people . A truer description of Israel 's conduct under international law is " genocide " . Genocide is the intentional extermination of a protected group , such as a nation or race , in whole or in part , through killing , transferring , fragmenting and other persecution . <p> While genocide was recognised as a crime in the Genocide Convention of 1948 , the prohibition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice 's ( ICJ ) judgment on Reservations to the Genocide Convention in 1951 , been peremptory norms of international law .

It has incrementally constructed a misinterpretation of the right of ' self-defence ' to commit a Palestinian genocide unheeded . The consequences for Palestinians have been unfathomable loss and cruelty . <p> Meanwhile , the implications of today 's precedents for the future of global security -- particularly the laws of armed conflict , genocide and crimes against humanity -- are catastrophic . <p> To show this , we assess both the authorisations and limits of the right to self-defence claimed by Israel , and the structural and historical aspects of Israeli occupation and related crimes suffered by the Palestinians . <p> Do Israel 's indiscriminate and brutal actions in Gaza meet the conditions for it to be charged with genocide under international law ? And what would be the possible avenues for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Management Sciences offer a collective and considered opinion ... <p> INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND THE CURRENT OPERATION <p> The only legitimate authorisation for unilateral force and the only trigger for the declaration of armed hostilities in an inter-state system is encoded in the UN Charter under Article 51 . This article declares an " inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack has taken place " against a member state , until such a time that " the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . " <p> Regarding Palestinian armed resistance , the ICJ has already clarified in the ' Israeli Wall ' case that Israel does not have an IHL " right to self-defence " against the Palestinian people , because it controls Palestinians and their land as an occupying force . <p> Even assuming argeuendo -- for the sake of argument -- that Israel had such a right , the drafters of the Charter sought to limit unilateral recourse to force ; they anticipated a multilateral response where such hostilities had been initiated .

" <p> It is also against the principles of collective security to extend a unilateral right to self-defence indefinitely . <p> Yet , both Israel and the US seem to adhere to a concept of self-defence that extends in perpetuity , exemplified by the enduring US ' war against global terrorism . ' Today , the reluctance of both Israel and the US to consent to a ceasefire , as opposed to a " humanitarian pause " , bears legal significance , as a ceasefire presents more compelling evidence of the cessation of hostilities , implying the conclusion of a self-defence response to an armed attack . Failure to adhere to a ceasefire could potentially categorise any subsequent use of force as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking how long Israel 's right to self-defence lasts begs the question . Circumventing the question of whether Israel has a right of self-defence against Palestinians to instead debate whether the " self-defence " is ongoing or proper is a sleight of hand . <p> This narrative redirects commentary away from one body of the law of armed conflict , that of the jus ad bellum -- the legal rules that determine when a nation can act in self-defence -- to jus in bello , or the rules defining what a belligerent can and can not do in self-defence . Even if we partook of this ruse , Israel 's military actions would still be illegal , because of its brutal military conduct . <p> Regarding Palestinian armed resistance , the ICJ has already clarified in the ' Israeli Wall ' case that Israel does not have an International Humanitarian Law " right to self-defence " against the Palestinian people , because it controls Palestinians and their land as an occupying force . <p> In its 2004 advisory opinion on the consequences of the Israeli Wall on Palestinian land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that all international human rights treaties ratified by Israel , including the International Covenants of Civil and Political Rights and Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , applied to Israel 's conduct there ; and that even if and when humanitarian law applied , it did not completely displace Israel 's human rights obligations to the Palestinians . This opinion and the conditions it cites undermine both Israel 's invocation of self-defence and its military conduct . <p> Self-defence is thus a disingenuous labelling of Israel 's actions . <p> Its employment to dissimulate and minimise the political cost of the butchery we see is not novel . It adds to a wave of neologisms that have shaken the foundations of international , and sometimes domestic , law in the 21st century : the " rules-based world order " , " the responsibility to protect " , " preemptive self-defence " , " unlawful enemy combatants " , and " enhanced interrogation techniques " are all sui generis characterisations to avoid applicable and binding precedents . <p> In almost all cases where we see this language , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole grounds for prosecuting warfare . <p> Under IHL , parties to an armed conflict must always distinguish between the civilian population and combatants , as well as between civilian objects and military objectives . They are obligated to direct their operations solely against military objectives and must take precautions in the method of attacks with a view to avoiding or minimising incidental loss of civilian life , injury to civilians , and damage to civilian objects . <p> Civilians can not be made the object of attack . All IHL instruments , including the 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1949 Geneva Conventions , prohibit the deliberate targeting of medical units , vehicles and other transport , as well as places of worship and schools . <p> Article 52 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , now considered customary law , states that , " In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes , such as a place of worship , a house or other dwelling , or a school , is being used to make an effective contribution to military action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We are told that , since Hamas does not distinguish between civilians and combatants , and does not follow the laws of war , Palestinians can not expect this from Israel . This is another dissemblance . <p> The Palestinian population , corralled into Gaza and living under an occupation , has neither the physical space to distance itself from belligerents , nor the means to acquire weapons or training that would allow belligerents to meet the standards that Israel sets . <p> A mechanical application of humanitarian laws that presuppose a sovereign state belligerent , or at the very least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an occupied or debilitated adversary fall short . Increasingly , the nature of modern warfare is asymmetrical : enormously powerful states are prosecuting wars on the penurious or the dispossessed . <p> Under the sham tit-for-tat logic of the overwhelmingly strong against the abjectly weak , the International Humanitarian Law protections accorded to civilians in periods of armed conflict have been stripped away . For example , in these last few weeks , we have read arguments about human shields in Palestine , tunnels near hospitals , and irregular combatants . The purpose of this narrative is to exploit the boxed-up position of Gaza : a position that Israel has created . <p> It is physically impossible for combatants to distance themselves from civilians in an overcrowded strip of land , or to acquire weapons or tactical training that could allow for a conventional armed resistance to occupation . Any belligerent in Gaza is , per force , close to civilians , because there is no room for him to go elsewhere . Ignoring such asymmetries , Israel and its choir reason that there are no Gazan civilians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target , in complete violation of the fundamental principle of distinction under IHL , and this is what the world observes today . <p> For Israel , this line of defence is not novel and it has used it to deflect responsibility for acts of vengeance in Lebanon , including the Qana massacres in 1996 , and the brutal killing of up to 3,500 refugees in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982 . <p> From 2006 , and in the multiple operations that Israel has conducted in occupied Palestinian territories , the Israelis have conflated the location of Hamas fighters within the densely populated strip with the intention to use the civilian populace as human shields . <p> While the UN-mandated Goldstone Report on Operation Cast Lead of 2014 found no indication of such intentionality , Israel 's defenders ' response was to argue that the condition of asymmetric warfare provides an inoperable terrain for upholding IHL protections : from powerful states battling adversaries employing urban guerilla tactics , calls are made for relaxing the measures of distinction and proportionality . <p> However , for civilian populations facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no imaginable reason for such relaxation . Deviation from such norms proceeds not on account of insufficient means to engage in more targeted strikes , but is mostly a consequence of failing to define permissible and achievable military ends . High civilian casualties or collateral damage are the acceptable trade-off , by this logic , for keeping the citizen-soldiers of these powerful states out of harm 's way . <p> Today we stand at a crossroads , where international human rights law , humanitarian law and the law of war -- jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- are being stretched and twisted to breaking point , to enable the killing of Palestinians with minimum fuss . <p> Civic fissures and unrest around the world , and moves to intimidate or suppress academic freedom , the freedom of speech , and the freedom of association in advanced democracies , provide ample indications that this dissimulation of the unlawful into the normative is failing . <p> We do not follow this lead .

The current trajectory of Israel 's actions indicates that the intent requirement for bringing about the physical destruction , wholly or partially , of a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group , as defined in the Genocide Convention , is being met . <p> In this instance , the Palestinian population collectively meets the definitions of these distinct groups under the Convention . <p> The prohibition against genocide is a peremptory norm or jus cogens in international law : there are no exceptions to or excuses for it , and it supersedes any other international law that is not likewise peremptory . <p> Under the ' Barcelona Traction ' case , the prohibition and punishment of genocide is also erga omnes , or an obligation to the comity of nations as a whole , and not to a particular nation or state that has been targeted . As a peremptory norm that is erga omnes , the prohibition against genocide allows any state to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute genocidal actors . <p> This is so even if those genocidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a state party to the Genocide Convention , the Rome Statute , or any other relevant treaty .

It has an intent requirement under both instruments : the " intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial , or religious group . " <p> The intent to target a portion of a group rather than the whole group suffices to establish this element . This has been clarified by the Yugoslav tribunal in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the 1982 UNGA resolution 37/123 D and findings of the UN Human Rights Commission , which highlighted Israel 's mass murder of refugees in Sabra and Shatila , Lebanon , as genocide . <p> In addition to intent , genocide also has an act requirement , which can be met with any of five actions against a recognised group or its members : killing ; causing serious bodily or mental harm ; inflicting conditions calculated to destroy in whole or part ; imposing measures to prevent births ; and forcibly transferring children to another group . <p> Under Article III of the Genocide Convention and Article 25 of the Rome statute , individuals can also be criminally charged for inciting , attempting , conspiring , or being complicit in genocide . In addition , the Rome Statute provides the ICC jurisdiction over three other crimes : crimes against humanity , war crimes , and the crime of aggression . <p> Crimes against humanity , defined in Article 7 , overlap with genocide because they include " extermination " ( 7(b) ) ; " deportation or forcible transfer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... recognised as impermissible under international law " ( 7(h) ) ; and " the crime of apartheid " ( 7(j) ) . Indeed , genocide is recognised as a specific category within the broader context of crimes against humanity . <p> The Genocide Convention triggers both criminal liability for genocidal acts and civil responsibility for failing to protect targeted groups . Genocide can be charged to both individual groups and states . While , as mentioned earlier , genocide can occur in peacetime and wartime , its elements do not change in international or non-international armed conflict . <p> However , under Article IX of the Convention , the ICJ does not have jurisdiction to hear a criminal prosecution of genocide -- it is not a criminal court , but a court to hear interstate disputes or interpret international law . The ICJ can , however , determine under Article IX of the Convention whether a state bears responsibility for a genocide because it has violated its duties under the Genocide Convention . <p> These determinations are not criminal prosecutions and are accordingly decided under a " fully conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " standard applied to crimes . Criminal prosecutions under Article VI of the convention are meant to occur in the affected states or specially constituted international tribunals , such as the ICC or the special tribunals of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia . <p> Under Article 29 of the Rome Statute , a charge of genocide is never time-barred and , under Article 33 , " following orders " is not a defence , since an order in furtherance of genocide is manifestly illegal . States can meet the intent requirement for failing to prevent a genocide under a lower standard , even if can not be ascertained that they did not plan a genocide , so long as there is near certainty of genocidal intent by groups that the state has enabled or facilitated . <p> This was the case when Serbia and Montenegro were charged with enabling ethnic cleansing of Muslims by Bosnian Serbs . In this case , the ICJ determined that the massacre at Srebrenica by the army of the Republika Srpska in July 1995 amounted to an act of genocide .

The one common denominator was that the ' delayed election ' news was coming from sources taking refuge behind anonymity . <p> Even then , a country which was once promised party-based elections within 90 days but had to wait 8 years for that exercise to happen on a partyless basis , and a nation that has seen its collective will being undermined by the machinations of one unelected institution or the other on multiple occasions over the years , could not have been blamed for finding such speculation credible if they did . <p> When such speculation -- or rather rumours -- start circulating and acquires a life of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this columnist , are asked by readers , friends and family if what is being speculated by usually well-informed journalists is true . <p> Elections , no matter how far from ideal , serve as a release valve for the have-nots in particular . <p> Frankly , I have no friends in high places or sources among the decision-making echelons of our beloved and , to borrow from Ardeshir Cowasjee , blighted land . All I have to rely on is asking the obvious questions to try and reach some sort of a conclusion myself . <p> So what questions would I ask to see if there is a likelihood of another delay in the already delayed elections ? The first and foremost was addressed rather masterfully by my friend and colleague Khurram Husain this last Thursday in this very column space . <p> He explained at length the pitfalls of a postponement and its undesirable consequences for the economy . At a time when even the establishment has understood the meaning of ' it 's the economy , stupid ' , which was used in the 1992 US presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Ask a student of elementary economics and politics , and they will tell you that economic development , ie , growth will be severely curtailed in times of political uncertainty and upheaval . Given the importance being attached to economic revival , it would be nothing but utterly foolhardy to delay the elections . <p> It would be useful to keep in focus the world beyond the elite bubble in our society , and understand that out of the 240.4 million Pakistanis , just under 40 per cent live below the poverty line . That is 95m people . <p> This staggering number of people , more than a third of the country , struggles to put food on the table and a roof over its head ; it can only dream about a decent education for their children and healthcare for themselves and their family . Can you imagine how you 'd be seething with anger and despair if your reality mirrored theirs , despite working all day long . <p> The impact of this anger , which envelops a third of our country , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , who lead a relatively smug existence , can not imagine . I shudder to think of the turmoil if this sustained deprivation brings the shirtless multitudes onto the streets . <p> Elections , no matter how far from ideal , serve as a release valve for the have-nots in particular as they feel empowered , even if only for a day , and think they are being heard and sought after . For those who have very little , to feel wanted must be a special feeling . <p> Even a somewhat flawed electoral exercise brings to the fore elected leaders who have more credibility than the establishment 's capital-hopping , jet-setting ' middle class ' poster boy . This credibility is significant both in enabling the office-holder to steer the ship at home and in strengthening their hands in negotiating externally . <p> Frankly , the only reason why some journalists have cited , in support of their insistence that a postponement of the election is on the cards , is what is perceived to be the popularity of PTI leader Imran Khan . This despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the PTI 's second- and third-tier leaders and those likely to run on the party 's ticket in the election . <p> But very few of these leading pundits address one small point . By postponing the election for six months or even a year , in the unlikely event that the apex court approves such a move , what change in the country 's objective conditions would occur that facilitates elections ? <p> If the election is at all postponed , it will create more political uncertainty , which would be a killer for the economy . The state of the economy will also dictate the political and social climate . If hardship increases , can we rule out upheaval ? Probably not . <p> Simultaneous with these factors is the return of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif . His return , facilitated as it is seen to be by the establishment , does n't seem to have happened for him to be kept waiting for an indefinite period . For now , he is an ally , but if the promised reset to 2016 does n't happen soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPP has already started its campaign . Its footprint may be receding but it remains a strong voice that ca n't be shrugged aside . Even if over the short term some political parties think a postponement may be beneficial for them , it would be short-sighted to back it . Their credibility and , therefore , their chances will likely nosedive and not improve . <p> Admittedly , we are talking of Pakistan , a land of glorious uncertainties . Luck is said to favour the brave but I could end up with egg on my face . C'est la vie .

@@104018232 <p> The headline inflation inched up again . It stood at 29.2 percent in November 2023 and the monthly increase stood at 2.7 percent -- highest since July 23 .

Other than gas , overall inflation is moving on a downward trajectory -- though food inflation is up by 1 percent ( MoM ) mainly due to the increase in perishable items . <p> The massive increase in gas prices ( mainly due to limitation of the methodology ) has revised up the inflation estimates by two percentage points for the next twelve months , and the full year inflation in FY24 is now expected at 25 percent , and the 5MFY24 stood at 28.6 percent . <p> This higher inflation number is forcing analysts to revise their expectations of rate cuts , as majority now expect SBP to maintain the status quo in the upcoming monetary policy , and it would be a wise decision , as keeping12M forward-looking real rates positive is imperative for stability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now urban inflation is higher than the rural .

Other than gas , electricity charges are down by 10.7 percent monthly , which is due to removal of PHL charges which may reappear again next month to post a higher increase . <p> The other notable hike is in clothing and footwear where the increase is 2.3 percent MoM and 21 percent YoY . In this segment , consistent rural inflation is beating the urban counterpart .

The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels . Realized crude oil prices witnessed a drop of around 20 percent , whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent in FY20 . In addition , production numbers were down as COVID-19 left many fields in partial shutdown mode . Oil and gas production thus witnessed a decline of around 12 percent each in FY20 , while LPG production fell by approximately 11 percent .

The emerging reports depict an increasing support for Narendra Modi 's right wing Hindu nationalist party , which draws much of its votes from its implementation of Hindutva ideology , capitalizing on extremist sentiments of Hindu populace of the state . What many reports tend to overlook however , is the persistence of the North-South divide deeply embedded within India 's internal geopolitical dynamics , reflected even in the sample as small as the current state elections . <p> The North South split essentially stems from the ineffectiveness of Modi 's Hindutva spell in the southern states of India relative to their counterparts in the north .

The continuous string of electoral setbacks for the BJP in this area has prompted Modi and his Hindutva proponents to devise an alternative strategy for the region . The party 's current scheme involves the strategic alteration of seat distribution in assembly between the north and south in a manner that favors the BJP 's political agenda.The Delimitation Act , under which the northern states are set to gain more seats and the south is bound to lose in contrast , is one such effort in pursuit of this agenda .

Though leaders in the south have consistently voiced their concerns over BJP 's attempts at political engineering aimed at creating circumstances conductive to Modi 's win in the south , the shape that India 's political landscape would eventually take still relies on public support for Modi 's agenda . The current indicators , with rising support for Modi in the mainland areas do not depict a favorable scenario for the progressive south . The divergence in public opinion in the north and the south pertaining to BJP 's Hindutva ideology seems far from converging in any area , solidifying the prospects of a widening North-South split .

It allowed the police to ride roughshod over the demonstrators who came to the federal capital to agitate against the enforced disappearance and killing of their kith and kin . <p> The police action ordered by the government or , perhaps more accurately , its powerful backers , underlined the irony for those who , though termed separatists , still seemed to display faith in the federation and came to the capital , the seat of the federal government , to press for their political rights and freedoms . <p> How else would you interpret the motives of the marchers , dozens of women among them , other than as an expression of faith in the federation , despite their broken hearts at having seen the tormented bodies of their loved ones ? Or worse -- having no clue about their disappeared family and friends ? <p> I know my words will add up to nought but I still feel duty-bound to say that the guardians of our security need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful than us have dealt with the ' separatist ' challenge . <p> It is n't within the scope of this piece to delve into the details of such accords but those dealing with the security challenges posed by the Baloch ' separatists ' need only look into peace agreements concluded between the ETA and Spain on the one hand and the UK and IRA on the other . <p> It takes a visionary leadership to reach out to groups responsible for inflicting pain on the state . <p> Both groups waged bloody campaigns over decades before sitting down for negotiations and agreeing to abandon violence as a means of achieving their goals . They were convinced through dialogue that armed resistance had only brought blood , gore and misery , and the cause of their political and economic rights had not been furthered . <p> Needless to say , it takes a visionary leadership to reach out to groups responsible for inflicting pain on the state . Even with both sides having drawn blood over and over again , it is n't always possible to see that continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver nothing in the end to either side . <p> Tragically , as we speak , the state and the separatists are both pursuing a single-dimensional strategy that has only brought pain and anguish to both . Surely , at some point they will have to sit down to negotiate , because endless violence and pain ca n't be a long-term goal . <p> The caretaker cabinet committee set up to address Baloch grievances will be able to deliver nothing because it could not even protect the protesters from police brutality , including beatings , and water cannons deployed in freezing temperatures . <p> The members may be well-meaning but that 's about it . It is clear that this cabinet and its ' middle-class ' boy wonders have no leeway beyond being their master 's voice .

@@104551236 <p> Romantics thrive on disappointments . Disappointments inspire them to weave laments through which they can exhibit their idealistic/romantic dispositions . They need to ' feel ' to be able to do this . If an occasion is n't able to get Romantics to emote , they are likely to ignore it . <p> The Irish poet Oscar Wilde wrote , " A dreamer is one who can only find his way in moonlight , and his punishment is that he sees dawn before the rest of the world . " Yes , the much awaited dawn was a disappointment . This is a classic Romanticist dilemma , but one that is created by the Romantic himself to lament about or poetise . <p> The Romantic disposition often enriches the talents of an artist , poet , novelist or musician . But in politics , Romanticism can spell disaster . It can also make one sound entirely naive , if not downright silly . According to the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , " No artist tolerates reality . " This was coming from the horse 's mouth , because Nietzsche was quintessentially a Romantic . <p> In 1986 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce everything to " aesthetic contemplation . " The purpose of this is to trigger " elevating experiences . " For example , they poeticise conflicts . According to Oakes , they do this not to resolve conflicts . Instead , they see it as an occasion " for the evocation of an emotionally satisfying mood and an aesthetic opportunity . " <p> While politics is a pragmatic , amoral and Machiavellian ' science ' , political romantics tend to poeticise politics and use it as an occasion to exercise emotions <p> Oakes was echoing the thoughts of the controversial German political theorist Carl Schmitt . In his 1919 book Political Romanticism , Schmitt wrote that political romantics poeticise politics and therefore , to them , political issues become nothing more than an occasion to exercise emotions . <p> All this is done to evoke a mood and a feeling . But outside these lie what politics really is : a pragmatic , amoral and Machiavellian ' science ' . This ' science ' does not interest the Romantic , unless they poeticise it and give it an aesthetic/emotional meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed for or lamented . All talk in this respect by the political romantic is basically for their own emotional satisfaction . <p> Whereas Schmitt categorically declared that politics and Romanticism were not compatible , the philosopher Isaiah Berlin applauded the political influence of the Romantics . In the book Roots of Romanticism , Berlin praised the Romantics for ending the hegemony of the Rationalists . He was enthused by the manner in which the Romantics embraced irrationalism . <p> However , the reasons furnished by Berlin behind the ascendency of Romantic ideas were not very complimentary . In fact , they were rather condescending . According to Berlin , Romanticism first emerged as a movement in 18th century Germany because the Germans were a " large collection of socially crushed and politically miserable human beings . " He wrote that the Germans failed to match the social , political and philosophical achievements of the French , and so they undermined their importance . According to Berlin , Romanticism was thus , a " grand form of sour grapes . " <p> Romanticism was a rebellion against Rationalism and Modernism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement , it peaked in Europe in the 19th century . It glorified emotion , intuition , ' mysticism ' , nature , and pre-modern pasts , which it imagined were pristine . It clashed with the Rationalist philosophies and with Modernity . However , on the one hand , the results of this clash were revolutionary ; on the other hand , they produced a new form of conservatism . <p> Therefore , whereas the 18th century French Revolution , which sought to destroy the monarchy , nobility and the clergy , was inspired by Romantic ideas , these ideas , ironically , also inspired the glorification of nationalism , traditionalism , the state and a past that was supposedly ' better ' and more ' organic ' . <p> The Romantic impulse of the French Revolution was about seeking a utopia ( to break away from a corrupt present ) , while the same impulse left another batch of Romantics craving for the mitigation of revolutionary chaos through a return to established traditions , spirituality and authoritarianism . <p> On the one hand , this contradictory nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of ' scientific socialism ' , Karl Marx , detested . On the other hand , the same Romanticism greatly influenced fascism in Italy and in Spain , and Nazism in Germany . <p> The last three were extreme forms of nationalism , in which the state was to be worshipped , a messianic leader was to be revered , and modernity attacked through glorified imaginings of a ' pristine ' past . Conventional religion too was to be replaced by a ' political religion ' , or a sacralised ideology with its own rituals . <p> Therefore , many forms of nationalism too are Romantic -- especially those based on staunch racial , ethnic or religious ideologies . These may not always generate totalitarian states or revolutionary upheavals , but they do develop polities with Romantic dispositions . The Romantic impact in such nation-states is so strong that even people who fancy themselves as being critical thinkers ca n't escape it , even though they might not be entirely conscious of it . <p> Take Schmitt for example -- an anti-Romantic , but one who ended up supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement . Another , albeit lighter , example in this context includes many ' rational ' commentators in Pakistan 's lawyer and activist communities , who have been exhibiting disappointment towards the current Chief Justice of Pakistan ( CJP ) Qazi Faez Isa . <p> They had romanticised Isa 's battles with the controversial former CJP Umar Ata Bandial . They had turned Isa into a heroic figure that would eliminate the establishment 's role in politics . But since Romanticism is not interested in the large grey areas in which reality operates , Isa 's tenure has continued to be viewed through Romantic lenses , leaving many of his admirers ' disappointed ' . <p> This disappointment is an occasion for his admirers to weave laments , expressing their dismay and more so , exhibit their own ' democratic ' and ' anti-establishment ' credentials . Their positions on most political issues are inherently utopian and their laments dystopian . There are no grey areas in their ' analyses ' , in which reality actually exists . In fact , such areas are detested by them , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in grey areas . <p> Romantics on the religious right in Pakistan relish imagining or even shaping ' saviours ' . But those on the progressive or ' liberal ' sides do so too . They did n't imagine Isa as a judge who fought a long judicial battle with a CJP who wanted to oust him . They saw him as a judge who would ride in on a white horse to vanquish meddlesome generals . <p> The disappointment in this respect is the outcome of a Romantic disposition . The disappointed will never be able to continue portraying themselves as gallant democrats and constitutionalists if they begin to view Justice Isa as a pragmatist or a realist . His performance is thus being ' felt ' by them , not rationally analysed . 
@@104551237 <p> Islamabad is a planned city , the federal capital and markedly less violent than the major metropolis of Karachi . The state , in various forms , is much more present than is the case in other Pakistani cities . State services in general are above average , electricity supply is more regular and residents have more personal connections to the state . <p> By studying Islamabad , one sees Pakistani state institutions at their highest level of effectiveness . If claim-making based on formal rights is going to work anywhere in Pakistan , it will be in Islamabad . <p> The primary site for my ethnography was at multiple subdivision offices of the Islamabad Electric Supply Company ( IESCO ) , where I followed the employees through all aspects of their work , and observed their interactions with citizens who came to the office . <p> The subdivision is the lowest level of the IESCO organisational hierarchy and fulfils most of the public-facing requirements concerning electricity supply , including new connections , billing , maintenance and disconnections . In addition to working with the IESCO employees , I interviewed and spent time among the residents of Islamabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ katchi abadis , such as 44 Quarter in Islamabad . <p> Islamabad has 34 katchi abadis , 11 of which are notified for regularisation per the Punjab Katchi Abadi Act 1992 . Regularisation leads to a formal lease of the land and access to all state services for the occupants of the katchi abadi , but it is not without some drawbacks . <p> For the Capital Development Authority ( CDA , the public agency that provides municipal services in Islamabad ) to regularise the 44 Quarter katchi abadi , where I did most of the fieldwork presented here , regularisation would involve planning the housing of the katchi abadi so that it would conform to building standards and thus contain fewer housing plots . <p> How do those without power , both literally and metaphorically , navigate the challenges in dealing with those that do ? An ethnographic study of the residents of Islamabad 's katchi abadis attempts to deal with the city 's electricity distribution infrastructure offers an enlightening view . Eos presents excerpts from Access to Power : Electricity and the Infrastructural State in Pakistan by Ijlal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be accommodated and where the surplus households would be relocated are points of contention that have stalled the regularisation process , since the proposed relocation site is much further from Islamabad . However , so long as 44 Quarter is not regularised , the residents are denied a document called a No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) , which is issued by the CDA to certify that the applicant for the electricity connection is the legal owner of the land . <p> Without an NOC , the residents of 44 Quarter can not get legal electricity connections . <p> MOBILISING COLLECTIVE CLAIMS <p> One of my key informants in 44 Quarter is Liaqat who , like almost all the residents of 44 Quarter , is Christian . Liaqat is approximately 35-40 years old , quite short and slightly built . The streets of 44 Quarter are uneven , sloping and made of packed dirt . A tiny , uncovered drain a few inches wide runs in front of the houses on Liaqat 's street . I can touch both sides of the alley at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which I 've seen a barefoot boy of about five climbing and playing . Children of very young ages are everywhere , usually playing unattended . I am often passed by bicycles and motorcycles on this street when I visit . Men and women are often talking in the street , frequently congregating around doorways , which seem to be open more often than not . <p> Liaqat 's home in 44 Quarter is a three-story brick-and-cement building that has not seen any new paint in some time . Liaqat and his wife and children live on the ground floor of their house , and other members of his extended family live on the upper two stories . The two rooms on the ground floor are a living room and a bedroom . The floor is bare cement . The ceiling is perhaps seven feet high and gives me a distinctly claustrophobic feeling when I stand . <p> There is a small fridge in the bedroom -- that is the only visible appliance . Located in the middle of an affluent residential area , 44 Quarter is well-situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity lines that serve the well-off neighbourhoods run through 44 Quarter . For most of its history , 44 Quarter was served by undocumented connections , known in Urdu as kunda . <p> According to Liaqat , the type of theft occurring in Islamabad 's katchi abadis occurs with the participation of the distribution company employees . Liaqat tells me , " The same money , instead of going to IESCO 's treasury , went to police and IESCO staff . " <p> Liaqat says that the distribution company employees were paid off to leave illegal connections alone , as were the police . Although I found no distribution company employees admitting to their participation in this specific case , many of them accepted such arrangements as being relatively common . Some 11 years prior to the time of my study -- probably in 1998 -- 44 Quarter 's illegal connections were forcibly taken down in an army-backed intervention . <p> The army 's role in power sector management came about at the invitation of the elected prime minister Nawaz Sharif . In an admission of his government 's incompetence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal in a coup the following year , Nawaz Sharif asked the Pakistani army to take over the management of electricity distribution companies in order to reduce theft . IESCO and the other distribution companies had serving army personnel assigned to them , including at senior management levels . The chief executives of the distribution companies were replaced by brigadiers on deputation from their usual military assignments . <p> The residents of 44 Quarter responded to the disconnection of their electricity supply by forming a committee to approach the brigadier in charge of IESCO . The gist of the argument they put to the brigadier was that if they were not allowed kunda connections , they should be allowed legal connections . <p> My informants at 44 Quarter feel no qualms about the kunda connections . Liaqat tells me that , " It 's our right to electricity . If you wo n't give it to us , then we 'll take it like this . " Another informant states that it is " inevitable , in this heat " that people will get electricity connections however they can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decent living , to which they , too , should have access , and their appeal to the brigadier was on largely humane rather than legalistic grounds . The meeting of the 44 Quarter residents ' committee with the IESCO brigadier went well . <p> The compromise reached by the parties was that 44 Quarter would be served by a few documented meters , but that all the wiring and management of the system beyond the meters would be the responsibility of the residents . This decision served IESCO by ensuring that 44 Quarter residents would pay for their electricity consumption and met the needs of 44 Quarter residents by ensuring their electricity supply . <p> These arrangements , however , are distinctly an exception to the rules , which define a consumer as " a person or his successor-in-interest who purchases or receives electrical power for consumption and not for delivery or re-sale to others , including a person who owns or occupies a premise where electrical power is supplied . " <p> The provision of electricity for delivery and resale to others is the job of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but IESCO 's consumer services manual limits service provision to applicants who can provide " ownership proof of the premises " , and it thus can not be provided to individual katchi abadi residents so long as the regularisation process is incomplete . <p> In the absence of NOCs and legal individual connections , the committee representing residents of 44 Quarter accepted the compromise of communal metering . The residents of 44 Quarter would be allowed a single communal connection at commercial rates ( higher than domestic rates ) . <p> The committee managed the process and the money for connecting the several hundred households of 44 Quarter to the communal meter . Shoaib was a member of that committee ( he mentions that the brigadier was a ' very nice person ' ) and tells me that his inclusion was on the grounds that he is considered educated . <p> Shoaib lives in 44 Quarter and is employed by the residents ' committee to manage the billing and maintenance of the electrical system . He says , " The committee met for two-three days prior to the negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I asked to see this later in our conversation , he smiled and said that they made it once upon a time and that no one knew anything about it now ) . " <p> The committee members are the respected elders of the community . Shoaib has , in fact , taken on many of the functions of the distribution company . He manages billing , collects the money , gives receipts , keeps records , and also handles the maintenance of 44 Quarter 's electricity system . Shoaib does many of the same tasks a subivision officer would . He also handles situations where there is difficulty in paying bills . <p> 44 Quarter prints its own bills with instructions on the back for making payments . Paying in instalments is not unusual , and sometimes the committee can reduce the bill somewhat . Strictly commercial arrangements are also not observed for churches and those individuals whom the committee deems needy and worthy of help . Instead , the moral underpinnings of the collective organisation for service delivery are reflected in the departure from commercial logics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assessment of the household 's consumption . I ask how they determine the charges for each household . Shoaib says he knows every house on every street . They are " like a family . " He knows everyone 's name , and his paternal grandfather 's name . We have no formality in going to each other 's houses . Paying for extra facilities ( fridge , a motor for pumping up water ) costs up to extra 300 per month . <p> Shoaib is confident that he knows the ins and outs of every household . His deep local knowledge is essential to keeping the communal system going . The residents of 44 Quarter have mobilised on the basis of collective solidarity and make their claim for service delivery on a moral basis . <p> They do not exercise purely commercial reasoning in determining how much each household must pay . Instead , assessments are based on Shoaib 's intimate knowledge of each household . Shoaib attributes his position to his good character and reputation . <p> Islamabad has 34 katchi abadis , 11 of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> IMAGINING RIGHTS <p> Sharing of a common meter is also present in 75 Quarter and 50 Quarter ( two other katchi abadis in Islamabad where I interviewed residents ) , but their committees have been less scrupulous than Shoaib . Collection for the municipal electricity bill is handled by a leadership committee , comprised of katchi abadi residents . Neither in 75 Quarter nor in 50 Quarter was anyone able to explain how the current leaders obtained their position or describe what was entailed in being a " leader " . <p> Their inability to explain the nature of a leadership position suggests a lack of a formalised process for selecting and changing leaders . Rates in 75 Quarter are higher than in 50 Quarter , but 50 Quarter has accumulated arrears worth approximately two months of billing . <p> One resident of 75 Quarter suggested that members of the katchi abadi leadership committee were embezzling some of the money . Another informant chided me for being so naive as to think that the 44 Quarter leaders were not also embezzling the committee funds . <p> Even in 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The communal meter must be put in someone 's name , which creates the opportunity for that person to take advantage of their position . Liaqat told me the following story based on 44 Quarter 's earlier experience with communal metering , which predated the current solution : <p> " A committee of about 20 people got together to choose the person whose name the meter would be put in . That man had not even a cycle to his name . He was a government employee , went to work wearing slippers . Now he has cars . He 's become a big-shot . This is Pakistan . Who has money is king . 44 Quarter residents brought legal suits against him , but we 'd talk and he 'd use his money to get away free . " <p> Liaqat sees how the communal system that now serves them well was once an opportunity for a member of their own community to exploit the residents of 44 Quarter . In his eyes , the legal system offered them no recourse to justice against someone with substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure rights and secure service delivery , the residents of 44 Quarter have engaged with various political actors in a very pragmatic manner . <p> Liaqat tells me , " We 're not with any political party . We work with whoever is in power . " Through their different contacts -- activists , academics , politicians , and also foreign embassies -- the katchi abadi dwellers bring to bear whatever pressure they can on the CDA to complete the regularisation to which they are already committed . <p> Liaqat proudly tells me of how the 44 Quarter residents secured a majority of votes for the candidate they backed at their local polling station . The delivery of votes is an exchange for political representation in a purely transactional sense , with no regard to party platforms . <p> The residents of the katchi abadis used the language of rights more than anyone else I spoke with in Pakistan . In the blunt terms of Liaqat , " With a meter you get rights . " He adds , " We 've spent hundreds of thousands of rupees on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rights , you benefit if you invest in your house . With a proper road you could get a car in . That would be very valuable . <p> " After plotting , only 300 houses would be possible . Some people would be moved away . The Capital Development Authority initially offered the outskirts of Islamabad , but that is too far away . Each household has three to four earners to sustain it . Their jobs are in Islamabad , the commutes would cost too much . <p> " The Capital Development Authority board has the plan for approval . It 's almost done . After plotting regularisation , everyone will get No Objection Certificates . Each plot will have value . No problems with authorities in getting gas and electricity connections on our own . " <p> Liaqat is acutely conscious of the material benefits that can accrue from formal land titles . He hopes that the shady dealings with state officials will cease . His approach is entirely consistent with neoliberal arguments for the importance of property rights , which draw on Peruvian economist Hernando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power and domination , it is a middle-class aspiration . <p> In some instances , katchi abadi leaders exploit institutional failures to extract rents of their own , adding one more obstacle to service delivery for the squatters . Perhaps unsurprisingly , the world of formal rights exemplified by a personal electricity connection takes on the appearance of an escape from these webs of exploitation and patronage . <p> However , a more careful look at the experiences of those with established formal claims on electricity services exposes just how unreal the social imaginary of citizenship with recognised rights is . <p> THE CHALLENGING TRANSITION TO FORMALITY <p> Unfortunately , many of the 44 Quarter residents who have succeeded in getting a toehold in the world of formal rights via an electricity meter in their name , have come to regret it . <p> Although IESCO 's compromise with the residents ' committee to provide electricity to 44 Quarter through communal metering is a functional solution ( every household in 44 Quarter has electricity ) , it is viewed as second-best by the 44 Quarter residents . The communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to regularise their katchi abadi and secure the right to have individual meters for electricity supply . <p> A local NGO has been at the forefront of these efforts , chiefly in engaging with politicians and activists in putting pressure on the CDA to complete the process in a timely manner . 44 Quarter has been surveyed twice by the CDA . Households identified in the survey are noted by the CDA as residences with rights to municipal services . <p> Liaqat tells me that , for meters approved after the second survey , the demand notices ( the distribution company 's equipment orders for the connection of new premises ) were issued five years later , and that it was 18 more months until the meters were finally installed . <p> The money for these demand notices was given by a member of the National Assembly out of their official budget for development projects . Liaqat 's explanation for the delay is that the distribution company employees resisted because it would reduce their monthly earnings from the communal meters . Nonetheless , Liaqat and the 44 Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time of our meetings . <p> When some individual meters were installed in 2009 , 44 Quarter residents were told by an IESCO officer that they would regret it and that they would want the old shared meters back . That prediction was borne out in 44 Quarter in many cases . <p> An individual meter can be a mixed blessing , as it requires a greater degree of direct dealing with the distribution company . The buffer from a communal meter is gone , and so are the protections that come with it . The experience of having an individual meter for a house is described to me by Adam , a young man of about 21 who is working in a community- based organisation in 44 Quarter . Adam 's family had received an unreasonably large bill exceeding 10,000 rupees : <p> Katchi abadis in Islamabad , similar to the one in F-7 pictured above , sometimes also have leaders that exploit institutional failures to extract rents of their own <p> Ijlal Naqvi ( IN ) : What happened in the IESCO office ? <p> Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another one . The next one sent me to another one . He told me that there was no meter assigned to our house . I said then how are we getting a bill ? He told us that they 'll check it out . That they 'll come and see if the meter is working properly . They said there 's a leak in our house , that the electricity is being wasted . <p> Liaqat : How can you have a leak with electricity ? This is n't a gas pipe . <p> Adam : They are taking the money from us in instalments . And the next bill came to 7,000 . So we switched back to the shared meter , which is 1,200 per month . And now our bill from the meter -- which we are n't using -- is 75 rupees . We are n't the only ones . Our neighbours have complained about high bills too . <p> IN : There must be a form you have to fill in to complain about your meter . <p> Adam : I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any form . We are n't educated enough that we can deal with IESCO . <p> Adam and his family were poorly equipped to handle the challenge of dealing with the state on its terms . Although Adam describes himself as insufficiently educated to deal with IESCO , he tells me that he passed his Matriculation ( 10th grade ) and , in conversation with me , is reasonably confident and able to express himself . <p> Nonetheless , the opacity of the process at the distribution company office and the behaviour of the distribution company staff are enough to deter him . Adam tells me that his family is resigned to paying this bill that they can not afford and did not incur . Their retreat to the communal system is a retreat to a system where they will be protected from state officials ' efforts at predation by Shoaib and the other committee members . <p> A related experience to the abandonment of an individual electricity meter comes from some households from Islamabad katchi abadis who were relocated as a result of the regularisation process . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors of Islamabad , including the relatively well-off area of F-10 . These families took possession of the land , but most of them sold their properties and returned to katchi abadis in Islamabad . <p> The choice to sell the land to which they had formal title in order to return to katchi abadis throws a different perspective on the value of formal rights and also the state 's responsibility to continue to provide such regularisation programmes to katchi abadi residents . <p> American anthropologist Matthew Hull reports a related set of circumstances , with villagers on the outskirts of Islamabad being compensated when they are relocated as a result of the city expanding , only for them to anticipate city planners by moving to the next area where expansion will take place in order to seek out further compensation . <p> The decision of the relocated katchi abadi residents to return to informality suggests that the programme for their relocation was poorly conceived . On the other hand , these families were best placed to judge how to manage their resources , and their actions suggest that living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to having formal rights . <p> Nonetheless , in all the fieldwork and other interactions I had concerning electricity in Pakistan , the katchi abadi residents were the only people to invoke regularly a language of rights . <p> What are rights worth in this context ? Formal rights seem to be worth very little . Claim-making on the state through formal channels is an exercise in frustration . Power relations ( sometimes reduced to wealth ) dominate proceedings , making it difficult to claim an entitlement , regardless of the black letter law underlying the claim . <p> The natural right to basic necessities is more compelling in achieving a compromise solution to the impasse between the electrical utility and the squatters , who are prevented from formal access to a service they are ready and willing to pay for . <p> These excerpts are slightly modified from the original and are being published with permission from the author and the publishers Oxford University Press from the book Access to Power : Electricity and the Infrastructural State in Pakistan <p> The author is an Associate Professor of Sociology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Social Sciences of Singapore Management University .

India 's hesitation on giving Pakistan its share of finance , defence stores , and even canal waters added to the acrimony . However , all these issues were eventually settled one way or another <p> One major issue that could not be settled was the dispute over the State of Jammu and Kashmir , which was forcibly occupied by India , in direct contravention of the terms for partition of British India . The state had a Muslim majority ( 78 per cent , with 93pc in the Valley ) , and was contiguous to the territories that were to become Pakistan . India has also violated every resolution of the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) adopted from 1948 to 1957 , which stipulated that the state 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under UN auspices . <p> Neither the wars between India and Pakistan in 1948 , 1965 and 1999 , nor the numerous bilateral peace initiatives , have resolved the matter . Complicating the matters further , four years ago , the Modi government abolished the ' statehood ' , announced Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh as two separate Union territories , and took away the special autonomy of Indian-occupied Kashmir . This was another blatant violation of international law as codified in a series of UNSC resolutions . <p> Earlier this month , the Indian supreme court upheld the Aug 5 , 2019 , actions of the Modi government , but directed it to revert statehood to J&amp;K , and hold elections there by September 2024 . The decision came as a reality check to those Kashmiri leaders who had cooperated with the BJP government in the vain hope that they would retain their autonomy . In the past four years , the Modi government has indulged in demographic engineering by issuing domiciles to millions of non-state persons . It has also engaged in electoral engineering to ensure that whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The current situation does not augur well for regional peace . <p> Clearly , India is seeking to dissolve the dispute by changing the basic parameters of the disputed territory . The main motivation for this comes from the RSS philosophy of making India a Hindu state . The Modi government has further been emboldened by the fact that the US has selected India as a partner of choice and invested in its military and economic prowess . Regrettably , the international community has failed to condemn India for its illegal actions in J&amp;K , ostensibly to protect their economic and commercial interests in the large Indian market . <p> These developments have been resented in Pakistan , where for centuries , the people of Pakistan , especially northern Punjab , and the people of Kashmir have lived together , bound by ties of faith and culture . Pakistan had , therefore , reacted to the Aug 5 action by lowering the level of diplomatic representation and stopping bilateral trade . <p> Where do we go from here ? The issue of J&amp;K is connected to the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been estranged neighbours for the past seven decades . Since 2016 , there have been no formal contacts between the two countries , often described as ' no-contact warfare ' by India against Pakistan . <p> Despite Pakistan 's consistent desire for good-neighbourly ties , India continues to exhibit animosity . It has discouraged even sporting contacts , when it obliged its cricket team not to visit Pakistan for the Asian Cup , whereas the Pakistani team visited India for the World Cup . India has also paralysed Saarc , probably because it thinks this forum might be used by South Asian countries to join hands to counter-balance India . <p> This state of affairs does not augur well for peace in South Asia . Many scholars and former diplomats argue that India can neither isolate Pakistan nor make it irrelevant . It would be in the interest of both countries to shun mutual hostility and embrace a peaceful coexistence . An opening might arise after elections in both countries in 2024 . The two countries could start with small steps to enhance mutual confidence , such as making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people-to-people contact , and restarting bilateral trade . <p> There have been suggestions that the two governments find an equivalent of the four-point formula of 2007 to help resolve this long-standing conflict . Meanwhile , Pakistan should maintain its support for the right of the people of J&amp;K to self-determination . Subject to the final settlement of the dispute , Pakistan should also grant Gilgit-Baltistan the status of a provisional province in response to the desire of GB 's elected assembly . <p> The writer is a former foreign secretary and chairman , Sanober Institute Islamabad .
