@@51232 <h> One Hell Of An Arcade Beat ' Em Up Is Coming To Facebook <p> Console quality games are a hard sell on Facebook . Each day millions of people log into Facebook to tend their virtual farms or play colourful candy puzzle games , while the hardcore shooters or robot-powered action role-playing games attract daily users in the low ten-thousands . What 's it going to take to get traditional gamers playing on Facebook ? <p> How about a 3D arcade beat-em up from the creator of Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto and the lead designer of Diablo and Diablo II ? <p> That 's exactly what developer nWay is bringing to Facebook . The San Francisco based company was founded in 2011 by game industry veterans for the purpose of bringing console-quality multiplayer games to the web a mobile platforms , and they gathered together some real heavy hitters to get the job done . Folks like David Jones , the founder of DMA Designs ( eventually Rockstar North ) , where he created the puzzle platformer Lemmings and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto . And Stieg Hedlund , the lead designer for the first two entries in the Diablo series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their passion . <p> ChronoBlade is an arcade-style brawler with a look and feel that completely betrays Hedlund 's influence , right down to the red hit point and blue power globes located on either side of the screen . Characters that would be right at home in a Diablo game do battle against a wide variety of fantastic foes as they battle to save the universe from the villainous Chronarch Imperium . <p> In a brilliant bit of design , ChronoBlade 's setting is a series of parallel worlds , banding together to fight against a common foe . Such an open game universe gives the nWay unlimited possibilities when it comes to expanding the game -- all of time and space and fantasy is wide open . The adventure begins on a Viking-themed world , but from there it could go anywhere -- steampunk , Lovecraftian horror -- anywhere . <p> The characters you 'll play come from these many-varied worlds as well , so expect a diverse cast . <p> This is Aurok . He 's a Viking barbarian type . Depending on how you spend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with active and passive skills ) he can focus on being resilient or being ... well , an arsehole . One of his abilities -- Mock -- grants him increased damage from every enemy within earshot when he fires it off . Tell me that 's not an arsehole move . <p> The big-handed Lophi is more my speed . Hailing from a Lovecraftian world of dark magic , she wields various arcade fetishes in battle . She can be about finesse , but she can also be about the crazy . In fact one of her skill trees -- Summoning -- relies on random items drawn from the depths of inky darkness ( taking some poetic licence there ) . For instance , the ability " Something Heavy " drops a random heavy thing on her enemies ' heads . She 's also fast and quick to air juggle her foes . If I needed an imaginary girlfriend , Lophi would be my first choice . <p> Earlier this week designers Hedlund and Jordan Patz ( America 's Army , Star Trek D.A.C. ) walked me through the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluid gameplay into a series of Viewmaster slides . They walked me through the adventure map for the Viking area , split up into a series of stages with mid-bosses in place to teach players important lessons about game mechanics like blocking and stringing together combos . They told me that each playable character will have somewhere between 60 and 80 combo attacks available to them . They walked me through various bits of loot , power-enhancing and look-changing equipment sorted by power levels that should be quite familiar to Diablo fans ( that 's a running theme ) . <p> They tried to show me the smooth arcade-style combat , but WebEx was being a dick . <p> So today I played it for myself . It 's so good . <p> Even using keyboard controls ( the game is built on Flash 11 , which should one day support an Xbox-style controller ) the fighting was fast and fluid .

I got blown up by an explosive spider egg sac during a boss fight , sure , but that only happened once . I learned my lesson . <p> I did n't get to play multiplayer , though I did take a stab at earning a position in the weekly score tournament ( the position I earned was last ) . Multiplayer is a focus for ChronoBlade -- the developers have an old four-player arcade machine in their office for testing purposes -- but the initial rollout will focus on single-player . <p> Even though the game is currently in closed beta ( and therefore subject to change ) , it 's already in a state I would n't hesitate to recommend playing . <p> Prior to my demo with the designers I had a chat with nWay 's co-founder and chief creative , David Jones about the decision to launch the game initially on Facebook . " We want ChronoBlade to be hyper-accessible -- playable on anything . Facebook is our launch platform . There we can fine-tune the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook is great for testing . " It 'll eventually be on Android and iOS , but do you really want to wait ? <p> As for the general aversion to hardcore games on Facebook , Jones and crew think the problem might lie in an aversion to browser plugins . Most console-style games on Facebook and other web platforms use Unity 3D , which requires a special plugin is installed to run . This scares away the casual player . " Flash is ubiquitous , " said Jones . <p> So the casuals are potentially taken care of . Why should the " hardcore " gamers play ChronoBlade ? It 's Diablo the beat-em up , crafted by legends and completely free to play . Here 's the beta sign-up website . See you in game . <p> There is , unfortunately , more grim news from the set of Resident Evil . The Final Chapter , where a crew member was reportedly crushed to death earlier this month . A stuntwoman who 'd been injured also recently said that her injuries will cost her an arm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video game console . Almost every console on offer comes bundled with some game or other . That 's not a bad thing , of course , but it can make the process of picking out a gift a little tricky .

@@51239 <h> Warmest 100 even hotter than forecast <h> How data analysis spoiled one of the world 's largest song contests . <p> Nick Drewe , an online marketer from Brisbane , got the last laugh tonight after he successfully predicted the Top 10 songs voted in Triple J 's Hottest 100 by analysing data from 35,080 votes published on social media . <p> Two weeks ago , Drewe announced that he felt confident he could predict the outcome of the Hottest 100 , which attracts a whopping 1.5 million votes from Australian music lovers . His Warmest 100 website became a much-discussed hit , attracting 75,000 unique visitors within 24 hours of launch . <p> All 10 of the top 10 songs were predicted , five at the correct ranking . <p> And of all the songs in the Hottest 100 , 92 of them were predicted by the Warmest 100 . <p> The first few results announced had caused some doubts , but by late this evening it became clear the analysis had been wildly successful . <p> " It could barely have gone better , " Drewe said after the number one song was announced . <p> " Earlier in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying things on Twitter like ' Warmest 100 , more like Coldest 100 ' , but up by the time we got to number 30 , the feedback online was mostly positive , " he said . " People got more excited as the day went on . " <p> How did he do it ? <p> Radio broadcaster Triple J used social media to promote the annual music countdown . Participants could share their votes by posting to sites such as Twitter , Facebook and Pinterest using a button on the Triple J voting site . The resulting post contained a link to that user 's unique vote page , showing all ten of their votes . <p> Drewe first had the idea for The Warmest 100 when he noticed the URL of shared votes contained a unique identifier . He then used the search mechanisms of the various social platforms to see how many votes he could find . " Facebook Graph Search was n't that useful , " he said , " I got 80 percent of the votes from Twitter .

" <p> ( Drewe 's day job is as Search Engine Marketing Manager at Search Factory in Brisbane . ) <p> The votes were saved into a simple spreadsheet , and then tallied up . Nothing more sophisticated than a simple count was used to analyse the results . <p> It was Drewe 's colleague Tom Knox , previously of music discovery site We Are Hunted , who had the idea of putting the list up on the web .

Professor You-Gan Wang , Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Queensland , confirmed that the sample size was large enough to predict perhaps 90 of the predicted songs that would ultimately prove to be in the official list . <p> Then David Quach , an Australian economist and MATLAB developer with Supported Intelligence in Chicago , also performed some statistical analysis on the data , which Drewe shared with him .

@@79230 <h> eBook Reader Review : Kindle Paperwhite vs Kobo Glo <p> eReaders with eInk screens have not stood still while LCD screen tablets have innovated , though eInk reader pricing has stabilised at just north of $100 . I 've been using the latest generation Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Glo during recent trips overseas as well as commuting to and from meetings to see how well they work . <p> Their new builtin screen lights solve the problem of reading books from an eInk screen at night or in a dark area such as during a flight when the aircraft lighting has been turned down , higher screen resolutions increase display crispness and snappier 1Ghz processors make using the devices generally snappier . <p> For the last few years eReaders with eInk screens have been the best ways for workers comutting on public transport , frequent flyers and holiday makers to read books . <p> Affordable tablets like the Apple iPad Mini and Google Nexus 7 are great gadgets but they have limited battery life whereas dedicated eReaders have extremely impressive batteries that last for many weeks if wifi and light are off . With their lights on at a low level the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tablets also have LCD displays that are always backlit emitting light at your face unlike the Paperwhite and Glo which are frontlit down onto the device from the edges and you can switch the lighting on or off . <p> NOTE : a reader pointed out that the Paperwhite light does n't actually turn off , it just gets very dim . With the Paperwhite If you could turn off the light completely , it would mean that to use it in the dark , you would need to turn on a light in the room , to enable you to see the screen to press the light button onscreen before you could turn the light on again . Looks like Glo is superior because it has a hardware light switch which actually turns it off/on . <p> Nevertheless these small tablets are more affordable and easier to hold than the initial Apple iPad so they must be stealing some marketshare from eInk eReaders . <p> According to several industry analysts the sales of eInk eReaders has plateaued and may fall soon as people who own one already are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is backed up by anecdotal evidence from seeing ebook readers " in the wild " on Sydney public transport , most are at least one or two models in the past . <p> In terms of software both the Glo and Paperwhite are easy to use and have smartphone and tablet apps that synch to your e-reader so that you can continue reading on them if you leave your eInk eReader at home by mistake . <p> Both screens are 6 " in size but the Kobo has a smaller bezel so it is less high and wide edge to edge . If you have an early generation Kindle or Kobo you 'll notice the Glo and Paperwhite display text more crisply thanks to their greyscale eInk 1024 ? 758 resolution screens compared to 800 ? 600 for old eReaders . <p> Both the Glo and PaperWhite screen lights can be turned on and off at will and have their brightness level varied to suit your eyes . The Glo has a dedicated light button at top right of the eReader near the power slider . The Paperwhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightbuld icon to turn the light on or off and vary intensity . <p> Book availability remains problematic with Kobo having some authors and publishers on board that Amazon does n't and vice versa . Sometimes the book you want wo n't be available for sale in Australia at all which is very frustrating and leads some readers to torrent books instead . Kobo has the edge overall because you can load any ePub book onto it , Amazon will only let you read PDF 's and books you buy through the Kindle store . <p> In terms of ports both have Micro USB at the bottom . Glo is WiFi only whereas PaperWhite has Wi-Fi and 3G models . Storage space is 2Gb onboard for both ( about 1GB usable for your books ) but the Kobo also allows you to add upto 32GB extra storage via a MicroSD on the left edge . <p> Overall both are splendid devices .

@@79232 <h> Filling the gaps in Australia 's dental workforce <p> Data released recently by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show the number of dentists has increased by 24% in the five years to 2011 . There are now around 12,700 dentists in Australia , with 80% working in the private sector . <p> Fearing an over-supply of dentists , the Australian Dental Association ( ADA ) has called for a cap on the number of dental schools and graduates . The ADA expects 580 local students to graduate this year , up from 250 a year in the early to mid-2000s . Given that around 200 foreign-trained dentists are expected to arrive in Australia this year , the ADA wants the number of university places capped at 460 a year . <p> But do we really have an over-supply of dentists in Australia ? If you live in metropolitan areas and can afford private dental care , the answer might be yes . But it 's a very different story for rural Australia and low-income families . <p> Who is missing out on dental care ? <p> Dental disease is high among Australian children , with around half having a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across all children . Those from disadvantaged families or who live in rural non-fluoridated communities have a far higher rate of disease than children from wealthier families living in urban fluoridated communities . <p> Australia 's aged population is also missing out on appropriate dental care . The many thousands of residents of nursing homes around the country often lack access to the basic dental services which are so important for them to maintain adequate nutrition . <p> Poor oral health is also associated with an increase in a raft of other diseases such as heart disease , arthritis and stroke . Oral disease and most of these systemic diseases have similar risk factors -- poor diet , obesity , smoking , for example . Modifying the risk factors for oral disease may well reduce the crippling burden of other conditions in the community . <p> But nearly half a million Australians are currently on waiting lists for care in public dental facilities . Most will be requiring some form of tooth restoration or even tooth extraction . <p> Small steps towards equity <p> The Commonwealth government 's Dental Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental care for children and additional services for low-income adults . Clearly there will be a need for more dental health practitioners to work in the public system to provide the necessary services . <p> The reform package also includes a grant scheme to encourage dental practitioners to relocate to rural or regional localities where there are limited or no services provided . <p> New dental programs have often been set up in association with rural campuses ( Charles Sturt University , for example ) , with the expectation that at least some of the graduates will practice in currently under-served regions of Australia . This model of rural training has certainly been successful for medicine . <p> Access to services in rural areas could also be enhanced with better use of telehealth/teledentistry services -- digital technologies to deliver health care , consultations and education . <p> Do we need to see a dentist ? <p> With such substantial gaps in dental care , it 's logical to ask whether everyone who has an oral health problem or needs a dental check-up requires a dentist to provide this care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently provide significant amounts of oral health care , particularly in the area of treating and preventing tooth decay , and gum disease . This model of care has a long history in both this country and overseas and is proving effective , particularly when the model ensures that such providers work closely with dentists as part of a dental care team . <p> Dental hygienist and therapist programs have increased significantly in Australian universities , with the number of graduates expected to reach 330 by 2015 . These dental professionals could be used effectively in rural centres working with dentists in regional centres , in schools and , of course , in nursing homes . <p> Future reform <p> With so many Australians still missing out on dental care , restricting the number of practitioners does not make sense .

@@83231 s new Mining Rehabilitation Fund ? what you need to know <h> Introduction <p> Reforms to the Western Australian Government 's approach to the funding of rehabilitation of mining tenements will have implications for both current tenement holders and those looking to buy or sell mining tenements in the future . <p> On 5 November 2012 , the Western Australian Parliament passed the Mining Rehabilitation Fund Act 2012 ( WA ) ( MRF Act ) . ( Fund ) . The Fund has been designed to secure the rehabilitation obligations of tenement holders by requiring them to pay an annual levy into the Fund . These payments are then used for future rehabilitation of abandoned mine sites and other land affected by a tenement holder 's mining operations . <p> The new law follows a recent study by the Western Australian Government which estimated that under the current bond system the Government has insufficient funds to cover the cost of rehabilitation of abandoned mining tenements , and its financial exposure to these costs could exceed $100 million . <h> When will the new law commence ? <p> The MRF Act is scheduled to take effect on 31 July 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the regulations for implementing the new law have yet to be released to the public . The regulations are intended to set out , amongst other things , the administrative framework for calculating/paying the levy . We anticipate the Fund wo n't become operative until the regulations come into force . <h> Who is liable to pay ? <p> From 31 July 2013 , holders of ' mining authorisations ' ( Holders ) will be required to make annual levy contributions into the Fund . <p> Under the MRF Act , a ' mining authorisation ' is defined as : <p> mining tenements as defined in the Mining Act 1978 ( Mining Act ) other than those granted or held pursuant to a State Agreement ; or <p> rights granted or held pursuant to a State Agreement , which will be specified in the regulations ( yet to be made public ) . <h> How is the levy calculated ? <p> The levy will be calculated based on data ( submitted by the Holders ) showing , amongst other things , the number of hectares of disturbed land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability ( including rehabilitation costs ) . <p> Mining tenements with an estimated closure liability below a certain threshold amount will be exempt from the levy . Once the Department of Mines and Petroleum ( DMP ) has completed its assessment of the estimated closure liability , the Holder will be issued with an assessment notice specifying , amongst other things , the annual levy amount to be paid and the day on which it will become payable . <p> Levy contributions will be assessed by the DMP on a per tenement ( rather than a whole of project ) basis , which means separate levies may be charged for different tenements irrespective of whether those tenements apply to the same project . <p> The obligation to pay the levy for a given year , and any penalties for non-payment , will be borne by the Holder who holds the mining tenement on the due date . This liability remains with that Holder even if the tenement is transferred to a third party after the due date . <p> As noted earlier , the framework for calculating and paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage applicable to certain Holders , and the threshold amount for exemption purposes ) is intended to be set out in the as yet to be released regulations . <h> Disclosure requirements <p> The MRF Act imposes an obligation on each Holder to disclose ( in an approved form and manner ) certain information relevant to their mine operations , by a prescribed date , for the purposes of determining the Holder 's annual levy contribution . Failure to comply with these disclosure obligations , including providing false and misleading information , could result in the Holder being liable for a maximum penalty of $20,000 . <p> Further , if any information provided by a Holder is not acceptable or defective , the DMP may issue an assessment based upon its estimate of the annual levy contribution payable by that Holder . This may not necessarily reflect the actual closure liability associated with the Holder 's mining operations . <h> Holders ' right to object and appeal <p> A Holder will have the right to object to an assessment notice ( or reassessment notice ) issued by the DMP based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erred in its assessment or reassessment of the annual levy contribution specified in the relevant notice . <p> After determining the objection , the amount of the annual levy contribution payable by the Holder may be increased or decreased ( as the case may be ) . <p> A Holder who is aggrieved by the outcome of an objection may apply to the State Administrative Tribunal for a review of the decision . <h> Implications for Holders <p> As is the case under the current bond system , the DMP will only draw from the Fund in circumstances where a Holder has not fulfilled its rehabilitation/closure obligations . However , unlike the bond system , the Fund will essentially cross-secure the rehabilitation obligations of all Holders so that the DMP will be entitled to draw from the Fund if any Holder does not meet its rehabilitation/closure obligations . <p> The MRF Act does not amend the Mining Act and environmental security bonds can still be applied ( in accordance with the Mining Act ) towards the rehabilitation of mining tenements granted under the Mining Act . Accordingly , the MRF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mining Act and Holders will still need to bear that liability in addition to making annual levy contributions under the MRF Act . <p> The obligation to pay levies into the Fund will be in addition to any obligations a Holder may have under the Contaminated Sites Act 2003 . <p> When negotiating sale documentation , purchasers of mining tenements will need to consider the inclusion of provisions that : <p> provide for the annual levy contribution payable by the seller to be pro-rated so that contractually the purchaser assumes the obligation to pay from the date of completion of the sale ( which may be some time prior to the date on which the purchaser becomes the registered holder of a tenement ) ; and <p> if necessary , oblige the seller to give the purchaser copies of , or access to , the seller 's historical records for purposes of satisfying any information requests by the DMP relating to the seller 's operations on the tenements for the purposes of calculation of the levy . <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought about your specific circumstances . <p> To print this article , all you need is to be registered on Mondaq.com . <p> Click to Login as an existing user or Register so you can print this article . <p> Ian McLeod is the head of Ergon Energy , the state-owned network operator and retailer . <p> Some comments from our readers ? ?

@@83238 <h> Canon EOS M Review : Playing Catch-Up In The Mirrorless Race <p> Mirrorless cameras have matured into serious alternatives to DSLRs . Some of the biggest brands failed to anticipate that success . One of them , Canon , is now trying to play catch-up . Its first attempt , the EOS M , dropped late last year after much anticipation . <h> Who 's It For ? <h> Design <p> Instead of chasing the trend of retro-styled cameras , Canon is sticking to its guns with the EOS M. Its design resembles that of many compact point-and-shoots in its lineup . Overall , it 's rather bland , but efficient and well-built . Gripping the camera is n't as comfortable as , say , a Sony NEX-6 , but it is easy enough to get used to . <h> Using It <p> The EOS M is controlled manually through it 's capacitive touchscreen ( more on that below ) , lacking the slew of physical dials that many enthusiasts demand . It is clear that this camera is geared heavily toward a streamlined , point-and-shoot experience . There is no viewfinder or pop-up flash . Instead , Canon offers an external flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . <p> The pictures coming out of the M are of great quality , and the 22mm f/2.0 kit lens is no slouch . Noise at high ISOs is only slightly behind the Sony NEX-7 , which we directly compared RAW files with . Check out our Flickr gallery of full-size images . <p> 22mm f/2.0 1/80 sec ISO 320 ( RAW conversion ) <p> 18mm f/4.0 1/80 sec ISO 2500 ( RAW conversion ) <p> The EOS M system only launched with two lens options -- the 22mm f/2.8 , and an 18-55mm f/3.5-5/6 . This severely limits your options if you are serious about using a variety of lenses ( and if you are n't , a camera like this may not suit you ) . Canon does offer an adaptor that allows you to use its entire line of EF glass with fully functioning auto-focus and aperture control . But slapping a giant DSLR lens on this camera kinda defeats the purpose of compactness . <p> You can also shoot HD video with the EOS M. It will look exactly like video shot with the EOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still no better than what you 've seen in the past couple of EOS iterations . <p> Pretty much every review for the EOS M thus far points out a particularly crappy autofocus . It 's true , compared to some of the other popular mirrorless cameras out there , the M will seem downright sluggish . It is n't terrible , but it is wholly unpredictable , which can be trouble for action scenes or fleeting street-photography . <h> The Best Part <p> The one particular strength that is unmatched by any mirrorless camera to date is the touchscreen interface . Other cameras feature touchscreens , but none work as smoothly or easily as Canon 's . The lack of physical controls is easily forgotten when you see how intuitive it is to access settings by tapping the rear display . <h> Tragic Flaw <p> The slow autofocus is an easy target here , but I think the lack of lenses is a bigger problem . The entire point of interchangeable lens cameras is ... the ... interchangeable lenses . If there are n't any lenses to interchange -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its EF-M line of lenses into a thriving ecosystem , but it will take a while .

And if there is one thing the promotional advertisements have made clear , it is that Tasmania means cheating . Yes CHEATING . There may be food . There may be Alice and/or Wonderland . But there will be cheating , served with a side of tense music infused montage . <p> Of course for there to be cheating , there will need to be rules first , or at least soon after , but they can be added in post-production . <p> So , once we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case people tuning in had n't decided whether to tune in yet , we cut to Hobart to discover that Samuel is wearing a massive hat while he cooks breakfast because it 's a " massive day " and not because he 's a massive tit .

My Kitchen Rules <p> A bit of background voice over then tells us that Ali is recently separated from her husband , and Samuel is a friend of her ex-husband who calls her " Mum or Mama " while she " knows him too well to ever find him attractive " and if you 've wrapped your head around that , then Seven hopes you 'll enjoy Tasmania 's next sitcom All In The Family which is presently writing itself . <p> Advertisement <p> The pair jump in the car and Ali reminds Samuel to use words , because this is n't a silent movie . Then the plot thickens ( and curdles just a little ) as Samuel points out that they 're arguing like an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're acting like my child . " <p> Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay . I 'll just let you all piece together your own Tasmanian stereotype gag out of that . <p> The mango initiative ... My Kitchen Rules <p> Miles away in a restaurant that has a wine rack , Peter looks over the menu planned for tonight and suggests Wonderland may in fact be Thailand ... because ... wait for it ... they 're cooking a Thai curry . Evans you larrikin , I bet you even thought of that yourself ! <p> Speaking of larrikins , tonight 's chefs arrive at the supermarket that I really wish they 'd name because it 's all so subtle and mysterious and Samuel grabs a kids trolley . And ... Ok , I 'll be honest , it 's three minutes in and I 'm already over this weird mum/child dynamic they 've got going on . We get no respite though as he calls her " darling " once more and then " mama " a few times in the car park and I 'm wishing he 'd forget Ali 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got . <p> Ali and Samuel get home , set up their theme which is Alice in Wonderland as interpreted by a two dollar shop and before you can say " why not call it that Mad Hatter 's Thai Party ? " Samuel screams out for Ali because a whole minute of the allotted three hours of cooking time has expired . Remember that minute later kids , if we 've learnt anything it 's that these guys will RUE the day ... well minute they made this crucial error . <p> Only a few relatively dull and uneventful moments later , Ali says , in a particularly calm voice that her stress levels are through the roof . Also that she 's freaking out . Hmmm , iif this is her at full panic it 'll make for pretty bland television . It 's a pity the producers do n't have some way *cough*cheating*cough* to ramp it up . <p> Speaking of bland , they 're making a custard , so we get a round of " it better not scramble " that suggests the contestants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't . <p> The pair cook effectively , while worrying successfully and tempting fate forebodingly , then the teams arrive , walking up the path past the sign that says " Wonderland " towards the doorbell that says " really clunky sound effects , " and Lisa and Candice read the word Wonderland aloud to prove they can , then talk about reading their star signs to undermine any credibility that might accidentally give them and prove there is a little bit of The Shire in every program now . <p> The doorbell duly rings and Samuel , parrot that he is , mimics it . Ali admits that 's when " the heart starts to flutter . " Samuel who has been hoping his constant use of the word " Mama " was the trick to getting Ali stirred up is shocked to learn that he only had to imitate a ding dong to get her going . Then again , he 's already a dill , so at least it 's not much of a stretch . <p> The other contestants sit down and participate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table in order to facilitate a bout of group bitching about Lisa and Candice in cutaways . We learn that Lisa and Candice are not only unpopular , but also coming last and because this is a reality television show and not a Disney movie , this means we are meant to want to storm their houses with flames and pitchforks , not take off their braces and glasses to reveal that they were secretly ' 80s prom queens all along . <p> All of which is clearly meant to make us want to hate them in the same way we hated the Spice Girls - that is by watching this show and no other - but really just comes off as a bit of kicking the team that anyone with basic arithmetic skills has already backed heavily to be the next team eliminated . <p> After an ad that once again refuses to tell me the name of the obscure and bashful supermarket chain that have so kindly donated their product and locations to this show , the teams ... bitch about Lisa and Candice , while Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's episode is well established and suddenly it feels like it may actually last for days rather than minutes , which is lucky as apparently that 's how long Samuel needs to prepare his curry paste . <p> As if scripted , the judges choose this moment to arrive and sure enough , Peter walks into the kitchen and as though psychically enlightened ( by producers ) as to the events that have lead to this moment , he asks instantly about the curry paste . <p> Gosh , if only he 'd asked about the squid . Or not come into the kitchen straight away like he normally does . How does he know ? ! <p> At least they 've dealt with it now and we can be sure they wo n't make much of this later . <p> Back at the table , Jenna says she does n't want to sound blonde , so instead sounds daft as she speaks of how " inspirated " by the prospect of an entree of granita down the rabbit hole she is . The others all dutifully pile-on in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have two blonde personal trainers mocking you for being a bit dim , you know you 've hit rock bottom , or at least you would if you had n't recently inspirated which can really dull your senses ( as well as inhibiting your ability to operate heavy machinery ) . <p> Entree is served -- in part , all over Samuel 's arm -- which Lisa and Candice like to think would have meant instant elimination , because dropping one dish is the same as dropping your bundle like they did . " That 'd keep us in the competition . Imagine that ! " says Candice . Australia does so . Australia shudders . <p> On the entree , which is Thai Beef Strips with a Mai Tai Granita , Peter says he 's going to be blunt , which will really contrast with his pussy-footing to date . He does n't think the Mai Tai belongs . He also thinks the curry paste out of a jar is a " no no . " This confuses Lisa who screeches " yes " to camera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this cooking competition . <p> Trying the dish , the other teams are split . Dan and Steph feel sorry for Samuel and Ali . Sam is pleased to discover a taste explosion . Jenna is now randomly saying the word " Malibu . " And Lisa and Candice ... are inspirated to find more fault , they do this mostly by Candice saying " jar " a lot and Lisa saying " did n't really work for me " even more . Weirdly the other teams judge that criticism to be slightly strategic . So they bitch about Lisa and Candice some more . <p> At least this is n't getting repetitive . Or repetitive . <p> Next Anthony Field turns up in the ad break to prove that retiring from the Wiggles has n't slowed him down at all -- he can make just as big a fool of himself without a primary coloured skivvy thank you very much . <p> Oh and here 's an ad for the Gate Crashers who arrive next week and promise something completely different : they will be snarky about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ad to the Spice Girls , and they are Asian , so imagine our surprise when 9 seconds later a Twitter pop up declares the Asian Spice Girls to be on their way . Vive la difference ! <p> In the kitchen , Ali reminds Samuel that Manu really likes sauce and he points out they 're ok , because they can always use some sweet chilli out of a bottle . Oh . Um . Wow . He 'll never learn . I do n't mean the bottle quip , which presumably was a joke , but the fact that he said it while Ali was holding a knife . I think she almost sliced his squid and stuffed it with pork right there . <p> Speaking of crazy ... Scott , the personal trainer , has an intriguing problem . It seems he does n't like to eat squid ( or cuttlefish or octopus ) , not because he has a tattoo of an octopus on his arm and likes the word " cephalopod " - though its nice to give the other teams another plaything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts and the ability to camoflage . <p> Ah yes , camoflage , one of the world 's three best reasons not to eat something and for that matter , the exact reason I passed on an Abrams Tank Amuse-Bouche at a party the other day . <p> While some of the others seem bewildered by this , Sam gets it . He points out that he would n't eat lions if they were on the menu , because he likes lions . It 's lucky he 's pretty when he smiles . Of course , by the reverse logic , he 'd all be happy to sup on a soup of boiled Lisa and Candice if given the option . But let 's not focus on that . <p> Back in the kitchen , Samuel is cooking with gas , though I mean that purely metaphorically as he 's actually run out of gas . Until he finds gas , attached to the gas barbecue . <p> There may actually have been a gas leak as for the talent portion of the evening , Miss Congeniality is now singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Pete and Manu feel ill then they 'll score tonight 's chefs lower . She points out to us that she knows people will tell her to shut up if they do n't like her singing . Sadly the other teams are n't aware of their safety words , so they just grimace and try to politely ignore it because they do n't habitually provoke the mentally disturbed by yelling at them . <p> And now Candice is attempting sign language so it seems that Ali and Samuel 's decision to offer up a crack pipe as a palate cleanser has really worked . <p> Oh crumbs ! The crumbs have n't set properly on the squid . And sauces ! ! The sauce is looking thin . And vegetables ! ! ! The vegetables are looking , well , crap . It turns out plating does n't come in a jar so Samuel does n't know how to do it . Ali contributes by bursting into tears because it has been a hard night and so she asks if she can have a minute ... to which Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the start ? ! ! ! " Well , no , he does n't . He escorts Ali from the cupboard she has chosen to hide in towards the door to the outside world where she can actually escape . <p> Then its an ad with Kochie and Mel promising hard hitting journalism on Sunrise tomorrow and now I 'm wondering how far that gas leak has spread . <p> After the ad Samuel demonstrates his ability with words . He helps Ali shake it off by getting her to actually shake it off . Nifty . <p> Having left their dish to cool , or as some might say , congeal , on the bench for a little bit , they finally serve the dish to the table . Faced with Ali 's tears , the teams sympathise . Pete and Manu eat . Oh and Lisa bitches and moans . Same old , same old . <p> Ali is still crying as the judges try to discuss their Squid hood stuffed with pork . Manu tries to charm her by liking her food , while Candice tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of weakness , really demonstrating a strong understanding of the butch , macho , testosterone-fuelled male audience that watches this show . <p> Peter calls the dish delectable and Ali runs back to the kitchen to celebrate their tactical decision to have her cry and not Samuel . <p> Then , hold on to your mad hats , the other teams love the dishes , except ... <p> ... can you guess ? ... <p> ... ok yes , Scott passes on the squid , because his arm told him to , but also ... <p> ... that 's right Lisa ! <p> Lisa has , contrary to all expectations , some complaints . They are entirely reasonable of course . She is upset at the squid for not being lion , disappointed in the pork for being chalky yet not enough that anyone without acute chalkitis could spot it , and apoplectic at the overall plate for not smashing itself into razor sharp shards that she can insert into the skin of the villainous dictators in the kitchen , pinning them to their thrones of evil while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Samuel wants to add corn flour to the custard because he sees a good opportunity for a visual gag in it , but Ali sees custard soaking into her sponge and declares it her worst nightmare come true . <p> Clearly Ali has n't spent any time in Lisa 's head . <p> And now , here 's a phrase you may not have heard before : Mango to the rescue ! <p> Pureed mango is mixed with the custard to form mang-stard the mang-nificent . And if that is n't enough bad word play for you , while this is happening the teams join in by coining a few puns on the word Thai . The Thai-rifle is Thai-riffic but the pun is Thai-rrible and Thai-rsome . All of which will be the names of restaurants in your local area by the end of this sentence . <p> Having run out songs , Lisa chooses to entertain the group with some impressions . Her first impression is of a complete lunatic . Specifically a mad woman who rants about her need for carbohydrates to help absorb her proteins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dessert is glassed up and Peter calls it ... " interesting " before asking Ali and Samuel if they like it . He 's really just hoping he can get Ali to cry again . Disappointed at the lack of tears , he says he likes the taste but not the technique . Peter is such a good chef he can taste technique . To him , the technique tastes a bit like chicken . <p> Meanwhile Manu is reminded of pina coladas . So much so that he regales the teams with a tale of a time he , three kitchen hands and a particularly large spatchcock spent a crazy week on a beach together . As the show is neither long enough nor broadcast in a suitable adults only time slot to permit that story to air , the production team finally locate the gas leak that has taken us all to this place and the anecdote sadly hits the cutting room floor . <p> Hold the press . Lisa is set to be hospitalised having exhibited multiple symptoms of a mercury-poisoning induced mental episode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai-rifle in front of her , but she is nice about it . Actually nice . Pleasant even . It 's disconcertingly congenial . That is until the other teams start singing the word ' rice ' in a moment of musical mocking that helps remind them and us that they are to only be Awful Human Beings ( TM ) as their contract states . <p> The teams retire to score Ali and Samuel , a segment with a theme of " just give them more than Lisa and Candice " running through it , with one obvious exception being Lisa and Candice who give it 3 for reasons that are about thought and about themselves and they actually do n't reference the meal at all . <p> The jovial voice of MKR then informs us that Ali and Samuel need to score more than 57 to not be in last place and sent to the seventh level of Hell . The guest score of 30 helps them out and surprises Lisa who has suffered a relapse , now exhibiting symptoms of paranoia with a hint of conspiracy theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams are scoring Ali and Samuel higher because they are n't as much of a threat as she is . Not as much of a threat to their ears perhaps . <p> So they need a total of six for their Thai-rifle , which means this is n't a very Thai-t compeThai-tion at all . Sorry , I 'll get my coat ... and Thai ! <p> Back to the judging:Dessert : Manu 5And Peter gives them nothing to make it a tie.No , sorry Peter gives them a 6 for a total score of 63 which means they are n't coming last , a fact that surprises two people at the table and also two people in the entire universe . <p> Ali and Samuel then kick everyone out so they can try to find the recipe for romantic chemis-Thai that they know they left around here somewhere . <h> 108 comments <p> Please do n't debase the noble mango by associating it with this embarrassing display of Oedipus complex . <p> Commenter <p> Offenbark <p> Location <p> Nelly Bay <p> Date and time <p> February 12 , 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for writing this article ?

@@104231 <h> This Joker Figure Made Me Question Why I Was Being So Serious <p> So another Hot Toys Movie Masterpiece figure finally came out , and , as is my nature , I simply had to get it . <p> This time , Hong Kong collectible figure maker Hot Toys came out with a version 2.0 to their highly popular Dark Knight Joker figure . Interestingly enough , the first Hot Toys Movie Masterpiece item I ever bought was the Bank Robber version of the Joker , so it seemed fitting that the moment the new Joker figure was announced , I immediately pre-ordered ( seriously one of the only ways you can actually be assured to get one at this point ... And even then , sometimes your order can get cancelled due to short supply ) one for myself . <p> Like always , Hot Toys has delivered a quality product . The Joker is one of the few 1/6 scale figures I 've seen that wears a shirt , a vest , a coat , and an overcoat and does n't end up looking extremely bulky or losing pretty much all of its mobility . This leads to some difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but considering how awesome the figure looks , it 's a low price to pay . <p> The face of the Joker is pretty much a spot on likeness of Heath Ledger 's portrayal of the character : dark , eerie , and sinister . This is pretty much a no-brainer , since Hot Toys has been getting it right since 2008 . The moveable eye feature is present again , which leads to a whole range of possibilities in terms of poses you can give the character . It 's fascinating that no matter what position you put the eyes in , the Joker still manages to remain menacing and scary . <p> As for differences when compared with the Hot Toys Joker 1.0 figure , the police uniform and no-makeup head have been excluded , as has the in-jacket grenade bundle . Instead , the figure comes with an interrogation room setup : a replica table and chair , and a 3-wall backdrop . <p> The table has authentic-looking scuff and scratch marks on it , and even includes a little hole where you can stick a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . <p> All this makes for a really fun and cool setup . When setting things up to take pictures , I found myself quoting lines from The Dark Knight . I even took my Batman figure down from his post and starting setting up scenes from the movie . <p> Now , no figure is without its flaws , but to be honest , there were surprisingly few to mention with the Joker 2.0 figure . One relatively big one was that the figure comes with 2 shoe knives , but despite what the instruction booklet says , the blades ca n't be inserted into the Joker 's shoes , rendering them useless . This was only a minor annoyance , however , since everything else about the figure was so cool I stopped caring after about 5 seconds . Otherwise , the only real complaints I could find had nothing to do with the figure itself , but were the fact that 1 ) the replica table lamp did n't have a built-in LED for added effect , and 2 ) that the interrogation room setup did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now <p> In the 1930s , there were no video games , no pen-and-paper RPGs and no Star Wars .

Until now , the cycling and running disciplines benefitted from a technical approach to equipment which the swimming element failed to replicate .

The wet suits and swimskins also utilise many features which enhance body alignment and buoyancy , including built in bicep and calf ' release ' areas on the wet suits to improve stroke efficiency and kick propulsion and compression in the swimskins which reduces frontal drag .

@@142231 retirement secret <p> Michael Hussey did not reveal his plans to retire at the end of the Australian summer until the week before the Sydney Test match because he feared he would have been summarily dropped from the team had he done so . <p> Australian cricket reeled with shock when Hussey announced his decision to finish playing the international game , and it is no secret the team hierarchy would have preferred to be informed further in advance . However Hussey told ESPNcricinfo that his secrecy had been partly about preserving his place until the right moment to finish . <p> " Partly why I did n't want to say anything to anyone was that I cherished every Test match I got to play and I really wanted to finish the Australian summer , " Hussey said . " If I made it known earlier then perhaps they would start looking ahead earlier and not play me in my last couple of Tests . That was a small selfish part of it that I really wanted to finish when I wanted to finish . I did n't want them to say ' you 're going to retire , we 'll blood someone else ' . <p> " Most of it though was making sure I was 100% sure about the decision . I wanted to make sure in myself , I wanted to see how I felt through the Australian summer , and my feelings certainly did n't change . When I started looking ahead to what was coming up I knew I was going to find it really tough .

He also said it would be some time yet before the team 's culture settles into the sort of strong and assured environment he first walked into as a Test match debutant in Brisbane in 2005 . Crucial to this , Hussey said , was the retention of a settled , stable team . <p> " The thing about that team is it did n't really change much for probably a 10-year period , so they got to know each other extremely well , like brothers , " Hussey said . " The environment now will get back to that I 'm sure , but it just takes time . <p> " There 's been so much change and upheaval in Australian cricket over the last year or so , changing of coaches and selectors , players have come out of the team and new players have come in . So you 've got to expect it will take time for trust to build up , friendships to build , the hard times , the good times together , it all builds the culture over a period of time .

Compelled to play in the Champions League for Chennai Super Kings , Hussey was left with only two days to prepare for a Test match against India in Chandigarh , and actively fought Cricket Australia 's decision to keep him in South Africa . <p> " I was really disappointed , because I was desperate to get there , " he said . " My understanding was that the Test tour starts when the team flies out of Australia , and they were n't allowing me to leave South Africa where the Champions League was , until literally a couple of days before the Test . <p> " India 's a tough place to play at the best of times , and if you do n't have very good preparation going into it , you 're not going to perform well , and I think looking back it was close to costing me my career . I came back into the Australian summer where again I felt under enormous pressure if I did n't start the summer well I could 've been out of the team . <p> " I had one Shield game in Adelaide where I got 0 and 1 , and in Melbourne I got a duck in the first innings and thankfully managed to get some runs in the second innings . If that had been the end , and one of the reasons why I was left out , because I was n't able to prepare properly , I would 've been one pretty dirty because I could n't give my best to the team , but angry that it would 've cost me my career . " <p> Hussey gave Clarke credit for the way he had shaped the team over the past two years , but said that Ricky Ponting was the best captain he played under . He also revealed he had held his own leadership ambitions for a time , frustrated that his record of four losses in as many stand-in ODI appearances does not indicate what he might have done with a more lasting commission . <p> Every word said by Hussey about his " shock " retirement makes perfect sense based on the current incompetence of the Australian selection panel . I am one of the majority of fans who believe that Hussey has never been and is not selfish . In a nutshell , Hussey says that if you are not 100% committed to representing your country on the big stage ( in any sport ) , your performance can suffer significantly as a result . The fact he has 4 children ( one born prematurely last June ) currently under 10 years of age is a more than justifiable reason to retire when he did , and his performances against South Africa and Sri Lanka this past Australian summer show that he was able to go out on his own terms and while on top , rather than being remembered as a fantastic player who stayed on too long . Most consistent player across all 3 forms of international cricket , whose presence will be sorely missed by many Aussie fans ( myself included ) for many years to come . <p> B.C.G on March 15 , 2013 , 14:52 GMT <p> @HatsforBats-Fair enough.Im not against any of his achievements .

It is also interesting to see how the team culture has deteriorated further since Hussey left and it also shows the current lack of effective leadership in place . <p> SevereCritic on March 14 , 2013 , 20:03 GMT <p> Aussies are generally always known to treat their retiring players rather ruthlessly . Hussey has always been a perfect professional -- a complete cricketer who delivered for his country in all three formats . He was part of the reason why Clarke was able to pile up all those runs in 2012 in home tests . Coming in 3 down , Clarke knew that there was always Hussey after him to hold things together and build a partnership with . Did it against India ; then did it again against SA in the first test . With Hussey gone , Clarke is having to rethink his 3 down position as he is being left stranded on one side , as the other side falls over like 9 balls . <p> SirViv1973 on March 14 , 2013 , 17:30 GMT <p> @Mervin John , Hindsight is a wonderful thing . Although both Hussey &amp; Hodge made their debuts soon after the 05 ashes series I do n't think anyone at the time would have picked them for that series . Katich 's position at 6 would have been vulnerable at that start of the series but I do n't think you could have accommodated both Hussey &amp; Hodge in that team . <p> @landl47 : Well said . Hussey to me is the epitome of a selfless cricketer . He got his break at the age of 30 - people should remember that . He was not bitter about that - just grateful that he got an opportunity and went on to pile mountains of runs . Given his late start I was expecting him to hang on for as long as he could so when he suddenly retired I was saddened - I 'd have loved to see him play 100 tests - but hey he played 26 more tests that Sir Donald himself so that context is useful to remember while we celebrate an outstanding career . The thing about Hussey was that he seemed to succeed everywhere and did well in India too when some of the Australian greats have struggled . It is also interesting that he says Punter was the best captain he played under - given that he played under just Punter and MC . Also his fear of being dropped is an indictment of CA - and the lack of trust that even senior established players have of the administration - something is wrong here .. <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 15:29 GMT <p> I think Hussey is one of the most dominant batsman Australia has ever produced . And I always maintained that if Hussey had played in the Ashes in 2005 along with Brad Hodge Australia might not have lost the Ashes . Remember , Australia has no fighter , no challenger on this team right now except Clarke and if they really wanted Hussey to stay , they would have fixed his pay check and retain him . Yes , he did the right thing , cause base on his age it would have been a matter of time before they shut the door on him . You can not win matches if you do n't select the right team to win . Meanwhile , Australia is enjoying their best day on the tour - no play today . Hope that will help them save the whitewash . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 14:51 GMT <p> Australian fans accusing Hussey of being selfish need to start appreciating their best players more . Remember , this is a guy who was continually being ignored for a place in the side while racking up mountains of first-class runs , while nowadays the Baggy Green is being dished out to incomplete players like Phil Hughes , Shaun Marsh , Steve Smith , Xavier Doherty , and Rob Quiney ! And when he finally got the chance he always delivered to the best of his ability for the good of the team . As an England fan he is the Australian I respect the most , ahead of the brilliant Michael Clarke and the never-tiring workhorse Peter Siddle . In any case , if retiring is the best thing he can do to spend time with his family , then all the best - someone has to put family first in today 's ever-commercialized age . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 14:17 GMT <p> I 've always said he was selfish , even when people all over the world were heaping praises on him . Does n't surprise me one bit . When he bats with tailenders , even those who can not distinguish the bat handle from the blade , he never shielded them and used to take singles off every opportunity and let them face the music . No wonder he has so many not outs and that average . He knew what was coming in India . With just him and Clarke as competent batsmen , they never stood a chance . He did n't want that on his career . He enjoyed being in a team where it felt awesome that you start a test match knowing you would win , and did not want to be a part of the team in which you walk in knowing you will be thrashed ( current team ) . So much for being Mr. Cricket ! <p> SirViv1973 on March 14 , 2013 , 13:43 GMT <p> Interesting stuff from Hussey . Given his record he had every right to decide when he would call it a day . CA could and probably should have selected him for the ODI series against WI . I understand to a certain extent that the selectors may have had the CT in mind but there were so many players used over the 2 series with WI SRL . The squad for the WI series should have been made up of players who were not going to be involed in the test series in ind this would have allowed the squad there to have had an extra week &amp; half preparation and given them the chance to play a couple of meaningful warm up matches before the tests began . <p> landl47 on March 14 , 2013 , 13:36 GMT <p> Hussey is the last person I would accuse of being selfish . He retired at the end of the Australian home season , a very fitting time to leave . He 's almost 38 years old . If Australia has trouble replacing him , the problem is in the shortage of talent available , it 's nothing to do with Hussey . <p> Huss could have phrased what he said differently and no-one would have accused him of selfishness ( eg : I hung on as long as I could , hoping that Australia would find a replacement for me before I had to go ) , but it 's a measure of his humility that he takes upon himself the burden that should have been CA 's . <p> All Australians should be grateful to Huss for being the player he was for their side . I 'm happy I had the chance to see him play . The best of good luck to him in his retirement . <p> B.C.G on March 14 , 2013 , 13:21 GMT <p> Look at Bobby Simpson.Came back at 42 to lead a 2nd string team against the mighty Windies.Remember he was paid according to the pre-Packer standards.Compare that to Mr.Selfish(huss) as he looks to earn a bit in the IPL . Did n't he know about the stern tests ahead for OZ ? Wheres the responsibility ? What legend deserts his team on FORIEGN shores ? <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 13:18 GMT <p> No one has a right to call Hussey selfish . Not one person would have a single bad word to say against him and his commitment to cricket and playing for Australia . It 's just great that he bowed out on a high . Hussey would 've always done what 's right for the team . If he did n't play his final tests it would 've been so unfair to a man who has given his heart and soul to Australian cricket . <p> B.C.G on March 14 , 2013 , 13:16 GMT <p> @HatsforBats-So 2 50s &amp; a 100 when the games was long gone ...... from 5 tests.By all accounts ; thats considered average or has great been redefined ? <p> FlemoGilly on March 14 , 2013 , 13:16 GMT <p> Huss , fancy a plane trip to India . We need you mate . Edward good points mate and what you say is true , and I think it is also a measure of how far the Sheffield Shield has fallen . Guys that come out of there are no longer the finished article ready to play tests . It is sad because they should be , we should n't be developing players ( *cough* Maxwell *cough* ) in tests . If our team is crap I am all for bringing in new people no matter how hard the next test is - hiding Hughes behind Quiney was a disgrace , and you hear about it all the time in the Wallaby articles ( selecting safe players not rookies against the Lions regardless of the gulf in ability or form ) . Khawaja who is one of the few descent test players has n't been played yet and we need to give him a go soon and Burns is another one who is impressing me . <p> thebrownie on March 14 , 2013 , 12:48 GMT <p> The fact that he was n't allowed to leave the Champions Trophy to prepare fore test cricket bothers me . Wow ! <p> TheRedLeb on March 14 , 2013 , 12:36 GMT <p> I think branding Hussey as selfish is narrow minded ... every great sportsman ( and his Test record for Australia speaks for itself ) has earned the right to decided when the time is right to retire and walk away from the game . The fact he did it at home on a high after a great personal series against the SA 's who has heaped a lot of hurt on in the past is a fitting end to a great career , I applauded him for walking away on his terms rather than being forced out or dropped . <p> I reserve comment on the Aussie selection panel but how would him announcing his retirement ahead of the SA series have changed any of their succession planning which quiet frankly has been found wanting and I doubt an extra 3 match head start would have made any difference . <p> EdwardsAnderson on March 14 , 2013 , 12:32 GMT <p> @Mitty2 yes Khawaja is talented and i see him coming back strong in teh 4th test . I do n't think his non selection has to do with Clarke but more with Arthur . Clarke was talking up Khawaja 's attitude at training yesterday so i do n't buy this stuff against Clarke . I personally would have liked to see Khawaja come in the Sri Lanka series to cement his spot but you know what Huss is a legend and i ca n't talk him down . And yes its true , Mary is right , imagine if Hussey had of announced that at the start of the year we would be retiring after Sri Lanka you would have had all these people saying that he should n't be picked because we should be preparing for The Ashes . That 's an interesting point and one that I have a problem with too ... Ashes is still a biennial event , what catches my goat is when teams start to drop players based on a World Cup which is three-four years away . Does n't cut the ice for me . <p> RandyOZ on March 14 , 2013 , 12:28 GMT <p> The third greatest batsman ever , behind bradman and lara . <p> VEXXZ on March 14 , 2013 , 11:56 GMT <p> More of this kind of " honesty " need to come to the foe . Too many things getting sweep under the carpet leaving the public the dark . Let hear the Truth coming from the England camp on KP . <p> mar2000 on March 14 , 2013 , 11:13 GMT <p> Just go to show that you are never " safe " in an Aussie line up . It is always difficult to stay in a team walking on hot ashes . <p> HatsforBats on March 14 , 2013 , 11:10 GMT <p> @B.C.G . ' Hussey is really average in England ' ? You really do n't know much about Hussey 's career in England , do you ? Or do you mean ' against ' England ? Well , he averages 59 against them so I guess not . Oh , I get it ! He was really average in England against England in that one series where he scored two 50 's and a century ! Yep , he 's been the laughing stock of the international cricket scene for years . Is n't it funny that he quit international cricket to spend more time with his family , and now he might play in the IPL and STILL get to spend time with his family ? ! Simply outrageous ! I 'm done now . <p> Cricket316 on March 14 , 2013 , 10:58 GMT <p> Selfish ? Could n't be more wrong guys . Hussey was always a Team Player &amp; an Icon of the Modern Era.I do n't blame Hussey for Retiring early . Hussey went out on his own Terms and with his dignity intact . Before he could be Axed or disrespected by his Administration and growing Egos in the Team.After Ponting left , I do n't think Hussey thought he was treated well , which is clear from his Statements . And yeah , he did n't inform anyone and did the right thing . Otherwise the other men in the squad would come scratching and crawling for his spot in the team &amp; as Hussey , who was n't at his peak at that time , he would have been not included in the Test Side &amp; then CA would have just given him an option of a Test match , as his Farewell . <p> Hussey 's a class act . I have nothing but Respect for Mike Hussey . His contributions can not be overlooked , he has single handedly won many matches for the Ozs on a number of Occasions , the back bone of the Middle Order so to speak . Its a different ballgame now ! ! <p> JohnnyRook on March 14 , 2013 , 10:58 GMT <p> If a guy like Hussey has to resort to a little bit of selfishness to play his farewell test , it only shows Australia 's coach , captain , selectors &amp; CA as a whole in bad light . He was after all dropped from one day side after he retired almost like a punishment for retiring . Selfishness breeds selfishness and Hussey definitely did n't draw first blood . <p> People who are calling Hussey selfish should just practice what they preach and if planning on switching jobs , they should tell so to their boss rightaway . I am still a big Hussey fan and respect him even more now that he had guts to tell the truth . I would be glad if my kid gets even half of Hussey 's honesty &amp; work ethic and I am not even an Australian . <p> whofriggincares on March 14 , 2013 , 10:53 GMT <p> Cant believe how some of the Aussie fans are starting to sound like the fickle conspiracy driven indian fans ( not all of them but plenty ) . Clarke is being made out to be the devil incarnate , not picking the " supremely talented " Khawaja because he does nt like him , what a load of crap that is . Truth is he had an image problem and people began to dislike him , now it wouldnt matter if he made 5 double tons in a year while leading us to back to back ashes triumphs the sooks on here would still find a reason to bag him as soon as something went wrong . It used to be called the tall poppy syndrome now it is known around the world as the " aussie whinge " . we now have a reputation for whinging even more than the poms . Thanks to all the whining sooks on here for that . <p> Mitty2 on March 14 , 2013 , 10:49 GMT <p> @bcg i have a phenomenal belief in this team . The talent is most definitely there , but the selectors are , bluntly , ruining everything . Maxwell , smith and doherty are n't in the best 25 . Khawaja is incredibly talented , but he is not backed up by the selectors and has no confidence as a result . Burns and doolan are developing . I , unlike may , really rate hughes , and am expecting a turn around from him this game because of his ability to adapt . Cowan and warner has been the best opening partnership for over a year . And clarke is the world 's best batsman . <p> but the plethora of fast bowlers is what is so outstanding , and it is seperated and covers all bases : <p> More than branding Hussey ' selfish ' ( who is not really ? ) , the bigger issue is the kind of trust players and Aus administration/support staff/ captain . If a player who has been around for as long as Hussey and has done as much for the game in and outside Aus as he has , feels insecure , it speaks volumes of the way CA is functioning . The fact that Hussey had no faith in selection panel to communicate the matter and in the captain to take him into confidence really tells you why the ' soap opera ' that played out last week happened . Feel Michael Clark is a big part of this problem . Players should be able to talk to their captain , getting his support and should not fear the axe . Symonds , Katich , Watson and a senior player who feared being dropped if he announced retirement in advance . Seems from the outside that there is serious trust deficit , insecurity among players and lack of leadership when Clark is at the helm . <p> manmishr on March 14 , 2013 , 10:22 GMT <p> Hussey has always been a silent assassin whose role was often underrated because he does n't come with a stylish batting sense like Sehwag or Clarke . But his contribution to their batting has always been pivotal . He added good stability to their batting and his ability to score runs with the lower order was a saving grace in many occasions . It will be very difficult to bridge the gap left by Hussey . <p> KingofRedLions on March 14 , 2013 , 10:21 GMT <p> Another provocative headline . Thought I was reading something from News Ltd. for a second . <p> popcorn on March 14 , 2013 , 10:17 GMT <p> Cricket Australia has NEVER HELD sentimental Farewell matches , we know that . Not for Ian Healy , not for Steve Waugh , not for Mark Waugh , not for Ricky Ponting . I am happy that he acknowledges Ricky Ponting as the BEST Captain he played under - I think so too - but others who have NOT played under Punter , now armchair columnists earn by the number of lines they write . Could be trash . How I wish we had a solid nnumber 6 like Huss . <p> RaadQ on March 14 , 2013 , 10:10 GMT <p> Arthur 's textbook-coaching is why Hussey would have been dropped and why his decision , albeit selfish , was the correct one . Learning from other sports , particularly football soccer one realises that bringing in a new team or rotation too much of the squad is doomed to fail , because not enough of the new players have the experience/team chemistry/mental ability to cope in a new environment , so it is best to transition into a new team by trying to groom one player at a time in the environment . You need a fixed , stable set up , and then introduce one person at a time , until he becomes ingrained within the squad , and it re-stablises despite the new edition . If two/three/four etc players need to be included as part of the long run , then this same method must be applied to them in succession , not in one go , which is doomed to fail . <p> Rhygwyn on March 14 , 2013 , 9:57 GMT <p> Uhh ... Hussey not being selected for 2-3 Tests would n't have put Oz in a much better position it is now . Do n't kid yourselves people . There is no easy fix to where the Oz team is at now . Only time can fix it . <p> PhilipGnana on March 14 , 2013 , 9:51 GMT <p> Why not Why not ? Hussey ? Times are such players are thinking of themselves and safeguarding their place , due to the distrust of the selectors . This is going on in most nations . Not being selfish at all , although that is how it seems to be . At the same time , money is key factor in all decisions these days with the IPL and the champions league . Aussies are building a new team and it will take time for them to settle . So is the case for all nations . Having giving his 100% , it will not right to be finding fault with him . Mr.Cricket was called so for a reason . He is Cricket . Without him the Aussies would have been a much poorer team . It is high time that the selectors concentrated on their selection . That is where the root of the problem lies at the moment . Philip Gnana , New Malden , Surrey <p> vumpire-republic on March 14 , 2013 , 9:39 GMT <p> Mike Hussey need feel no embarrassment or shame for his decision ... the current Australian team management are the ones who should feel ashamed and guilty ( once again ) for creating an insecure / untrusting environment . <p> And @Jayzuz , flogging rebuilding or out-of-form teams like SL and India at home did n't make Australia a class outfit again ... it is this tour of India and the next one in England that should be used to guage where Australia are at . At home , Oz themselves have calibrated their pitches over the last 4 yrs to be greener and pacier when teams like India , SL , NZ visit ( although it backfired at Hobart ) and far more benign when SA 's strong pace attack visits ( as seen at Brisbane and Adelaide , and to a degree even at Perth where it was less green than when India visited ) . So do n't begrudge challenging away conditions ... that 's the beauty of Test cricket ( and far more preferable than boring draws like Brisbane 2010 , or Galle 2013 ) . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 9:32 GMT <p> @paul Rone clarke , youve summed up the whole thing . nuff said <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 9:25 GMT <p> Selfish ? I would say that 's more than a bit harsh after all he did for Australian cricket .. Like most other teams he played against , I know many people thought he was a pain in the backside , but only because he always seemed to come good at the right time . A fine cricketer and as far as I know .. a gentleman . And let me say just this , if he had announced his retiremnet earlier and been dropped , then Australian cricket would have been deeper in the mire earlier than it is now . <p> SamRoy on March 14 , 2013 , 9:24 GMT <p> @Jayzuz I know India is not all that good ( bowling is pretty poor ) ; but Australia does n't have a single good young batsman coming up the ranks except Warner , but he has been there for 4 years . That is their biggest problem . Ok , maybe Joe Burns . I will tell you something , England will comfortably beat Australia in the Ashes in England ( they can blank them as well but English weather and a little bit of lackluster performances from England might not allow that ) and are overwhelming favourites to retain it back in Australia . Truth is currently apart from SA and England there are no other decent test team in world cricket at the moment . <p> Kunal-Talgeri on March 14 , 2013 , 9:20 GMT <p> Dear Cricket Australia , this is a plea from a fan who is neither English or Australian : please do what you folks can to bring Michael Hussey back for one last shot -- The Ashes , at least the English edition . One appreciates the youth policy , and the tensions in re-building a team in transition . But for one summer , just look at putting the best XI together and focussing on the battle within the boundaries of a cricket field . Long before Hussey debuted , word was around of how compact a batsman he was . I , for one , believe the 2005 Ashes would have been a little different if he had debuted in that series . That 's history , and there is a glorious summer in store . Please bring back a seasoned batsman to make a difference to your side . One also hopes Hussey leaves behind any insecurities to prepare for a top battle against a very competent English attack . No disrespect , but ' Swann to Hussey ' is a different ballgame from ' Swann to Hughes . ' Hughes may be the future , but the present counts too . <p> Anwar-Lara on March 14 , 2013 , 9:20 GMT <p> Mr Cricket or Mr Selfish ? ? ? ? ? <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 8:56 GMT <p> the Aussies have fallen so far that i doubt it mattered either way what mr Hussey did . <p> TSJ07 on March 14 , 2013 , 8:52 GMT <p> Anyone calling Hussey selfish must be out of his senses . I 'm an Indian and if I have respect for any Aussie player it has to be Huss at no.1 on the list.True performer for not just Australia but whole cricketing world.He came into team so late and still showed his hunger for runs and won many matches for his country . Also his on field behavior was the best of all Aussie players especially when they had some issues with Ponting in charge . Why Huss did not inform earlier probably he knew the current state of affairs in CA and team management under Clark now that recent example has shown us . Good luck Huss for the rest of your life we need more cricketers like you in future which will be rarity . <p> Jayzuz on March 14 , 2013 , 8:42 GMT <p> @rajn , are you suddenly praising India 's selection policies and team culture now that they have won two games - after winning only one of the previous 12 ? Australia lose two games and they are condemned to hell , immediately following a very successful period where they lost only 3 games in 2 1/2 years . These things just do n't add up . Somehow I do n't think Hussey was the sole reason for that success , given that Australia drew both series that he did very poorly in - vs SA ( in SA ) and NZ . I 'll say it yet again , what we are seeing here is a result of poor selections and the fact that India have deliberately set up conditions to suit their team ; and their strengths just happen to be the exact opposite of Australia 's , so that has been extremely easy to do . India are no better than SL , who we just flogged 3-0 . <p> guptahitesh4u on March 14 , 2013 , 8:36 GMT <p> Hussey was not selfish .. in fact he has been honest in accepting the fact . And this incident shows the way CA manages the things . CA might be managing cricket in the same manner since years , however the loopholes were not visible as the team was very much strong . Now , with the retirement of all greats , the loopholes are looking as wide as anything . <p> D.V.C. on March 14 , 2013 , 8:32 GMT <p> If Hussey was n't so selfish Australia could have started losing earlier ! <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 8:31 GMT <p> Some past Australian players of the last few years have been pretty ordinary in their timing to retire .. Hussey is one . Several have simply lied about retiring , stating they were going to play on til etc etc but then jumped ship . I understand the selectors ar hopeless and causing retirements but the players need to think about the team also . <p> discobob on March 14 , 2013 , 8:21 GMT <p> Yes , if Hussey was n't so ' selfish ' then Australia could have taken the opportunity to blood more of the current crop of batters who are doing so well in India . <p> gamespplplay on March 14 , 2013 , 8:13 GMT <p> the best skipper Australia never had ! <p> jmcilhinney on March 14 , 2013 , 8:02 GMT <p> There are those who will , and are , calling Hussey selfish for this . You know what ? They 're right . I do n't have a problem with that though . Hussey has done a great deal for Australian cricket and let 's not forget that his international career started very late in life , so I do n't begrudge him looking after himself when it has n't necessarily hurt the team anyway . I reckon that those same people who are calling Hussey selfish now were probably lambasting CA for dropping him from the ODI team and would have done even more so if he had been dropped from the Test team . The argument is , of course , that getting someone else into the team sooner allows them to settle in sooner and some might think that things in India might not be so bad if Hussey 's replacement could have settled in during a home series . Think again . Phil Hughes was protected from the scary SA bowlers and given a relatively easy home series to settle in and look at him in India , as well as several other experienced regulars . <p> B.C.G on March 14 , 2013 , 7:56 GMT <p> Hussey is really average in England.He struggled in 2009 &amp; then got a ton in the end when everything was lost.No wonder he ditched his country before the Ashes.He says he wants to spend time with his family ; yet when the IPL comes calling he even takes his family with him to India . <p> @Mitty-You quote- " It 's indicative of the dismal and pathetic state of the Australian management and NSP that they 'd consider depriving one of the Best aus batsmen to have a desired home series exit just to blood a young player . " <p> Are you a true OZ fan ? Wheres the Baggy Green pride ? Is a fitting exit better than blooding new players in comfortable surroundings. ? Usman Khawaja may cemented his place in that series instead of Huuss bullying a weak attack.Why coud n't Huss leave with Punter after the SAfrican series ? <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 7:41 GMT <p> " AFTER reading his statement it looks a case of nervous breakdown sort of condition ... Which comes in the life of every man where he feels that he is not competent enough to fight with the situation .... Otherwise I can bet the player of his stannderds would have done fair enough in this Indian tour also .... But revealing thisthis thing at this stage he has given the introduction of his honesty ... HE deserves a salute for this ... Indeed you have to be brave enough to publically accept the truth with sheer honesty ... It needs a courage man ..... Though I personally felt sad after the retirement of Hussey ! " <p> satishchandar on March 14 , 2013 , 7:36 GMT <p> Partly he is correct too . The day he announced his test retirement , he was disallowed in ODI/T20 team with the management thinking that " You are going to retire soon and let us try out different players " still being the best limited overs player for Australia even better than Clarke in that format . What more can u expect from that poor guy . Even such committed guy gets bad treatment .. <p> ozwriter on March 14 , 2013 , 7:20 GMT <p> hussey should have been the captain after ponting. clarke 's most recent fiasco is yet another evidence of his ineptitude as a captain and leader . <p> MrKricket on March 14 , 2013 , 7:20 GMT <p> A lot of the cracks of the past few years were papered over by the form of Hussey , Clarke and ( last season vs India ) Ponting . Now with two of those three gone it 's all on Clarke and he 'd love to have Mr Cricket over there even as a stabilising influence . The team is barely recognisable now , seems to have happened very quickly . <p> Huss had to wait forever to make his debut - they could have given him a bit more flexibility near the end of his career . <p> rajn on March 14 , 2013 , 7:14 GMT <p> The term ' picking a team for the future ' seems cliched . India has been doing that for the past few years where guys like Yuvraj , Raina , Vijay etc have been tried without luck . Now with Dhoni batting at six some of the careers are on the line . The good ones simply come and perform.Dropping Hussey from the ODI 's is more in keeping with the mindset to exercise control than for any cricketing reason . What comes out in this instance is that the players actually know they are up against a management that knows very little about the game . <p> Yuji9 on March 14 , 2013 , 7:12 GMT <p> I think this article is revealing for showing that CA is actively detrimental to Aus 's Test performance ordering batsmen to play pointless T20 tournaments over the priority of Tests . No more need for Argus or to ask the players why they under-perform . CA is about money and Hussey is here testifying to the impact that CA 's valuing of quick cash over Test preparation had on his performance . I 'd like 3 points from Pat Howard on how much he values the baggy green cap and its history and what he is prepared to sacrifice from Test performances to appease business interests . CA undermines Aus 's Test potential more and more - I do n't know what the Champions League is - I thought that was soccer ? - and what on earth is a Chennai Super King ? All that is nonsense and silly and leaves no legacy other than to hurt Aus Test performance with CA the corporate whip behind it all - it 's like ordering a master chef to work in a fast food drive-thru - T20 passes from memory like junk food thru the body <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 7:01 GMT <p> ' the saga of debacle of australian cricket ' ! ! if the most hardworking and most humble cricketer of OZ sqaud like Mike hussey has been saying this , then its hard to imagine wat must be the inner picture of dressing rooms and selection boards : ( cant say , once Clarke retires wat wud be the picture of Australian cricket team.Sadly they 're heading towards the same path as Windies did after dominating the cricket world for many yrs <p> RobTay14 on March 14 , 2013 , 7:00 GMT <p> I would n't have wanted to go to India and then play ten ashes matches either . Good timing Hussey , you 've been a great player . Now you can relax and get drunk . <p> frommoonman on March 14 , 2013 , 6:59 GMT <p> India is the exact opposite - SRT thinks he can never be dropped despite scoring only one hundred ( that too in a losing cause against lowly Bangladesh ) in his last 48 international innings . <p> TommytuckerSaffa on March 14 , 2013 , 6:58 GMT <p> Unreal that ACB dropped him from the ODI and T20 series straight after announcing his test retirement . Shameful . Such a talented batsman . <p> satishchandar on March 14 , 2013 , 6:54 GMT <p> I do n't think he was selfish . Being a modest and honest guy , he terms it as ' selfish ' but certainly i wo n't take it that way . If any player feels he will retire at the end of a series the team management should respect them and continue if he scores runs . Hussey did n't fear bad performance will make them drop him but a statement of retirement itself will make them drop the poor guy . Why should a player be dropped immediately after announcing retirement after the series . It would be such a arrogant management system if a super senior player like Hussey itself is such insecure and feels how rude the management can be . Another bad example from Australian think tank on how the management should n't be . Please publish . <p> Mary786 on March 14 , 2013 , 6:49 GMT <p> Hussey 's decision not to say anything could also represent this obsession we are starting to have with The Ashes . Back when I first starting following cricket the most important Test match was the next one we played . The Ashes was always that little bit more special but you never heard anyone talk about Ashes squads during the middle of a South Africa test series and you would never get anyone say we need to blood young players ready for the next Ashes series.I imagine if Hussey had of announced that at the start of the year we would be retiring after Sri Lanka you would have had all these people saying that he should n't be picked because we should be preparing for The Ashes . There would have been heaps of pressure to drop him and ' blood a youngster ' . Now that he is retired we need to get a long term replacement and for me that is Khawaja from the famous gang of 4 , if only he can get a couple of games to show his stuff . Hopefully we see him in the 4th test . <p> SamRoy on March 14 , 2013 , 6:47 GMT <p> @timohyj If Dravid and Laxman were so selfless they should have voluntarily sat out of the 4th test in Adelaide giving opportunities to Rahane and Rohit Sharma as it was a dead rubber . You are talking about the selfishlessness of Indian Cricket Superstars . I have n't seen one who was utterly selfless except probably Anil Kumble ( but people have questioned his vested interest once he retired from the game ) . <p> Winsome on March 14 , 2013 , 6:34 GMT <p> Gee , Warren Smith , Mike Hussey must feel terribly hurt that you hate him now . LOL . Considering the shenanigans of the Aus mgt and selectors at present , he would likely have been dropped if he 'd let them know . Look how fast he was dumped from the one day cricket team . Who exactly would have taken his place in the Sri Lankan test team ? Khawaja who ( for a variety of reasons ) they wo n't even play now ? Henriques - who is only playing in India because Watson wo n't bowl ? Hussey is quality . <p> RaadQ on March 14 , 2013 , 6:32 GMT <p> Knowing the text-book style of Mickey Arthur n co , they prob would have done so , good on ya Hussey ! <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 6:30 GMT <p> Made him leave early ? Pfft we should still have him in the team now , he s still better than most of the players in the team will ever be . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 6:24 GMT <p> The only cricketer who consistently DOMINATED the oppositions in all three forms of cricket . Scored runs when his team needed them the most . Not like our Indian sachin &amp; sehwag who never delivered in crucial times <p> timmyw on March 14 , 2013 , 6:22 GMT <p> @ - timohyj . Well , what you say is incorrect on two counts . Firstly , Dravid and Laxman made way for two absolute guns who should have been in the Indian side long before they got their chance . After Hussey left look at how Australia have performed . Secondly , Hussey was in brilliant form . Those two guys were n't . Hussey is probably the least selfish international cricketer there was . Gon na miss his strokeplay and sportsmanship . <p> tokoloshe on March 14 , 2013 , 6:11 GMT <p> Hussey is a good man and a great cricketer . I wish him the best of luck even though he caused me much pain ..... ( i am a Saffa ) <p> lillee4PM on March 14 , 2013 , 5:46 GMT <p> Mike Hussey should have kept quiet about his retirement until after the ODI series against Shri Lanka . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 5:30 GMT <p> Strong ACB administration and unbiased selection committee made Australian team achieve milestones one can only dream of . But 2007 onward the story changed completely . Same administration and committee kept on costing them the key players like Martyn , Symonds , Hayden , McGill , Hussey etc and who knows Watto may be . Over confidence on shield cricket and uncompromising attitude towards discipline might have helped them in the past but later on it hurt the team equally . They never had a plan to make smooth transition b/w old legs and young blood . As a result , the team which was nearly impossible to beat , is now sits on 3,3 and 7 in test , odi and t20 respectively and the ranks will surely get even more worse at the end of ind vs aus , pak vs sa and eng vs nz series . In the light of all this I will say Hussey made a very right decision . <p> Mitty2 on March 14 , 2013 , 5:30 GMT <p> It 's indicative of the dismal and pathetic state of the Australian management and NSP that they 'd consider depriving one of the Best aus batsmen to have a desired home series exit just to blood a young player . The contradictions are just phenomenal , they just picked Haddin when there are numerous players who are younger and more talented .. <p> Hussey 's statement on ponting is interesting , Clarke is one of the best tactitions in the game currently , and ponting 's was doubted . The ostensible professionalism of Clarke is a fasad , with Clarke becoming increasingly immature with his relations with others . If you are a bad player but are friends with Clarke , you will instantly be selected ( ie wade , Maxwell ) , and if you are a supremely talented player and better than the other alternatives , but Clarke has an issue with you , you will receive the full brunt of mistreatment ( katich , khawaja .. etc ) <p> And this is why punter is better , the whole fiasco would not have happened if punter was captain . <p> S-Matrix on March 14 , 2013 , 5:27 GMT <p> Waiting for the knives to come out for this selfish cricketer . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 5:26 GMT <p> why is he revealing it now ? .... it will only portray him as selfish .... if he kept it secret then he should have done it forever ! ! ! <p> hycIass on March 14 , 2013 , 5:24 GMT <p> This interview shows that the culture in the team is not right when a retiring champion ca n't announce his retirement for the fear of losing his spot . We need to look at carefully at whether the captain and coach can be selectors as this approach causes a conflict of interest . Hussey should never have been dropped from the ODIs . <p> SamRoy on March 14 , 2013 , 5:14 GMT <p> Always nice to hear from an honest , humble , hardworking man . <p> **25;214;TOOLONG on March 14 , 2013 , 5:04 GMT <p> He was truly a great representative of Australia cricket.His performed remained constant during the best and to some extent in the worst days of austraila cricket.He is truly a Mr. cricket . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 5:03 GMT <p> Hussey 's comments show the issues endemic in Australian Cricket at the moment . Clearly he was 100% right not to announce early as he was summarily dropped following the last test and not given the honor of a farewell tour of Aus for the One day series that his career and , as importantly , current form deserved . All the best for the future Mr. Cricket ! <p> mrmonty on March 14 , 2013 , 4:55 GMT <p> Mike Hussey ( Mr. Cricket ) thought he could be dropped , even in the face of Australia 's talent drought ! Either he was little insecure or he must have inside knowledge of the capriciousness with which most selectors ( of most countries ) work at times . <p> on March 14 , 2013 , 4:49 GMT <p> I wonder if anyone in the ACB hierarchy ever asked him what his plans were regarding retirement , when and what he replied . One of the arguments made by people last year for dropping Hussey ( and Ponting ) was that they would n't be around for the Ashes series , if we want to be number 1 we need to win those series and to do that we need to get some experience into the young players coming in - the counter arguments were ( a ) they 're making runs ( b ) you have to win the current series and ( c ) while they 're still making runs there 's no reason they wo n't still be around for the Ashes .

But that same year his mother , who had persuaded him to consider law over journalism , tragically died . Geary soon found himself back in Sydney going through a difficult time . <p> Disillusioned with the idea of studying for the next four years , he enrolled in the army , passed the interviews and exams , and was just about to go to the next stage when fate stepped in , in the form of a small sugary parcel . <p> " I went to dinner with some friends and I got a fortune cookie that said : ' you would make a fine lawyer for no detail escapes your attention ' , so on the whim of that I gave it another year , " he says . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the law . <p> Beyond his years <p> Sleep-ins worthy of a uni student and late-night bar shifts at the Bondi Hotel were soon replaced by early risings and a clerkship at local Bondi firm James A. Moustacas &amp; Co . <p> " It was back in the days where you could appear in court a lot easier than you can now by asking for leave , " says Geary , who recalls the very practical experience he got at a young age . <p> On one occasion , Geary was in the Supreme Court running an injunction application in a duty judge matter when the judge stopped halfway through proceedings and asked : " How old are you ? ... Are you admitted ? " <p> " I think I was about 20 or 21 years old and I said , ' your honour , I started by asking for your leave ' , and he got a bit flustered and looked down at his associate ... and he let me continue , " says Geary . <p> Someone else who was surprised to encounter him was Daren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , Curry came up against Geary 's tenacious litigating skills when the pair acted for opposing parties . <p> " He impressed me so much I thought he was much more senior than he was and I was shocked when I learned he was only a junior lawyer , " says Curry . <p> At 22 , Geary was asked to join McLachlan Chilton , a firm that advised the " big bad insurance companies " in building law and acted in various cases for the government rescue package for HIH and FAI insurance . <p> Geary , Curry and their team moved across to national law firm Mills Oakley in 2006 , where the work was similar : litigation for insurance companies on construction disputes . Geary also ran a wide variety of commercial litigation disputes for various clients when he was made a partner , aged 28 . <p> Pro bono pioneer <p> The view he had then from level 34 of the glossy Met Centre is slightly different to the one he has now . <p> Hiding in a quiet street in Surry Hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He appears suddenly in the hallway entrance then rushes off again saying : " I 'll be with you in one minute " . <p> When we sit down for the interview , surrounded by piles of case-files and folders crammed into shelves , Geary ca n't help but laugh at the man yelling obscenities from below the tiny barred window . <p> This is a law firm with a twist . In November 2010 it became a ' first-of-its-kind ' commercial legal practice . Charging market rates for its speciality legal services , Salvos Legal funnels the profits straight back into its humanitarian arm -- a free legal program for society 's most needy . <p> " We give them the same level of service as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client and that does n't matter if it 's a one-day case or a one-month case , " says Geary . <p> The fees generated by non-controversial property and commercial advice and transactional work for big clients like Transport NSW , Anglicare , Commonwealth Bank and Colliers International , allow Salvos Legal Humanitarian to serve in more than 260 free cases every fortnight . <p> A combination of advice work , full-time representation and ongoing assistance is provided on a pro bono basis in the areas of criminal law , family law , debt , housing , Centrelink , migration and refugee law . <p> " It 's a lawyer 's mecca , " says humanitarian partner Rizpah Jarvis , who previously worked with Geary at Mills Oakley , " it lets us use all our legal skills to make a big difference .

He credits the Salvation Army for the rare opportunity to turn ad hoc pro bono work into a more sophisticated full-time gig , but it 's unlikely Salvos Legal would exist today without his vision . <p> In the future , Geary sees himself doing a lot more rolling around on the floor with Jake . He can see Salvos Legal operating right around Australia and overseas ( he 's already had talks with Canada , the US , England and New Zealand ) , and other blue-chip clients following those that have been " trailblazers " in trusting the firm in its infancy . <p> He may not have the equity carrot or the harbour view , but for Geary the rewards of giving selflessly to the service of the public are something money ca n't buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lawyers Weekly is the leading authoritative source of independent news , analysis and opinion about the business of law in Australia .

@@156233 @ @ starts with your own employees <p> Maintaining your organisation 's cybersecurity is an extremely complex process and the threats are rapidly evolving . As fast as businesses and organisations work to counter threats and protect against attacks , hackers and cybercriminals develop new attack vectors and systems . Our recent report found that in 2012 nearly every industry , country and type of data was involved in a cybersecurity breach . Nobody can afford to be lax about cybersecurity . In order to protect their data and reputation , all organisations must be vigilant about maintaining robust cybersecurity procedures and policies . The first , and most important , thing to remember in regards to maintaining cybersecurity is that it starts with your own employees . <p> Most of the key security risks are reducible by effectively engaging your employees with the security requirements of your network . Employees are your first line of defence in the cybersecurity battle but they can also be your Achilles heel . If employees do n't understand security policies and procedures , how to mitigate risks , or are not prepared to respond to a security breach , they are potentially contributing , whether intentionally or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undertaking regular security awareness training is essential . This training should be conducted for all incoming staff and existing employees and should be regularly updated based on evolving policies and threats . Engaging your employees in regular training not only keeps security at the front of their minds but also increases the likelihood that your staff will understand and adhere to your security policies . Keep your staff up to date with topical security issues and present them with case studies that prepare them for identifying and dealing with security threats . Every employee is a potential warrior in your cybersecurity plan . Arm them with the tools they need to fight your fight . <p> As cybercriminals develop new , and increasingly complex attack vectors , traditional security weaknesses and simple errors make these attacks easier . Passwords are still one of the main weaknesses in many organisations ' cybersecurity defences . Employees regularly select passwords that meet the most basic requirements of a password policy but are not strong enough to deter attacks . Of all the passwords we examined , the vast majority were eight-characters long ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees still use simple passwords that are too easily deciphered . Amazingly , " Password1 " is still the most common password which is deeply concerning . <p> The best approach to using safe , complex passwords is to move your organisation from passwords to passphrases . Passwords , even those with complex combinations of letters , numbers and symbols , are no longer sufficient protection for your network . Passwords that were once considered almost unbreakable can now be cracked in a matter of hours or days . Passphrases are longer but need not contain numbers or symbols which makes them easy to remember , eliminating the need for them be written down or stored . By selecting a passphrase like " **33;684;TOOLONG " employees can render brute force attacks impractical and instantly improve your security . Educate your employees on the benefits of moving to passphrases as part of their security training , emphasising both the personal and organisational benefits of improved network security . <p> Another simple but important security step is to develop and implement a strong social media security policy . Employees can inadvertently compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By viewing Facebook profiles , researching LinkedIn employee connections and viewing third-party material about your organization and staff , criminals can build detailed profiles of your employees and then exploit this information in phishing campaigns . For example , with some basic social media research a hacker could discover that your employee , Mark , is a golfer and is shown in Facebook photos playing golf with his colleague Patrick . The hacker then titles their phishing email " Golf with Patrick on Saturday " and Mark is much more likely to open the email and compromise your network 's security . These types of highly-targeted phishing campaigns are likely to increase along with the continued expansion of social media . Making your employees aware of the risks and how to reduce them is simple , effective and inexpensive . <p> Regular security code reviews , vulnerability testing and procedural updates are vital to staying ahead of cybersecurity threats and your system administrators and IT service providers must be proactive in identifying and reducing risks .

@@156235 <h> Human Rights Watch <p> The Executive Director of Human Rights Watch , Kenneth Roth , discusses the violence in Syria and what the west can do . <h> Transcript <p> TONY JONES , PRESENTER : To discuss the situation in Syria and whether chemical weapons are now in play , I was joined just a short time ago by Kenneth Roth . He 's the executive director of Human Rights Watch , which operates in more than 90 countries and is in the process of setting up an office in Australia . Mr Roth was in our Melbourne studio . <p> Kenneth Roth , thanks for being there . <p> KENNETH ROTH , EXEC . DIR. , HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH : My pleasure . <p> TONY JONES : Now , we 've seen today both sides of the Syrian conflict accuse each other of using chemical weapons . Do you believe either of them ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well , we just do n't know yet . Human Rights Watch does have people in Syria , but we just have n't been able to confirm this one way or the other . I do think that all this hullabaloo about chemical weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are terrible weapons . It was just 25 years ago that Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurds in Halabja . So we can see the evil done with these weapons . But the idea that , you know , Obama imposes a red line around chemical weapon use , but implicitly a green line if Assad is simply killing people with bombs or scud missiles , there 's something wrong with that . There 's 70,000 people who have died with conventional weapons . <p> TONY JONES : Sure , but if the Syrian regime did start to use chemical weapons , do you believe there would be serious Western intervention ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : I think at this point there would have to be . I mean , Obama 's credibility is on the line . By stating that this would give rise to Western intervention , I think he would have to follow through . That may be why the White House was so eager to deny these claims , but we 'll have to see what really happened . <p> TONY JONES : What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the bloodshed in Syria ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well , you know , there 's not a simple question to ask and obviously there are , you know , many people who are debating should there be a no-fly zone ? , should you arm the rebels ? Some of these things are happening , particularly arming of the rebels . But even short of that , there are I think a number of things that could be done but for Russia 's veto in the Security Council and these things would make a difference . There could be an arms embargo put on Syria , Assad could be brought before the International Criminal Court , or at least threatened with that . These are the sorts of things that would make I think an emotional difference as we try to separate Assad and his henchmen from other people in the state hierarchy . But , you know , Russia 's getting away with blocking this without paying any serious price at all . <p> TONY JONES : Yeah , I 'll come to the in a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect doctrine , which has been applied sporadically and not consistently at all , is actually pretty much defunct now ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : You know , I actually would n't say that because , I mean , clearly it has n't been applied in the case of Syria . When it comes to military intervention , people do have , you know , real questions as to whether that would make things better or worse . Where I 'm actually most disappointed is there are steps short of military intervention that clearly could have been taken that would have made some difference and have n't been taken . So in that sense , the responsibility to protect has been flouted here , but very recently it was enacted , it was used in Libya , in Cote d'Ivoire , in Kenya , so we 've had success stories too . I would not pronounce its burial just yet . <p> TONY JONES : In Syria , action has effectively been blocked mostly by Russia and China . They 've pretty much stopped unified action , partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume they are worried at some stage in the future it could apply to them to some parts of their countries . <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well , you know , the truth is nobody 's gon na be invading Russia or China , so that 's a bit of a false fear . And indeed , both countries acted under the responsibility to protect in the case of Libya . Now they 're outraged because they thought that with the Security Council they were approving simply the protection of civilians , not the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime and to a significant degree , the people of Syria are paying a price for that perceived overreaching on the part of NATO in Libya . <p> TONY JONES : Yes . You talk about the ineffectiveness of the global south , which obviously has disappointed you because these vast populations in these rather large countries should be able to wield certain power and moral suasion , but they 've done virtually nothing here . <p> KENNETH ROTH : Yeah , no , exactly . I mean , I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , all of which very recently sat on the Security Council , all lot which ultimately supported intervention in the case of Libya , but have backed off ; they 've not played a leadership role with respect to Syria . And they 're neutrality with respect to stopping the killing in Syria has made it easier for Russia and China to veto . They in a sense have played defence for Russia and China 's obstructionism . <p> TONY JONES : Now I note that you 're actually setting up an office here in Australia and I presume it 's partly because Australia is now on the Security Council . Is there much more that Australia could do ? What do you expect of Australia ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well , that is precisely why we 're doing it and indeed I was in Canberra last couple of days talking with them about some of the details . But , you know , Australia obviously is n't a superpower , but it is a very significant middle power , and it can I think quite successfully rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superpowers to act . We 've seen that I think most recently in Australia 's efforts to - with Switzerland , to push Russia and China to allow the International Criminal Court to act in Syria . Going back in time it was that kind of middle power effort that was behind the landmines campaign , the campaign to ban cluster munitions . So Australia can have clout if it 's willing to use its public voice , use its diplomacy and build alliances that even the major powers would then have to listen to . <p> TONY JONES : Now , I 'll just broaden this a bit because in a recent essay you raise a very interesting philosophical issue claiming that the failures of the Arab Spring spotlight the tension between majority rule and respect for rights . Can you explain what you mean there ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well I think a good example is Egypt . You 've got the Muslim Brotherhood who suffered quite seriously under Mubarak for decades . Finally they win an election and they do n't want to be told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're in charge , they 're the majority . And what I tried to stress with that essay is the concept of human rights constrains even an elected government . There 's certain things that even a majoritarian government can not do . You ca n't torture people , you ca n't summarily execute people , you ca n't shut down their religious freedom or the freedom of the press and those are restraints that these new majoritarian governments in Egypt , in Tunisia do n't really want to hear , but it 's important to stress that even elected governments have to be limited in order to be called a democracy . <p> TONY JONES : So are you saying , for example , that if a clear majority voted for a government which wanted to impose sharia law , a very strict form of sharia law in one of these countries post-Arab Spring , that that would be undemocratic ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Precisely . In other words , there 's certain limits that even a majority ca n't transcend . If a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the press . We 're gon na just get you off the air and we 're not gon na let you speak , " that would be wrong . You have an absolute right to speak freely ; it does n't matter what the majority says . If they said they wan na torture or they wan na execute you , similarly , you have basic rights . That applies whether it 's sharia or anything else . Even a majoritarian government has to abide by those limits . <p> TONY JONES : Although it is a pretty controversial concept , is n't it , and I imagine that some of those people who are in these majoritarian governments will be accusing you or that thought of embodying cultural imperialism . <p> KENNETH ROTH : Yes , they like to do that , but what I like to stress is that we 're not - for example in the case of , say , women 's rights , we 're not telling women in Egypt that they have to lead a modern secular existence . If they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's will , they can do that . But what we 're saying is if women and many Egyptian women do want to lead a more liberated existence , if they want to be treated as equals of men , if they want to be able to move freely about and choose their job and choose where they 're educated , that 's their right . The West is n't imposing that on them , that 's something that they want to do and it 's actually the right-wing government that would be preventing them . It would be the one doing the imposition . <p> TONY JONES : So is a democracy only a democracy when it has a constitution that somehow embodies universal principles of human rights ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : Exactly . In my view a democracy requires three key elements . Obviously elections . But also rights and the rule of law , and by the rule of law I mean that even if government is subject to the courts and even the government has to abide by the law . <p> TONY JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 10 years since the invasion of Iraq , which was at least partly inspired by the idea of spreading a Western-style model of universal rights and a model democracy in the Middle East - partly inspired by that ? Tony Blair certainly believed that . George W. Bush talked about it . John Howard here in the leadup to the war also talked about it . <p> KENNETH ROTH : Well , I think two big lessons have been learned . One is you ca n't preach what you do n't practice . When the US or British troops went in and tortured detainees , when they used excessive lethal force as a means of force protection and nobody was prosecuted or very few people were prosecuted for these clear war crimes , that sends a signal that the Iraqi Government can do the same thing . And you 're seeing Prime Minister Maliki today clinging to power by torturing people , by subjecting them to kangaroo courts , by all kinds of basic injustices . He learned this in part from the Americans and the British . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humility is important . You remember George Bush went in and through the so-called " de-Baathification " process , essentially eliminated the old Iraqi government . They were gon na build it up from scratch . It 's very difficult to do that . And I think it 's important to remember that now in Syria , that even if Assad topples , it 's important not to eliminate the Syrian state . You know , take away Assad and his henchmen , but you got ta keep that state structure in place , otherwise you have a political void , chaos and all kinds of atrocities that can result . <p> TONY JONES : Finally , going back to this faltering doctrine , I think you could say that it is , of the responsibility to protect , do you think that despite what we 've learnt in Iraq , in Afghanistan and in interventions in other places , that the world will decide that military intervention in certain circumstances to protect people from a dictator still is the right thing to do ? <p> KENNETH ROTH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing to do . I think it was the right thing to do in the case of Libya . It worked very successfully there . If you go back a year before that , the French basically did the same thing in the Ivory Coast , very successfully . Today in Maui , in a version of the responsibility to protect , we see what seems so far to be a successful military intervention . So , I do think that this is a doctrine that continues to have meaning . It 's not gon na be applied in every single country . It wo n't always be a success ... <p> TONY JONES : Would you like it to apply in Syria ? Just briefly , ' cause we 're nearly out of time . <p> KENNETH ROTH : Yeah . Well , the doctrine , yes . What that means in terms of what should be done is obviously a complicated question , but I wish the world were doing more than it is right now to stop the awful atrocities and the killing that proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave you there .

@@156236 <p> 2012 proved to be an unsettling and difficult year for clean energy . High-profile bankruptcies and layoffs plagued many clean-tech companies , overall venture investments retreated in the face of increasingly elusive returns , and the industry was begrudgingly transformed into a partisan wedge issue during the US presidential campaign . <p> But as we highlight in our just-released Clean Energy Trends 2013 report , the fundamental global market drivers for clean technology remain largely intact . Intensifying resource constraints loom large . Unprecedented climate disruption in the US and abroad is putting resiliency and adaptation front and center . And President Obama has signaled a strong commitment to expanding clean energy and energy efficiency in his second term , calling for another doubling of renewable power by 2020 . Similar commitments exist in China , Japan , and the European Union . <p> The report found that lower prices for many clean-tech goods and services , combined with a renewed focus on scalable projects , resulted once again in record annual solar , wind , and biofuels deployment . Against this continued expansion , however , combined global revenue for solar PV , wind power , and biofuels expanded just one percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 . This marginal growth was one of the many consequences of rapidly declining solar PV prices . <p> Some of the report 's key findings include : <p> Biofuels ( global production and wholesale pricing of ethanol and biodiesel ) reached $95 billion in 2012 , up from $83 billion the previous year . From 2011 to 2012 , global biofuels production expanded from 27.9 billion gallons to 31.4 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel . <p> Wind power ( new installation capital costs ) expanded to $73.7 billion in 2012 , up from $71.5 billion the previous year . Global wind capacity additions totaled 44.7 GW ( gigawatts ) in 2012 , a record year led by more than 13 GW added in both China and the U.S. , and an additional 12.4 GW of new capacity in Europe . <p> Solar photovoltaics ( including modules , system components , and installation ) decreased from a record $91.6 billion in 2011 to $79.7 billion in 2012 as continued growth in annual capacity additions was not enough to offset falling PV prices . While total market revenues fell 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trends ' 12-year history -- global installations expanded to a record of 30.9 GW in 2012 , up from 29.6 GW the prior year . <p> Together , we project these three sectors will continue to grow over the next decade , nearly doubling from $248.7 billion in 2012 to $426.1 billion in 2022 . <p> In many ways the shift to cleaner sources could n't be clearer . Renewables and natural gas made up more than 80 percent of new electricity capacity additions in the U.S. in 2012 , with renewables coming in at 49 percent and natural gas at 33 percent . For the European Union , the renewables number is even higher , with solar in the driver 's seat . In 2012 , newly installed solar PV accounted for 37 percent of all added capacity , followed by wind with a 26.5 percent share , and gas at 23 percent . In total , renewable sources represented more than 31 GW of the 44.6 GW of new generation capacity in the EU , roughly 70 percent of all new capacity for the second consecutive year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as actual generation . But even in this regard , clean energy sources have moved past their days as rounding errors and are playing a significant role in meeting electricity demand in a number of global markets . Wind energy in Denmark blew past a 30 percent share of national electricity use in 2012 , and an official target is in place to generate half of the nation 's power from wind by 2020 . In Germany , clean energy already accounts for 25 percent of energy production -- led by wind ( 9.2 percent ) , biomass ( 5.7 percent ) , and solar ( 5.3 percent ) -- and the country is aiming for 35 percent from renewables by 2020 . <p> Clean energy continues to expand as a major economic force , with an increasing focus on deployment of readily available technologies . <p> In early 2013 , for example , Warren Buffett 's MidAmerican Energy Holdings expanded its solar portfolio with a whopping $2 billion acquisition of the Antelope Valley Solar Projects in Southern California , one of the largest utility-scale solar developments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with long-term purchase agreements already lined up with Southern California Edison . ) Google 's recent $200 million equity investment in a Texas wind farm pushed the tech giant 's ownership in solar and wind projects to a combined 2 GW , making it one of the largest renewable energy asset owners . And in January , car rental giant Avis Budget Group announced its plan to buy car-sharing pioneer ZipCar for $500 million , a promising reminder that new ways of thinking can be just as disruptive as new technologies . <p> What all this seems to point to is something we 've talked about for years : the scale-up of clean-tech deployment . And it 's not just the big investors shifting their focus toward deployment . Mosaic , which we highlight in this year 's Trends report , is bringing solar deployment investment opportunities to small investors via a crowdfunding platform , offering annual yields of around 4 to 5 percent . And do n't forget the state-level Green Banks established in Connecticut and announced in places like New York and Hawaii or the prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REITs ) or master limited partnerships ( MLPs ) . <p> Indeed , the near- to mid-term will be all about getting assets in the ground . That is where the action will be . It will take many shapes and sizes , from large corporate investments to crowdfunding and will span the globe from the U.S. to Japan . <p> This new focus on deployable and proven technologies reflects the maturation of an industry that was a mere blip on the economic radar just a decade ago , but today represents the largest slice of new electricity capacity additions in the U.S. and European Union . Even in pro-nuclear China , wind overtook the atom as a generator of electricity in that nation 's power mix in 2012 . To ensure that clean energy keeps up its momentum , however , we 'll need new models and a leveling of the playing field -- and that will take hard work , creativity , and , in the face of entrenched interests , a great deal of steadfast commitment and endurance . <p> Ron Pernick is founder and managing director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two books on clean-tech business trends and innovation , Clean Tech Nation ( HarperCollins , 2012 ) and The Clean Tech Revolution ( HarperCollins , 2007 ) .

It takes a lot more milk to make mature cheeses . <p> Soft cheeses , they 're seasonal , so people really demand them in the season . They get very disappointed when they 're finished . <p> So , yeah , there 's no one particular cheese you can say is the most popular . The whole range just goes . <p> SEAN MURPHY : Most of the awards have been for Cambray 's mature hard cheeses , which are made by Tom Wilde using his mother 's recipes . <p> TOM WILDE , CAMBRAY WA : It 's a lot of trial and error with the sheep milk because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get , and a lot of cheesemakers do n't give their recipes up . <p> But generally mum does quite a good job sort of straight out of the box .

@@178230 <p> If you replaced the two hobos in Waiting For Godot with four semi-naked male playboys , what would you get ? Something not a million miles away from Penelope , a revisionary take on The Odyssey by prolific Irish playwright Enda Walsh . <p> Penelope charts a day in the life of four suitors to the eponymous wife of Odysseus . The great hero been away fighting the Trojan wars for years , and in his absence 100 men have tried to woo her . Having outlasted the rest , the final four while away their time trying to catch Penelope 's eye and rid themselves of the other competitors . Like Godot , it 's a play of waiting , but in place of Beckett 's pared-down prose Walsh gives us something more verbose . Whether the audience will wait as patiently for the story 's conclusion as the characters have is doubtful . <p> The suitors present four distinct models of masculinity : bitchy Dunne , bookish Fitz , aggressive Quinn and the runt of the littler , a young idealist named Burns .

And there is perhaps no hero quite as compelling as Odysseus the trickster adventurer -- just ask James Joyce . <p> As the four men variously strut and cower in the swimming pool , the anxiety of living in the shade of this absent , untouchable model of masculinity is palpable .

It proves to be a good move , as he 's at his hauntingly beautiful best and chooses a brilliant selection of tunes . The Fertile Rock , Exploring The Blue and Love Is A Monsoon are dripping with emotion and spirit , while between songs Bloom is simply charming . He 's such an endearing character , full of Irish wit and charm but far from over the top . He seems genuinely chuffed to be here too . He dedicates City Of Chicago to the Irish expats in the crowd , thanks Mark Seymour for gifting the world such a beautiful song after Throw Your Arms Around Me and tells a tall tale of scoring from Lance Armstrong when needing assistance to get through a performance . His show is like a warm embrace from an old friend and I ca n't wait to catch up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another quick dose of Allen Toussaint is too appealing to pass up and it 's a shame to leave his set of slick New Orleans funk , that opens with There 's A Party Goin ' On , but Tony Joe White is about to hit the APRA stage -- what an embarrassment of riches ! <p> The coolest man in blues ( coolest man in the world ? ) Tony Joe White smirks and points at a couple of audience members as he walks on stage , sits centrestage with his guitar and blazes through an hour of scintillating swamp rock . After a deep and dark Stockholm Blues , drummer Fleetwood Cadillac joins him onstage for the majority of the set , they rip through Undercover Agent For the Blues , Roosevelt &amp; Ira Lee and the raucous Do You Have Garter Belt . He recalls being at Bluesfest for the first time many years ago and being inspired to write The Delta Singer , an incredible song that has real power when heard at this event , runs through a new tune called Hold Up and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polk Salad Annie . <p> The sky looks awfully threatening which lends an extra kind of gravitas to the deep spiritual vocals of Sweet Honey In The Rock . Their onstage demeanour is so very warm and pleasant , the arrangements of the songs are so complex but made to sound so simple and their sound today is unobstructed by bleed from the other tents , making it a real special experience . I Remember , I Believe is aired in tribute to all of our ancestors before a medley of spirituals that were repopularised with the Civil Rights Movement . We 'll have them back anytime , thank you very much . <p> Roger Hodsgon and band sound immense as they open with Take The Long Way Home ; while people raved about his past Bluesfest performance , this evening 's must be on another level for Supertramp fans as the songs are full fleshed out and really amped up . Take A Look At My Girlfriend is a mid-set highlight as a huge crowd of grinning faces soak up hit after hit from the classic rock legend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earle on the small Jambalaya stage and this year 's unmissable back-to-back program is a soul extravaganza featuring two great singers backing up from last year . <p> Bettye LaVette has an excellent new record that she 's released since her last Aussie dates , so there 's plenty from it aired this evening . Her leathery , rugged but tender voice rips through I 'm Not The One and Tom Waits ' Yesterday Is Here while her band ooze class but they have enough grit to make things pop . She laments not being featured on American Bandstand due to the nature of her 1962 single My Man -- He 's A Lovin ' Man before a devastating rendition of Gnarls Barkley 's Crazy ( " I 've been crazy for a long time , " she says ) and The Moody Blues ' Knights In White Satin .

The Staple Singers were such a vital part of the Civil Rights Movement and the fire in Staples ' heart has not died down one iota judging by tonight 's performance ; Freedom Highway sounding as full of life as you 'd imagine it did way back when . <p> People hang off of Staples ' every word in this gorgeously intimate environment , and so they should . We 're Gon na Make It and Eyes On The Prize are both very cool , but it 's the closing I 'll Take You There that sends the audience into an absolute frenzy ; the iconic tune bringing everyone to life and confirming that , no matter how many times we 've seen Staples in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bit of tent hopping is in order next , thanks to the weather being kind enough to hold out on us ; SOJA play a brand of west coast reggae with a mighty big sound and the tent starts to smell pretty funny not too far into their set . A quick spot of The Lumineers shows that their popularity seems to grow by the day , they 've packed out the Crossroads tent but manage to fill it out with their sparse sound quite well . It 's unoriginal but you can understand why so many find it palatable . <p> After last night I simply must hear Dr Burt sing the blues again , so we run to the Cavanbah just as he 's kicking off his set -- which seems closer to five minutes tonight . I implore you to watch this man play if you 're ever given the chance , he 's the real deal . <p> We close out tonight with the fresh rockabilly sounds of JD McPherson and his band . It 's all pretty much as expected , endearing , energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles like Country Boy and Farmer John might give you a bit of an idea about the way their brand of ' 50s inspired rock leans .

Bo Diddley 's Hangin ' Round Here sees bassist Jimmy Southern take the mic , while Firebug and Mona stand out <p> If yesterday I felt tired , today I 'm about to drop . Bluesfest comes home strong today , though ; Paul Simon will be too much fun , Bonnie Raitt will blow minds , more doses of Mavis Staples and Wilco are not negotiable ( could we see a Tweedy cameo in Staples ' set ? ) and how will the big country jam band sound of the Zac Brown Band go with an Aussie audience ?

Photo : James Boddington <p> In Colombia , it 's financing a 66-storey apartment tower that developers declare will be the " first skyscraper built by . . . common people " . And in Melbourne , it could provide specially designed dwellings for groups of like-minded owners , such as pet lovers , elderly gays and lesbians , and weekend rockstars . <p> A spin-off from the concept of crowdfunding ( raising money through social media , most commonly for films and other creative projects through donations ) , " crowdhousing " aims to build innovative and potentially more affordable housing by giving people a say in how they live . Unlike crowdfunding , crowdhousers are not donating to someone else 's project , but contributing to their own . <p> Using this embryonic concept , Melbourne architect Ivan Rijavec has just launched an online platform called Citiniche , targeting owner-occupiers who have a vested interest in getting what they want but who do n't individually have the resources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off the ground . <p> The Six Degrees ' Heller Street townhouse design in Brunswick . <p> The buying power of the group allows it to compete against other developers . <p> Advertisement <p> " It 's a reaction against the crap that 's out there and against every . . . apartment that does n't actually serve the person who lives in it , " Rijavec says . " Instead of confining someone 's lifestyle to a predetermined sense of what is average , what this does is say , ' Do it your way ' . People are sick of going through apartments and getting beige on beige on beige . " <p> On the Citiniche website , groups form around " niches " that reflect their needs or interests , such as pets or gardens . In some respects , it 's like finding neighbours before moving in . Citiniche monitors the design discussions and when enough members demand similar aspects -- rooftops , courtyards , pet-friendly areas -- they propose potential housing projects . <p> Next , niche members will be invited to a workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refundable deposit . Once the project receives planning approval , a place is secured with a full deposit . During the construction process , Citiniche will provide regular progress reports . <p> Among the niches being proposed on Citiniche 's website are multi-unit developments that would cater for " gay greys " , " urban greys " and " urban pet owners " . <p> Rijavec says these groups are just the tip of untapped buyer markets . " I ca n't count the number of people who 've said they 've had problems with permission to have pets in apartments , " he says . <p> Another growing group are older gays and lesbians who are reluctant to move into retirement homes or units that may not be gay-friendly . The first multiresidential development for the ageing gay population is being built 20 kilometres east of Ballarat in Ballan by another developer -- but Rijavec says if any group had a preference for inner-city living , it would be this niche . <p> As ageing baby boomers , gay and straight , demand more than bingo and bowls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , include shared spaces such as meeting rooms , roof gardens or pet-friendly courtyards so seniors could keep the family dog , and be in areas that people want to live . <p> Of course , these embryonic niche projects are only suggestions . Dozens have registered as " supporters " of different niches on the website . <p> Ideas range from the general to the specific . User " Duncan " offers the following idea for an inner-city apartment : " Everyone seems to have a band ; people hate moving the equipment around . Why not provide soundproof rehearsal rooms in the basement with a booking system ? " <p> On the page for the " urban loft " niche ( proposed price : $415,000 for two bedrooms ) , user " bashton " suggests : " It would be so great to live in a place with original factory/industrial finishes . " <p> Businessman Marcus Rose , 59 , said he was drawn to Citiniche after a failed search for an inner-city apartment that would allow him to " phase shift " while retaining the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement is a large urban garden , with lawn and trees , extending from the apartment 's living space . He believes there will be enough people like him , with significant home equity , to invest in a complex of larger-than-usual apartments . <p> " I want a sense of being on the ground , but you 're not -- like a sky garden . I like views , and as the city becomes more built-up , I want to see the urban landscape , the sky , and be brought up off the ground . So how do you reconcile those things ? I think you can . " <p> But apartments he has inspected are small and sterile , and he says the response from real estate agents to his needs has been " glib " . Their best suggestion is " we should develop it ourselves " . <p> Yet as Victoria 's Government Architect Geoffrey London points out , Citiniche and other " crowd architecture " groups could allow ordinary people to effectively develop their own townhouses or apartments . ( It 's easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling . ) <p> London describes Citiniche as a " cracker of an idea " -- a kind of " housing dating bureau " that " allows people to get together and use their own resources in such a way that there is no single entity that is taking the risk " . <p> " It 's going to introduce a degree of diversity of housing types in the marketplace , a degree of choice for buyers in the medium-density sphere , and it 's going to bring good design into the marketplace , where in many respects it does n't really exist . " <p> It 's of course impossible to tell how committed the potential owners who have registered on the Citiniche site are , but the idea is taking root . <p> Internationally , crowd architecture concepts include Colombia 's 66-storey BD Bacata apartment tower , which is under construction and which developers claim has helped poorer people buy apartments . <p> In Rotterdam , the attractive timber Luchtsingel pedestrian bridge is being realised through crowdfunding . The first phase has already been built , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer the bridge " , keeps the money flowing . Donors are also promised their name engraved in large letters on one of the bridge 's thousand planks . <p> Another similar example is New York 's Lowline , an underground version of the hit urban park project the Highline , which used Kickstarter to help fund a public park in a disused subway station . <p> Unlike Lowline and the Rotterdam bridge project , Citiniche projects are not benevolent , but encourage online contributors to collaborate to buy something for themselves . <p> Rijavec says his company will focus on developments in Victoria first , although the project is fundamentally " borderless " and he has approached architects and developers in Sydney , Perth and Adelaide . <p> Citiniche also intends to avoid one of the major pitfalls of international crowdsourcing design site Arcbazar . Under the Arcbazar model , a client writes a brief , posts it online and designers around the world work on it . The client then selects its favourite design and pays the agreed fee . But the risk for designers is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get any recompense . <p> Citiniche intends to reduce this risk by expanding those commissioning the brief and limiting those solving the design problem . In Melbourne , it has registered architects including Jackson Clements Burrows , BKK Architects and Robert Simeoni Architects . <p> Tim Jackson , of Jackson Clements Burrows , says Citiniche will give developers confidence to look at new markets and housing models . " The development world becomes generic very quickly , " he says . <p> " Everyone starts copying the most recently successful one . Citiniche is a way of throwing something into the mix that hopefully has n't been thought about . Not only might it push the typology , it might also suggest areas of the city developers would n't normally have considered . " <p> In a recent , celebrated example of developing an unusual residential site , James Legge , of Six Degrees Architects , transformed a contaminated brown-field site in Brunswick into a row of three-storey family townhouses with a private community park as a substitute for backyard space . <p> " It was a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet people still have a six-foot wall around them , so you end up with these pokey courtyards and pokey backyards that are not that usable and the outlook 's not that great , " says Legge , who also lives in the development with his family . ( Friends and friends-of-friends also bought in , with prices around the $800,000 mark . ) " I 'd spent a formative period in England and the commons idea appealed to me , " he says . <p> The townhouses are set back from Heller Street with a park open to the entire neighbourhood in between . In the give-and-take between private and public space , each house has a patio at the front while the undulating park landscape provides privacy . <p> Residents include Sally Thomas and her partner , artist Matthew Sleeth , who wanted to live in Brunswick but did n't want to renovate or buy a comparatively expensive weatherboard house with a backyard . <p> Through a real estate agent they met Legge , whose work they admired . Only afterwards did they realise they were being interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they benefited from buying off the plan , and appreciated the house 's design , which did n't waste any space and has " great sound insulation " , the biggest bonus was the community itself , Thomas says . <p> " A lot of my friends are jealous because they like the idea that you can just send your kids out to play , and having other kids to play with is a big bonus , " she says . " The friendships are like having cousins . It has that vibe . People who you know so well , because you see them all the time . " <p> While the kids come and go , everyone is quite respectful of each other 's privacy , she says . " A lot of people might have been scared off by not having their own backyard , but for me it works better to have common space and share . " <p> While not everyone has architects for friends , it is hoped the genesis of such a community ( effectively , Legge recruiting a bunch of mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " In a way , Citiniche is reverse-engineering what we did at Heller Street , " Legge says . ( That is , instead of developing a project that attracts like-minded people , like-minded people help create something that suits them . ) <p> " Most high-density housing is appalling around Brunswick 's Sydney Road and Carlton 's Lygon Street , and essentially completely developer-driven , " he says . " It 's trying to cram as much of it in as possible . What needs to happen is an exploration of all sorts of models for increasing the urban density . <p> " If you get everyone involved and they commit , all of a sudden you are in the same environment as the developer , looking for much larger pieces of land that are less expensive per square metre . " <p> But will Citiniche make properties more affordable ? Tim Jackson warns against unrealistic expectations . " Some communities could be quite naive in terms of their understanding of what they can get for a certain amount of money , " he says . <p> Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being vastly cheaper . After all , the niches will be competing for inner-city land against national developers dedicated to maximum yield and efficiencies of scale . But Jackson hopes that savings made by the developer on marketing and display suites could be passed on to buyers . <p> Says Rijavec : " My instinct is it will bring down prices , particularly if a project is totally subscribed . On the developer side , the risk is substantially reduced , and on the consumer side , they 're getting something for less than on the open market because of the buying power of a group . " <p> Yet while saving money is desirable , it 's clear the emphasis is on having more control over the project and getting something closer to individual requirements while achieving the vaunted " good design " . <p> Developer David Napier , executive director of Digital Harbour at Docklands , is keen to use Citiniche to produce something out of the ordinary for the 80 proposed apartments between La Trobe and Dudley streets . <p> " From our point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The market has a lot of ' same old same old ' developments which are virtually just repetition . . . what this is talking about is something that will actually cater specifically to the needs of the end owner-occupier of the unit . That appeals . " <p> An architect with 25 years ' experience as a developer , Napier is keen to explore an alternative approach to the development of Docklands apartment towers that might include low-rise developments with green roofs and parklands that allow light into the precinct . <p> But he is aware that consumers are also likely to have a " wait and see " approach . " You have to get the numbers . That 's the biggest challenge for Citiniche . How deep is the market ? How many are going to relate to this ? It 's untried here and how many people are willing to put down a deposit and to conform to . . . a set of criteria which may not be 100 per cent what they want ? <p> " If we felt it was 80 individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in the air and say , ' That 's not possible -- go and buy a house ' .

This is a major taboo for Cthugans because the Nyarlathotepians have been enemies for years and are meant to hate one another .

@@214234 <h> You Do n't Need Combat To Have A Good RPG <p> When it comes to gaming , RPGs represent the pinnacle of storytelling with games like Final Fantasy VI , Chrono Trigger , Mass Effect , Skyrim and Earthbound . While many games from many different genres do indeed have compelling stories , storytelling , more than any other facet , is what RPGs are known for . <p> But despite this , RPGs always seem to tell the same basic narrative : a group of heroes comes together to " save the world " from a powerful villain . Sure , sometimes it 's a fantasy setting and sometimes it 's a sci-fi one , but the basic story is almost always the same . Why ? <p> What seems most likely is that this story framework allows for a fighting system , be that a shooting system like Mass Effect or a turn-based system like in most JRPGs . <p> But why must RPGs be centered around fighting ?

The answer is simply " no . " And as if to prove this , RPGs are slowly but surely breaking out of this narrow combat-necessary mindset . <p> Another recent RPG , Deus Ex : Human Revolution even includes a trophy/achievement as reward for players who do n't kill anyone in their playthrough of this action RPG -- despite the standard save-the- " X " story format . <p> Currently , Japan-only RPG Fantasy Life allows players to level up through non-violent professions like tailoring or fishing at the same rate as fighting monsters in the field -- giving the player full choice is which way of growing stronger they prefer . <p> Perhaps the best example of what RPGs could become without the crutch of combat-based gaming is 2011 's To the Moon . There are no fights in the epically moving and thought-provoking adventure RPG . At one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have battles . In a scene where a squirrel is encountered , the player character readies to attack it in standard JRPG turn-based fashion -- only to be admonished by the other characters for preparing to hurt a defenseless animal . <p> Recently , the teaser image for the second game in this series satirized this point by portraying the characters from To the Moon fighting a horde of zombies on the moon -- something completely antithetical to the emotional narrative . <p> Is combat fun in RPGs ? Sure , it can be -- especially if the system is engrossing and does n't end up feeling like busy work . But we 've reached the point where the need to include combat in RPGs is stunting the growth of the genre and holding it back from the wonders the genre is capable of producing . There is far more out there than just heroic narratives centred around combat for us to experience . <h> Tags <h> Discuss <p> Agreed .

For some reason it really grated to see realistically proportioned and voiced characters standing absolutely still in a line while enemies beat up on them . As characters get more realistic I suppose the suspension of disbelief is slackened . Besides which the battles were slow and pretty dull . When Final Fantasy was in its prime ( FF6-10 ) the good battles were exciting and nail-biting affairs . <p> But I 'd love to see a big-budget RPG where killing stuff is simply not necessary . <p> I 'm not sure a pacifist run in Deus Ex really counts as no combat seeing as you 're just replacing death with sleep .

RPG in it 's current form does n't really even stand for role playing game . It stands for the concept - the typical hero ( likely amnesiac ) , fighting to save the world . In these games the battles support the storyline . <p> However , as a literal Role Playing Game , a game in which you play a role ( wait ... is n't that every game ? ) , any game in the world could be an RPG .

Already , the contribution to global warming of our exported coal when burned in overseas power stations is at around 140 per cent of domestic emissions production on 2011-12 figures . Yet this physical reality is a political taboo . <p> The response of Environment Minister Tony Burke to last week 's boarding of the coal ship could not have been more telling . Burke said , " Our position is that we dealt with the issue of Australia 's emissions when we introduced the carbon price . " <p> The Minister 's position is indeed a fair and truthful reflection of the Commonwealth Government 's view on the matter , but like all political spin , his words concealed a deeper untruth . <p> It is logically untenable to claim to have " dealt with the issue of Australia 's emissions " for so long as nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . According to data assembled by the Commonwealth Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics , over the next five years the coal industry plans to add new thermal coal mining capacity equivalent to twice 2012 exports . <p> The planned increase of Australia 's coal industry is the second largest of 14 major fossil fuel growth enterprises globally which would collectively almost certainly push the world beyond two degrees of warming . <p> In a liberal democracy , citizens confronting a wrong are presented with a range of lawful options for making their views heard . These include rights under administrative law and such other procedural and legal mechanisms as may exist , campaigning through the media and in the community , political lobbying , and electoral participation . <p> Despite years of committed effort by thousands of Australian citizens , all available lawful options have proven wholly inadequate and ineffective for reining in the coal industry which is hell-bent on reckless expansion . <p> In Queensland , for example , what is ostensibly due process is leading to the construction of up to nine new coal mines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Coast . The plain truth is that the existing regulatory process does not function to prevent coal mines from being built , so much as legitimise their construction , regardless of the climate and other environmental consequences . <p> It is the gulf between the scale and immediacy of the threat posed by the radical expansion of the coal industry and the absence of effective lawful options to address the hazard that creates the conditions in which civil disobedience is justified .

Some shoppers are even using bricks-and-mortar stores as a showroom for an online purchase , not necessarily tied to that particular business . Smartphones have made this whole process " point-and-click " by enabling shoppers to scan a bar-code to look up a product 's details and then return a price comparison tailored to their location . Not surprisingly , with few exceptions , the retail industry in Australia has reacted to this phenomenon by either pretending it does n't exist or by trying defensive strategies like charging fees to shoppers who come into a shop to browse . <p> Retailers Gain from Technology Too <p> The salad days of being able to charge the uninformed public a premium over your competitors are very nearly over . But the retail future is not all gloom . The use of smartphones in stores offers businesses an opportunity to interact with customers in a range of ways that go beyond simply putting informed salespersons in their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now more likely to rely on their phones for information than talk to a sales representative in person . This is again not surprising as another common bugbear of shopping is the experience of store assistants giving you information about a product that they clearly are n't that familiar with . <p> In fact , according to Nielsen , 80% of US smartphone owners have used their phone for " shopping-related " activities . The most frequent activity was finding the location of a store and checking the price of a product , followed by researching items and reading reviews . <p> Social Shopping <p> The Nielsen report revealed another aspect of the way we shop and that is that we have n't as yet moved wholesale to a " social mode " of shopping . Only a small percentage of shoppers actually write a review about their purchases or use social media to comment on their purchase . Other reports have highlighted that websites and other more " traditional " forms of information are still used more frequently than social media when making decisions about what to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being purchased . <p> Virtual Stores <p> There are companies that are taking full advantage of the flexibility offered by the mobile phone by creating virtual stores .

In Australia , Woolworths launched virtual stores at train stations in Sydney and Melboune earlier this year . <p> Hybrid Approaches <p> Woolworths is innovating in another area by trialling free WiFi in their stores . For Woolworths and other companies that have built an effective onlin strategy , it does n't matter whether shoppers in a bricks-and-mortar supermarket buy from the store or online and making it as easy as possible for the shopper is an effective strategy of making sure that purchase stays with your business . <p> This is an approach also taken by Apple who actively use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . <p> The added benefit of this for the retailer of course is all of the information that can be gleaned from what the shoppers did whilst attached to the wireless network . <p> Retail Tech : Who Wins ? <p> The use of mobile technology when shopping will become more pervasive in the near future as it is another example of a technology use that is being driven by the consumer that will force even the slowest of businesses to respond . Retailers themselves will be able to use information about competitor 's pricing to become smarter about how they bring more value to their customers . It really should n't be up to a customer to point out to a shop owner that they are charging twice the price of their next-door neighbour for the same product . 
@@245234 <p> Neither side of politics is likely to stop live animal exports.AAP/Theron Kirkman <p> The evidence of gross cruelty in Egyptian slaughterhouses that has just come to light underlines that while some progress may have been made , the problems in the Australian live export trade are far from solved . <p> They probably will never be and I personally believe the trade should cease . But neither side of politics will ever embrace that . All up , it is worth about $1 billion annually . <p> Obviously , it is regarded as core business by the Coalition . Labor , after it received a battering over its temporary ban on the trade to Indonesia - when Four Corners in 2011 aired shocking footage of cruelty to Australian cattle slaughtered in that country - would not contemplate scrapping the trade . <p> So it has to be a matter of second best options . Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig insists the provisions that he and the industry have put in mean that there is these days a quick reaction to and action on complaints . <p> He says he takes very seriously the evidence from Egypt , accepting that the cattle were almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , after Egypt objected to the use of growth hormones , but several thousand are still in the country from earlier exports . <p> Egypt has form .

Since February 2010 , more than 100,000 cattle have been exported to Egypt . <p> Ludwig says he is willing to put in more regulation for the Egyptian market if that is necessary . <p> " We 'll work with the Egyptian authorities " , he says . Already the Australian ambassador to Egypt has been put on the case , and the Egyptian ambassador in Canberra has been contacted . <p> One disturbing aspect of the live export trade is that those who discover breaches do n't seem to be Australian officials or the Australian industry but animal welfare activists , notably Animals Australia . <p> " There is n't a regulator standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These things do happen . It 's like going through red lights . The police are n't there every time .

One apparently worthy proposal is for an independent Office of Animal Welfare . This was endorsed by the ALP national conference in 2011 , and developed by the caucus working party that had been set up in the wake of the Indonesian atrocities . <p> Federal MP Melissa Parke , one of the caucus activists on the live export issue , outlined to parliament in February how such an office would work . ( Parke and Kelvin Thomson , another leading voice on animal welfare , have been muzzled by their appointments this year as parliamentary secretaries ) . <p> The office would " take the lead role in managing the development of national animal welfare policy " , she said .

@@245235 <h> Premium wines market a winning formula <p> How is Penfolds Grange able to sell a bottle of wine for over $700 ? By not marketing itself like a bottle of wine , writes Adam Ferrier . <p> Wine is funny . Normally it does not follow the normal principles of marketing . <p> Marketing is a mass-market game . You take a product , and you charge a price and you encourage as many people as possible to consume that thing . For most categories this works fine , however wine is a bit different . <p> If you charge a high price for wine , and lots of people start to drink it then what will tend to happen is the wine will be perceived as cool for a while , then as the masses appropriate it , it will lose its cache , and go out of style , thus losing its ability to charge a premium price point . So , what we tend to see is a series of wines lined up and willing to be flavour of the month , get mass exposure , and then fall out of favour as quick as they rose . <p> Couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people can not tell the difference between the taste of a good bottle of wine and an expensive one . In fact quite the opposite . There is an effect in marketing called ' the price placebo ' which means ' the more you pay the better it is ' , with wine , the more you pay the better it tastes . It 's been well proven both via self-report measures , and by strapping peoples brains into MRI machines . <p> There is of course one notable exception to the wine rules of non-marketing and that is the Penfolds Grange Hermitage . Every release is met with anticipation and ever-increasing popularity and prices . <p> Why ? Because Grange has transcended wine . Most people who purchase Grange - are not , I believe , purchasing a wine to drink , instead they are purchasing a gift , or an investment , or both . <p> Gifts and investments create value in a different way than wine does . Here are the four steps to how Grange creates a value that justifies such a price premium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and there is n't much of it we tend to value it more . We were born with this innate desire to value what 's limited ( it would have been a very useful survival mechanism back in the day ) , and it 's an extremely strong driver of behaviour . The overt marketing and ' release date ' , give the impression that people have to ' get in now ' to get this limited release Grange , or there wo n't be any left . Of course this is n't true ( it 's available all year round ) , it 's just the hype creates a fear of missing out , and this increases value . <p> Consistency : However , what Grange has done is balance scarcity with consistency . We know that there 'll be releases in years to come , and that Grange has been doing this for many years . Therefore , the brand has a sense of familiarity , yet has retained exclusivity ( via scarcity ) . If the biggest predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour that it 's not going away . Grange has been a constant in their lives , this is despite the wine having many owners over the years such as Southcorp , Rosemount , Fosters , and now Treasury . One must give due credit to all of these companies for not stuffing up this wonderful brand . Consequently , if people buy Grange there is always going to be a demand . <p> Tangibility : We value what we can hold . A similar purchase in shares or bonds , or an overseas holiday will not have the same value as something we can hold and touch . Grange , is a relatively easy-to-touch brand , they conduct Grange clinics , and encourage people to come along and get their Grange refilled when it suffers from ullage . <p> Universal Appeal : Grange is now pretty popular , and has achieved a level of general familiarity and acceptance . If people see Grange on the wine shelf they know it 's a very good bottle of wine , and that it 's valuable . Thus there is a status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more obscure wines . This status guarantee works equally well sitting on ones wine rack aging ( and increasing in price ) as it does as a gift . <p> So , at $700.00 a bottle Grange is a ridiculous wine purchase . It does not taste 20 times better than a standard bottle of wine , in fact it does n't taste any better than a normal bottle of wine at all . <p> However , despite this I 'll be buying a few bottles of Grange this year as I do most years . Why ? Because it 's a great investment and an even better gift . <p> Adam Ferrier is a founder of Naked Communications and their global head of behavioural sciences View his full profile here .

In the past decade or so procedural crimes have become these carbon copies of each other , spawning leagues of CSIs , Law and Orders and NCISs . <p> However , this year we 've seen somewhat of a different type of crime show emerge from the typical American procedurals , shows that could -- at a glance -- be called them , but they truly have an astounding amount of depth and breadth to them . These shows are Hannibal and Elementary . <p> While these two shows deal with episodic crimes , wherein the criminal is usually caught at the end of the episode ( even though a larger nemesis is part of a fuller story arc ) , there are far more to the shows than your usual straight-jawed cops and fantastical scientific evidence . <p> To be fair , the fact that Elementary has Sherlock Holmes ( Jonny Lee Miller ) as a lead character , already gives it a leg up .

So on occasion , we 'll be doing what we can to lighten the mood . OK ! Let 's get sad everyone , all the time ! <p> HEXMetro Last light continues the story Artyom , and the struggle to survive beneath a post apocalyptic Moscow . The bombs went off around 20 years ago , leaving the surface uninhabitable , and the metro tunnels are the last stand for the human race . Everyone is cold , hungry and disease is infesting the community . The world is full of decay topside , but out surviving the radiation is n't the biggest problem . There 's bandit gangs , other city factions and even Nazi 's who are constantly causing unrest . On top of that , a whole host of mutated creatures are after you ... Aww kittens ! ! <p> BAJOI thought we 'd put some cats in to lighten the mood . <p> HEXGreat idea ! <p> BAJOThis story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . And Artyom has a strange connection to it . This story is n't based on the sequel 2034 to the 2033 book that the last game was based on . But the Author has apparently been working with developer on this . The dialogue is mostly quite interesting and there are some very dark themes . There 's a constant stream of commentary from characters and your comrades as you go from action sequence to story moments . <p> HEXYeah and it is an atmospheric and immersive world to be in and like we said , super depressing all the time . Even the loading screens need to cheer up a bit . <p> BAJOYes as you wander the underground tunnels , every single character has some morbid and long tale of woe . AWW kitty ! ! ! Aww ! In fact I 'd argue most of this game is designed to force you to watch the stories of those around you play out . It does this by slowing you down constantly , and taking control away from you . This game redefines slow walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city areas , and some other sections too you 're pulled down to the pace of , an old man going up some stairs . <p> HEXYou 're often walking behind someone who you ca n't walk past to speed things up . And every NPC walks very slow too , so you 're often waiting for them to catch up or finish their dialogue . And I do n't think it 's a loading device . Some wo n't mind this as much as us because it is mostly interesting subject matter and dialogue , but not being given the choice to ignore or move on quicker , verges on indulgent design . <p> BAJOYeah more and more we 're seeing games now days tell the story around you , which is perfect because you have control of what you want to do , even in heavily scripted linear games like this . And they have tried to do that here , but that constant pulling on the reins really hurts the game overall . And sometimes they even throw cob webs at you to slow you down further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conversation by 3 NPCS as one told the other her husband was dead . OHHH just let me out ! <p> HEXThe good news is , the action is thrilling ! Weapons handle perfectly , and there is solid strategy in the weapons you pick , how you customise them , and how you manage your reloads . There are times you 'll need to switch weapons quickly to fight off nasties rather than reload , and actually all the gunplay is satisfying . <p> BAJOI especially liked the quad barrelled shotgun ! You can never have too many barrels . <p> HEXThere 's a focus on stealth too . And you 'll enjoy taking out lights and sneaking about in the dark . It is a very forgiving mechanic , so I think they 've softened that a little from the last game . <p> BAJOAmmo is nice and scarce too , especially if you forget to buy some when you 're in town which I did all the time . But even fully stocked , you 'll often cheer for joy when you come upon a convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't revolutionary but I liked the way they react to your presence . <p> HEXI liked the way they take hits as well . Also there 's toxic air everywhere , and if you run out of filters , it 's death . I love the sections where you need a mask Bajo . Wiping the grit and dirt away from your face , rushing to the next section , the muffled breathing , it adds so much to the atmosphere . <p> BAJOThere are a handful of confusing ' what do I switch or click ' moments that got me killed a few times , such as in this rail car section so I think they should have done a better job on direction because you essentially have a time limit before your mask runs out . At one point I got stuck at a checkpoint , running out of air with no filters . Each time I loaded I 'd die within seconds , and I had to restart the entire chapter . <p> HEXI did n't mind that so much .

There are some spectacular set pieces and excellent hallucination moments . We played on console , and visually it 's a bit washed out . There are some nice areas of contrast , but it 's still one of the brownest games we 've played in a long time . <p> BAJOYes I 've almost missed brown games Hex ! Not quite though . There is a lot of detail though and some areas have slick effects , such as in the fiery catacombs . <p> HEXOne thing I was really disappointed with is how the women are represented in this game . And that stripper scene was full on , pointless , and just a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't actually serve any purpose in the narrative either , I 'm getting a little tired of strippers scenes to be honest . <p> Just sitting down and paying money to watch someone dance , what 's the point ? <p> HEXYeah . And I do n't think I 'm being prudish about it . I have no issue when a strip club is a setting for a particular scene to take place , and there 's some chicks in the background or what have you . But having them full-on grind up against you when they 're naked with their boobs out , I just think that 's unnecessary . I did find it a bit weird that you were so involved in what was going , with so much dialogue , but your character has no voice . Normally this is n't much of an issue but it did make for some pretty strange interactions . <p> BAJOYeah , essentially no one can ask you a question unless it 's rhetorical . All the other voice actors do an excellent job in creating that end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can put up with the slow pace of everything , it 's one of the more different linear shooters out there and reminds you of what is so great about the likes of fallout and stalker . <p> BAJOThere is a lot to like here , especially those end of day 's hallucination flashback moments . And I tried so hard to get into this game Hex . But in the end , I felt like you 'd have one good fight per hour , and the rest of the time was walking around to slow dialogue or sitting on some sort of cart or raft . But there are truly exciting and unique moments in this game , and I did n't regret playing it but I 'm still going to give it 6 out of 10 kitten videos . <p> HEX Even though the characters all blend together towards the end , last light felt like sitting down and having a drink with an old comrade and the action really ramps up about 7 hours in .

It 's appropriate because one of the finalists is the New Jersey Devils ' Martin Brodeur , the only active goalie whose NHL career is older than the video game . <p> So , once again , it 's time to check on who is left in the league who appeared in one of console sports gaming 's greatest titles .

Brodeur had been called up for four games in the 1991-1992 season for four games when the New Jersey Devils ' two starting goalies were hurt . The next year , he was back in the AHL before returning for the 1993-1994 season . <p> So he even though he 's 41 and played in 20 seasons , he still does n't belong to that exclusive fraternity of the Active Players in the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teemu Selanne , Roman Hamrlik and Jaromir Jagr , all of whom logged time in the playoffs .

@@293239 <p> AusGamers was invited out to a pre-E3 press event for Bethesda and caught an early glimpse of The Evil Within from survival-horror mastermind , Shinji Mkami and his newly crafted studio , Tango Gameworks . Read on for our full thoughts ... <p> While Shinji Mikami might be attempting to bring survival-horror back to its roots with The Evil Within , he 's also certainly breaking convention . For one , his new game is built on a heavily modified id Tech 5 engine , a benefit to now being an official part of the Bethesda umbrella and different for being Western-developed , and for another he 's playing with horror in ways no other survival-horror title has ever attempted . <p> It 's not specifically groundbreaking , but there 's a mysterious element to The Evil Within that is likely the scariest part of the game . Out at a pre-E3 event in Los Angeles , we were shown this in short-form : at one point the game 's protagonist , Detective Sebastian Castellanos , is avoiding the undead by descending to an already creepy basement level of an equally creepy cottage . Once there , however , a shift in visuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hallway with a single door . Sebastian turns to go back the way he came but another distortion comes and before we know it he 's enveloped in a sea of blood that spews forth from the newly planted door at the end -- a clear nod to Kubrick 's The Shining . The blood vanishes as quickly as it came and now Sebastian is standing in the dilapidated corridors of the Beacon Mental Hospital -- the location in which his nightmare first began . Ahead of him , at the end of the corridor , is a room with a single light source highlighting a bodybag , like some horrifically directed stage show . But this is survival-horror and with the path behind seemingly blocked off , Sebastian is drawn to the spotlight like a moth to flame . <p> I do n't need to tell you that , right on cue , the bodybag turns to bodybags , plural , before exploding into a fountain of blood and the four-armed creature introduced to the world in The Evil Within 's debut live-action cinematic trailer pulls herself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to run in one of the game 's escape sequences , of which at this point we 've seen two , offering up a uniquely scary camera angle and contextual trip and vault system . Our hapless detective struggles to move over static gurneys and other impediments before he fully trips and the monster bears down on him . Struggling to deal with the horror before him , Sebastian fights back but his defense is more akin to a kitten fighting off a lion , and with a swipe of her clawed hand the demo ends and we 're left gasping for air . <p> Of course I 've only described the end of what we were shown , but for the purpose of getting deeper into what 's on offer here than a simple breakdown you 'll be able to read everywhere else from those who attended , I 'd rather just leave you with the same sense of dread I was left with when all was said and done . And as I mentioned in the opener , the game is n't specifically breaking any new ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days taking a more action-oriented route , it 's the horror component to The Evil Within that is its strongest point , a conveyance I hope to successfully relay throughout this piece , because it really is the most lacking element to the modern interpretation of the genre . <p> " So since Shinji Mikami defined the genre , it 's been a long time , " says Tango 's Masato Kimura who serves as a producer on The Evil Within . " So the definition of the genre has broadened ; it 's widened and has evolved a lot . <p> " But the very important things for survival-horror are fear and of course ' scare ' ; how scary it is -- those are horror elements , and you have to be able to overcome that fear , or beat that fear , " he adds " So the balance between those two is very important . We Tango have our ideal balance of those two but modern horror games have a difference of opinion about those balances . " <p> It 's true that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern horror games , which could be attributed to an overall shift in the challenge of most action titles : regenerative health , metre to metre checkpoints and seemingly unlimited ammo , all of which have irked most hardcore gamers , but in the this space , specifically , it negates the point of the genre in the first place . To hear that Tango not only recognise this , but actively stand against it is a sign the studio want to take it in new ( and old ) directions . <p> There are simple things they 've done here too . For example , early on in the piece Sebastian awakens to find himself strung upside down amidst a veritable meatlocker of other unfortunate souls whose fates have already been signed , sealed and quartered . That is apart from another victim close to the detective , but out of his -- or the player 's -- periphery . A hulking butcher completes the scene , taking his tools to this faceless fellow but again , completely out of your line of sight . The sounds , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any horror game I 've played , and operate as our living ( digital ) evidence of the horror Sebastian now faces . This is n't the whole face of the game though , and the team would be remiss to not award the player retribution and power in intermittency as a reminder they can survive , something the team is very conscious of . <p> " Just because it 's a scary game does n't mean you can keep scaring people for the duration , " Kimura-san offers . " So you need a scary area then a safe area where people feel safe , then a scary area again . We showed you two areas : maximum horror where all you can do is run away , and then the battle where you can actually go against the monsters -- so you need that kind of curve in gameplay . " <p> We were n't specifically shown this curve , only intensity and tension . The few minutes of the game where Sebastian was exploring were n't at all safe . The team has done a remarkable job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on corners and the player line-of-sight so as to ensure you ca n't swing the camera around and prep yourself for the dread ahead , rather your only tools will be diligence , smart thinking and the all-important conservation of ammo -- a hallmark ceremoniously returning to the genre with The Evil Within . <p> " For this game what we 're trying to achieve is the player character , Sebastian , and his emotional feeling in the game ... we 're trying to synchronise that with the player , " Kimura-san explains . " So whatever the character 's feeling in the game , we want players to feel that same kind of feel . So the limping walk -- it 's difficult to control and it 's stressful to Sebastian , but it 's also stressful to the player . " <p> This " limping walk " he refers to is a component we 're not unfamiliar with as far as survival-horror goes , however , a quick spray of a medicinal aerosol you made out of strange , colourful plants is n't the order of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene I talked about earlier has said meatman swinging his chainsaw at Sebastian and connecting with the back of his leg , hamstringing the character -- and player -- to restricted movement and a sense of context to the lower level of violence to come ( read : we 're not even at the highest point of horror yet , Dorothy ) . The result is another escape sequence that sees Sebastian tripping and clawing his way out of being the next tree-lopping victim of this overzealous logger . To relay to you that this is more than intense , is an understatement , but the helplessness of the character despite your ability to get away is a hallmark long-missing from survival-horror , so despite my shortness of breath , it was wonderful to see it in full swing . <p> " One thing that we really appreciate about Bethesda ... because this is a business right , there are things like schedules and stuff like that , but beyond all that Bethesda always tells us that quality is number one , so make sure that quality is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So this is Shinji Mikami 's typical style of making games : he listens to all the staff in the studio for new ideas . So he tries to put all the ideas in then try them out and , you know , keeps some of the ideas and throw away some of the ideas . There 's a lot of ideas from a lot of different people -- there 's no one inspiration ; it 's all kind of one idea combined . " <p> Knowing that at its core , The Evil Within is being constructed by a developer , and leading designer , with an all-in approach is refreshing , but to also have a publisher whose willingness to bankroll ideas that not only buck the norm , but outright strip them of any modern components of marketability , leaves me breathing a massive sight of relief . The game looks gorgeous . It has that Japanese horror feel we love with Western sensibilities built in . There 's a maturity to Mikami 's movement and horror design that brings his style into the new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greater sense of mystery . If the key art leads me to believe anything , it 's that we might be dealing with deepseeded issues within the stoic detective Sebastian or , just maybe , we might be dealing with the mind of the brilliant Shinji Mikami . Whichever the case , based on my exposure to the game and time with Kimura-san , I cant wait to learn more about The Evil Within .

The rule is that only one property can have the exemption -- so if you have bought something else to live in , that may be the one you apply the exemption to , therefore losing this six-year window on the one you moved from . <p> Your depreciation report should show you the amount of depreciation available for the remainder of the year and then for each of the subsequent 9 years .

If Indigenous people do not establish and facilitate their educational approaches , their cultures may be misinterpreted or oversimplified with damaging effects . <p> Bilingual schooling is often suggested as an effective means for facilitating a culturally and linguistically appropriate education . Its benefits are twofold in that it can preserve and strengthen Indigenous languages , whilst allowing access to the language of the dominant society . However , not all Indigenous people support bilingual schooling . This highlights the danger in assuming what is best for or wanted by Indigenous people , and that Indigenous peoples and their issues are homogenous . <p> Strong Indigenous leaders are needed in the education system to achieve positive outcomes for Indigenous students . Strong community leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate the needs of their respective communities . The diverse circumstances , needs and hopes of different Indigenous peoples should be acknowledged . <p> The training of more Indigenous teachers is a positive and tangible strategy that can support Indigenous people in the establishment of culturally and linguistically appropriate schools and support their right to self-determination . <p> The More Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Teachers Initiative ( MATSITI ) , introduced by the Council of Australian Governments , aims to achieve these outcomes through scholarships and research into best Indigenous education practice . This initiative is set to run until 2015 , and it is imperative that funding and support continue in the long term and in every remote Indigenous community .

Does someone on $100k pay twice as much for petrol , bus tickets , milk , clothes or a movie ticket than someone on $50k ? Do you pay more rent because you earn more money ? Are school fees higher because you earn more money ? No , yet governments over the years base rates on the value of land , rather than on the cost of the service they provide .

@@308234 <h> How to build a more creative and innovative culture <p> According to a recent BCG report among executives worldwide , 76% stated that innovation was among their top three strategic priorities , while for CEOs it was a staggering 84% . <p> These results beg the question , how can leaders build a more creative and innovative culture ? As it turns out this was the exact question I asked some 88 leaders in my doctoral research during a series of interviews ( my thesis was called Designing a Continuously Creative Organisation ) . <p> In answering this question leaders tended to adopt the position of what was stopping their team , unit or business from being more creative . In other words , they believed that if they could just remove these barriers then creativity would flourish much like a breach of a dam . <p> The key barriers they identified were : <p> Company size <p> Entrenched power <p> Organisational structure <p> Lack of resources , for example people , budget and time <p> However , in my research I wanted to delve more deeply into exactly how leaders could build a more innovative team . After all , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always be there . <p> I asked leaders a different question . <h> What might an ideal creative environment look like ? <p> This really opened up the floodgates . Leaders responded by listing the following six attributes they perceive a creative environment to exhibit : <h> 1 . Open and receptive to ideas <p> For many leaders , an open and receptive culture was the very essence of creativity and innovation . This insight has certainly informed my work for the past few years . It is not enough to generate big , new ideas if no one is open or receptive to them . Idea receptivity is equally as important as idea generation . <h> 2 . Continually experimenting <p> According to leaders a creative culture is continually testing and experimenting . The tests do not have to be big -- in fact smaller , quicker , cheaper tests are the order of the day . <h> 3 . Taking risks <p> Having an experimental mindset also makes it easier to take risks , which is one of the other key features of a creative culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which involves risk-taking , learning and failure . This partly explains why high-achieving managers find even the idea of innovation difficult , as the outcome is not predictable . <h> 4 . Fun and enjoyable <p> Even the most practical and rational leaders also recognise that creating new ideas can only occur when people can relax and enjoy themselves and their work . The outcome may be serious but the process is not . <h> 5 . Retaining a focus on results <p> I found this a surprising result , but truly creative environments place a premium on results . It is not all beer and skittles . Creative people want to have their ideas tested in the marketplace . They need to know what works and what does not . <h> 6 . Operating at the ' edge of chaos ' <p> One of the distinguishing features of a creative culture is a concept which I have borrowed from complexity theory called operating at the ' edge of chaos ' . Although leaders did not use this language they instantly recognised its properties . The edge of chaos means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and randomness . Leaders would talk about giving people freedom but within constraints . And further , they adopted a leadership style of agreeing ' what ' has to delivered but leaving the ' how ' to their team members . <p> These six factors are interdependent and form the ideal creative environment , and are covered in a new course I have developed called Breakthrough Leadership . The successful leaders of the future need to think of their role more as builders and facilitators of a creative environment rather than adopting the traditional command and control mindset. <h> inside innovation : how 6 SMEs shook up business <h> BROUGHT TO YOU BY <p> Direct Links <p> Topics <p> Our Partners <p> SmartCompany.com.au is Australia 's leading website for SMEs featuring business news , business information and business blogs .

Jetstar 's whole business model is built around added charges for everything that does n't involve plopping you into a seat and getting you to your destination , and iPad rental is no different . <p> Jetstar offers iPads in-flight at three different price points . $8 is the entry level price point for short domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International flights . The different price tiers do in theory buy you slightly more content , with movies added to the offerings of music , TV , games , eBooks and eMags . <p> Unlike the Q service , it 's not secured with RFID tags ; instead you 're required to pay upfront and surrender your driver 's license ( or , I guess , passport ) until it 's returned . Not that you 'd easily be able to steal the iPad , because the battery case that it sits in is seriously hefty . I 'd hate to be in a plane that struck serious turbulence if these things go flying around . <p> The interface is quite basic , and if I 've got one particular criticism , it 's that in some areas the choice of content is somewhat lacking . The TV selection is OK , and while the games are on the older side , everyone should play The Settlers at least once in their lives . But the magazine selection when I tested was limited to six titles , with a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the $8 rental price and figuring that 's what a mag from the airport newsagency would cost you , it 's worth bearing in mind that you 'd get more choice in a paper mag , and you could also read it during takeoff and landing , where the use of an iPad is still a no-no . <p> Jetstar provides standard earbuds , but I really did n't fancy the look of mine , as they were weirdly gritty on the actual bud parts . I could n't quite tell if they were always collected post-flight and replaced , and did n't fancy picking up somebody else 's ear infection . They did n't collect them ( or at least not my pair ) , but I was n't feeling brave , so used my own headphones intstead . <p> One slight added bonus ; movies are meant to be an extra for longer flights , which makes sense because you 've got time to watch them , but at least on my short flight they were all available . Something tells me the cabin staff does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I had time to watch all of The Hobbit -- but it was there . <p> So does it offer value for money ? It can do , but obviously only if you do n't have your own tablet or other electronic diversionary device to travel with , because the rules for electronic devices remain the same no matter whether you 're renting or carrying them . I 'd be more concerned for longer hop flights if you were n't planning to watch a movie , because the range of magazines is limited , and the eBooks offerings are kids-only fare . <p> Lifehacker Australia contributor Alex Kidman often travels with more technology than is strictly speaking sensible , and has had to explain this to airport security staff more times than he 'd really like .

@@308238 <h> 4 June 2013 Remember Me <p> HEXIn our social media-addicted generation where we feel compelled to share absolutely everything , do you ever wonder what the next step will be ? What if you could share your actual memories ? This is a concept explored in Capcom 's new action-adventure title Remember Me . <p> BAJOThe year is 2084 in what is now called Neo-Paris . A new brain implant called ' Sensen ' has swept the population allowing people to share their memories online . But , of course at the root of this tech is a mega-corporation called ' Memorize ' , who 's control over people 's minds have allowed them to create a state of extreme surveillance . <p> HEXYou play as Nilin , a former ' memory hunter ' who , after having her memory-wiped is recruited by a rebel group trying to bring Memorize down . It 's a little bit Total Recall , a little bit Minority Report , but there are some seriously cool sci-fi concepts here that just had me on board with the story straight off the bat . <p> BAJOYeah , it 's a really stylish setting for a game , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Sadly , there 's a lot about design that feels sloppy , making the environment at times difficult to navigate . A lot of the early pathfinding is either painfully obvious or just frustratingly unclear , the game does n't do a great job of guiding you in a way that feels intuitive . <p> HEXYeah , a lot of great pains have been taken to create a visually interesting environment which is nice to look at , they 've done a lot of interesting camera work as you make your way through certain climbing sections , but this is more often than not to the detriment of basic movement and you end up just getting frustrated with it . <p> BAJO The controls just feel awkward too , do n't they ? It does n't quite meet that standard we 're used to for climbing and parkour games . <p> HEXYeah . Although , there were moments when I just fell in love with this city in spite of that . I thought the art style was just fantastic and the way the music swells as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just awesome . I was slow-panning a lot and that 's a good sign ! This is a world I wanted to explore , but then , sadly once you looked a little closer it was all quite lifeless . There was nothing you could actually interact with , save from a few doors and levers . You know how some games do a really good job of making a city feel real and lived-in ? This kind of felt like you were walking through a two-dimensional movie set , so I was a little bit disappointed by that . <p> BAJOMoving to combat , fights always seem to occur in glaringly-obvious purpose built rooms , and always in staggered waves . It 's combo-based , but they 've worked some interesting ideas into the fighting style . You 're supplied with a series of different combo chains in which you can unlock and customise attacks to mix-n-match within each set . Some attacks deal damage , some restore health , others are multipliers and some serve to speed up cool-down times for special abilities . <p> HEXI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of experimentation with placement of these attacks , until I found a set of combos that I could pull-off easily in a fight . Rather than blocks or counters you 'll focus mainly on speedy-dodging to avoid combo-breakers , so it 's tricky keeping complex combo chains in your head while you 're hitting A to dodge every 5 seconds , let alone remembering which combo chain you put the health regen in , but you do get used to it . <p> BAJOYeah , I think you 'll either love or hate this system of fighting and I was n't much of a fan . On the surface it appears to have depth to it , but it boils down to the same repetitive attacks while constantly cart wheeling out of the way of overt enemy telegraphing . I thought the cartwheel was a bit overdramatic , a bit impractical perhaps , the dodge out of the way . <p> HEXHow is a duck and roll more practical ? If you 're in a combat situation and someone is attacking you . How is that more practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not practical . <p> HEXI 'm glad we cleared that up . The point is I really started to enjoy the combo patterns once I got used to them . <p> BAJOMy spine hurts . <p> HEXI mean , this is a game where you simply can not win any fight by button mashing , it just wo n't let you . You 're forced into making use of the attack combinations YOU CHOSE which I think is really cool . Admittedly I preferred these slower , more calculated fights with heavy goons , than the wild scraps you have with these leaper-things . <p> BAJOYeah , Leapers are kind of memory-addicts that have overdosed and mutated into some kind of subhuman creatures . They move quickly , can blink in and out of view and if you get overwhelmed they can make your life pretty difficult . Some fights will see you needing to rely on constantly hitting flood-lights to expose them , or using lots of your cool-down combos so that you can waste them with your special abilities . <p> HEXYou also have a ranged weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good for breaking through shields and is particularly useful in boss fights . Some of which are visually really interesting scenarios but get a little tiresome and repetitive after the third or fourth stage of the fight . Plus there are other just plain dumb design flaws where quick time events happen but amidst all the flashy artwork you ca n't actually see the button you 're supposed to press . Play that back ? Yeah , it 's ... THERE . <p> BAJOYeah , it 's in examples like that where it becomes obvious that the game gets a little too caught up in style and flashy design , but then totally falls down on basic elements which should just feel organic and natural . <p> HEXThe game 's strength for me is in its setting and characters . The story starts out a little convoluted , the amnesia certainly does n't help , but Nilin makes for cool protagonist and there 's some really great voice work , too . <p> BAJOOne of the more unique story concepts of the game were the parts where you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the events in their minds . <p> HEXYeah that was interesting . Part of your skills as a ' memory hunter ' is the ability to steal memories and ' remix ' them . As a player , this takes form by allowing you to fast-forward and rewind a scene , pin-pointing certain moments which act as a catalyst to change the events of that memory , and its outcome . It 's a cool device but I 'm glad I did n't have to do it too often because it 's time-consuming and a little fiddly . <p> BAJOYeah , there are a bunch of scenarios you 'll need to play out before you get the right outcome , but we should wrap this up Hex . <p> HEXI loved that art and design but , not enough on finessing the basic mechanics or adding depth to the world . <p> BAJOYeah , there were a few basic missteps . To me , it felt like half a game , and a lot of the ideas felt half developed . It 's such a shame , because I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sci-fi world . And it could have been amazing , but I do n't think it is . So I 'm giving it 5.5 out of 10 rubber chickens . <p> HEXThat 's a fair score , and I should really score it the same , there are inexcusable flaws to this , yes . But I enjoyed the combat and I actually think a lot of the navigating of the environment picked up as the game progressed . Well , kind-of . I got really attached to Nilin , I was committed to her cause and when you 're willing to put up with some pretty shoddy level design to see through a game 's story , it proves that at least they 're doing something right . I was keen to stay in Neo-Paris a little bit longer , I 'm giving it 7 . <h> Darth : <h> Arbijon : <h> Arbijon : <p> 28 Dec 2013 10:58:54am <p> Rating : I will remember this game mostly because of the visuals and interesting levels.movement could have been ironed out especially for a game that relies on free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my collection . <h> Sculli69 : <h> Tells the Truth : <p> 21 Jul 2013 12:31:37pm <p> Rating : I actually really like this game !

@@327236 <p> In May oil spilled from a well in south-west Queensland owned by Australian oil and gas company Santos . In what may be the state 's third largest spill , more than 250,000 litres of oil flowed from the well into the surrounding environment . <p> While Santos has plugged the well and cleaned the area , the state government monitored the spill via satellite . So , when it comes to oil spills , who is responsible for regulation ? <p> The spill itself is not a particularly huge amount of oil , but it is significant for the potential effects on both the local and wider environment . The leak occurred in the Channel Country , where rain flows over the country like ribbons rather than rivers , and eventually flows into Australia 's inland icon , Lake Eyre . <p> For Santos and the migratory birds that use Lake Eyre as a breeding ground , it was fortunate there were no rains or floods at the time of the spill . Santos claims now that all of the contaminated soil has been removed to a bioremediation area . <p> Arguably the most important issue that arises out of the Santos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well integrity involves maintaining control of a well so it does n't leak . Loss of control was the cause of BP 's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the Montara oil spill off the coast of Western Australia . <p> Well control is at the heart of preventing environmental harm , but it 's not assessed as part of the environmental plan . Instead , it 's assessed as part of well management . The environment plan and the well operations management plan are treated as two separate systems . And this is the heart of the regulatory problem . <p> So , what 's the difference ? <p> Environmental management tries to reduce the impact of any activity to as low as reasonably practicable , whereas well management utilises a minimum standard of good oilfield practice according to what other companies are doing to maintain well control and integrity . Environment and safety might be regulated to the max , but well integrity is regulated to the minimum . And it 's this that causes oil spills when it goes wrong . <p> Jurisdictions such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment of the activity occurs as one integrated assessment , to a maximum standard . Unless and until this occurs , this oil spill conundrum will continue . <p> Santos has responded to the spill in a manner that is consistent with a spill-response plan -- stop the source of the oil spill , and remove the oil that flowed over the surface . The ABC reports a team of US specialists were brought in to help out , and the spill was contained within six days . <p> But the fact it took six days for US specialists to contain the leak indicates a lack of local response capability that must be investigated and addressed . Whether Santos ' response was adequate will be confirmed when the company 's report into the incident is released in two weeks . <p> In the meantime the oil spill brings to the fore the larger issue of the government response to the spill itself . If this incident had involved the injury or death of a person , government inspectors are required to immediately attend the site of the incident and investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to media reports , no personnel from the Queensland Department of Environment have attended this incident . Since it is an environmental issue , the spill was handled by the company . The Department of Natural Resources and Mines was notified , and two of its officials were onsite within 24 hours. * While the government has said it used satellite data to monitor the area and verify Santos ' reporting of the incident , the spill highlights the weaknesses of the present regulatory framework to respond to environmental issues . <p> The regulator , whoever it is , needs to look beyond the immediate effects of the incident to what could have been . <p> *This paragraph was corrected on June 15 . It previously said no government officials had attended the spill .

Many students commented that IT was " not interesting " or " not enjoyable " and some commented that they are not sure what they would do in ICT . <p> Computer studies was last on the list of favourite subjects among the students ; only 17 per cent see it as their favourite subject . However , maths was the second most popular subject of study at 29 per cent , with physical education being the most popular at 35 per cent . <p> Almost half ( 47 per cent ) of students had only studied ICT in high school for less than a year , resulting in a lack of exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether IT had been studied previously , there were still between 23 to 31 per cent of students who were at least undecided about whether or not they would like to study IT .

" Speaking for Wolseley , we 've very deliberately positioned ourselves in that mid-market space . <p> " There are anywhere from 11,000 to 18,000 companies in Australia that turn over more than $10 million a year . Two-thirds of those are owned by baby boomers . Our experience is that the vast majority do n't have a succession plan in place , and are trying to delay the inevitable . All up , that 's an enormous volume of businesses that has to change hands one way or another in the next decade . " <p> Petering wants private equity to be a bigger part of that conversation . To that effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Seat , released this month , which aims to demystify the world of private equity . <p> He 's not the first private equity leader to do so in recent months . In February , Champ founder Bill Ferris released Inside Private Equity , telling LeadingCompany at the time : " We 're all ' barbarians at the gate ' in populist lingo , " referring to a 1990 book by two Wall Street Journal reporters that gave private equity a bad name . " I 'm hoping to address that . " <p> It 's a sentiment Petering shares . " I 'm trying to take the fear factor out of private equity , " he says . <p> " I think , as an industry , we need to get better at explaining what we do ... A lot of the time , it 's the handful of very large stories that catch the public interest , and that 's where people get their education . People read the front pages . But that hides a much more bread-and-butter story of what we do , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity has been dogged by some high-profile failures in recent years . For example , global PE firm CVC famously lost a fortune in buying and selling Channel Nine .

In his book , Petering quotes statistics from the Australian Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association , which show that of all Australian private equity exits over the three years from 2009-11 , only 16% resulted in equity being written off . <p> This is an important statistic , because it 's not just business owners Petering is making his pitch to . He 's got his eye set on aspiring executives , too . <p> Wolseley runs a program called Bankable CEO , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the challenge and grow their wealth through leading the group 's investments . <p> " We want executives with a good track record of success , and then we help them find a business they can buy into and run . <p> " We do n't think anyone else is doing it quite the way we are . The way we think about it -- we put the jockey before the horse . " <p> The program has n't been marketed , but Petering says it 's grown strongly , largely through word-of-mouth . " I 'm having one or two meetings a week with executives . We have a fairly constant stream of people interested in the program . " <p> Wolseley wants three things from the CEOs it backs : a proven record of success ; an appetite to test themselves ; and a desire to make a lot of money . <p> " Our hope is that a successful execution of a strategy over three to five years could be a life-changing event for an executive , in terms of creating wealth for themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some contribution towards the purchase price of a company , though Petering says that amount varies largely from individual to individual . The program suits those who otherwise would be going into a senior role at a multinational . <p> " That 's quite a different view for executives who might be at a point in their career where they are looking for the next senior role within a large multinational , to all of a sudden take a different perspective on life and hunt a business to wrap their arms around . " <p> What kinds of executives make good CEOs in companies owned by private equity ? <p> Petering says a theme came out of the interviews . <p> " The ones who enjoy it the most are the executives who like working to very clearly defined goals within set time frames , and who want to be in control of their own destiny , " Petering says .

@@332235 <p> The defining image of World War Z , according to director Marc Forster , is not a zombie biting into someone 's flesh but the wildlife montage that plays behind the opening credits , which might best be summed up in the words of one of his characters : ' ' Mother Nature is a serial killer . The best there is . ' ' <p> The zombies scaling the wall ae basically this pack , crawling on top of each other . I thought it 's a strong image because that 's how humanity is . <p> Forster grew up in Switzerland , and as a child spent a lot of time looking at the anthills behind his house . ' ' I loved watching these insects crawl around , ' ' he says . Later , he became ' ' obsessed with swarms of birds and fish , how these swarms communicate with each other ' ' . <p> This is how the world ends : Zombies climb the walls in Word War Z <p> The fascination stayed with him when he became a filmmaker . ' ' I was always thinking I had to implement that image in a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started working on World War Z , I felt there was no better way to implement that than in a swarm of zombies . ' ' <p> Advertisement <p> One of the key set-pieces in the big-budget apocalypse film , produced by and starring Brad Pitt as a UN worker trying to find ' ' patient zero ' ' , or the first person to be affected in this unexplained plague , involves a swarm of zombies attempting to scale the impossibly high wall that 's been erected around Jerusalem . <p> The symbolism of that wall is rich and conflicted : it protects Jews and Palestinians alike , in a brief and oddly blissful moment of coexistence now the threat has been transferred to an Other more foreign and dangerous than either could ever be . But in Forster 's mind , the scene 's significance is global , not local . <p> Brad Pitt tries to stop the marauding zombies in Word War Z ( top ) ; The Walking Dead shuffle across our TV screens ( middle ) ; Bill Nighy 's death stare in Shaun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other to ( un ) death in their frantic bid to climb ever higher . ' ' As the zombie tower is building , it 's almost like a feeding frenzy , them going after the last resources with no respect for each other , ' ' he says . ' ' They 're basically this pack , crawling on top of each other . I thought it 's a strong image because that 's how humanity is . ' ' <p> So the zombie apocalypse - the zombocalypse , as the kids would have it - in World War Z represents a planet on the brink of economic and environmental collapse ? <p> ' ' Absolutely , that reflects the time we live in . There are not enough resources for the people that exist . ' ' <p> It 's possible Forster is the first filmmaker to use the zombie horde in quite this way , but he has in no sense betrayed the genre by doing so . One of the key factors in the appeal of the zombie as a fictional device is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' overdetermined ' ' , a sign whose meanings ( the things it signifies ) have overwhelmed the word itself ( the signifier ) . A little like a zombie horde on the move , in fact . <p> ' ' Zombies are a very elastic storytelling trope , ' ' the US novelist Jonathan Maberry , whose zombie trilogy ( starting with Patient Zero ) has been optioned for television , said in 2010 . ' ' They 're endlessly fascinating because they play on so many of our fears : the loss of identity in ourselves and our loved ones , paranoia , fear of disease , racism , and so on . ' ' <p> Above all , he added , they represent ' ' a constant and universal threat that is implacable and unbearable ' ' . <p> The seeming endlessness of the onslaught is a crucial aspect of the zombocalypse scenario : the zombie horde represents a threat that is so enormous that it seems impossible to defy . It can be endlessly substituted for the many things we suspect threaten us but struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might add nuclear war , terrorism , viral epidemics such as HIV , SARS and Ebola , even mindless consumerism . <p> Each has generated its own iterations of the zombie story , or at least its own readings of the zombie genre . In the hands of left-leaning cultural critics , the film that started it all - George A. Romero 's low-budget black and white Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) - was an allegory for the mindless waste of life that was the Vietnam War . His 1978 sequel , Dawn of the Dead , with the action moved from a remote farmhouse to a suburban shopping mall , was a devastating critique of the empty lives of American consumers lulled into ignoring the ills of the world by the allure of all that shiny plastic . <p> The English zom-com Shaun of the Dead ( 2004 ) played a variation on the same tune : the repetitive pattern of life in suburban London is barely distinguishable from zombiedom , and in the end almost interchangeable , as Shaun and his best mate - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session on the gaming console they 'd started before the plague set in . <p> Writing in the literary magazine Granta in 2011 , Naomi Alderman , one of the developers of the app Zombies , Run ! , noted : ' ' The zombie apocalypse is the death of civilisation . It represents the moment when all that becomes important is : do you have food ? Do you have guns ? We want to practise this in fantasy , to imagine it all the way through , especially in times of economic crisis . ' ' <p> But she also had a far more personal reading : she could n't help but hear in the zombie apocalypse a distinct echo of the Holocaust . And anyone who does n't see in the shuffling , grey-hued living dead of the genre something of the survivor of the Final Solution is surely not looking terribly hard . <p> Such is the malleability of the genre , though , that it also lends itself to more conservative readings , such as that of the American ' ' philosophical counsellor ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genre as tapping into an anxiety about ' ' losing one 's autonomy ' ' , a kind of creeping ' ' paranoia ' ' , albeit one founded in genuine concerns . All human societies are founded on borders , he argues , the most fundamental of which is that between the living and the dead . ' ' If the fear of zombies is prevalent today , it is because this is an age in which borders are being transgressed , on many fronts . ' ' <p> Among them : non-traditional marriage , socialism , communism . ' ' Such movements as diversity , multiculturalism , globalisation are threatening to dissolve the identity of various nations , ' ' he adds . <p> In the zombocalypse scenario , there is in fact precious little of the nation state left to dissolve . Arguably , this points to an anxiety about the rule of law in general and the viability ( and reliability ) of our political systems . <p> Nowhere is this played out more explicitly than in the US cable series The Walking Dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its season three finale was watched by 12.4 million people in the US in March ) effectively pitted good cop Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) against bad cop Shane Walsh ( Jon Bernthal ) in a world in which all systems had broken down . <p> At every turn , they presented their small band of survivors with a choice - between the rule of law and the rule of the gun . In season three , the lines became more blurred as Rick sought to defend his tribe against a rival band of survivors led by an autocratic psychopath known as The Governor ( David Morrissey ) - and in the process became increasingly like him . <p> The show has struck such a nerve , season-three showrunner Glen Mazzara told me late last year , because ' ' people really do believe that some sort of apocalypse is coming and we are going to have to bond together to survive , and the infrastructure of society and government will collapse . They imagine , ' What would my life be like if I had no food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect my family and my neighbours ' . ' ' <p> If it taps into the fantasies of the US survivalist movement and its counterparts ( of both reactionary and green hues ) elsewhere , the show also touches on a fundamental question about what kind of society we would choose if we were to start again . Would it be compassionate or would it be based on the survival of the fittest ? For an America that often feels as if it has lost its way , it 's a compelling premise - let 's wipe the slate clean , be pilgrims again and see if we ca n't get this right - even if it 's played out against the harshest backdrop imaginable . <p> Interestingly , race is barely an issue in this post-zombocalypse world . And when that most shameful aspect of America 's past pops up , it is dramatically inverted as a samurai sword-wielding African-American Michonne ( Danai Gurira ) leads a couple of black-skinned zombies , minus arms and lower jaws ( so they ca n't bite or scratch ) , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slavery era ( or , indeed , of Australian colonialism ) is unmissable . <p> There 's a similar racial flip in World War Z , too . With Pitt 's Gerald Lane presumed dead , his wife and children face eviction from the aircraft carrier on which they 've been granted refuge . The man who delivers the news is the deputy-general of the UN , a friend of Lane and a black African . It 's a potent ' ' how would it feel ' ' moment that makes the whole refugee crisis visceral for even the most disengaged ( white ) viewer . <p> For all that , the zombocalypse scenario can satisfy far baser instincts too , as anyone who has ever played a first-person shooter game such as Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead ( or the real-world laser-tag version , IRL Shooter ) will attest . In offering up an enemy that is both human and not , and presenting us with a simple kill or be killed scenario , it allows the player to satisfy the killer instinct in a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have a complicated mythology like vampires or aliens , ' ' says Mazzara . ' ' They just keep coming at you - they 're the never-ending presence of death . ' ' <p> Writing in the Foreign Policy journal in 2010 , Daniel Drezner , a professor of international politics , noted that ' ' zombie stories end one of two ways - the elimination/subjugation of all zombies , or the eradication of humanity from the face of the Earth ' ' . <p> That is , in many ways , the choice many of us feel we face in the real world : we keep stumbling through like so many zombies , failing to act upon the threats we face , or we rise up and reclaim our humanity , and our future . <p> ' ' We 're living in times where there are these really big problems , ' ' said Max Brooks , son of Mel and author of the book on which World War Z is based . ' ' We 've got terrorism , economic problems , unpopular wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , but I think we 're living in fear of the apocalyptic times .

You ca n't shoot the Gulf oil spill in the head . ' ' <h> Rise of the undead <p> Because the zombie is essentially an empty vessel into which meaning can readily be poured , the genre is surprisingly alive . Here are five key moments in the evolution of the undead . But be warned : the selection is personal , and far from exhaustive . <p> White Zombie ( 1932 ) Generally regarded as the first zombie feature , this black-and-white film stars Bela Lugosi as a Haitian voodoo master called Murder Legendre , who runs a sugar plantation staffed entirely by Haitian slaves .

Romero 's film cost $114,000 to make and has grossed an estimated $30 million , making it arguably the most profitable zombie film ever . More significantly , it is the film that kicked off the modern iteration of the zombie picture , with a small band of survivors under siege from a marauding pack of flesh-eating ghouls . Other key contributions : many of the main characters are killed off , the source of the plague remains unclear , and the leading man ( Duane Jones ) is black . <p> The Serpent and the Rainbow ( 1988 ) Horror-meister Wes Craven plays it almost straight in this return to the Haitian setting of White Zombie , albeit while making a detour through the scientific-fringe of Ken Russell 's Altered States ( 1980 ) . Bill Pullman is a doctor on the trail of a drug that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the voodoo aspect of Haitian culture is treated with something close to the seriousness of ethnographic documentary . <p> Shaun of the Dead ( 2004 ) This English buddy movie-cum-romantic comedy - does that make it a Pom-zom-rom-com ? - breathed new life into a by-then-old format , with Simon Pegg starring as a man stuck in a suburban rut that looked an awful lot like a living death . The pub as refuge/prison is a wonderful metaphor for ... well , something . <p> The Walking Dead ( 2010- ) AMC 's series , based on the comic books by Robert Kirkman , Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard , has taken the zombie genre to the masses , scoring audiences on cable television to almost equal any drama on American free-to-air . English actor Andrew Lincoln ( he was Egg in This Life ; he 's Rick in this after-life drama ) stars as the good cop determined to cling to some form of morality in a world gone to a very Darwinian form of hell . <h> More than one fallout <p> Brad Pitt has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by his company , Plan B , in partnership with Paramount , so it 's not just his face up there on screen - it 's his dollars , too . <p> It 's no secret that things did n't always run smoothly . Paramount bought the rights to the book on which it is based - written by Max Brooks , son of Mel - in June 2006 as a vehicle for Plan B. Filming was set to start in early 2009 but the project went back to the drawing board when the screenplay was rejected . By mid-2011 it was back on ; a year later - as it ran over time and over budget and a new ending was ordered - Pitt and his Swiss-German director Marc Forster were no longer talking . <p> So goes the folk tale , at least . But according to Forster , who directed the James Bond film Quantum of Solace in 2008 , much of what has been reported is simply not true . <p> ' ' I finished the movie in the amount of days I was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , ' ' he says . <p> What of the rumours that he and Brad were not speaking ? ' ' I was surprised when I read that . We were always in communication and respectful to each other . We never even had an argument or fight . I would say we are 99 per cent on board with the cut and the similar opinion . It was n't like we had a communication breakdown . ' ' <p> The concept of migration , and the experience of being a refugee , plays a surprisingly large role in the film . That ' ' reflects the time we live in , ' ' Forster says . But should we detect the hand of activist Brad - and maybe even Angelina Jolie - in that ? <p> ' ' Not at all , ' ' Forster insists . ' ' In fact , there was a concern to make sure it did n't reflect that they are so active in that area . It was actually me pushing a little more for that . ' ' <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ending of World War Z seems very much to be aiming for a sequel . ' ' It 's definitely in the air if it works out , ' ' Forster says . ' ' The idea we discussed originally was maybe a trilogy . But let 's see how the box office goes and then we 'll go from there . ' ' <p> And if it is favourable , would he go there again , despite everything ? ' ' It 's always tricky with me , ' ' the director says . ' ' They offered me Skyfall as well and I did n't want to do another Bond movie . I like to switch genres . But in this case I definitely would leave it open . I do n't want to close that door .

@@332238 <h> This Man Had The Equivalent Of A Teleportation Device In 1901 <p> I try not to seek out the " best " of anything . The idea of best is so subjective , it becomes useless . Try picking a " best " car , for example . I 'll save you the hassle : you ca n't . But there is one exception . It 's for the overall concept of personal transportation , and the person who did it best was Alberto Santos-Dumont . <p> Alberto Santos-Dumont ( he preferred the equals sign to a hyphen , so , what the hell , I 'll write it that way from here on out ) was one of the pioneers of early aviation , developing the world 's first practical steerable powered dirigible blimps and later moving to heaver-than-air craft , making the first fixed-wing aircraft flight in Europe . These contributions are well-documented , but I want to focus more specifically on his unique personal transportation solutions , which I think represent the absolute best situation of any person in history , and possibly of any person in the foreseeable future . <p> I normally write about cars , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation solution . For some of us , that solution also includes subways or rail travel for intra-city travel , and if we have to go long distances , we 'll take flights on large commercial airliners . <p> Santos=Dumont had a very different approach . He lived in Paris , and in addition to the petrol and electric automobiles he owned , he got around town in a small , powered , steerable dirigible of his own design . He did this mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , long before there were any inklings of ideas about air-traffic control laws , so Santos=Dumont had free run to float over the city at rooftop level , stopping in at caf ? s or even his own apartment , tooling around the Paris airspace like he fucking owned the place . Which he basically did , in any way that matters . <p> Just think about it for a second : say you live in one of the greatest cities in the world , but like all great cities , it 's dense , crowded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal way to get around ? Through the air ! You would n't need outright speed , but you would want something that could hover indefinitely , stop and manoeuvre with the agility of a car , and make you look like King Badass 's Boss 's cool Dad when you got in and out of it . A personal blimp fits all these criteria perfectly . <p> Some background on Alberto Santos=Dumont is probably worth talking about now , if only so you can make the inevitable Bruce Wayne/Batman associations in your head . Santos=Dumont was the son of a very wealthy Brazilian coffee grower . It was in his father 's extensive and highly innovative coffee fields that young albert first encountered steam driven machinery and even a locomotive , which fascinated him . <p> In 1891 , he travelled to Paris with his family , where he had one goal . As he said in his book My Airships : <p> " I am going to Paris to see the new things -- steerable balloons and automobiles ! " <p> And boy did he see those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that enthusiasm eventually led to the idea to use a small automotive-type gasoline engine to power a balloon . As he told a reporter for Century magazine in 1901 , <p> " I got my first idea of putting an automobile motor under a cigar-shaped balloon filled with hydrogen gas while returning from the Paris-Amsterdam automobile race in 1897 , " <p> This initial idea led to a series of increasingly advanced dirigibles , which he simply named Santos-Dumont No.1 through No.10 . Among the innovations he came up with while developing his airships were lightweight stiffening frames and structures , directional rudders , light and efficient gas engines ( some adapted from cars of the era ) , and a system of shifting weights that allowed him to adjust the pitch of the airship to ascend or descend without having to release the precious and dangerous hydrogen or deal with dropping or adding ballast . <p> Oh , and he also independently inspired the idea of a wristwatch , just in case you were on the fence about how fundamentally amazing this guy was . As Wikipedia tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the difficulty of checking his pocket watch to time his performance during flight . Santos-Dumont then asked Cartier to come up with an alternative that would allow him to keep both hands on the controls . Cartier went to work on the problem and the result was a watch with a leather band and a small buckle , to be worn on the wrist . <p> Santos=Dumont 's No.6 airship was used to win the Deutch Prize , which was to be awarded to the first steerable , powered airship to be able to make the 6.8 mile round trip between the Eiffel Tower and the Parc de Saint Cloud in Paris in 30 minutes or less . Santos=Dumont rounded the Eiffel Tower in only nine minutes and all was looking great when he had engine trouble , causing the engine to stall . <p> He could n't restart the engine from his control basket , so he had to shimmy across the flimsy , skeletal airframe to the engine , without any safety harnesses or anything , with only the raw badassium secreting from his pores to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to finish the course with only 30 seconds to spare . <p> After a bit of timing controversy , Santos=Dumont 's attempt was declared successful , and he was awarded a substantial prize of 125,000 francs . Here 's what he did with the money : <p> The money of the prize , amounting in all to 125,000 francs , I did not desire to keep . I , therefore , divided it into unequal parts . The greater sum , of 75,000 francs , I handed over to the Prefect of Police of Paris to be used for the deserving poor . The balance I distributed among my employees , who had been so long with me and to whose devotion I was glad to pay this tribute . <p> Are you f**king kidding me ? He wins a daredevil 's prize by the skin of his teeth , after a death-defying mid-race aerial repair , in an airship he designed himself , and he divides his prize money between the poor folks of the city and his own crew and mechanics ? The man 's made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental and racing airships were , the one I 'm most interested in is his No.9 airship , the one that afforded him the status of Best Personal Transportation in History .

" I can go to Moscow or Lisbon ! " I said to myself . But when I discovered that I did not want to go to Moscow or to Lisbon the small and handy electric runabout in which I do my errands about Paris and the Bois proved more satisfactory . <p> Speaking from the standpoint of my pleasure and convenience as a Parisian my air-ship experience has been similar .

I do n't really think Santos=Dumont 's situation can be beat . <p> Alberto 's little No.9 also became the first powered aircraft to be piloted by a woman , a Cuban-American named Aida de Acosta . Aida took three flying lessons from Santos=Dumont , and flew solo in 1903 , about six months before the Wright brother 's first flight .

Man , am I jealous of that guy .

The " ground war " means hand to hand combat : contacting voters one by one on their door steps , in their letter boxes , and in the streets , shopping centres and bus stops of their community . <p> Where the " air war " will feature the prime minister and the opposition leader , the " ground war " will be more about the local candidates - Labor 's incumbent Mike Kelly and Liberal challenger Peter Hendy . The " air war " , for Eden Monaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ground war " will be fought on the streets of Cooma , Cobargo and Queanbeyan . <p> The military metaphors are perhaps especially relevant in Eden-Monaro , given the high number of defence force voters in Eden-Monaro , and Kelly 's army background and defence portfolio . <p> But in 2013 the language of air and ground wars accurately conveys the state-of-the-art practice of election campaigning in marginal seats around Australia . In studying the election in Eden-Monaro we are studying a laboratory in which party Head Offices are constantly experimenting with and refining their campaign techniques . <p> " Air wars " became fixed features of election campaigning in the 1970s , when the national party Head Offices first used the recently formed national TV networks to blanket the nation with their electronic messages of change . <p> These high-cost , high-visibility , high-emotion campaigns , executed for head office by professional advertisers and market researchers , were effective because they could efficiently reach the party 's safe seats as well as the marginal seats needed to assemble a majority in the House of Representatives . They tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the big national factors to drive their campaigns . <p> Air warfare remains a critical part of modern campaigning , built around TV and radio commercials and , increasingly , internet videos that feature the parties ' parliamentary leaders , promote their policies and promises , and attack their opponents . Much of the media reporting of election campaigns remains fixated with this type of activity . <p> But over the decades , such campaigns have declined in effectiveness ( though not in cost ) as network TV audiences fragmented ; campaign strategists moved to supplement them with more focussed efforts targeted at specific voters and specific seats . Equipped with ever more granular market research and census data , strategists could identify the critical undecided voters with greater precision . From the late 1980s , both parties were allocating more and more resources to marginal seat campaigning , heralding the rise of the " ground war " campaign style . <p> Where the air war is all high-visibility -- who wants to hide an advertising campaign ? - the ground war tends to be more covert . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign workers ( volunteer and paid ) are required on the spot , to door-knock voters in their homes , distribute leaflets , run sausage sizzles , collect signatures on petitions , organise postal votes in nursing homes , and the like . On Election Day itself , armies of volunteers , up before dawn to festoon voting booths with bunting , will distribute How to Vote cards . <p> To secure victory in Eden-Monaro , both Kelly and Hendy can be expected to deploy all the tactics of the " ground war " style . Indeed unlike a marginal seat in , say , Western Sydney , which falls within the major Sydney TV markets , Eden-Monaro is a rural seat and lacks a major TV market ( except whatever spills over from the ACT ) . So the " ground war " will be proportionately more important in Eden-Monaro . <p> Direct mail is the weapon of choice for this kind of integrated campaign . The letters seem personalised and localised but are the product of a highly centralised campaign . Both major parties maintain complex data bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvassing data and other data sources . Using this information , correspondence to individuals can be tailored to reflect their interests and opinions . <p> As an opposition candidate , Peter Hendy is likely to use direct mail as a simple and direct way of introducing himself and his family and to highlight local issues of concern . As a government MP , Mike Kelly is likely to highlight services he 's provided to the electorate using map-style leaflets - showing a map of Eden-Monaro with arrows locating government spending projects such as roads , GP Super Clinics , schools built under Building the Education Revolution program , and regional development initiatives . <p> It would be easy -- but I think , wrong -- to see the ground war campaign in 2013 as representing a revival or throw-back to some 1940s golden age , with local candidates addressing public meetings on street-corners . What we are seeing instead is the extension and reinforcement of a centralised campaign managed out of the parties ' professional head offices . <p> As one national party official expressed it in a recent research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be run top down and bottom up , and completely integrated " . <p> Accordingly , bottom up ground war campaigns are actually designed , planned , funded and often staffed by the national head office , and managed along lines set out in campaign manuals written and issued by head office . The ground war elaborates and reinforces the themes and arguments of the air war : local deviation from the central plan is discouraged ; consistency is valued over innovation ; and amateurism is tolerated but not extolled .

He receives funding from the European Community 's Seventh Framework Programme under a Marie Curie Fellowship . <p> Accusations of scientific bias are the new catch-all weapon for anti-science commentators and climate deniers . Why are they effective ? New research shows they may exploit part of our psychology . <p> Climate sceptics have won , Martin Wolf lamented in the Financial Times , despite near-universal scientific consensus against them . The sheer longevity of this " debate " indicates deniers attract disproportionate attention - partly due to one of their main lines of attack : scientific bias . <p> Brent Strickland of Yale University and Hugo Mercier of the National Centre for Scientific Research in France asked non-scientists to evaluate scientific studies . Participants decided whether they believed the results of experiments , given what experimenters expected to find , their financial motivation and whether the methods were sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's belief in findings , even if the methods were flawless . <h> This is my truth : tell me yours <p> High profile debates over HIV , passive smoking and , latterly , climate change , have increasingly questioned the social context of science as well as the facts . They gained momentum during the " science wars " of the 1990s which popularized the idea of scientific findings as socially constructed , inseparable from the people producing them . Now , accusations of scientific bias are going viral . <p> Erickson asks not whether this is good science but instead whose side the scientists are on . His hope is to create a stalemate where , owing to suspect motives , no science is valid . In this vacuum , his opinion is as good as anyone else 's . <h> Bias is real ... <p> Why are Erickson and others able to get away with this ? Unable to challenge scientific consensus with data , deniers can be confident accusing the establishment of bias . No amount of data will shake this claim , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrosive - we have worried about it for many years . Ben Goldacre , a medical doctor and journalist , for example , has been sounding alarm bells for more than a decade . The bigger the incentives to manipulate results , the harder it is to dissociate findings from motives . <h> ... but it does n't undermine all of science <p> The more high profile these arguments become , the more people get used to the possibility of a giant scientific plot fuelled by career-protecting scientists , and the further their trust in scientific findings , however unanimous , is eroded . The problem is exacerbated by the fact that strictly balanced media over-represent minority views , which are typical of many denialists . A BBC review concluded that climate coverage was skewed towards sceptics . <p> Thus , when a recent study suggested conspiracy theory was associated with climate scepticism , critical bloggers ' predominant response was more conspiracy theory . In the right hands , our sensitivity to financial and political bias becomes a potent anti-science weapon . <p> If scientists are constantly forced into disclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right : the deniers have won . The debate is no longer about science , but about bias . <h> What can be done ? <p> Critics are right to be concerned about bias , but within reason . It can not be used as a wholesale indictment of science . Numerous studies show that bias can be reduced in various ways : increased sample sizes , carefully controlled designs , meta-analyses , pre-trial declarations and commitment to publishing all results , including negative ones , under open-access frameworks . <p> Academic platforms routinely declare conflicts of interest . Some , like The Conversation and PLOS journals , place declarations very prominently . Possibly , industry-funded studies should be identified as such in their titles , or appear in separate journals . <p> Unfortunately , denialist accusations of systematic bias rarely rely on specifics that can be challenged . They invoke a fuzzy , boogieman concept of " bias " , such as Erickson 's blanket statement " experts can be as politically motivated as anyone else " . This is as undeniably true as it is undeniably vague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand a real risk of this argument successfully undermining public confidence in science . <p> Governments are not currently helping : examples include tying funding from national research institutions to economic gain in the UK and in the US , or allowing unlimited conflicts of interest among FDA advisors .

We also know that it will be the poor , the vulnerable and the marginalized who will be worst hit by the negative impacts . <p> In scoping the context of people and planet , there are harrowing things to consider . However , the connections between sustainability and health are not only negative -- and it 's important to appreciate the positive impacts of the environment . <p> Starting with the wellbeing of the planet , we know that green space and natural environments can play an important role in storing carbon and reducing CO2 emissions , in controlling flooding and in sustaining biodiversity . <p> However , there is also a significant and strengthening body of evidence describing how nature and green space are beneficial to human health . Studies have shown that access to nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and aggression , and increased levels of physical activity ; that ' green exercise ' -- exercise taken outdoors -- is more beneficial than gym-based physical activity ; and that patients in hospital recover more quickly if they have views of the natural environment from their window . <p> Again , we also know that access to green space mirrors other indicators of deprivation and is strongly related to health inequalities . <p> Richard Louv , in his book , ' Last Child in the Woods ' , speaks of ' nature deficit disorder ' and the particular importance of reconnecting young people with nature . <p> He discusses the disturbing shifts created by a complex of factors such as the rise in screen-based entertainment and increased parental fear of unregulated spaces . He observes that whilst children may be aware of global threats to the environment , their close contact with nature is fading ... " they can likely tell you about the Amazon rain forest -- but not about the last time he or she explored the woods in solitude , or lay in a field listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Louv also contends that respect for the planet and a passion for sustainability and environmental activism are often borne out of the intimate contact with nature that has been so eroded . <p> The settings approach <p> Having briefly set out the context for connecting health , sustainability and social justice agendas in relation to people and planet , I now want to shift the focus onto ' place ' by looking at what 's become known as the ' settings approach ' . <p> We all spend time in a range of different places and it 's clear that they have important influences on our wellbeing . Settings such as schools and workplaces have long been used by health promotion professionals as convenient vehicles for targeting interventions . <p> Understood in this way , settings -- together with population groups and health topics or problems -- make up the traditional three-dimensional matrix used to organise health promotion programmes , particularly those concerned with encouraging individual behaviour change . <p> However , what 's become known as the ' settings approach ' moves beyond this fairly mechanistic view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives are themselves crucially important in determining health . <p> The settings approach has developed over nearly 30 years to become a key element of health promotion strategy at local , national and international levels . <p> It has its roots within WHO 's Health for All strategy and , more specifically , the Ottawa Charter , which contended that : " health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life ; where they learn , work , play and love ... Health is created by ... ensuring that the society one lives in creates conditions that allow the attainment of health by all its members . " <p> Subsequent conferences and declarations further legitimized the approach , affirming that particular settings offer an effective infrastructure for the implementation of comprehensive strategies for health promotion -- as witnessed by an expanding range of programmes , networks and strategies covering a diversity of settings . <p> Reflecting on this expansion , Ilona Kickbusch has commented that the ' settings approach ' became during the 1990s the starting point for WHO 's lead health promotion programmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of disease to ' salutogenesis ' , concerned to foster the health potentials inherent in the social and institutional settings of everyday life -- and so support wellbeing and human flourishing . <p> Whilst the WHO glossary defined a ' setting for health ' as the social context in which people interact to affect wellbeing and create or solve problems relating to health -- it 's also clear that most settings are in reality oriented to goals other than health and have pre-existing structures , policies , characteristics and institutional values . <p> It follows that the settings approach involves : <p> a focus on structure and agency ( and place and people ) <p> an understanding of a setting not only as a medium for reaching ' captive audiences ' but also as a context that directly and indirectly impacts wellbeing ; and <p> a commitment to integrating health within the culture , structures and routine life of settings . <p> So why use the approach ? <p> Whilst the provision of ' health ' services is vitally important , our health is largely determined by social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly impact wellbeing and also have indirect influences through providing more or less supportive contexts within which people make lifestyle choices . <p> It follows that effective health promotion and improvement requires investment in the places in which people live their lives . <p> More specifically , the approach recognises that people 's lives are complex and that the processes of enabling human flourishing and addressing 21st century health challenges are equally complex -- requiring us to engage with what 's been characterised as ' wicked ' problems . <p> Complexity requires us to embrace holism and emergence , appreciating that the patterns and system-related behaviours relating to these challenges are not predictable , are not linear and can not be understood through reductionist analysis . <p> This means that the underlying influencing factors and conditions are interrelated and can be most effectively tackled not by ' single thread ' interventions , but through comprehensive , integrated programmes in the settings of everyday life -- where people learn , work , play , love , live and die . <p> Overarching characteristics <p> Conceptually , the settings approach is rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation and empowerment -- and has three overarching characteristics . <p> Firstly , it adopts an ecological model . It appreciates that health is multi-layered and determined by a complex interaction of factors ; it focuses on populations within particular contexts ; it represents a shift of focus towards an holistic and salutogenic view ; and it addresses human health within the context of ecosystem health . <p> Secondly , the approach views settings as complex systems , acknowledging interconnectedness and synergy between different components , and recognising that each setting is connected to the world around it . <p> Thirdly , the approach adopts a whole system focus , drawing on learning from organisation and community development and using multiple , interconnected interventions to embed health within the culture and ethos of settings that generally do not have health as their ' ra ? son d ' ? tre ' . <p> This means harnessing the multi-dimensional nature of settings -- and , within this , the relationship between the structural dimension provided by their contexts , facilities , services and programmes , and the human agency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainable environments ; integrate health into routine life and core business ( whether this is quality of patient care in hospitals ; education in schools ; or rehabilitation in prisons ) ; and connect with and contribute to the wellbeing of the wider community . <p> This model illustrates the balances involved in implementing a whole system approach . It reminds us that the approach is underpinned by core health promotion values , draws on a diverse portfolio of methods and involves holding a number of aspects in tension : addressing needs and problems , but also seeking to celebrate and build on strengths and capabilities ; investing in long-term ' behind the scenes ' organization development , but retaining a high profile through managing innovative and visible projects ; securing top-down leadership alongside bottom-up empowerment and broad-based ownership ; and anticipating and responding to public health concerns whilst also being driven by and contributing to mainstream business . <p> Lessons since the Ottawa Charter <p> Having outlined the background to , set out the rationale for , and sketched a conceptual framework for understanding and implementing the settings approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've learnt in the decades since the Ottawa Charter . <p> The first lesson is that there is a diversity of activity happening under the banner of what is variously labelled settings-based health promotion , health promoting settings , healthy settings and settings for health . <p> Whilst diversity can be a strength , it can also indicate a lack of clarity , which this varied terminology perhaps symbolises . I 'd suggest that it also reflects a tendency to shy away from , rather than embrace , complexity . <p> In their 2001 paper , Sandy Whitelaw and colleagues presented a typology of different models of settings activity . Whilst they acknowledge that it is not always possible to implement a fully comprehensive approach , they support Wenzel 's earlier critique , arguing that those claiming the settings label need to do more than repackage interventions focused on individual behaviour change -- a view reinforced by Johnson and Baum in relation to health promoting hospitals . <p> The second lesson is that whilst there is value in articulating an overarching framework to guide implementation , settings are not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we talk about a ' health promoting school ' , a small primary school presents very different challenges to a large secondary school ; and when we talk about workplaces , we not only have to consider businesses ranging from small and medium enterprises to huge multinationals , but also how workplace health is addressed as a crucial feature of our programmes in healthcare , educational , criminal justice , leisure and other settings . <p> Furthermore , there are clear differences between categories of settings -- for example institutions such as hospitals and universities are very different from less formal ' geographical ' settings such as neighbourhoods and homes , yet all of these are nested within -- and contribute to the wellbeing of -- cities , towns and municipalities . <p> The third lesson is that the settings approach risks reinforcing power imbalances and perpetuating inequalities -- and it is important to engage critically with the structure and agency debate . <p> Green , Poland and Rootman caution against programmes uncritically aligning themselves with management : whilst the approval and commitment of such gatekeepers may be important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may unintentionally play into existing power relations and make it difficult to engage and gain the trust of other stakeholders . <p> They also echo Galbally in drawing attention to the danger that by focusing on well-defined organizational settings , we miss many of the most vulnerable and disenfranchised groups of the population -- such as the unemployed , the homeless , asylum seekers and children who are excluded from school . <p> This highlights the importance of further developing work with settings such as prisons and children 's care homes , and of locating settings-focused work within the context of a broader health promotion framework -- it 's only part of the solution ! <p> And the fourth lesson is that health is closely related to other agendas and concerns and that there is value in moving beyond the boundaries of traditional health promotion . <p> This realization is one that I 've already highlighted in the context for my presentation and one that has become increasingly apparent in the context of globalization and in discussions about ' liveability . ' <p> For example , the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way the ... environment supports the quality of life and wellbeing of communities . Quality of life and wellbeing encompasses mental and physical health , happiness and life satisfaction for individuals and supportive social relationships in communities ... and is enhanced by environmental sustainability . " <p> In responding to this learning , I 'd suggest that we need to reflect on our experience to date and forge a new praxis for healthy , sustainable and connected settings that is holistic and integrated . So , what are the implications ? <p> A call to clarify values and theory <p> First , it means ' connecting practice , theory and research ' . When undertaking my doctoral study , many of those involved in the emergence of healthy settings reflected that , whilst informed by ecology , holism , salutogenesis and systems thinking , the approach has lacked a theoretical framework -- a concern that Jane Wills , Jo Newton and I will be exploring in a workshop following this session . <p> I 'd suggest that we can strengthen practice and implementation through clarifying both values and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our settings initiative is aiming to achieve and how we expect this initiative and its multiple interventions to achieve those aims . <p> Closely linked to this , we need to find ways to move beyond evaluating the individual interventions taking place in a setting , to capture the added value of adopting and implementing an ecological whole system approach . <p> Whilst there have been calls to move beyond linear evaluation and engage with complexity through utilising realist and theory-based approaches , there are still relatively few examples of research that has successfully grasped this ' nettle ' . <p> Second , it means ' connecting within ' the setting . Specifically , this will require us to connect top-down leadership with bottom-up participation ... daring to combine senior leadership with unleashing the richness of grassroots creativity and innovation -- ensuring that , in the words of Ilona Kickbusch , " settings provide a political space for empowerment . " <p> More generally , it will mean appreciating and mapping the linkages that exist in any one setting . To illustrate this with reference to a school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people or different topics or issues or different components of the system . <p> Third , it means ' connecting outwards ' , appreciating that settings are interlinked . People 's lives straddle different settings -- both at a specific point in time and , as Dean Whitehead has discussed , across the life course . <p> Similarly , the 21st century challenges facing us -- such as climate change and obesity -- do not respect boundaries . Furthermore , these boundaries have become increasingly permeable : a problem made manifest in one setting may well have its roots in a different setting which , in the case of an issue such as bullying in school , is increasingly likely to be virtual or online as well as within the geographical community . <p> Connecting settings with wider systems <p> This means that there is value in connecting settings with their wider systems -- appreciating that initiatives with discrete settings can be a springboard for expanding the work , for example from health promoting schools and health promoting hospitals ... <p> Settings also exist at different levels , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital or school may be within a particular neighbourhood , within a town or city , within a district , region or island , within a country -- with the planet being the overarching contextual setting . <p> This echoes Bronfenbrenner 's work on social ecology , in which he suggests that human development takes place in micro , meso and macro settings within a number of interconnected layers . <p> This understanding reinforces the need for settings initiatives to respect and care for the earth -- but also has implications for the conceptual and practical organization of different programmes . <p> In one of my interviews , Agis Tsouros from the WHO Regional Office for Europe said " a Healthy City should be a city of healthy settings , " highlighting the need to view individual settings as part of a bigger whole and work to enhance the synergy between them and maximise their contribution to the well-being of municipalities . <p> Whilst we can make some progress developing a ' whole system ' healthy and sustainable food strategy or travel plan for a specific setting such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands that we have joined-up strategies across settings . <p> However , whilst certain WHO regions have at times worked with ' families ' of settings within the overarching frameworks offered by Healthy Cities , Healthy Districts or Healthy Islands , bureaucratic structures and competing egos have too often intervened and stopped this from happening . <p> Fourth , it means ' connecting upwards ' -- acknowledging that whilst action focused within and across settings is important , there are higher level influences at play . <p> In looking upwards , we can examine our work to ensure that it is doing all it can to tackle the wider determinants of health and ill-health -- and integrate health equity impact assessment into our planning and delivery of settings programmes , as was urged in the final report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health . <p> Beyond this , however , part of our task must be advocacy -- calling on governments , multi-nationals and global organizations to act for health , sustainability and social justice . <p> And fifth , an holistic approach also means ' connecting beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health of the planet , and prioritizing and using as exemplars place-based actions that engage with both health and sustainability concerns . <p> I want to pick up on this last point and revisit the territory that I touched on at the start of my presentation -- considering why we should connect health and sustainability in relation to settings . I 'd suggest that there are at least three reasons ... <p> First , health is both a critical outcome of and prerequisite for environmentally , socially and economically sustainable development -- and we are most likely to see healthy and sustainable settings when we do not view economic development as an end in itself , but hold these three spheres of action in balance , promoting places that are viable , liveable and equitable . <p> Second , the causes and manifestations of unsustainable development and poor health are interrelated , pose interconnected challenges and offer potential for ' win-win ' synergistic solutions . For example , there is enormous synergy between climate change and obesity ... <p> This relates both to their roots in underpinning metabolic imbalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be taken to tackle both , with wider knock-on effects . <p> Thus , good spatial planning catalysed by Healthy City initiatives can increase levels of physical activity and increase access to healthy and locally-produced food , which in turn can help to tackle obesity and non-communicable diseases ; enhance mental wellbeing ; and reduce carbon emissions through decreased car use and lower food miles . <p> Third , the health of people , places and the planet are interdependent . This can be understood in a number of ways : for example , as I 've already highlighted , there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the positive impacts of nature and green space on human wellbeing ; and there is likewise a wealth of research showing how the deterioration of ' planetary health ' poses significant risks to the health of people . <p> In advocating for ecological public health , Tim Lang and Geof Rayner argue convincingly that " the interface of human and ecosystems health now deserves to be central for policy making . " <p> Picking up this last point , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from environmental degradation , climate change and resource depletion . <p> This threat is closely connected to societal greed and to a continued infatuation with unfettered growth ( which begs the question for many as to whether we can coherently link the words ' sustainable ' and ' development ' ) . <p> Relating these concerns to health , we also know that increased material wealth does not automatically translate into increased wellbeing -- and Phil Hanlon from Glasgow University has highlighted the threat that consumer culture poses to both humans and the long-term sustainability of the planet -- suggesting that the public health community has a vital role to play in working creatively to imagine and bring about an approach that enables us to ' use less stuff ' and have better health and wellbeing . <p> It 's also clear that these threats contribute to and are closely entwined with growing socio-economic inequalities , poor health status and increasing inequities in health -- making it imperative that policies for health and sustainability are integrated and that social justice is understood to be inextricably linked to environmental justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At an individual level , we 've seen an increasing market for ' green consumerism ' and a concern with reducing ' carbon footprints ' . <p> At community and city levels , there has been a growing focus on activism and mobilisation , often around specific issues . <p> At an organisational level , there has been a surge in the development of frameworks and standards for corporate environmental ( and social ) responsibility in a diversity of settings -- accompanied by expanding rhetoric and action concerned to promote sustainability through ' greening ' organisational behaviour , whilst increasing productivity and securing a market advantage . <p> These responses have evidently led to what can be termed the ' greening ' of settings through institutional practices and community and city-level governance related to a range of issues . <p> Ecological determinants on the sidelines ? <p> However , I 'd suggest that health promotion has tended to focus so strongly on social determinants of health that ecological determinants risk being sidelined . <p> Despite a growing appreciation of the health benefits of increased access to nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action for ' sustainability ' and ' health ' have tended to happen in parallel -- perpetuating what Trevor Hancock has called a ' multiple-silo ' approach . <p> Furthermore , many ' greening ' initiatives , like many health promotion initiatives , tend to be ' add-ons ' , delivering fragmented lifestyle interventions within settings rather than reflecting an ecological whole system approach . <p> Before concluding , I want to expand on some work I did with Blake Poland to suggest some principles for practice that could underpin an holistic and integrated approach to creating healthy , sustainable and connected settings . <p> Take a positive look to the future <p> First , dare to envision the future we want -- adopting an ecological perspective and identifying what makes places liveable , vibrant and enriching , then taking this diagnosis and applying it to the settings of everyday life . <p> In doing this , we may need to let go of the explicit language of health -- but may find new ways to facilitate innovative and creative change and help build sustainable and connected settings that enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to this ' big ' vision of what healthy and sustainable settings can and should be , take smaller incremental steps towards realizing that vision -- finding ' entry points ' where we can secure both top-down commitment and bottom-up engagement . <p> Third , start where people are ... This means listening to and respecting people and negotiating agendas , balancing the urgency of our priorities with a willingness to value other concerns and build shared ownership -- and understanding that different people see the world through different ' lenses ' . <p> Fourth , build on strengths and successes ... this means looking for assets and capacities within communities and organisations , rather than focusing only on needs and deficits -- and learning from , harnessing and connecting the things that are already working effectively . <p> Fifth , root practice in place ... this means that whilst the settings approach seeks to stay true to common values and characteristics , it also appreciates the distinctiveness of different settings and the need to take account of different cultures , structures and histories when we develop and implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their framework designed to guide design and delivery . <p> Sixth , build resilience within and between settings -- recognising that narrowly-defined notions of efficiency have often led to its erosion . This focus is prominent in grassroots initiatives such as Transition Towns , and leads on to the next principle ... <p> ... which is to engage with and learn from emerging social movements . <p> Looking back at the literature in the immediate aftermath of the Ottawa Charter , settings-focused programmes such as Healthy Cities were talked about as new and exciting social movements for health ... <p> Twenty years on , they are , arguably , at risk of becoming institutionalised , professionalised and bureaucratised -- and I 'd suggest that we need to step outside of our comfort zone and engage with and learn from the movements for social justice , sustainable futures and community resilience that have truly become ' viral ' , such as Transition Towns and Occupy . <p> These have clearly captured people 's imagination and tapped into the zeitgeist or spirit of the age -- and are where some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for us to build partnerships to tackle some of our most taxing issues . <p> Last , revisiting the importance of advocacy , we need to deepen our socio-political analysis ... this means shifting our focus beyond symptoms to root causes ; and at the same time supporting processes akin to what Paolo Freire called ' conscientisation ' -- working with stakeholders and communities within and across different settings to enable them to develop critical consciousness about the wider determinants of health , sustainability and injustice ; to connect their lived experience to that of others and to the wider practices and structures that create and sustain exploitation of people and the world around us ; and to become empowered to realize their agency and to advocate for and catalyse change . <p> To conclude ... I 've argued that -- more than a quarter of a century after it was ushered in by the Ottawa Charter -- the settings approach is still highly relevant and can make an important contribution to health , sustainability and liveability . <p> By adopting an holistic , integrated and connected approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've learnt and the 21st century challenges we face -- enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of initiatives in the diverse places in which people live their lives . <p> Isis Brook , formerly at UCLan , talks of the importance of " healing ourselves of our current alienation from nature and healing the earth from our alienated actions upon it . " <p> As the converging crises of environmental degradation , climate change , resource depletion and social injustice intensify , we will need to do more than ' tick the right boxes ' -- daring to envision a different future and to change the way we conceptualise , organise and live our individual , community and working lives . <p> In looking to such a future , it will be important to focus not only on the negatives -- the very real risks and ' doom and gloom ' ; but also on the positives -- re-engaging with the environment and the wonder of the world around us ; and recognizing that within upheaval lie the seeds of hope and empowerment , and the potential for us to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellbeing of place , people and planet . <p> Helping to nurture and midwife this transition is perhaps the most important task facing health promotion today . <h> About this blog <p> The Croakey blog is a forum for debate and discussion about health issues and policy .

@@334239 <h> Japan 's PM has frog in throat as ecological crisis looms <h> Author <p> University Lecturer in Biogeography and Biodiversity ; Academic Director of Oxford 's MSc in Biodiversity , Conservation and Management , University of Oxford <h> Disclosure statement <p> Rich Grenyer does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has a problem , and he might end up killing an awful lot of frogs to solve it . <p> Shares are up in Japan , but everything else has flatlined : kick-starting the stubbornly moribund economy clearly requires big structural changes . Abe has a plan to deliver them via his " three arrows " of economic policy , and in this once-conservative economy , almost nothing is off the table . Abe 's first two arrows ( more quantitative easing and new stimulus spending ) have been well received , and the third -- a growth policy -- was announced last week . <p> This third announcement was the big one -- what levers would Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , according to many commentators , he bottled it . Heavy on aspiration and light on detail , his speech knocked investor confidence yet again : the Nikkei has lost 22% of its value since its late-May high . <p> Abe is certainly not out for the count , but he has staggered and needs to keep up the momentum by showing that he really will deliver concrete , structural change . One very likely target , if some commentators are to be believed , is Japan 's rural agriculture . <h> Ecological hotspots <p> Conservationists have recognised for many years that agricultural land is n't a biodiversity desert . It forms a key part of the " matrix " -- that vast majority of the landscape that exists outside nature reserves and in which many of the world 's species have to survive . Working out how to influence and manage the matrix for biodiversity is one of conservation 's big challenges . <p> In Japan , rice paddies and their surrounding satoyama landscapes cover about 20% of the land surface - about all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of millennia , and as human needs changed , so did the satoyama . Today the steep slopes have light woodlands , which until the 1970s were regularly foraged for food and medicine , and coppiced for fuel and building materials . In the valley bottoms , streams are maintained to irrigate the rice fields ; these are interspersed with mown grass dikes ( aze ) and paths , arable and livestock fields , and settlements . <p> Mitsubishi 's next great investment ? St Stev <p> Small scale clear-cutting makes for a forest of diverse ages . Mowing , coppicing , digging , and litter removal actually increase plant biodiversity . Paddy field margins , streams and drainage swamps all harbour distinct communities of plants and animals . And perhaps most importantly , satoyama is a very connected landscape -- one that 's easy for animals and plants to disperse through . This all adds up to a network of more-or-less managed tiny habitats , and the diversity of species that thrives within them is extraordinary . Hundreds of plant species , 39 species of dragonfly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Japan and globally endangered -- rely on satoyama . One half of all endangered species hotspots in Japan are found there . <p> But it would be wrong to think of satoyama as an agrarian paradise for wildlife and people . Japan 's huge 20th century urbanisation consumed much of it , and changing demography took people away from what was left . Fewer people meant much less coppicing and forestry . Those who remained were older , and placed more reliance on heavy machinery , pesticides and herbicides . No one likes hand strimming an aze dike on their own when a herbicide spray is available , especially not if they 're in their seventies . These changes , plus the widespread concreting of irrigation canals , have lead to a precipitous decline in many satoyama species . <h> Agricultural protection <p> Agriculture is now less than 1% of Japan 's GDP , and employs less than 3% of the population . The OECD notes that the average rice farm is about the size of a rugby pitch and is farmed , part time , by a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the land for development if they can . Heavy import controls keep Japanese food on Japanese tables , but it 's expensive . Only 8.5% of the national rice stock can be imported , with anything above this level taxed at an eye-watering 780% . <p> If you 're a bank or industrial conglomerate in Japan , you ca n't buy a farm . Agricultural land ownership is limited by law to individuals who commit to farm 150 days a year , and to agricultural firms and collectives who are not permitted to do anything else . This , plus the tariff protection from global prices , means farm household incomes are actually higher than non-farming households -- an extraordinary state of affairs that is supported by state subsidies to the tune of 50% of market worth - even the EU manages to keep this down to around 20% . <p> The average Japanese farmer is over 70 . TruShu <p> Earlier this year , Abe began negotiating Japan 's membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a controversial free trade agreement . Any deal on offer looks likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider Pacific markets for Japan 's manufacturing sector . It 's a tough political choice . The lone farmer and his flooded fields figure strongly in the national psyche , and his future wellbeing is backed by the geography of Japanese party politics and a strong farming lobby . <p> But if Abe decides to show he 's not , in Texan parlance , all hat and no cattle , then there 's only one barrier he needs to break -- the legal right of large businesses to own agricultural land . Without the 1952 Agricultural Land Act , major agribusiness and the great diversified trading houses , could buy out the aging farmers , demolish most of the aze , consolidate the small farms , and compete on price around the Pacific Rim . What 's more , he can do this by a single decree . <p> It 's an extraordinary situation . Japan 's agricultural policy since 1952 has produced such a head of pressure that a single statement might radically alter a fifth of Japan 's terrestrial surface within years . And the alignment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing of that decree much more likely . <p> Salamanders and pool frogs do n't usually figure highly in the political scheme of things . With such a need to keep the momentum behind what has been dubbed Abenomics , left to themselves they do n't stand a chance . <h> Big fish , little fish <p> So what can conservationists do ? The answer probably lies in the corporate sustainability offices of Mitsui , Sumimoto , Mitsubishi and the other major trading houses . Close engagement , lobbying , and constant delivery of the business case for biodiversity might pay handsome dividends . <p> Targeted chemical application , tailored field margins , connectivity planning : there 's a lot of best practice out there already , and it should be possible to minimize the harm that wide-scale industrialisation might bring . Remembering the conservation negatives of small-scale farming -- the rampant herbicide use , the abandoned forests , the sterile concrete streams -- might be good too . If the demand for agricultural land is n't immediately all-consuming , there might be opportunity for what some ecologists have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow young urbanites to reconnect with their agricultural heritage , or low-impact local business that buy the products of well-managed satoyama landscapes such as compost , biofuel stock or artisanal foodstuffs . <p> As conservationists we swim in waters among bigger fish than ourselves , and we can change their course less than we would like . In this case , accepting change and acting early to shape intensive agriculture may yet leave a little room for those frogs . But European conservationists should watch Japan closely : any radical revision of the Common Agricultural Policy could produce similar problems , and on a similar scale . 
@@339231 <p> In an emotional interview , the widow of former Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman has spoken to Guitar World about the events that led to her late husband 's demise . Kathryn Hanneman recalls how she pleaded with her husband to get medical help immediately after a debilitating spider bite , but Jeff simply refused . <p> The problems began following the spider bite Jeff received while in LA . Despite the arm being " bright red and three times the normal size " it was a full week before Hanneman made it to the hospital , finally getting it checked out the morning after showing the wound to his wife . <p> A few hours into his stay at hospital , the weight of the situation was realised . It became clear that losing his arm was the least of Jeff 's worries , as he could potentially die from the necrotizing fasciitis contracted from the bite . Kathryn explained , " The doctor put it in perspective for me . He said , ' I need you to see your husband . He may not make it . ' " <p> Kathryn urged Jeff to get further assistance once he left hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind : " I think he thought he could do this on his own -- that he would just to go to rehearsal and play , and that that would be his rehab . " <p> But Jeff soon realised he could n't play like he used to and , as his wife puts it , " That really hit him hard , and he started to lose hope . " <p> The full interview will be live in the August edition of Guitar World . Until then you can read the below snippet . <p> " Jeff had been visiting a friend in the L.A. area . He was in the Jacuzzi one night relaxing , and he had his arm over the side , and he felt something , like a bite or a prick . But of course he did n't think anything of it . He came home about a week later , and he was pretty well lit when he came through the front door . He was n't feeling well , and he just wanted to go upstairs and go to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to show you something , even though I really do n't want to . ' And he took off his shirt , and I just freaked out when I saw his arm . It was bright red and three times the normal size . I said , ' Jeff , we need to go now . We need to get you to the ER . ' But all he wanted to do was go to bed and sleep , and I knew that I was trying to rationalize with a very intoxicated person . So there was nothing I could do that night .

@@339232 <h> Barnaby and Albo hug hides division on local govt <p> The biggest national local government event in recent history wrapped up in Canberra today as more than 1000 delegates at the 2013 Australian Local Government Association national general assembly headed back to their respective shires and councils . But the argy bargy continues . <p> The event started on Sunday night when about 200 mayors and lord mayors had dinner with Prime Minister Julia Gillard , Local Government Minister Anthony Albanese and several other cabinet ministers in Parliament 's Great Hall . The highlight was Barnaby Joyce and Albo hugging on stage , signalling the much-needed bipartisan support that is needed to succeed in a referendum campaign . <p> The leaders of the main political parties traditionally address the general assembly , and it was at this event two years ago that Opposition Leader Tony Abbott made his solid pledge to back constitutional recognition for local government provided it was a minimalist and practical change that secured future federal funding without undermining a state 's ability to create and sack councils . <p> After then-minister Simon Crean procrastinated for two years , that is precisely what Albanese did when he reclaimed the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 words to the constitution . <p> Some state governments were always going to oppose such a move to protect their turf so that the federal government could not directly fund councils without so-called double handling by state bureaucrats . The Victorians have led the charge on this , culminating in an extraordinary beat-up in the Herald Sun on Monday , where the page one splash screamed " SACK PROOF " with a double-page spread plus an editorial urging a vote against . <p> The anti-government Institute of Public Affairs dancing bears plus a couple of washed up city-based Liberals , Peter Reith and Nick Minchin , have been leading the hysterical against campaign and are clearly looking to get on the government teat for funding . <p> However , their campaign was completely ineffective because the House of Representatives voted 133-2 in favour of the minimalist amendment . Dennis Jensen and Alex Hawke do not constitute a parliamentary groundswell . <p> While Albanese told the conference he had worked extremely hard with Abbott and Joyce to secure bipartisan support , his efforts with the states and the Senate have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday , he professed to not even knowing the name of Victoria 's local government minister , former Shepparton mayor Jeanette Powell . <p> Joyce , Powell 's National Party colleague and federal local government spokesman , turned up at 4.30pm yesterday to deliver delegates a rocket , complaining councillors had failed to counter state government lobbying of Coalition senators . Joyce professed to have burned up political capital during ongoing screaming matches with colleagues and then bluntly declared : " If it was n't for me , the Coalition would be opposing the referendum . " <p> The funding question is interesting . The Ku Klux Klan wo n't be given equal funding to oppose the referendum on indigenous recognition , which has bipartisan support to be put during the next Parliament . However , Albanese erred in announcing just $500,000 in funding for the " no " case before the Senate had voted . This disrespect for the Senate will trigger more floor-crossings and no-shows by Coalition senators later today . <p> The ALGA has appointed veteran advertising guru Digby Nancarrow as campaign director . After signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of presentations and panels yesterday afternoon . <p> Having worked on the successful Republican No campaign in 1999 , Nancarrow understands what works . And with $20 million to play with , plus 564 councils from across Australian on board , this should be a reasonably straightforward exercise . <p> Albanese honed in on the winning line of the campaign when he returned to the ALGA general assembly this morning to announce another $150 million worth of federal grants for council infrastructure projects across Australia . Over the coming 86 days , voters will be reminded of the thousands of pools , libraries , park , roads and sporting fields that are owned by councils but paid for with direct federal grants . <p> With the High Court moving determinedly towards declaring unconstitutional the beloved " Roads to Recovery " program approved by then-ministers Reith and Minchin and announced by John Howard in March 2001 , it is hard to see voters opposing the amendment and consciously shutting down direct access to Canberra cash .

Currently the only level of government open to dual citizens under our constitution is local government . What happens to their ability to stand for Councils when a constitutional amendment recognises local government ? Will this mean that councilors who have dual citizenship will find that they are now ineligible ? If so , I wonder how many dedicated public servants will be disenfranchised ? While I can not find an exact figure it seems that up to a quarter of the population are either dual citizens or eligible for dual citizenship . That 's an awfully large part of the gene pool not allowed to represent their fellow country folk under our constitution . And yep , full disclosure , I 'm one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare mongering . Why would n't citizens want to keep direct funding of sports facilities , libraries , roads and the like . Channeling funding through state government is inefficient and will lead to losses on the way through to recover bureaucratic imposts . But that is what the No case proposes . The Yes case on the other hand will mean continuation of a system which has delivered to local communities for many years until recent high court challenges put direct grants at risk . <p> Tom Jones the " government " have to much control of us and our money now without us giving them more !

The thing is if government think it is good for us then it probably is n't ! Vote NO ! Edward James <p> Edward James : There 's no such thing as a one sided referendum . Even if it 's supported by 150 House of Reps MPs and 76 senators there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overall majority plus ( in this case ) a majority in every state ( because all states are affected by this referendum ) .

In both cases I 've had it much better than the poor sods who live in the dysfunctional Wyndham or Casey areas . <p> As long as the specifics of this constitutional change do not make it impossible for us to ( as soon as possible ) completely abandon the small minded wasteful bureaucracy that is local government then I 'll support it . <p> Our Federal Government and Local Councils are putting up twenty million between them in support of a yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope more than half the voters have the brains to maintain the status quo .

I will vote No because I want to keep our local councils " the way they are " the status quo . To put it another way the Federal Labor party is pushing for the extra powers which will come from having the purse strings . Both the outgoing government and our Local councils are spending together some 20 million dollars of our taxes to promote a yes vote . I will vote No on the referendum . Edward James <p> I have no idea of what the arguments are either for or against the referendum proposal , but it seems to me that local government functions are just state government functions that have been delegated or devolved to entities that , despite being called ' local government ' , are really just state agencies .

It does not matter provided it is regularly collected and properly managed . The " Yes ' campaigners have a lot of work to do to convince me ( in just 12 weeks ) that the bowdlerised , property developer-driven and political party-controlled ' local government ' we currently experience is worth any sort of constitutional status . <p> Good one Bruce Hassan .

@@339233 <h> Why phasing out live export and supporting farmers goes hand-in-hand <p> In his article , ' Animal activists mislead to destroy our northern cattle industry ' Brendan O'Reilly is right to highlight the vital importance of finding a solution to the live export issue that benefits Australia 's farmers . Yet we believe that a transition to a chilled and frozen meat trade is the only alternative that will be truly beneficial to the Australian economy , jobs and animals . <p> Australian farmers are the living , breathing heartbeat of Australian society .

The wider contribution of farming-related industries is far higher . <p> WSPA - the World Society for the Protection of Animals ( a separate organisation from Animals Australia ) - have invested in economic research which shows that chilled and frozen meat is already far more significant than live exports to the Australian economy ( it contributes six times more than live exports to our GDP ) . <p> Advertisement <p> This positive trend for chilled and frozen meat export , combined with the declining numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a positive sustainable solution , we need to play our strongest hand . <p> Trends are extremely positive for Australian meat exports - sheepmeat exports are predicted to triple , and beef exports double , between 2007 and 2050 . <p> Looking further into this , economic research commissioned by WSPA indicates a potential 245% earnings increase for Northern producers if a northern abattoir built . If one or more abattoirs are built ( as has been proposed by AAco ) within easy reach of the major northern production regions ( somewhere in Northern WA or Northern NT ) , research shows that jobs would be created and the economy stimulated . A northern beef processing facility could increase earnings for producers by over 245% . The research has demonstrated that processing up to 400,000 cattle each year would increase the gross regional product by up to $204m per annum for the regions which currently rely on the export trade . Over 1,300 additional full time equivalent jobs would be created . <p> The chilled and frozen meat story is one that is , and will continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of live export is a very different one , categorised by inherent risk to the farming community . <p> Indonesia accounts for the bulk of Australian live cattle exports , yet reliance on that market is a huge risk . Australia 's export strategy is dependent on Indonesia 's allocation of import permits , which in turn depends on the progress by Indonesia towards its target of beef self-sufficiency . Australia becomes reliant on political decisions , rather than market forces . Is this really the best long-term export strategy ? <p> Advertisement <p> Similarly , the tariffs and subsidies of importing countries can change without warning . There are reports of Bahrain considering a move from blanket to targeted subsidies , meaning only the most deserving members of society would qualify for cheaper goods such as meat . This would mean that the subsidies that prop up the live trade could , at any time , be changed or removed , which would have a devastating economic impact .

In 1991 it comprised 35 million sheep , by 2012 it was estimated to be about 13.74 million sheep . This indicates that WA farmers have been getting out of the sheep business and earning higher rates of return from other activities , i.e. cropping . There is a trend towards fewer sheep farms and more mixed grain-livestock farms . It begs the question as to why people continue to support the failing live export industry -- the alternative is far more positive for the economy . <p> The risks of the live trade are numerous , the solution relatively simple over time with some assistance by government to farmers and now is the time for the government to facilitate the transition to support farmers , jobs , the economy and the animals . @ @ @

The Commission recommends selling off state-owned electricity providers and introducing smart-metres to bring costs down . <p> It estimates the changes could save the average household up to $200 a year , with overall savings of nearly $4 billion dollars over the next three decades .

Due to the multiplicity of GOCs , we not only have large increases in the number of similar functions repeated over these GOCs but also the creation of new roles . New roles such as ; Boards of Directors , CEO , CFO , CIO , Trading , Risk Management , Business Development , Marketing , Sales and so forth . Salaries within upper management and to some degree within middle management are extremely high , not really supportable and a very high burden on users ( the customers ) . Also what tends to occur is a sense of entitlement filters down through the ranks of these organisations resulting in upward pressure on wages meaning further burdens upon the consumer . Further to these costs were the various systems required to support the new GOCs . Such as the initial setting up costs and ongoing accommodation leasing of separate multiple office buildings for the staff . These offices did not exist before , were all of fairly large footprints and many within the CBD OF Brisbane . An example in a different industry relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of people power . At the time this was being formed it would have had all the management functions and issues similar to those I mentioned above ( Boards , CEO Etc ) .

I seem to recall that certain dedicated local people caused the reversal of this decision thereby dodging an unnecessary and expensive ' bullet ' for the residents of Redlands , Logan and the Gold Coast . I believe there was mention of ; how many homes water bills would it take just to pay for the CEO salary and related expenses ( I think there was mention of over a thousand homes ) .

@@354234 <h> 8 Designs That Rethink The Way We 're Buried <p> The way we bury our dead has n't changed much over the past 2000 years . But it needs to change soon , according to a group of designers , philanthropic foundations and funeral directors who sponsored a recent design competition to rethink burial traditions in the face of emerging problems with the status quo . It 's a less less macabre concept than it sounds . <p> In fact , there are some pretty compelling reasons to change the way we bury each other . For one thing , we 're running out of space : in cities especially , cemetery overcrowding is a major problem . More importantly , both burial and cremation are surprisingly bad for the environment , not to mention the health of the living -- our dental fillings , for example , release thousands of pounds of mercury into the atmosphere when we 're cremated . <p> What 's holding up a revolution in the way we bury our dead ? The answer is complex . Most of us are uncomfortable with talking candidly about death , and ritual is there to help to calm that anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention challenges from the established commercial industry that surrounds funerals . Still , the " natural burial " movement , which seeks to make bural more eco-friendly , is gaining momentum . So are less conventional burial methods , from space-borne ashes to fireworks . <p> So in April , Designboom launched Design for Death , a competition that invited designers to propose new burial methods . In the end , they received 2,050 proposals and distributed over $US100,000 in prize money . A group of jurors -- including architect Richard Meier , artist Ray Ceasar , andthe director of the National Funeral Directors Association -- voted to pick the best . <p> Some of them are trite , others are powerful -- and most are a bit of both . After all , the ways we mourn ( and the ways we take and give comfort ) differ for everyone . With that in mind , some of these designers make powerful arguments for change . Check them out below . <h> The Infinity Burial Project by Jae Rhim Lee <p> " By trying to preserve dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and further harm the environment , " says MIT research fellow and artist , Jae Rhim Lee , the designer behind the so-called Mushroom Death Suit . The idea is simple : certain strains of mushrooms are actually able to remediate toxins . Knowing that the average body is host to 219 different chemicals -- all of which seep into the soil when we decompose -- Jae Rhim 's proposal would use " death suit " covered in the mushrooms to prevent the spread of toxins into the soil . <h> Emergence by Enzo Pascual , Pierre Rivi ? re <p> Three French designers proposed this eco-casket , made from biodegradable plastics and embedded with a tree seedling , as an alternative to a traditional steel , wood , or plastic box . The beautiful thing about their design ? Co2 emitted from your body 's decomposition will power a perpetually-glowing headstone on the surface . It 's a self-powered memorial . <h> Urn for a Ceremony by Agnes Hegedus <p> Hungarian designer Agnes Hegedus created this elegant little urn for a style of burial that was once more popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body is n't cremated on the water . Rather , an urn containing your ashes floats out to sea aboard a clay pot , which is designed to sink slowly down to the ocean floor . The pots would cost only a few dollars to make . <h> " I Wish To Be Rain " by Studio PSK and Matter &amp; Fact <p> The increasingly common practice of " cloud seeding " , which alters the intensity of natural rainfall by literally " seeding " it with particular chemicals , serves as the basis for this idea from two UK design teams . " Humans now have the ability affect , control and even cause natural phenomena , whether it is rain , an earthquake or a flood , " write the designers . " We wonder if a person could do this not just by their actions , but literally transform themselves into types of natural spectacle . " The concept would use a weather balloon to carry your ashes into the sky -- releasing them high above the earth , to be " rained " back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably deeply illegal , it 's still a lovely idea . <h> Design for Death Living by Ancunel Steyn <p> " Multifunctional land is not a non-renewable resource , " argues Ancunel Steyn , the South African designer behind this proposal . " The question is , how can we reduce space required to store the dead ? " Steyn proposed an urban design that would intersperse memorials with public infrastructure : from parks , to art galleries , to mixed-used commercial buildings . The memorials themselves would take up a very small , tissue box-sized space , stacked on a series of walls arranged around the site . <h> Family Tree by Loucas Papantoniou and Asta Sadauskaite <p> Two Lithuanian designers created this hexagonal design for an urn-storage system . The idea , as the title suggests , is to create a literal family tree of urns . There 's also a digital element , which could come off as smart or tacky , depending on how you feel about SMS-based memorials : " The urn vault is made of wood , with an OLED display cap , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulsing light that conveys spirituality and displays the name of the deceased with a short memorial message . " <h> Souvenair by Chen Jiashan <p> This simple design , by French artist Chen Jiashan , is half windchime and half urn . " Why should we keep the deceased ones away from our eyes ? , " asks Jiashan . " The souvenair , small in size but clearly visible , can be hanged at home or in a public place . Its tiny and appeasing ' ding ' recalls the presence of the loved one whenever some wind blows . " <p> Video . These days , blockbuster movies print money with the same formula and it usually begins with a movie trailer that looks , sounds , and feels identical to the blockbuster movies that come before it . It 's no accident . Studios are so careful in their marketing of big budget movies that they end up looking the exact same as previous hits . If you been fooled once , you can be fooled again .

@@354238 <p> To borrow the title of the 2001 album by Norwegian indie folk-popsters Kings of Convenience , quiet is the new loud on the Australian wine scene . Backing off , letting the grapes speak , minimal intervention : these words are all employed in the vernacular of winemakers across the ? country . <p> White wines , especially serious chardonnay , have been toned down significantly over the past decade to make them more complex , drinkable and age-worthy .

This change is taking place even in regions famed for high-decibel wines such as McLaren Vale , the Clare Valley and the Barossa . <p> Grapes are being picked less ripe so alcohol levels are reduced , the levels of new-oak are being pulled back and barrel selection is being refined .

( I 'm excluding from this discussion wines such as pinot noir and syrah from southern Victoria , where these changes have been under way over the past decade . ) <p> Another factor that has had an impact on the volume of serious reds , especially those from South Australia , is the extremely cool and wet conditions of the 2011 vintage .

High availability was a key requirement for the Water Corporation , so redundancy throughout the entire process and mechanical design a priority when evaluating and planning the SSDP 's network design . <p> Whilst Worley Parson successfully won the tender to design the Control System , in practice the initial design is usually followed by consultation and design modifications with the System integrators -- BlochTech -- whose responsibility was to program the design and make it work . <p> In consultation with BlochTech , the Siemens PCS7 control platform was selected .

@@377231 <h> Five quick tips and mistakes to avoid with cloud accounting <p> With a new book , XERO for Dummies , out on the market , Heather Smith is a big believer in cloud accounting , especially for business owners who are n't comfortable with their financial literacy . <p> " Accounting is just like driving , you ca n't do it without checking the dashboard . When you run your own business , you need to identify KPIs ( key performance indicators ) you should be monitoring , and cloud accounting helps you easily track your financial ones , " says Smith , who has 22 years ' experience as an accountant and certified advisor for Xero and MYOB , two of the major players in cloud accounting . She has been running her own business for eight years . <p> Smith spoke to StartupSmart about her top five tips for start-ups setting up cloud accounting , and how they could get the most out of it . <p> 1 . Use it to save time and boost growth <p> " I recommend start-ups , if you 're serious about going into business , get your financial side sorted out as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on financially , and be scalable , " Smith says . " If you 're doing cloud accounting right , it 'll free up your time to grow your business . " <p> Smith says cloud accounting , and the opportunity to see at a glance your entire bank feeds , sales data and invoices , will allow start-up operators to strategically grow their business by automating systems . <p> " There does seem to be a trend in business at the moment to move to subscription payment services and a cloud accounting system can do this without you even thinking about it . This creates a money funnel for your business , " she says . <p> 2 . Make the most of plug-ins and report features <p> Smith says some of the plug-ins , such as the Timely time management plug-in and the debt-tracking options , can boost your cashflow very quickly . <p> " Personally , I implemented a debtor tracking solution and I was able to improve my debtor days by 10 days , and that was massive , " Smith says , adding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-ups who are working on their own . <p> " You can monitor how many and what value of invoices you 're doing a month , or a week .

" <p> 3 . Getting expert help to set it up properly will be easier and ultimately cheaper <p> " We have such an onerous tax system in Australia , " Smith says , noting that sitting down with your accountant or bookkeeper now to install a system will save you stress and time next financial year end . <p> Smith says start-ups who set up a cloud accounting system as early as possible will avoid complicated and costly fixing later on . <p> " This first stage is the hardest stage . But if you get help after a couple of months , to fix it up takes a lot longer and can be thousands of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith says the data security concerns around cloud accounting are minimal , and there are significant data security benefits too . <p> " Xero data is historical data not future data . Someone who gets in ca n't access your bank account and extract money . So if you 're prepared to do online banking you should be set to do cloud accounting , " she says . <p> Smith says business owners should be more worried about losing their financial data through computer crashes , or natural disasters , adding that she 's based in Brisbane and has seen too many businesses lose their records from flood or fires . <p> " You need to have a secure back-up plan in place , so use a cloud-based option , backed up in real time in multiple services . I still suggest to people they make their own back-ups , but cloud will be far better . " <p> 5 .

A recent article in the Financial Times discussed the tough time data storage centres are facing in the UK as they try to sell their space . The article highlighted that the problem in the UK is that there is no shortage of supply and , equally important , no shortage of potential supply of DCs . This does n't make for great business economics . <p> A brand new $430 million facility , the Cobalt Data Centre Campus , opened earlier this year and is reportedly yet to sign up any customers , while " another regional flagship -- Next Generation Data in south Wales -- has leased only one-ninth of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity to be one of the world 's largest DCs , however at current growth rates , market watchers suggest it may take three more years just to fill one-third of its capacity . <p> Foolish takeaway <p> There is a lot to like about Next DC , including its early mover advantage . There are also important variables between DCs which can minimise the " commoditisation " issue . These variables include security , property positioning and customer relationships . However , the wide acknowledgement that there will be high demand for DCs in the future is attracting plenty of supply . Decisions by large domestic firms like Telstra ( ASX : TLS ) and foreign competitors such as Amazon ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) could lead to significant increases in DC supply that ultimately could push down pricing and affect the profitability of incumbents . <p> Motley Fool contributor Tim McArthur does not own shares in any of the companies mentioned in this article . <p> Obviously being a commodity producer is n't all bad .

@@408235 to invest within 24 hours ! Evidence says do at least 40 hours of due diligence ! <p> Have you read the latest essay from Paul Graham , founder of Y Combinator ? <p> The premise of investing within 24 hours clearly has some merit but , I think it remains out of reach for most Angel investors . It can work for those who are very , very rich and those who live deep in the heart of their investment domain -- like Paul . Most of us can not afford to invest a million dollars a week , or even a month on a sustained basis and that is what 24 hour decisions for $100,000 investments means . Of course , the upside is you can get all your investing done in a few weeks and can spend the rest of the year on the **28;337;TOOLONG reflecting on how easy it is to lose large amounts of money quickly . <h> Will the venture capital game change ? <p> Paul 's focus in his essay is venture capital ( VC ) and some of his observations are well known to us . Will the VC model change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founders do n't need money as badly as they once did -- not so sure but , I accept that they can need less . That has been true and more readily apparent for many years to those of us who operate outside the overblown egos and large fund sizes of Silicon Valley . <h> Such harsh words , for such glowing figures ? <p> To be honest , I 'm not entirely sure how to understand his reference to investors being " founders ' bitches " but , certainly he is right that micromanaging founders is not and , frankly , never has been a sound investment approach . I think , as investors , we need to know more about more than our founders but , that does n't mean we know the right answers all the time . <p> To me it is more about process and strategy , our ability to see ahead to the pot holes in the road and the opportunities that might arise . We offer not only early-warning but , possible strategies for taking advantage of opportunities or for ameliorating the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , it is up to the founders to make the decisions and take the actions . <h> The ' Golden Rolodex ' <p> A pivotal aspect of the Y Combinator value and success has been the ' Golden Rolodex ' . Initially Paul 's and later from other mentors in the team too . The ability to shoehorn promising young ventures into a seat in front of the very best investors and the right corporate partners is an enormous advantage . Many Angel investors offer the same benefit to their portfolio companies , albeit in differing market sectors and geographies . <p> The valuation discussion remains distorted because Paul paints a picture of a VC focused only on a percentage correlated to the amount they must deploy to meet their objectives as fund managers . As Angels we know that the real discussion is not about the amount of money per se but , about the future , the likely growth of the business and the bigger that potential , the more valuable our contribution is at the earliest stage . <h> Hey , which way to the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic exit -- rallies the thinking around valuation on the value of the investor not the investment . Founders who want dumb money are increasingly able to get it quickly and at a lower cost . Founders who want smart money will recognise that smart , also requires a little more deliberation which , in the end , will deliver greater value and higher growth multiples to fuel a large exit . <p> For my part , while I prefer faster decisions than the months it takes to get a group across the line I also value , the many times when a little delay has afforded me the opportunity to see the flaws in a deal and avoid losing my money in an unwise investment . Indeed , research into Angel investing has shown a strong correlation between returns and effort in due diligence with the best returns being achieved for investments that complete at least 40 hours of due diligence . So , the evidence would tend to suggest that Paul 's proposition , at least for Angels , is inappropriate . <h> Speed is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks to raise capital is more like six months , or longer . The folks in Silicon Valley always sneer at such time frames and thus , teach even our local entrepreneurs to frown on that pace . Yet , without the intensity and depth of the Silicon Valley market it is not practical for early-stage investors or founders to act as if they are in Silicon Valley . Indeed , if we are not in Silicon Valley we probably do n't face the sort of competition for deal flow that Paul assumes and , for Angels , unlike VC , we do n't have to do a deal at all . <p> VC have a contract to invest someone else 's money and to get it put to work within a very limited time frame -- quite literally they must consume all their capital . In comparison , Angels are beholden only to themselves ( and perhaps a spouse ) and , as such , are not interested in consuming all of their capital at breakneck speed . If Angels do n't like the shape of a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , that can mean if it is not according to the Angel 's rules -- then we do n't have to invest at all . After all , Angels are n't making a living from their investments and in most deals they lose all of their money so , some patience and process certainly seem prudent . <h> Embrace the angels <p> I encourage entrepreneurs to develop relationships with the Angels well before the venture needs capital . That helps shorten the decision cycle and also makes for a better decision by both parties . One of the most important aspects for founders and one not often contemplated in narratives like Paul 's , is that founders are the ones making the key decision not investors . Founders are deciding which investors to take on-board and in so doing are making one of the most pivotal decisions for the future of their venture . Bad investors are far worse than bad employees . You can fire the latter but , the former remain a problem and often a fatal infection for the venture . <p> People tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk profile of investors . So an investor who decides within 24 hours on making an investment with the obviously limited information and time for consideration that that implies is very likely to make all decisions that same way throughout the life of the company . That encourages a dynamic in which the entrepreneur is even more highly motivated to withhold information if they think it will produce an ill-considered response from investors , a rapid decision that will damage the business . <p> Ultimately , founders and investors both want to make decisions expeditiously so that the business can keep pace with the market and take best advantage of all opportunities but , that demands a degree of consideration and deliberation . As the business gets more complex , more mature , more dynamic the time required for obtaining , absorbing and responding to all the relevant information increases . To preserve short decision-making cycles large companies employ teams and systems not readily available to early-stage ventures and , even if they were , start-up entrepreneurs are rarely skilled in using such systems . <h> Communicate with the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor can be most apparent . A founder who keeps his Angel investor well informed can leverage the experience of the investor to help make expeditious but , well considered decisions . Of course , that only works if the investor has the experience , thus , a 24 hour commitment cycle is not enough time for the founder to really know if the investor has anything more than money to offer . <p> Paul suggests that " few investors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes on startups " . <p> Really ? <p> In the angel world , most of the investors have been there , done that and often more than once . Indeed , it is because Angels understand only too well the impact of fundraising that we tend to agonise over ways to deliver value to every founder at every engagement whether we have decided to invest yet or not . I am sure that Paul is not na ? ve so I can only assume he has the VC investors in mind but , even then , I really doubt that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . <p> I can only conclude that Paul is referring to the expanding bubble of johnny-come-lately investors we see in every bubble cycle , the people who have little more than money to offer and are attracted by the recent front page news success stories without understanding what it takes to help those companies succeed . <h> The quality of the entrepreneur <p> So we come to another of Paul 's observations , the quality of the entrepreneur . As more and more people start new companies in the hope of fame and riches it is harder and harder to find the individuals with a real vision about changing the world . That rhetoric of the VC investor and the Angel remains a strong and effective bias . When asked what makes the A-grade team we are all looking to back the vast majority of early-stage investors still refer to the vision and passion of the founders for a new world . Yes , we want founders who expect to create substantial value and then sell it so that together they and their investors can reap the financial rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days are chasing only the money and have no real or credible vision to change the world . <p> On the other side of the table there are an increasing number of people trying to be early-stage investors and they too lack experience , expertise and capability . Organised Angel communities offer training , collaboration and professional process to help early-stage investors make better decisions . Not everyone likes to work in a team but , you do n't have to be a member of an Angel group to access some of these resources . <h> For those who would be angels <p> However you choose to become an early-stage investor , know that there is a lot more to it than it looks like from the outside and most of your investments are likely to lose all your money . Follow the 24 hour approach and that percentage is likely to go way up . So be sure you can afford that spray-and-pray strategy before you start because whatever strategy you choose , it is only going to work if you can play it through in full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test of walking-the-walk . Does Y Combinator make its investment decisions within 24 hours ? Clearly not as some applicants wait months to learn if they have been accepted . So , if that 's the case and Paul is n't following his own advice , what is the real intent of spreading the word of speed , or , as Paul supposes , is it simply that Y Combinator is imprinted with an obsolete model of risk ? <p> Most business owners undervalue themselves . They either do n't know the real value of their work , or intentionally undervalue themselves for competitive reasons . Learn how to get what you 're worth here .

@@413238 <p> The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is extremely cunning . Many think it actually encourages mice to be more reckless , allowing them to be eaten by cats which proliferate the parasite through their faeces . But if it can send a mouse mad , what could it do to humans ? Dr Chris Tonkin investigates the latest US research , which may have massive public health consequences for Australia . <p> Most people have heard that we are teaming with bugs . They 're on our skin , in our mouth and most prevalently in our guts . <p> Not many people know about another bug that lives with many of us . The world prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii , or Toxo for short , a single-celled parasite can range from 30 -- 80 per cent of people . Although there is no official figure , it is likely that a good proportion of Australians carry this parasite . <p> Most people have not heard of Toxo because it rarely causes medical problems . But recent studies have shown that this parasite is found in the environment more than we expected . And a disturbing link between chronic infection of Toxo and mental illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by several studies that people that experience certain symptoms associated with schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are much more likely to be infected with Toxo . <p> Dr Chris Tonkin , parasitologist <p> When many of us are first infected with Toxo , either by eating undercooked meat harbouring cyst forms , coming in contact with Toxo shed in cat faeces , or through contaminated soil or water , infection usually manifests as flu-like symptoms . Individuals with healthy immune systems adequately deal with this infection , but the cunning Toxo parasite then transforms , creating a cyst wall around itself and lodging in muscle and the brain . Here it will lay dormant and unnoticed for the rest of your life . <p> But if our immune system is compromised in some way , such as taking immunosuppressive drugs when we have an organ transplant , or becoming infected with HIV , then Toxo can raise its ugly head . Pregnant women are also warned to stay away from cats and kitty litter . If infecting for the first time , Toxo can cross the placenta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent times there have been some interesting studies shedding light on the prevalence of Toxo in our environment . Recent research performed in the USA has shown that soil often contains far more cysts shed in cat faeces than previously thought . Some samples in places where cats defecate had as many as 434 cysts per square foot . <p> Is this a recent problem with the increase in the cat population or has the rate always been this high ? We 're not sure at this stage , but this could have massive public health implications . One cyst can lead to human or animal infection ( which could then be passed to humans in meat ) . These cysts are also extremely hardy -- they can live in the soil for years and can even resist two per cent acid levels . <p> But we do n't yet have local research to confirm the prevalence of cysts in Australian soils . <p> It is important to learn more about this parasite because of its link to mental illness . Toxo has already been shown to affect the behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into open spaces and have less aversion to cat urine . This is particularly interesting given that this behaviour would more likely result in them being eaten by a cat , allowing the parasite to undertake the next part of its lifecycle . It 's amazing that a single celled organism can change the behaviour of its host . <p> It was for this reason that scientists began looking at the prevalence of Toxo in people undertaking risky behaviour . <p> More attention has also recently been given to infectious agents as a possible cause of some symptoms associated with schizophrenia . Several studies have shown that people that experience certain symptoms associated with schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are much more likely to be infected with Toxo . But is this contributing to the symptoms or is it just that people with the disorder are more likely to become infected ? The jury is still out and many labs around the world are busy trying to find the causal link and find potential molecular pathways that could be influencing mental illness and behavioural modification . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells for survival and proliferation . Therefore , understanding the molecular processes that govern host cell ' invasion ' has been of major interest to researchers keen to find new treatments to cure Toxoplasmosis . What is under-studied , however , is developing drugs to cure people carrying cysts . These drugs might be especially handy for people who have just received an organ transplant and face taking immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives , or for HIV patients . <p> And if there is a causal link found between Toxo infection and mental health disorders then there is the possibility that curing chronic infection may alleviate some of the devastating symptoms of illnesses like schizophrenia . It should be stressed , however , that although there is a correlative link between some mental illness and Toxo infection , Toxo is not yet proven to be the cause of these illnesses . <p> As seems to be always the case -- with every answer comes another question .

@@428230 <p> Germany has committed itself to an ambitious long-term policy agenda to decarbonise the energy sector . The Energiewende -- or energy transformation -- policies are n't cheap , but the German government says it 's a price worth paying for long term energy security and a low carbon economy . <p> In 2010 , the government outlined the Energiewende 's goals : To reduce emissions by 80 per cent compared to 1990 , and provide for 80 per cent of the country 's electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2050 compared to 2008 . If that was n't ambitious enough , it made the task even more complicated by deciding to phase out all nuclear generation by 2022 . The government pledged to achieve this in the most cost-effective way possible , while maintaining economic growth and high standards of living . <p> So far , the public have bought into the government 's long term vision and are backing the plans , despite rising energy bills . But the media is increasingly concerned the Energiewende 's policies will drive up energy costs , leaving consumers to foot the bill . <p> Wholesale energy prices <p> At the centre of the scheme is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany 's energy mix without harming the economy . But not everyone is convinced the Energiewende will deliver on its promise . <p> " It is hard to think of a messier and more wasteful way of shifting from fossil and nuclear fuel to renewable energy than the one Germany has blundered into . The price will be high , the risks are large and some effects will be the opposite of what was intended . " <p> While this is a common perception , the figures tell a different story . Since 2010 , the wholesale price of electricity has continued to decrease , because once renewables are built they have no fuel costs : <p> While this means wind and solar are increasingly competitive -- helping to get more low carbon generation on the grid -- the declining cost of renewable electricity may have a less desirable consequence . Some fossil fuel plants are still needed to back up renewable generation . But cheap electricity from renewables could make fossil fuel plants economically unviable . A number of German gas plants have been temporarily shut down -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheap coal generation . <p> The problem is exacerbated by a requirement to prioritise electricity from renewables over fossil fuels generation , known as the ' merit order ' . David Buchan , senior research fellow at the Oxford Energy Institute , explains : <p> " ... if this capacity becomes effectively excluded from the merit order altogether , or is never in practice called by grid operators to generate , it will never earn a financial return and may , therefore , wither away " . <p> This means Germany must consider ways to support fossil fuel generation as well as renewables . <p> One solution could be a " focused " capacity market , where plants used to provide electricity at peak times are subsidised , but plants expected to provide electricity around the clock compete in the a market . Another alternative -- favoured by the environment ministry -- is a strategic reserve where gas plants which would otherwise be mothballed are paid to stay online in case the system needs a boost . <p> As more renewables come online and fossil fuel plants become increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging . <p> It 's commonplace for the UK government 's policies to be blamed for rising energy bills , and Germany is no different . Bills fell between 1991 and 1998 , but have risen continuously since then -- and this is set to continue as more renewables are added to the mix . <p> But the Energiewende 's policies are only responsible for a portion of the bill hikes . German economics thinktank , the Centre for Economics Studies , calculates renewable subsidies account for about 28 per cent of the rise since 2000 , but costs of electricity generation -- mainly driven by the rising cost of fossil fuels -- account for about 45 per cent . <p> So far , consumers have been willing to accept the bill increases as they back the Energiewende 's long-term goals and see the community benefits of the scheme . Private investors and farmers owned almost half of Germany 's renewable energy projects in 2012 . This makes bill payers more amenable to rising energy costs as some of the subsidy goes back to their communities . Environmental thinktank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A focus on low prices is microeconomic thinking . Germans take the macroeconomic view and want to know whether that price is paid to large corporations , foreign entities , or back to their community . They are willing to pay higher prices back to the latter . " <p> The public 's willingness to take a slice of the subsidy pie for themselves has so far been key to maintaining support for the Energiewende . <p> Reform prospects <p> With the September election looming , some politicians have been keen to cut the costs of the Energiewende in the hope it will boost their popularity . But the reformers have their work cut out : Germany 's political system makes changing the way renewable energy is funded particularly challenging . <p> For example , some of Germany 's regions are investing heavily in renewable energy -- with some , like Bavaria , wishing to become self-sufficient . This makes them more resistant to subsidy reform . <p> There is also bickering within the federal government . The environment ministry wants to lead the Energiewende , but the economics ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with the risk of political infighting built in . The future direction of the transformation is likely to depend on who sits in those ministries at the end of the year . <p> Public support <p> In Germany , public support for the Energiewende has been robust despite rising energy bills . The government maintains the immediate costs will be worth it in the long run , and the public seems sold on the bigger picture -- so far . <p> But with the European economy still in stormy waters , German elections in September , and ever rising costs it remains to be seen how long the support persists .

WISE found that a BAU path for all fossil fuel imports ( coal , oil , gas ) would run a current accounts deficit of 13% of GDP by 2030 . The problem is WISE considers 3% sustainable . A worst case scenario tags this bill as high as 39% . At a time when the rupee has fallen precipitously a drain on foreign exchange is indeed a risky proposition . <p> Clearly the government has a problem on their hands . Luckily WISE has a few suggestions most important of which is to plan for ' peak coal . ' Not because the resource is running out per se ( though it is ) , but because the current path is simply unsustainable economically . The WISE plan outlines a scenario where the government beings to dramatically ramp down coal plant construction post 2022 . This means after the current five year plan ( and its proposed 51 GW of new coal ) runs its course the next two plans dramatically reduce new build to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace that lost capacity and ensure a ' green transition ' the plan calls for between 346 and 401 GW of new clean energy ( nearly the size of the current coal pipeline ) . That means a dramatic ramp up of solar manufacturing ( from 2 GW/year today to 18-25 GW/year by 2020 ) , doubling the current 10 GW of wind manufacturing and combining both with low-cost finance in ' adequate quantities ' . The latter is particularly important given the scarcity of affordable capital for clean energy in India . <p> So there we have it . Our new energy axiom is as follows : clean energy is cheap , coal is expensive . We are in a brave new world and its time policy makers caught on . Because if they do n't , and WISE is right , their fossil fuel import bill just might bankrupt them . <p> Justin Guay is a campaigner with the Sierra Club .

@@433235 <p> Do you ever reach a situation where game balance and fun conflicts with historical accuracy ? Which do you prioritise ? <p> I think history tends to provide that balance anyway , so there 's not often that many clashes . But fun always wins out . That is our general principle , if we have a choice between being slavish to history and being fun , it 's fun . For example , battles , a real battle would last 8-9 hours , and in some cases , the battle of Philippi for example , the battle went on for 3 days . We 're not going to force a player to play for 3 days . <p> In terms of casualties , it 's something that through lots of study , through history , we know an average army would give up the ghost and flee if it lost more than 10% of its force . That does n't really make for very exciting battles , you get a handful of guys dying on the battlefield , then everyone runs away . That 's not very satisfying . So we tend to make people a lot braver and more foolhardy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , with the inspiration ability and all those things , those are there to give the player some agency . and let them have the experience of being a great commander . <p> It 's an interesting point about how history balances itself . Because there are certainly some time periods that seem to do that quite well , and we see a lot of those games . But there are some periods that we do n't see much of , and seem like they 'd be less naturally balanced , like World War 1 as opposed to World War 2 ... <p> I think even there , when you start looking at it , there are checks and balances you can put in there . For example , when the tank was first put on the battlefield , it swept everything before it . But it rapidly became obvious to a lot of people that there were some major weaknesses in the tank . For example , it was very vulnerable to any high velocity bullets and things like that . So they started getting anti-tank crews almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the driver 's compartment , and that 'd be the tank knocked out . Or just using artillery , because it was so slow , it was easy to aim with artillery to knock the tank out . <p> So you get those immediate checks and balances . Humans are very ingenious ... <p> Especially in wartime ... <p> Exactly . So when we 're making a game , we 're always looking at that rapid advance of technology , and where the rock paper scissors comes out of that naturally . And then you just turn it into a game mechanic . I think the hardest thing is making it clear to the player , what 's forcing that motivation . <p> What sort of those technological tit-for-tats occurred in the Roman era ? <p> The Romans went through several changes in the way they structured their armies , and that was a result of the various enemies they fought . For example , at the very beginning of their setup , they started out with almost Greek style methods of combat , using spears and shields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Then they met the Gauls , and the Gauls were fighting with swords , what we now regard as the classic Roman sword and shield . And that open faced helmet . And the barbarians schooled them in how to fight battles with mobility . <p> The result of that was , the Romans went away , thought about that , came forwards with more adaptations of that . In the game , you might have triaria , that old fashioned type of unit . But as you evolve , you might have astarte and principes who are more barbarian styled in what they do and how they fight . And that slowly evolves -- and you can do this with technology in the game -- it slowly evolves into the Marian reforms . Which is turning it into what we regard as the classic republican army , with the chainmail , the coolest helmets , the square shields , using a gladius , and throwing your pilum as you enter combat . <p> So that 's all there in the game , you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all part of the gameplay progression . Even if you know absolutely nothing of history , it 's just something that will emerge out of gameplay . <p> What role will your navy play in all of this ? <p> We 've basically decided the best thing we can do with naval battles in bring them into the main battle engine . so we use a lot of the same kind of interfaces and ways you order things around , as if you were fighting a normal land battle . And the result of that is you can bring both elements together , and fight land and sea at the same time . It creates some really cool gameplay opportunities , so you can do some creative things like moving your units around the back of the enemy , and coming to attack from behind . <p> At the same time , it also means you can block people who are trying to do that , because you can use your navies backup force as you 're moving along the coastline , and if they bring their navies in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stone paper scissors . <p> One of the things we did decide with this game -- and maybe this 'll change in the future -- was the best way to work with ships that land their troops , was that once the ships have landed , basically you ca n't get back on board those ships . And those boats remain beached until the next battle . You can push them back off the sand for the next battle , but during that battle , once you 've landed , that 's it . <p> In terms of what happens when you 've won the naval battle but you 're losing the land battle , well , you have to then unload your men off the ships and then onto the land . If you do n't win the land section of a battle , you 've lost the battle . Because without land , you 've got no supplies , nowhere to rest . Ancient biremes could n't remain out at sea forever , if they did then they would be sunk in a storm , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd told me on New Year 's Eve 2014 that my two favourite games of the next year would be a Witcher and Metal Gear title , I 'd have laughed , then frowned , then walked off to talk to someone who was n't clearly crazy . <p> If games are a truly interactive medium , then it stands to reason that the people who play them have an unusual amount of influence on this creative form ; more than they do on others .

I shuffle the joke Rolodex in my head , trying to find one about three brothers and rotisserie chickens . There is one , but if he 's leading with that to a family audience , the Liberal attempt to win the seat of Reid is going to make Jaymes Diaz 's attack on Greenway look slick . It 's not . It 's something about small business , higher taxes , red tape . But he 's no sooner in his stride than he has to be finished , and you can see the frustration build .

Laundy had no sooner launched into an attack on Labor 's refugee policy -- " every time there 's an election Labor comes up with a new refugee policy , we 've had the same one for years . We started offshore processing , " Laundy said , foreshadowing the crueller-than-thou strategy that Abbott would outline in the debate later that evening . <p> " Izzadeen is spittingly angry at the two-party system , so is Ashraf , and I do n't blame them .

@@449236 <h> Bush Tales <p> PIP COURTNEY , PRESENTER : Not since 1977 when Colleen McCullough 's novel The Thorn Birds became a global bestseller has so much shelf space been devoted to Australian bush romance . <p> In the last decade , the number of rural novels written by young women farmers has boomed , creating a brand new category that 's the fastest-growing segment in the Australian book industry . With domestic sales showing no signs of slowing down , publishers are now looking to break into overseas markets . <p> It 's time for Colleen McCullough to move aside , for the new , modern Aussie bush romance novelist has arrived . This time though it 's not a lone author , it 's nearly 20 . They 're as prolific as they are popular and most are actually farmers . Their heroines are n't girly indoors types either . They 're tough , sometimes raunchy and work in harsh environments , branding cattle , mustering sheep and of course falling in love . <p> RACHAEL TREASURE , AUTHOR : I wanted to read about chicks like me that love their dogs more than they love shopping , they love their utes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NICOLE ALEXANDER , AUTHOR : We 're not talking about the Bridget Jones 's of the world or the girls from Sex and the City . These are quite strongly developed , feisty heroines . <p> FLEUR MCDONALD , AUTHOR : I ca n't tell you how long it 's going to be around for . Because it 's so full-on at the moment , I keep thinking that at some point it has to slow down , but it has n't shown any signs of doing that . <p> PIP COURTNEY : The top three authors in the category are Rachael Treasure , Fleur McDonald and Nicole Alexander . Between them , these three farmers have sold over half a million books . <p> On a small farm an hour north of Hobart lives Rachael Treasure , the queen of rural romance writing . Her fifth and latest novel is The Farmer 's Wife and her publishers are working on marketing it in the UK and the US . <p> SHONA MARTYN , HARPER COLLINS : The sales team for Harper Collins US were very excited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months before people in Montana and South Dakota and so on are reading and identifying with them . And also in the translation markets , Germany is a very strong and supportive market for Australian authors generally , but particularly the Germans do love the fact of our wide , open spaces and so on . <p> PIP COURTNEY : What kicked off this booming genre was Rachael 's first book , Jillaroo . <p> In Australia , a bestseller is just 10,000 copies . Jillaroo sold 100,000 . <p> They say authors should write about what they know . That 's worked for Rachael . <p> RACHAEL TREASURE : I 'd been to Orange Agricultural College and I 'd also been working in shearing sheds and partying as hard as Ag ' college students did back then , although they 're very much more studious than we were in those days . <p> So , Jillaroo , the first book I wrote , it was basically the story of me , essentially , not from the plot point of view with the characters , but it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Rachael followed Jillaroo with four more novels and a collection of erotic short stories , 50 Bales of Hay , a rural version of 50 Shades of Gray . <p> SHONA MARTYN : Our real job is to provide books that people want to read , and certainly she really put her finger on the right type of storytelling and she did it with such verve and energy . You know , all that Bundy and the goings-on at agricultural college , I was totally shocked , I have to say . In fact I 'm told that perhaps Rachael Treasure 's books are read by boys in boarding schools to perhaps learn the facts of life . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Rachael Treasure knows what she 's writing about . She grew up on a farm in Tasmania and worked as a rural journalist , jillaroo and wool classer . She believes readers sense her passion for the bush , its people , animals and landscapes , and , that along with romance , she touches on the big issues . <p> RACHAEL TREASURE : People will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because some of them have been through the journey of single motherhood , other people have been touched with the tragedy of rural suicide . <p> I want to impart more than just the rural setting . I want to help shift paradigms of thinking on how we manage land , on how we see women within rural families . A lot of them do n't have a voice . A lot of them are the little misses in the kitchen still and that still goes on . So , you know , it 's one of those things - there are other layers to my writing . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Rachael Treasure inspired the number two writer in the category , Fleur McDonald . The mother of two works alongside her husband on their 8,000-hectare property at Esperance in WA , but her other workplace is inside at her desk . <p> FLEUR MCDONALD : It 's like being able to bring the farm into people 's lounge rooms or wherever they 're reading and that 's a really privileged situation to be in because I can let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIP COURTNEY : Unlike many aspiring authors , Fleur 's path to rural authordom has been surprisingly smooth .

I 've always been a serious reader . But , I do n't think it ever entered my head that I could possibly , you know , become published . And when suddenly there was a contract in front of me , it was very - it was really exciting , completely amazing . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Her point of difference in this crowded market is a love of crime novels . She weaves crime and mystery into her stories . <p> FLEUR MCDONALD : My books are n't just rural-based . They 're not romance , just romance-based . There 's some crime and some mystery in them as well , and I think that 's probably what pulls the blokes in as well . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Fleur 's third book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when news came that in just a month it had out-sold her first two , there was n't time to celebrate . <p> FLEUR MCDONALD : I was actually working in the sheering shed on the day and it was as hot as hell and the sheep would n't pack up because I was rousing - the sheep would n't pack up into the catching pens and I sort of went , " The life of a bestselling author . Why do n't you sheep go into the catching pens ? " ... <p> ... The gap between the city and the country does n't need be as wide as what it is because we are all exactly the same people . We still have families that we want the best for , we still have - we still work , we just do different jobs .

Rachael Treasure , always , and then Fleur , her first novel back in 2009 ; Red Dust was the best new fiction for that whole year . So , consistently every time they 're released , they 're always in the top 10 . <p> PIP COURTNEY : And having an author of rural romance in town was a big drawcard for fans . <p> FAN : I think it 's just the rural element and being able to relate to harvest and stressful times and the toughness of the land . <p> FAN II : The ups and downs in daily life . You can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be like that sometimes . You just want to give up and , yeah , you just keep going . <p> FAN : I live on a farm , so you just relate to what the story 's about and it 's always nice to read a romance one as well . <p> NICOLE ALEXANDER : It does n't matter whether you live in the city or the bush and strong female characters , I think , are very appealing . I mean , women are very forthright , strong individuals who are successful in their own right and I think probably to a certain extent rural literature portrays women that way and that 's the way the majority of us are . We have a job to do and we just get out and do it . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Coming in at number three is Nicole Alexander . In a cluttered market , history is her point of difference . Her first novel , The Bark Cutters , is contemporary , but the story is driven by events in the 1850s . <p> Bark Cutters was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually shortlisted for Australian Book Industry Award . That 's their debut author award for a high-selling novel . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Nicole works on the family cattle and cropping property at Bumi , near Moree . I do n't think we can do much more with these fellows . She 's her dad 's right hand , her farm work doubling as research . <p> But inside the homestead , a remarkably preserved family history is proving a great resource for her fiction . <p> NICOLE ALEXANDER : That 's one of the great benefits of being the descendant of a generational grazing family ; I 've got this huge amount of archival material to draw on . Old station books , paddock diaries , I 've got mail order catalogues from the 1920s , old publications of our gazettes and The Bulletin magazine . So , yes , a whole heap of different stuff . As well as obviously family-old tradition , which is - you know , that history as well is great as far as anecdotal evidence . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Nicole fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALEXANDER : It 's a lot of fitting in . I mean , occasionally I 'll have a couple of days during the week . So I might have , you know - I 'll be lucky and have a month where I can do two work days a week of full-on writing . I always write on the weekends and on I usually try - on average I try and do 5,000 words a week because you just do n't get through the story otherwise . <p> So I 'd like to be able to say I get up in the morning and start , but it does n't work that way . You 've got to fit in with what 's going on , on-farm , and , yeah . <p> PIP COURTNEY : Her fourth book , due out in September , is set during World War I and concerns three brothers from a Queensland farm . <p> And any tough bush chicks in there ? <p> NICOLE ALEXANDER : There 's a wily young lass who , you know , she sets her sights on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically . So , yes , she causes a little bit of trouble for the three brothers who go abroad to fight . <p> PIP COURTNEY : She 's not sure how long rural lit ' will be flavour of the month , so is broadening her work into historical fiction . <p> NICOLE ALEXANDER : If you produce good work and you can continue to produce a good stable of work , you 'll keep your readership engaged and they 'll keep following you . So I think it 's still going to be there in the future , but we probably wo n't have the heady days that we do at the moment where there 's 14 or 15 titles being released every year . <p> SHONA MARTYN : They have to be good .

@@449237 <p> Ambivalence is likely to be in short supply if you were to ask people for their view on the Volkswagen Touareg V8 TDI R-Line . There 's equal chance it will be either derided as a massively overpriced VW , or lauded as a bargain luxury SUV with power to spare . <p> With a price tag of just under $113,000 ( before on road costs ) the V8 TDI takes the top spot as the ultimate Touareg variant in the all-diesel line up , commanding a substantial $28,000 premium over the next-model-down V6 TDI 4Motion . <p> It 's easy to see why opinions are polarised on this hifalutin Volkswagen SUV , given that for a few grand less you can have the entry-level Porsche Cayenne Diesel , or for a tad more ( $113,800 ) you can take home a BMW X5 40d with 255kW and an entirely useful 600Nm of torque . <p> In fact , if you prefer the Benz badge , then the ML 350 BlueTEC with 190kW/620Nm is yours for the ' bargain ' price of $101,400 . <p> But it 's sheer firepower that sets the top Touareg so far ahead of the competition when comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all strong pullers and rate highly on luxury , none comes close to the Volkswagen Touareg V8 TDI 's sheer unadulterated grunt . <p> Under the bonnet lurks a 4.1-litre ( Volkswagen lists it as 4.2 litres ) , which delivers a colossal 800Nm and a sprint time to 100km/h in a scorching 5.8 seconds . <p> That 's quicker than the old autobahn-storming Volkswagen Touareg R50 with its 5.0-litre V10 diesel , 257kW and a Boeing 747-pulling 850Nm ( a Touareg V10 TDI holds the world record for the heaviest load towed by a passenger car for towing just that ... a 747 ) , could only manage 6.7 seconds . <p> In fact , you 'll struggle to find many supercars with that much twist , let alone a family-friendly sports utility vehicle with school pick-ups and weekly grocery excursions as its top agenda . <p> Rival SUVs with similar specifications and performance are considerably pricier , and in some cases not nearly as quick . <p> Audi 's Q7 ( sister car to the Touareg and Cayenne ) V8TD punches out the same 250kW/800Nm and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6.4 seconds , though the V8-powered Cayenne Diesel S packs even more 281kW/850Nm and only shaves one tenth of a second off the time , but costs $142,300 . <p> The Touareg V8 TDI adheres to Volkswagen 's current corporate styling treatment -- meaning there is n't a lot of visual drama going on apart from the deeper front spoiler , body-coloured side sills and oval tailpipes . <p> There 's the telltale R-Line badges on the front wings , but by far the most revealing sign that this is n't your cooking variety Touareg are the imposing 21-inch twin-spoke ' Mallory ' alloy wheels and low-profile Bridgestones . <p> Inside the Volkswagen Touareg V8 , there 's no R-Line brashness , either , just a subtle logo on the steering wheel and stainless steel doorsill plates , but nothing that shouts ' high performance ' . <p> As the range-topper , the V8 TDI is extremely well specced with a host of luxury kit including items such as Nappa leather upholstery , Area View , optical parking system , front and rear parking sensors , satellite navigation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming . <p> In addition , the top line Touareg also comes with Driver Assistance and Comfort packages , which add four-zone climate control , automatic kerb view when reversing , electrically adjustable front seats with memory and front passenger and heated steering wheel with memory . <p> The Driver Assistance Package includes safety systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control with Front Assist Function and City Emergency brake function and Side Assist . <p> The Napper leather seats are superbly comfortable and cabin quality is well above the average grade , but somehow it lacks the sumptuous first-class quality that you find in its Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne cousins . <p> There 's no shortage of space , though , fore and aft -- and plenty of width to boot . You also wo n't find larger door pockets than those in the Touareg along with a raft of other cubbyholes spread throughout the cabin . <p> The rear cargo area ( with auto open and close tailgate ) is good for 580 litres of gear with the rear seats upright , expanding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats laid ( almost ) flat . <p> Fire up the potent V8 diesel , and there 's none of the usual oil-burning clatter that so often spoils the premium experience . <p> There 's a touch of turbo lag from the get-go with any right pedal stomping , but between 1750-2750rpm , when you 've got the full 800Nm at your beck and call , mid-range acceleration is where the Volkswagen Touareg V8 TDI really shines . <p> Throttle response is n't as sharp as the Cayenne 's -- more of a groundswell-style surge , but the combination of the creamy V8 diesel and excellent eight-speed auto make forward progress a silky-smooth experience . And there 's always plenty in reserve . <p> That 's not to say that the V8 TDI is in any way slow off the line -- 5.8 seconds for the 0-100km/h sprint is mighty quick for a two-tonne-plus SUV , while top speed is 242km/h -- where permissible . <p> And as with all Touaregs , the V8 TDI R-Line comes with Volkswagen 's fuel-saving BlueMotion technologies , including brake energy recuperation . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.8/100km , or not far above the official figure of 9.2L/100km combined . <p> The standard-fit air suspension delivers a generally cushioned ride on most road surfaces in the ' Comfort ' setting , but firms up in ' Sport ' mode while still managing to iron out the majority of bumps . <p> In corners , though , the big VW is n't the sort of vehicle that can be thrown around -- too much weight for that -- but it 's more capable than you might imagine , particularly in the firmer setting , which significantly reduces body roll on turn-in . <p> There 's not a lot of feel to the steering , but it 's quick enough , and the overall ride-handling balance is very good . Not as precise as the Cayenne , mind , but certainly more comfortable and more in common with BMW 's X5 on this front . <p> The Touareg 's brakes , too , are exceptional -- with serious fade-free stopping power and great pedal feel to boot . <p> Apart from those safety systems included in the Driver Assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active and passive safety features including a total of nine airbags , anti-locking brakes , electronic stability program with traction control and active rollover protection , engine braking control and hill-descent assist . <p> VW Australia offers a standard three-year/unlimited kilometre warranty period on the Touareg with service intervals set at 12 months or every 15,000kms . There 's also capped-price servicing over six years commencing at $507 at 12 months ; $507 at 24 months ; $689 at 36 months ; $616 at 48 months ; $507 at 60 months and $975 at 72 months . <p> While it might be the most expensive Volkswagen Touareg by some margin , the V8 TDI R-Line represents a significant bargain when compared with its pricier and more prestigious Audi and Porsche cousins . This is a true heavyweight contender with luxury to spare . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> Nice review . I just cant help thinking that all of that acceleration in such a heavy car is a dangerous mix . It 'd have to absolutely destroy most other cars safety features if it speared into them . But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( say ) a benz sedan , but SUVs have often got a stiffer chassis . I 'd have thought that if you add stiff chassis to the weight and inertia and thrust , then the height which can go over the top of most side intrusion bars , you 've essentially got a bunker buster . Then you get the type of driver who goes beserk in a big SUV because they dominate the other cars . And I 'm not singling out VW , I think the same applies to all of the big quick SUVs . But I do nt drive one , I 'm only speculating . <p> racrepus <p> I think if they 've engineered the centre of gravity low enough and the suspension was setup correctly , there 's little risk or danger involved . YouTube /watch ? v=V8fmsFDL7h0 <p> jetyj <p> It fits easily under the NSW RTA 130Kwton safety barrier for P platers and Vic roads 125KWton rule -- and being Diesel exempts it from being a V8 or turbo . <p> So it must be perfectly safe for the inexperienced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments . Racrepus , what I 'm meaning is that there must be incredible mass/force behind one of these things if it hit something while accelerating , compared to ( say ) an evo . But physics isnt my strong suit by any means ( which I gave away by not even knowing the correct term above ) . And jetyj , that 's exactly what I mean . I drove a v8 Range rover for a while when I first had my license , and behaved like an absolute fool . Luckily it was slow ( to go with the weak brakes ) but it did nt stop me from getting a head full of steam and feeling invincable . And I 'm sure I 'm not the only one whose worst side comes out driving a big SUV . The thought that a p plater could drive something so big and powerful makes me shudder . <p> Hjalle <p> Sounds just as logical as a p plater being aloud to drive a Golf R32 but not a GTI <p> ltui <p> That rule is being changed for NSW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they fit under a 130Kwtonne cap . So the outgoing Golf R and GTi will both be permitted . The does n't take into consideration heavy , high torque diesels/Hybrids/EVs like this 0-100kmh in 5.8 secs Toureg , so this is permitted along with a selection of other high performing cars like Lexus GS450 , Audi A6 Biturbo Tdi , &lt;2012 BMW 535D , BMW ActiveHybrid5 , Tesla Model S -- all cars with 0-100kmh times under 6 seconds that with power to weight ratios under 130KWtonne . BMW 's X6/X6 M50D does 130.2KW/tonne , so I do n't know if they 're counting the decimal points but if not , that is also permitted at 0-100kmh in 5.4 secs ! <p> Ted <p> Does this have a DSG , or normal auto .. <p> Captain Nemo ? ? <p> Ted <p> fairly sure it has a 8sp ZF auto .

The Toerag will be full of rattles and falling apart after 12 months . <p> jkwetuk <p> It has a 36 month warranty , so why would it be falling apart after just 12 months ? <p> Telly <p> So it can spend the next 24 months in and out of warranty repairs that never actually fix the problem of the first up poor engineering design .

Enjoy your public transport . <p> CraigS <p> Having owned various VW 's long term including an orginalTouareg for over 150 thousand kays when we had our own business , one thing VW 's do n't do is rattle , my work car now , a toyota RAV 4 has always rattled , even from new . My 10 year old Bora still does not rattle and is massively quieter than the 2012 RAV4 <p> Realist <p> Well I must then , I had a Touareg V10 and loved it , currently have a BMW X6M and am seriously considering a return to the Touareg R Line , never had any issues with the Touareg V10 , reliable , comfortable , powerful and economical and I think I can live with the slight performance drop from the X6M . <p> barry <p> A tractor engine with soft touch Euro plastics . <p> Telly <p> Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly useful SUV 's that go like the clappers but do n't actually have any off road ability . I do n't find them appealing at all no matter how fast or how well they handle . A sporty block of flats is still a block of flats regardless of the badge it wears . <p> Peter <p> So that people can have a station wagon without the stigma attached to owning a station wagon . Personally , I 'd rather the wagon , eg a volvo v60T6 R design . But then there might also be the odd person who also needs 7 seats <p> kjetu <p> This Toureg does n't sell well but in the case of the higher end brands that do like BMW/Merc/Audietc , their 4WDs are generally cheaper than a equivalent station wagon . E400 wagon for example is around $130K , yet a ML350 is $99K or ML500 $130K . X5 and Q7 also cheaper than similar spec 5 series wagon or A6 wagon . <p> Andreas <p> Hi Telly , appreciate what you say but it 's really up to each individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see the purpose of sports cars and rather just have one car that I can travel to my farm with , tow a few things , take 3 teenage kids when I need to as well as their mates . Perhaps it relates to needs but i regularly travel between Sydney and Melbourne as well as Brisbane and could n't think of a more comfortable way to travel ( via the roads at least ) . One can still enjoy a drive as the car has ample overtaking power , and handles well considering its size . For that reason my family has a diesel XC90 and a diesel Q7 which will be replaced by a GL ( diesel though ) shortly when it arrives . <p> Telly <p> Thanks Andreas , I understand where you 're coming from and with such long journeys I can see the value of what you are saying . Personally , as you pointed out , having more seats tends to give rise to transporting other peoples family members , not having a go at you , to each their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't wait to get back into a sedan based vehicle with only 5 seats so I would n't be seen as everyone 's Taxi , plus the enjoyment that comes with a better handling car . Having said that , I guess I more was looking at the value of such vehicles within the confines of a city for people who do n't drive the distances that you do but still have such vehicles . Cheers . <p> Realist <p> My V10 had low range and 750NM of torque , center differential was an option , why would you assume these cars have no off road capability , subject to off road tyres ? You are either too quick to judge or ll informed <p> Telly <p> Actually neither . The amount of Toerags and Q7 's that have gone through a couple of my mates workshops with both major and some minor electrical and mechanical faults tells me they did n't have much on road ability either .

Easy choice for me ... oh and nearly forgot , absolutely no rattles in either ( wish I could say the same about the Toyotys ) <p> TP <p> We purchased our Touareg in 2009 now 1010,000 kms ago . Until recently it has been exceptional . That was until at 108,000 kms having just driven 2,000 , Melbourne to Dubbo/Dubbo to Noosa in two days when both inlet manifold runner controller flaps needed to be replaced . $2,500 at VW Sunshine coast . We had it back a week and 388 kms later when the high pressure diesel pump failed . $16,000 for injectors again at VW Sunshine coast . VW did come to the party on the second event ( HPDP failure ) to the extent of parts at cost . On returning to Melbourne we wrote to VW Aust in Sydney looking for an explanation as to why these items failed . No explanation was given . <p> The IMRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or de-coating function built into it as has been built into the exhaust side which have filters which require regular running over 80kmph to clean . VW was not happy that it was suggested that these IMRC flaps were engineered to fail as the same parts were put on in replacement . It seems we have been our own worst enemy as we have reserved the Touareg for our long distance high speed hauling over the 5 years and resevrved our 2.0l diesel Tiguan for local commuting . We have averaged 20,000 per year in the Touareg and 10,000 per year in the Tiguan , so we do get about in our retirement . Had we used the Touareg for the local school run and local shops the IMRC flaps would have failed under warranty . As for getting only 100,000 out of a modern diesel engine before it blows up ? No , there has never been any petrol put in by mistake . VW Aust position was that atleast we got 100k . <p> Consumer and Fair trading law provide for extended warranties given the original purchase price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thinking of buying a VW , perhaps you should think long and hard and then buy something else .

@@471236 <h> 10 reasons why the PC is n't dying <p> What 's a PC ? It 's not just a personal computer because tablets or smartphones are also personal computers . A PC is the personal computer that lets you do the serious stuff from playing intensive games at home to creating designs or running spreadsheets which allow you to earn an income . Unlike a tablet a PC is built around an open architecture and is configurable to meet your needs . While a laptop or an all-in-one PC are both fundamentally PCs they 're less configurable so the focus of our poll was on the traditional PC . <p> The PC 's place in the digital landscape alongside tablets and smartphones is so clear so irreplaceable and so critical that it irks our readers ( and us ) when industry pundits -- and impressionable tech bloggers -- constantly deliver the last rites . Even schools which should know better are swapping PCs/laptops or Macs/MacBooks for tablets continuing a trend that some readers have called the ' dumbing down of tech ' . <p> Reader Peter Croft says : ? ? ? I see tablets and the like as just another example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the easy path . Sorry kiddies some things require work and study and skill. ? ? <p> Many are puzzled that there 's even a tablet/smartphone versus PC debate . ? ? ? I have mobile devices smart TVs smartphones smart everything but nothing matches my PC in terms of power performance and flexibility ? ? says John Gangemi adding : ? ? ? The PC is king when it comes to this . Need a bigger monitor ? Easy . Need more disk space ? No problem . Need more RAM ? No worries . Need to do some serious gaming and work ? Buy a PC. ? ? <p> Jacob Logan adds : ? ? ? No device no matter how compact portable or interactive will ever match the desktop PC 's dominance in the fields of content creation programming and gaming. ? ? Another reader going by the handle of Flymow says : ? ? ? I really like tech stuff but we do n't consume a whole lot of fluffy content it 's much more fun creating things and the tablets I 've tried suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? This beatup re smartphones etc. reminds me about the ' paperless office ' we were promised in the eighties . We 're still waiting ... Seems the latest fad is always the best and greatest about to replace all before it . Rarely happens. ? ? <p> Ultimately says Sebastian Stinton : ? ? ? You can do anything with a PC . Your limit is your imagination. ? ? <p> APC readers have highlighted the key areas in which PCs rule . These are the reasons the PC is king and will remain king of your personal computing platforms : <h> 01 Hardcore gaming <p> Nothing shows off the glorious performance of a PC -- and the ability to run peripherals to further enhance the experience -- than serious PC gaming . ? ? ? A mobile device will never match the graphics performance of a half-decent PC in a million years let alone today ? ? says reader Jacob Logan . <p> Mike Tuppen points to good simulations as being impossible on a tablet : ? ? ? I like to play realistic racing simulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which are n't available on any mobile device or game console for that matter. ? ? <p> Thirteen-year-old Yosiah de Koeyer speaks for all of us when he says : ? ? ? You can play real games on a PC . Lots of the games for iPod/iPad/Windows Phone etc. are just like mini-games and are usually finished in a day or two. ? ? <p> Readers also point to the inability of tablets and smartphones to handle 4K graphics anytime soon . ? ? ? Tablets are fine for slow solo play like Fruit Ninja or Angry Birds but that is about it ? ? sums up Sean ( surname not provided ) . <h> 02 Content Creation <p> As much a tablet weakness as a PC advantage is content creation . Trying to do serious content creation on a tablet or smartphone is a recipe for pain and frustration as several readers found . <p> Max Perry often edits many hours of AVCHD video files running the editing program on dual 24-inch high-quality monitors . ? ? ? Rendering the final video to a single file can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RAM at 100% for several hours . Try that on a tablet or notebook ? ? he says . But he 's not finished . ? ? ?

My wife and I travel a lot ? ? says Alistair Campbell . ? ? ? I Photoshop our photos ( and she has digital dysentery ) every night on my Sony ultrabook with two SSDs in RAID 0 . Try doing that on a smartphone or tablet in anything like the time it takes me . I will be in bed hours before you and the job will be done better. ? ? <p> Stephen Cooper points out that decent music recording capability -- involving the recording of live music and vocals multitrack mixing and stereo mastering -- would n't be impossible on a tablet . Still on music Mike Tuppen says : ? ? ? I use REAPER for music production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . While there are alternatives available on mobile devices they do n't offer as much as what I have now ( due to all the plug-ins ) and do n't have any flexibility. ? ? <p> Harry Truong adds : ? ? ? And soon PCs will have 4K graphics something tablets and smartphones wo n't have for a long time. ? ? <h> 03 Run Intensive Software <p> The most obvious advantage of a PC over a tablet is power . ? ? ? When something needs grunt where do you turn ? ? ? asks Craig Ashton adding : ? ? ? Have you tried running a complex spatial setup on an iPad ? Sure you could probably land a man on the moon with an iPad but ripping your Blu-rays ? You want threads and cores man. ? ? Micheal Clark adds : ? ? ? intensive workloads such as 3D modelling video editing and scientific calculations are still impractical if not impossible on a mobile device. ? ? <p> But it 's not just intensive software . Big screens plus the comfort of using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PC . ? ? ? I work with a lot of spreadsheets . Touch input devices can not compare to the speed and accuracy of a mouse and keyboard ? ? says Matt Cooper . <p> Even programmers ca n't imagine doing their work on anything but a PC . ? ? ? While I can open edit and sometimes even compile simple code directly on my tablet it is not suitable nor capable for serious programming yet ? ? says Mitchell Smith . <p> Sean adds : ? ? ? Even with a keyboard attachment to a tablet I could not imagine trying to view and debug code on a tablet I do n't even enjoy it on a laptop . Multiple screens and not feeling cramped is the only way to go for me. ? ? <p> And of course most serious business software is n't available for tablets or smartphones . ? ? ? My wife is a bookkeeper so she uses the PC for QuickBooks which is n't available on mobile devices ? ? Mike Tuppen says . <h> 04 True Multitasking <p> Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the joys of having a PC . Nigel Quayle says a PC allows you to visually multitask . ? ? ? A PC can have a large area of screen(s) available to display programs or documents alongside each other for visual comparison. ? ? <p> Eddie S puts it well when he says : ? ? ? I listen to music while reading email via an SSH client transcoding a home video keeping an eye on the weather radar and using a webcam at the same time all run over two screens. ? ? <p> M.A Howley adds : ? ? ? When building a web site I often have Photoshop a word processor and three browsers open simultaneously ( each with multiple tabs open ) . Try that on a tablet ! ? ? <h> 05 Run Large/Multiple Monitors <p> The ability to run multiple monitors off a single PC means productivity can be sky high . John Hogan says he appreciates the myriad benefits of big and/or multiple screens which means he can have ? ? ? research windows word processors music Twitter etc. running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You can run big displays on a PC ? ? says Michael Clark : ? ? ? Mobile devices have high resolutions but still the screen is too small to have multiple applications open. ? ? <h> 06 Virtualisation <p> No tablet or phone can run the previous OS within a virtual machine . On a PC it 's easy . Eddie S says : ? ? ? You can run VMs with different OSs from Linux distros to different versions of Windows all nicely sandboxed from each other. ? ? <p> Reader Col H says : ? ? ? I just upgraded my PC with the latest hardware have dual screens and Windows 8 Pro which has Hyper-V that works really well for me as I virtualised my previous Windows 7 Ultimate PC with its WinXP virtual machine and it all works as it used to. ? ? <h> 07 Big Storage <p> A PC allows you to add virtually unlimited local storage says Stephen Cooper . ? ? ? I have a movie library -- there 's 1000 movies on hard disk that can be streamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has expanded his system to store an astonishing 30TB of music and 24TB of images . <h> 08 Home Server/Media Centre <p> You can turn a PC into a serious home media centre .

Jon Gould writes that he can ? ? ? record four TV channels simultaneously whilst watching TV and maintain all my music photo TV and movies in storage measured in terabytes. ? ? <h> 09 Full-size keyboard &amp; mouse <p> On a PC with a full-size keyboard you can type fast and with high accuracy . It 's also possible to attach a keyboard to a tablet or phone . Yosiah de Koeyer says : ? ? ? Typing for me is very hard on any type of portable device . Nothing can compare to typing on a normal desktop keyboard. ? ? Craig Ashton adds : ? ? ? Bulk typing is impossible on tablets . Can you type a Harry Potter novel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clicking and dragging with a mouse ; try highlighting bulk multiple files on a tablet. ? ? <p> With the exception of Windows 8 tablets and a handful of Androids you ca n't attach a mouse to the vast majority of tablets including the iPad . ? ? ? The accuracy of a mouse is difficult to emulate on a touchscreen . Many tasks need the raw processing grunt a desktop gives as well as big ( or multiple ) screens and peripheral connectivity . Some web sites are painful to use with a touchscreen ? ? says another reader David . <h> 10 Build/customise it <p> Last but not least you can build or customise a PC -- something that 's impossible on the appliance-like tablets and smartphones . PCs offer users the ? ? ? ability to cost-effectively and/or extensively customise the hardware without having to buy an entire new device ? ? says Mark ( surname withheld ) . <p> Mike Kramer adds : ? ? ? The PC gives you the ability to mix and match hardware to suit your work environment to be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DisplayPorts and a DVI port to run multiple high-resolution screens or add multiple hard drives to keep your data storage easily accessible and backed up in RAID 1 . ? ? <p> Clay Pettit picks up on another pleasure of building or customising your own PC : ? ? ? You get a feeling of pride and accomplishment after setting up a new system and it boots the first time. ? ? Adrian Monsif agrees saying that building a PC gives you ? ? ? nerd bragging rights ? ? .

It 's okay , everyone 's entitled to an opinion . I was n't really talking about this car , this ' huwtm ' seems to write nothing but nonsense on every single Holden article on this site , and I 'm curious as to why he has such a hatred of them . <p> $29896495 <p> If that is the case Tom , quote me .

Although this looks nice its a bit to euro looking and as some have said its simply a 2 door commodore . Give it a bit of a retro look maybe , similar to what has been done with the current Camaro ? ? <p> Igomi Watabi <p> But the point of the Monaro is its basis in the sedan . Look at the HK-HG Monaro .

Precious little that can ensure a positive outcome . Threats of eventual prosecution at the International Criminal Court can be levied at all sides , but will probably be ignored . <p> Negative outcomes are easier to guarantee . An early reprisal attack against the Syrian regime or other opposition group , which later turns out not to have fired chemical weapons , would be humiliating for the West .

He turned over ball twice . He scrambled a poor kick out of defence with an overlap outside . He kicked another ball out on the full . And he threw the intercept pass for Folau 's try . <p> Intimidated ? Referee Jaco Peyper of South Africa .

But because the All Blacks were good enough to win despite Nonu 's howlers , they are airbrushed out of history . <p> The All Blacks do n't admit the big mistakes in public unless the unthinkable happens and they lose . Then confession is called for . There were others in this New Zealand team who under-performed on Saturday . <p> Israel Dagg kicked out on the full , missed a tackle , put his wing under pressure with a daft throw-in , but one good break and the country looks the other way . The hooker position is an ongoing problem , and Aaron Smith did not kick well from the base . But the myth must be perpetuated . <p> It intimidates other teams , although Australia look quite capable of intimidating themselves at the moment . Some of their tackling is feeble and they are quite hopeless at fielding short , high kicks in midfield . <p> More importantly , the myth intimidates refs . This millennium , New Zealand have received 46 cards in 166 tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boks really nearly twice as evil ? <p> The Australian coach Ewen McKenzie was right to be apoplectic on Saturday evening . Why was Moore 's " try " not referred ? Why was Kieran Read not yellow-carded for a professional foul ? Why was Nonu not yellow-carded for a dangerous tackle ? Why were the All Blacks ' tacklers and defenders repeatedly allowed to take so long getting back that they blocked Will Genia 's blindside channel ? <p> That was coached cheating again , by the way . Why was Ben Smith allowed to stand offside in front of the tryline to make a crucial defensive tackle ? Why was Tony Woodcock allowed to angle in , but not Australia ? <p> The penalty count should have favoured Australia in the first 50 minutes , but New Zealand led it 12-5 . <p> Sir Graham Henry would have suspected perfidy or a betting scandal in such circumstances .

@@482236 <p> When we talk about a country 's carbon emissions we generally only consider those that occur within its borders . But where does the fuel for those emissions come from ? And where do the products a country makes go ? <p> In this second part of our series The Carbon Trade we look at who the big traders of carbon are . We 'll analyze the major importers and exporters of fuels and products and in doing so explain much of how carbon moves around the world , both before and after its combustion . <p> The Regions Fueling the World <p> In the first piece of this series , The Globalization of Carbon , we noted that in 2007 traded carbon totaled 17.6 Gt CO2 , or 60% of total carbon emissions . More than half of this traded carbon was in the form of fuels , in particular oil and gas . <p> The big exporters of fuel carbon are those regions and countries that produce more fossil fuels than they use at home . <p> The big five fuel exporters are the Middle East , Russia , Sub-Saharan Africa , North Africa and Australia . Together these five regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are each so rich in fossil fuels in the form of oil , natural gas and coal that each of them export more carbon in fuels than they create through combusting fuels within their borders . <p> Each tonne of oil , natural gas or coal that is exported by these regions is imported somewhere else . So let 's see where they go . <h> Living On Foreign Fuel <p> It is widely known that the US is dependent on foreign oil , so much so they banned crude exports back in the seventies oil shocks . But the US is n't the only region living off fossil fuels from other regions . <p> This fact is plain to see when we look at who the big importers of carbon in fuels are . <p> When taken together the countries that make up Europe ( EU27 ) import more carbon in the form of fuels than the US . These two regions are the big fuel importers followed by Japan , China and South Korea , based on 2007 data . <p> Together these five regions import a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China is the World 's Factory <p> Now that we have seen how carbon is traded before it 's combusted , it is worth looking a how it is embodied in the trade of products after its combustion . For clarity 's sake products in this case means both goods and services though the former dominates . <p> In the last two decades exports of Chinese made products have exploded , driven on by cheap labor , capital controls and government subsidies . This phenomenon is plain to see in the data for carbon in exported products . <p> In 2007 the carbon embodied in China 's exports of goods and services totalled 1,556 Mt CO2 . About the same as the exports of the United States , Europe and Russia combined . <p> Although these five regions accounted for a healthy 58% of the trade of carbon embodied in products it is as a general rule less centralized than is the case for fuels . <p> Europe and the US Buy the World 's Stuff <p> If China is the big exporter of carbon embodied in products it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers . <p> In 2007 there was 1,514 Mt of carbon dioxide emissions embodied in European imports of goods and services , a quarter of which came from China . The US was the other major importer , followed by Japan , China and the Middle East . <p> The fact that so much European and American consumption is supported by emissions that occur in other parts of the world highlights the perils of focusing solely on terrestrial emissions for climate policy . The increased outsourcing of carbon intensive production to regions with weaker climate regulation risks undermining the effectiveness of national climate policies . <p> Such risks also exist regarding carbon in fuels . If factors reducing terrestrial emissions result in increased exports of fuels this can undermine the effectiveness of national action . The more than doubling of US coal exports since 2006 in reaction to the shale boom is a good example of this . <p> Join us for the final post in the series tomorrow when we Mind the Carbon Gap between country 's extraction , production and consumption totals . <p> All the data used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely downloadable , paper ' Climate policy and dependence on traded carbon ' by Robbie Andrew , Steven Davis and Glen Peters .

Even though its 2013 publicity machine boasts a diverse range of music -- " collaborative projects , sound installations , improvised performances , and fascinating experimental sounds " -- women 's music barely signifies . Of 18 groups in the NMN 's 2013 programs only six will perform music by women . Of the total of 80 works listed for performance , only nine ( or 11% ) are by women . <p> So why is there such a disparity between the number of female composers represented and the number performed ? <p> Emma Ayres is right when she says this is due to a combination of three factors . First , their music lacks exposure . It is unfamiliar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer female composers , and so there is less of their music available for performance . And third is the longstanding view , overhanging from 19th century aesthetics , that women 's music is inferior when compared to music by men . <h> Playing catch up <p> It was not until the 1970s that historical musicologists began to unearth women 's suppressed music . Names such as Hildegard of Bingen , Elisabeth Claude Jaquet de la Guerre , Barbara Strozzi , Clara Schumann , Fanny Mendlessohn , and numerous others in the 20th century were exhumed . Their music is now widely performed . Some of these women , Hildegard , in particular , have been hailed as trailblazers . <p> German writer , composer , philosopher Saint Hildegard of Bingen ( born 1098 ) receiving a vision and dictating to her scribe.RobertLechner <p> The idea women compose " serious " music is a relatively new phenomenon .

Some now have entries in music dictionaries , such as the esteemed Grove Music Online , and have their music discussed in standard music history textbooks . <p> Despite this , women 's music struggles to be heard in mainstream concert venues . Perhaps this is understandable , given mainstream activity in classical music devotes most of its energies to performing work of great male composers . Very little women 's music fits the category of masterwork . <h> Adjusting the balance <p> In the 21st century , we 've seen the rise of new genre categories and new kinds of music ; some of it using electronic media , some of it performative and improvisational , and some of it cross-breeding with other art forms . But why is it that new , risk-taking music groups are still resistant to seriously including women 's music ? <p> There are no easy answers . In the 1990s , women got together and put on their own music festivals in Adelaide , Melbourne , Sydney and Canberra . But this activity soon fizzled . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year the director of Brisbane 's Restrung festival of new music , Danielle Bentley , decided to positively discriminate for women 's music , inviting ensembles to include music by women in their programs . This yielded an unprecedented result , skewing the performance of women 's music to 61% . <p> But despite the effectiveness of affirmative action in the short term , it does not work in the long term . This is partly because it is too difficult to police . Affirmative action policies are also politically and socially divisive . Research suggests they stigmatise those who have benefited , compromising the self-esteem and self-respect of beneficiaries who know they have been given preferential treatment . <h> Solving the problem <p> All composers face similar pressures : resistance by listeners and institutions to new music , financial constraints , and the tendency of commissions to go to well-known composers .

@@489233 <p> The ultra-marginal seat of Greenway in Sydney 's western suburbs has recently drawn international scrutiny after the embarrassing media performance of the Liberal candidate Jaymes Diaz , who faltered when asked to explain the Coalition 's plans to stop the flow of boats with refugees . <p> Greenway is currently held by the Labor Party on the wafer-thin margin of 0.9% , Labor 's smallest margin in New South Wales . It is centred on the suburb of Blacktown . Like many electorates in western Sydney , it is a snapshot of modern Australia . <p> Populated by voters from an incredibly multicultural background , Greenway has the nation 's fourth highest proportion under four years old . It is also the country 's third highest number of households with dependent children . <p> Created in 1984 when the size of parliament was increased , the history of Greenway is similar to many seats in western Sydney . It was once regarded as Labor strongholds until former prime minister John Howard 's pitch to aspirational voters . The region is now home to some of the most hotly contested seats in the country . <p> The Coalition first captured the seat in 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate Ed Husic , a Muslim union official . This campaign saw an anonymous pamphlet drop stoking anti-Muslim sentiments , stating : <p> Ed Husic is a devout Muslim - Ed is working hard to get a better deal for Islam in Greenway . <p> The former ALP state secretary Eric Roozendaal claimed the campaign was " very effective " in inflaming anti-Muslim sentiment in the region , and Husic was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for the seat . <p> This disturbing operation was seemingly mirrored three years later in the infamous leaflet scandal in the neighbouring seat of Lindsay , where Liberal-aligned workers were caught distributing bogus leaflets thanking the ALP for supporting terrorists involved with the Bali bombings . <p> As an electorate , Greenway is far harder to categorise than seats such as Lindsay , one of the nation 's bellwether seats . This is mainly because the boundaries have been radically redrawn in recent years . In 2007 the electorate shifted north into the semi-rural Coalition voting regions of Windsor and Richmond , but three years later was pushed back south towards traditional Labor voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , and after an indifferent campaign in 2010 , migration lawyer Jaymes Diaz is again contesting the seat . As we have seen , Diaz has moved from indifferent to embarrassing . <p> At the last election Tony Abbott railed against the NSW Liberal state machine for some of the candidates contesting marginal seats . Jaymes Diaz , who only achieved a modest swing against the backdrop of a big shift in voter sentiment to the Coalition , was clearly one of those who felt his ire . According to The Australian , Diaz 's father Jess , a Blacktown City councillor , holds sway in three local Liberal branches in Greenway ( a claim that is denied ) , and Jaymes Diaz has once again emerged triumphant over a strong field to contest the seat for the Coalition . <p> The Liberal Party 's campaign in the seat could hardly have had a worse start after Diaz fluffed his lines badly during an interview with Channel Ten that provided the campaign with its first major gaffe . Under repeated questioning over the Coalition 's plans to " stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a nearby car park by his minder . <p> Despite this setback , polls suggest the seat , like many in western Sydney , is likely to fall to the Coalition . The ALP has responded by flicking the switch to personal and unleashed its own letter bombing campaign , claiming Diaz has recently lived in a luxury city apartment he still owns . <p> The flyer goes on to claim that Diaz has attempted to conceal his work as a migration lawyer - a line of work seemingly at odds with the Coalition 's hardline policy against asylum seekers . Diaz has responded by employing the ultimate small target strategy : being a no-show at a public forum in Blacktown in the penultimate week of the election . <p> Despite the many needs and great potential of the electorate , it seems like they have only been served dirty tricks and seven second grabs . And like the rest of us , it will be poorer for it no matter who wins the election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @

How about a plan for profitability <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Mark McGovern does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Large parts of Australian agriculture are economically and financially unsustainable . Returns are inadequate and unbalanced ; assets are depleted ; risks are needlessly high . To date , governments have largely relied on the market to address problems , but problems have worsened . <p> Mainstream political thinking has essentially ignored issues of foreign investment in farming and food processing ( where no significant wholly Australian processor remains ) . Popular opinion has been turning against such investments , but it was only on Wednesday evening , at the Rooty Hill leaders debate , that prime minister Kevin Rudd finally stated his anxiety about our " open slather approach " and expressed the need for change . <p> Responding , opposition leader Tony Abbot was reassuring . He would lower the threshold for review of foreign investment from A$220 million to A$15 million - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain unchecked . Understandably he did not wish to open up an issue that still divides those in the Coalition and , now openly , Labor . <p> How important is foreign investment to our farming future , and indeed our nation ? Briefly , the historical record is mixed . There are no clear connections between GDP growth and foreign investment , and indeed some contrary examples ( relatively slow GDP growth with high foreign investment ) . <p> The really important issue is how investors use production assets ( such as farmland ) and who profits where and when . Serious problems arise in markets when : <p> income streams and profit are inadequate for needs <p> distorting opportunistic strategies are not curbed or countered <p> assets from stressed enterprises are dumped on markets <p> investments are made with mixed motivations <p> funding availability and power are asymmetric <p> financing is unevenly based and biased and <p> perceptions are distorted by misinformation . <p> Any one of these conditions can corrupt asset markets . As all seven are evident in the Australian farmland and product markets , outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution in such circumstances would be foolish , something that the current prime minister seems to be realising , finally . <h> Not business as usual <p> While our politicians and , particularly , their advisers might prefer " Plan A : business as usual " , prudence dictates planning for realities . Here the Australian people are ahead , with now clearly expressed preferences for controls on farm land purchases , supply chain reform , robust national interest evaluations and the like . <p> This year has witnessed many collapses in rural businesses across all manner of size and form , with many more likely . Governments need to agree on an adequate " Plan B : Stabilisation " as a debt-deflation spiral builds in rural land assets . <p> In our open economy , the build-up in foreign investment necessitates " Plan C : asset return enhancement " . Foreign investment , be it direct or portfolio , can add significantly to the progress of regions and a nation when it adds something " new " or " better " that realises decent returns for both its domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is different . There , not only do the bulk of returns accrue preferentially to external parties . Control of assets also enables wider strategies , be these corporate or national . <p> For example , a grain handler ( headquartered in the USA , China , Middle East or elsewhere ) may acquire assets in Australia not so much for the earnings from a well-run business based on them but as a means of global supply chain consolidation and targeted preferencing of some suppliers ( and discrimination against others ) . <p> Plan C should then minimally include a robust national benefit demonstration and measures to preclude opportunistic actions . Under some circumstances ( such as current high domestic finance costs and limited rural liquidity ) the only real national solution appears to be to ban foreign investment until local investors can obtain comparable finance . Currently cheap foreign money is maintaining unserviceably high asset values and privileged asset access , pushing prices above those local investors can sensibly afford . <p> The critical strategic question is how to manage foreign investments so that excessive domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in some Australian sectors and many parts of the world ) . This is central to plan " D : Restoring national incomes " . <h> Ownership transfer , income losses <p> Further ownership transfers of farm , processing , product handling and marketing assets to external parties would see increasingly serious national income losses and Balance of Payment deterioration . Australia is an increasingly indebted nation . It needs to earn its way in the world , not sell off the assets which could support such earnings . External crises can be expected soon enough if our annual net outflows of around A$50 billion continue to go unaddressed . <p> The usefulness of current financing arrangements could be the focus of " Plan E : sustainable finance " . Currently banks are providing what are essentially home loans to businesses with the high income volatility of agriculture . Others have structured finance in unsustainable ways . <p> All have been asking for trouble , and it has now arrived . High interest rates ( especially the growing margin claimed by financiers for rural funds and the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations of larger debt holders . A well-constituted Rural Reconstruction and Development Bank is part of a viable solution . <p> Next come " F : supply chain operation " . This does not just mean the problems laid at the door of Woolworths and Coles . The real issue is one of supply chain closures , globally and nationally , as countries and corporations set up their own exclusive supply chains . Markets are increasingly bypassed as corporations tie up chains for a variety of reasons . <p> Such chains are tailored to preferentially serve certain parties at select parts of the chain . As this runs from farmers through transport and processing to end users anywhere in the world , there are many options for predatory , security or other actions . Recall that high prices only five years ago saw more than 30 nations enact food export controls to ensure their domestic populations were fed . <h> Insightful action needed <p> Ultimately , solutions combine in " Plan P : restoring enterprise profitability " .

The SMH article was completely consistent with them , so I might as well add my bit of anecdotal colour to the debate . <p> The region where I live has been one of the last in Victoria to add fluoride .

Even though they bounce back pretty quickly afterwards , it 's not a very rewarding job to do . Anaesthetic trainees rotating down from big city hospitals where they rarely see such lists are about the only ones who benefit from such a cavalcade of needless misery . The risks of general anaesthesia are not to be idly contemplated for children , and far outweigh the virtually nonexistent risk from fluoridation . <p> Since fluoridation was introduced to Geelong in 2009 , my colleagues are much happier , as severe dental abscesses requiring tricky anaesthetic techniques are much less common , and tend to mainly come from areas in the region which still are n't fluoridated .

When they returned from living in a non-fluoridated European city 3 years later , 2 of his 3 children had needed dental treatment under GA and all 3 had fillings compared to none of any of their peers in our social circle who stayed in Australia .

The other fallacy you 're working to is that $100 is not necessarily a standard charge for anyone who is " decent at SEO " . The bigger firms may well be able to command $100 an hour , however we are neither a bigger firm , nor want to be ! Price is n't really the goal for us , it 's the ability to deliver great SEO that dictates whether we work with a client or not ( yes we do choose to not work with those we ca n't add value to ) .

If the company is not on page 1 of organic search for its own key search terms then how could they possibly do a good job for your SME ? ( Note : I see that your company Optimising is on page 1 for this search term , so well done . ) <p> I think there definitely is fear and scepticism in the market , and unfortunately it 's going to be a long process to educate the market that the case is different ! <p> And yeah there are n't many good SEO/PPC/SMA agencies , however that 's from a purely service provision perspective -- A lot of people choose businesses for more than that though , so it would be difficult to suggest which are the good ones . For example we have a lot of interstate clients , and they have a priority on high quality and just getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to have the priority of using someone local that they meet and discuss things with in person . <p> Pointing out who are good or bad is n't really effective , I am primarily trying to draw attention to the fact that people do need to be wary and critical when evaluating the right path forward -- Pretty much what everyone should do when evaluating a service provider !

@@520230 <h> REVIEW : Spirit Of The Lore ( Brisbane Festival ) Cremorne Theatre <p> Our critic calls Spirit Of The Lore the most profound black theatre she 's ever seen . The Brisbane Festival show -- prepared by a bunch of students -- must be seen . <p> This is the most profound piece of black theatre that I 've ever seen in this country , and I do n't say that lightly . It 's a play that no white person would have dared to write , because it 's about such sensitive matters as what constitutes Aboriginality , black-on-black prejudice and ultimate reconciliation , what country really means , and whether there is such a thing as an Aboriginal nation . <p> Those are weighty enough matters in their own right , but it 's more than that , too . It soars to universal heights , and forces us to think about the necessity of forming communities to sustain and protect us , and of how , when it comes down to the wire , we need other people to help us survive , no matter how different they are . <p> The production notes say that the concept was inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it goes deeper than that , into the roots of 20th century alienation . It 's as bleakly existential as anything dreamed up by Samuel Beckett or Jean-Paul Sartre or T.S . Eliot 60 years ago . Fourteen Aboriginal people find themselves , we know not how , in the middle of a hostile desert , where there is no food , water or shelter . They 're all from different mobs , and have nothing in common with each other . Some want to deny their Aboriginality ; one young man , who looks whiter than white , desperately wants others to accept his Aboriginality ; some have always lived all their lives on country ; some are educated ; and others rely on their natural wits to survive . We love some , we hate some , we laugh with ( not at ) some , we pity others , and we all despise the great brute of a man who tries to force his will on them all . <p> What they all have to learn is that , in extremity , neither class nor origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , share our resources and our wisdom and become a community , and that 's a lesson for everyone , white , black or brindle . <p> Solemn stuff indeed , but it 's much more than a stern moral treatise . It 's full of fun and laughter and dance , and of our connexion to the past , because above the 14 survivors in the desert are two ghostly figures , the spirit of the ancestors , who seem to guide and protect the living beings . <p> And as they gradually come to trust one another and to share their meagre belongings -- some sticks , a knife , a few pieces of clothing -- they become a community who learn that they must protect , support and eventually love each other . <p> There are some uplifting sequences , such as when the men ( because although the group often act together , the sanctity of secret men and women 's business is strictly adhered to ) teach the white look-alike Mickey ( Jayden Stubbs ) to learn the emu dance , and then all teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was foot-stamping uplifting heroic stuff , and deserved its raucous round of applause . <p> When Polly ( Kaleenah Edwards ) is brutally raped by the evil Coyote ( Angus Jones ) in the desert , she stumbles back to camp and is healed by all the women , even those who did not at first accept her , and when Coyote is dragged before the community to answer for his crimes , the impressive woman called Justice ( Jakaya Dixon ) insists that it must be Polly who passes sentence -- which she does , in a totally satisfying way . <p> Spirit of the Lore has a cast of stars , and although not all the actors are of the same standard , the energy and belief they put into their performances makes it a piece of world significance . It deserves to go on tour -- the festival circuit , perhaps , and as far as Edinburgh and Europe .

@@520231 <p> How do you get to know one of Earth 's most mysterious creatures ? By looking at its earwax , according to a group of US researchers . Analysing the contents of blue whales ' ears , through a process similar to analysis of tree rings , led the team to construct a chemical timeline of the its life . This technique , they say , should allow significant further research both into how blue whales develop and how they respond to environmental concerns . <p> The earplug of a whale is the lifetime accumulation of its earwax . It slowly builds up in layers . As such , the earplug , like tree trunks , can be used to estimate a whale 's age . The earplugs have been used for this purpose for a while , but Stephen Trumble , assistant professor of Biology at Baylor University , and colleagues realised that a lump of wax , which in this case was 25cm long , possesses a lot more secrets than just the age . <p> the whale 's earplug.Stephen Trumble / Baylor University <p> " We were the first group to see that the earplug of a blue whale contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We realised that if we chemically analysed one , we could create a chemical portrait of the whale 's life . " <p> There are no other animals whose lifetime chemical profiles can be drawn . " Large baleen whale species , such as the blue whale , are the only wild animals that we can do such a thing , " Trumble explained . " The only other situation where constructing a lifetime chemical profile is possible would be by constantly taking samples from an animal in captivity . " <p> Trumble 's team analysed the earplug for a wide range of hormones and pollutants including the stress hormone cortisol , the developmental hormone testosterone , organic contaminants such as pesticides and flame retardants , and other pollutants such as mercury . <p> Currently analysis of whale blubber is used in order to assess chemical levels . But all that this allows one to find out is what chemicals the whale absorbed . The unique treelike composition of the earplug means that hormone and pollutant levels can now be mapped over the length of the blue whale 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just if , chemicals have been absorbed , " Trumble said . " The chemical tracing means that you can reconstruct time periods . " <p> The method allowed Trumble and colleagues to construct a developmental profile for the whale . Testosterone profiles , for example , suggest this male blue whale reached sexual maturity at approximately ten years of age , which corresponds well with and improves on previous estimates . They also found that stress levels doubled over the whale 's lifetime . This could allow for a more comprehensive examination of stress levels - in response to rising ship traffic and environmental noise , for example . <p> Because the lipids , waxes and keratin that form the earplug also work as a sink for pollutants - such as pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) - a chemical portrait of the whale 's exposure to contaminants could also be constructed .

" Documenting how chemicals are work their way through ecosystems is invaluable . " <p> How much can be asserted from the current analysis is limited , of course , as only one whale has so far been profiled . But the success of the process promises greater future prospects . The analysis can take on a historic perspective , too - as there are archives of earplugs harvested from whales involved in shipwrecks that reach back to 1969 . A map and a timeline of whale activity and marine pollution over the last 50 years can now be drawn up .

Governments and numerous NGOs have eagerly adopted the limit ; whether we can meet the target is another matter . But 2C is n't an easy concept to grasp . So , how can we imagine what 2C means for the world ? <p> First , why is 2C so significant ? At any time of the year , for most latitudes at which people live , the difference between overnight lows and daytime high temperatures can be as much as 15C . In summer it is even greater . When the day to day temperatures of weather vary so much , 2C seems insignificant . <p> What we 're talking about here , though , is the global average temperature , not daily variations - and we 're fast approaching 2C warmer than before the industrial revolution and emissions from fossil fuels intensified .

Fortunately , the earth has already done the experiment for us , 18,000 years ago in the ice ages . <p> For starters , there was an ice sheet one mile thick ( the Laurentide ) that extended over the northern half of North America right down to New York . <p> But these events happened 18,000 years ago , over a timeframe of hundreds of years , as a result of changes in the earth 's orbit and other natural forces . <p> What should worry us today is that human-forced climate change is happening at 10,000 times the rate of climate change caused by these natural cycles . <p> The changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , but still slowly compared to human lifespans . That 's because the climate system is " lethargic " . And here 's the problem , the inertia of climate is very difficult to imagine or visualise . <p> There a variety of reasons visualising the inertia of climate change is difficult ; prime among them being that climate is complicated . There 's a complex interplay between climate and oceans . For instance , 90% of warming is going into the oceans - at the rate of four Hiroshima bombs per second . But even with all that heat going in the oceans , they will still take a great many decades to warm . <p> The other complexity is the relationship with ice and climate . Ice may be melting at the poles , but it may be having surprising effects in the Northern hemisphere , like more cold fronts . <p> So we need an image that captures the complexity of the climate system as it gradually approaches 2C , and that climate wo n't always appear to warm in a straightforward manner . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open icebox which has been neglected at a party . The ice inside reacts to the warmer climate outside and melts .

When the ice melts it will not be replaced . Ice extent will fluctuate from year to year , and some climate change deniers will selectively point to recovery years , but there is only a downward escalator . Which means , unless dangerous climate change is addressed , for some of us today , and many more tomorrow , the party will definitely be over . <p> This article follows Four Hiroshima bombs a second : how we imagine climate change .

Besides , I was a professional . <p> He snapped away . Then I got my blouse back on as quickly as I could . I did n't think much about it . These pictures were n't going to be used .

Brooke Shields , or Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver . <p> Finally we were done , and headed back to the house , the sun setting behind us . It must have gone well enough , because although he did n't say anything to me , Roman called my mom and arranged for a second session . <p> On March 10 , my ticket to stardom showed up again , his cologne smelling a little too strong .

He must have been a little high himself . After some small talk , he asked if Mom and Bob wanted to see the pictures . They said sure . He went to his car and brought back an envelope of slides , a slide viewer , and a joint . They smoked together . <p> It 's impossible to tell , in retrospect , if Polanski assumed that because of Bob 's job at Marijuana Monthly we were a permissive family in other ways - more European , perhaps ? Or maybe , with the arrogance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he just assumed that whatever he did was okay . As Mom and Bob looked at the photos , they were surprised to find them unprofessional , unfocused , cropped haphazardly , with no regard for lighting . Some caught me prematurely , as if the photographer had snapped too soon . My mother knew test shots , and she was instantly baffled why a man of pictures like Roman Polanski would resort to shots like these . I looked more sullen than sultry , one hand on a hip , a hand slightly behind my head , now in my white lace shirt , unbuttoned . No young Marilyn here . When they saw the topless photos , Mom and Bob froze . <p> " Motherf ... er , " my sister , Kim mumbled . <p> Dogs are pretty good at measuring the mood of a room : our dog Natasha went into a frenzy , spinning in circles before she peed on the living room rug . <p> " What are you doing ? !

Just keep him away from Sam . " They were trying to be calm about this , with me in the next room . My mother spoke in a panicked whisper . She went to her bedroom to lie down and think .

@@533233 <h> Pulling Off One Of Gaming 's Biggest Cons <p> Doctored screenshots ? A demo that directly contradicts the actual game ? In-game writing specifically designed to mislead the player ? Producer Yoshinori Terasawa talks about crafting one of gaming 's biggest cons for Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc . Note : The following article contains spoilers for the first murder case of Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc . <p> Before the release of Danganronpa in Japan , Terasawa and his team were busy weaving an elaborate hoax . The core of this hoax ? The character of Sakaya Maizono . <p> Leading up to the game 's release , it was obvious that Maizono would play a major role in the game . She was featured in many of the game 's official screenshots and was clearly set up to be the player character 's romantic interest . <p> The PSP demo only served to solidify this , featuring her prominently in the demo 's version of the game 's first case . <p> Even when playing the first chapter of the full game , all the flags for her being the player 's assistant character/love interest are there : She knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and quickly comes to rely on him once the death game begins . <p> There is only one problem with all this : Maizono is actually the first character to die . <p> The whole setup was nothing but an elaborate hoax . <p> Like with Metal Gear Solid 2 , where pre-release screenshots that should have included Raiden showed Snake instead , the screenshots for Danganronpa were edited to show Maizono in scenes taking place long after her death in the full game . The demo 's version of the first case not only changed who had been murdered , but came complete with many additional lines voiced by Maizono 's voice actress that were never used in the full game . And the foreshadowing character clich ? s in the game proper were all made to further the illusion that she was an important main character . <p> Why go to such lengths for this con ? Simple . Danganronpa is a game specifically designed to shatter player expectations . <p> " The impact I really wanted to give was one of surprise . We set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it so that she and the main male character might have some kind of relationship -- and really whet the player 's appetite for this whole relationship ... I thought right from the beginning , ' What would be a bigger shock than killing her off ? ' ... If it worked and you were really surprised by it , it is exactly what I was going for , " Terasawa told Kotaku . <p> Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc was released on November 25 , 2010 for the PlayStation Portable in Japan . While the PSP version wo n't be localised , the upcoming Vita remake is scheduled for a Western release in 2014 . <h> Discuss <p> Just think . You will never be able to say that again now . The marvels of modern technology whereby you can know something you did n't previously know just by reading it on the internet .

Good stuff . <p> Actually some of the set ups are pretty elaborate and creative , and often keep you guessing . It ca n't really be try-hard if it was n't trying to be serious in the first place , but rather just comically twisted . <p> But if you know kids that can write stuff like that , I 'm extremely impressed . You should give them a cookie . And also tell them to stop writing about twisted death games . I mean they 're kids man , seriously . <p> Not that twisted , pretty standard . Lots of kids anime try to do this thing , it makes the kids watching it go OMG SO COOL&lt; THERES DEATH AND GORE AND STUFF .

Games like Heavy Rain and Beyond . Two Souls and Gears Of War are ridiculous and over the top and sometimes just straight out bad , but something about them still makes them entertaining to play . I expected Until Dawn to be one of these -- but as it turns out , Until Dawn is not a bad game .

Cartoonist Alan Moir drew her as a crowd of clones , grinning menacingly , and Mardi Gras devoted a float to her . Fairfax photographer Mike Bowers called it ' ' Bronnymania ' ' . <p> She was the Sophie Mirabella of the 1990s - the politician journalists loved to hate - but bigger , bolder and more nakedly ambitious .

Commentator Mike Gibson said she was so tough , ' ' she blow-dries her hair in the exhaust of her limo ' ' . <p> Bishop wanted to be prime minister .

Photo : Simon O'Dwyer <p> For that is what Bishop wanted to be : prime minister . Not speaker . <p> Advertisement <p> And , briefly , voters did too : a 1994 Newspoll found 39 per cent of voters wanted her to be leader , while 21 per cent favoured John Hewson and 13 per cent John Howard . <p> The announcement that Tony Abbott would be backing Bishop for the role of speaker this week was heralded as a coup for women . There may have been , stupefyingly and embarrassingly , only one woman in cabinet , but we were told Bishop would be lending lady-like decorum to the house . <p> However , this potential appointment is not a symbol of female achievement , but the thwarted ambition of Liberal women . Just a few months ago Bishop told Peter van Onselen she was not interested in being speaker as she wanted a place at the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard she makes the Tower of Pisa look vertical . <p> This week of course , she sat next to Mr Abbott , beaming delightedly and talking of bringing back dignity to Parliament . I am sure she can do this , but it was never her goal . Real power was her goal . So when exactly will the federal Liberal Party bring women back to cabinet ? And what on earth went wrong ? It 's not hard to find women to promote - the smart , long-serving Marise Payne would be an obvious , easy choice of cabinet member , but is in the outer ministry . Kelly O'Dwyer is another . A meritocracy without a decent number of women is a perversion . <p> The crucial period for understanding the slow collapse of Liberal efforts to draw more women into the fold is the mid-1990s . And the crucial figure is businesswoman Chris McDiven , who went on to be the first female president of the Liberal Party in 2005 . McDiven was president of the NSW Liberal Women 's Forum from 1991 to 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women preselected , with the backing of then state director of the Liberal Party Barry O'Farrell ( who has six women in his cabinet ) . McDiven expanded her efforts nationally when she became the president of the federal women 's committee from 1994 to 1997 - again , with critical support from Hewson . <p> She says the key was : ' ' The party supported the women 's initiative to train , support and mentor women seeking preselection . ' ' And lo ! A record number of Liberal women were elected in 1996 . <p> McDiven had mentored every one of them . But when she stepped down , momentum was slowly lost . Women who were then in Parliament now talk - only off the record - of a fading interest in equality , an insistence that women suffered no disadvantage , and a disdain for those who urged the promotion of women . Much of this has to do with the gradual , firm shift of the party to the right , as well as a vacuum of leadership . <p> Former senator Judith Troeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball on promoting the sensible idea of having strong women candidates ' ' . This happened , she says , because of cultural pressure : ' ' The necessity of having a relevant number of women in the party to show our cultural diversity has lost importance because the leadership has not come from the top . ' ' <p> Over the past decade , there has been a subterranean cultural fight over gender within the party that is rarely spoken of , and only ever with microphones off , through gritted teeth . <p> When I interviewed Bishop for my book Media Tarts 10 years ago , she said men had a vested interest in keeping women out of cabinet : ' ' If women are able to compete equally , what you do for men is , you double your competition ... If you look at our frontbench , most of the blokes have stay-at-home wives . Now , I 'm not criticising that situation , but it does n't reflect what the rest of the country 's like . And it does have an impact on policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not that hard to find women of quality to run for Parliament , and amply occupy the senior jobs . They exist - go find them . Having just one woman in the cabinet is offensive , alienates half the population and exposes us to global ridicule . <p> But what might be hard now is to convince women that politics is a worthwhile career . This week former NSW Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski said the protracted trashing of female leaders - including herself , Cheryl Kernot and Julia Gillard - had been a strong disincentive for women to run at all . <p> Hewson agrees , saying the ' ' personal assassination ' ' of Gillard had made women wonder if they ' ' want to get eaten up like that ' ' . <p> ' ' The course of women in politics has been set back a long way because the numbers are not coming through , ' ' he said . ' ' And the treatment of Gillard causes people to stop and think if this is a circus they want to be part of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some research , tug on their sleeves , encourage them to run , and promote them for potential as well as experience . There are chief executives doing it across the land .

@@539240 <h> Why superannuation change is necessary <p> Maybe it 's the necessary evil , but superannuation change is not only necessary , it 's also inevitable . Bryan Ashenden states the case . <h> 1 . The 2013 Election outcome <p> With the 2013 Federal Election result now known , we know with certainty that there are superannuation changes afoot . You may recall that in their pre-election stance , the Coalition released their ' Real Solutions ' booklet in January 2013 , which contained the following statement : <p> " We will ensure that no more negative unexpected changes occur to the superannuation system so that those planning for their retirement can face the future with a higher degree of predictability . " <p> Whilst we can all have our own view on political speak , this statement itself highlights two main points . <p> There is nothing preventing positive change to the system when needed ; and <p> Negative changes can be made . Provided there is enough notice ( and hopefully consultation ) , they would not be unexpected . <p> On the first point , this was a considerable point of difference between the major political parties leading up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-year moratorium on superannuation change , with any changes to have been considered and recommended by a Superannuation Council . The Coalition was opposed to this as it also prevented the ability to make positive changes earlier . <p> Regarding the second point , there are already changes to be made that we know about . The Coalition committed early on to the removal of the Low Income Superannuation Contribution , which if enacted will remove the contribution ( essentially a refund of contributions tax ) for those earning less than $37,000 . <p> Indeed , with this measure only having commenced from 1 July 2012 and no contributions yet having been paid under this measure , it is potentially one of the first changes the Coalition Government will need to make , so that the mechanism for payment is removed from the law before such payments become due under existing law . <p> The second negative change to super that we expect to come through is the introduction of legislation to tax earnings within a superannuation pension that exceed $100,000 in a given financial year . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 April 2013 , and was included within the 2013 Budget measures , to which the Coalition gave its commitment to support . <p> On the basis that it was part of the Budget measures , was not opposed at the time , and has essentially been included with the Budget revenue forecasts , it is expected that the Coalition Government will proceed with this measure and introduce legislation within the next nine months to give effect to it . <p> This particular piece of legislation will be complex , and extremely difficult to implement . <p> Whilst the enforcement of it may be relatively straight-forward , with existing arrangements around excess contributions being used to facilitate the payment of any tax arising , it is the tracking and reporting of information ( particularly around capital gains tax events ) at a member level that will create the greatest angst for the industry . <p> This is where the need for consultation is extremely important . Where change is to occur , whether positive or negative , it 's vitally important to have the change working correctly from the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superannuation system that people will have faith in . <p> Knowing the rules , understanding the change , and having faith that it will be properly implemented is vital . <h> 2 . Today 's rules are confusing <p> Simplus . Melius . Fortius . If it all sounds like Latin , and a dead language to you , just think how the superannuation system feels to your clients . <p> Back in the 2006 Federal Budget , the then Treasurer Peter Costello released the " Simple Super " package of reforms . <p> And yes , it did sound like it would be simpler -- with no Reasonable Benefit Limit ( RBL ) rules and no tax ( generally ) on super payments to those 60 and over . <p> Of course , imposing limits on the level of contributions and changing the terms to be used for contributions ( undeducted to non-concessional , and deductible to concessional ) was n't quite as simple as people once thought , and the level of excess contribution notices that still arise today is testament to the complexity that still exists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Simpler Super system to become known as " Better Super " . <p> Since then , we have had the more comprehensive review of super , commonly referred to as the Cooper Review , which then led to the previous Government 's package of reforms known as " Stronger Super " , which are yet to be fully implemented . <p> Indeed , there has been much confusion around exactly what will or wo n't happen in this space . <p> For example , we had recommendations from the Productivity Commission around opening up the criteria for nomination of default fund arrangements under Awards -- but these recommendations have ultimately been largely ignored . <p> In the area of self-managed super funds ( SMSFs ) , we had recommendations for new rules to be introduced around the transfer of assets between an SMSF and its related parties , whether in-specie , by way of contribution , by way of benefit payment , or via a purchase or sale . <p> Originally due to commence from 1 July 2012 , a Bill to give effect to this change was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the relevant schedule regarding these amendments was ultimately pulled from the bill to allow its passage . So at this point , we have : <p> A measure that was originally due to commence 1 July 2012 ; <p> With a revised commencement date of 1 July 2013 ; <p> Potentially impacting transactions that have already occurred ( although one would expect a deferral to the start date now likely ) ; and <p> No legislation to give effect to the intent of the change . <p> And if the case for confusion is not clear enough already , think of the number of Rulings and Determinations that are constantly issued by the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) . <p> When it comes to the ATO and rulings , it 's important to remember that the ATO does not make the law -- it applies it . <p> The fact that the ATO needs to issue rulings and determinations at all is reflective of the complexity we have and the need for certainty , clarity , and perhaps one day simplicity . If everyone was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation , there would be no need for rulings . <p> Consider the last couple of months ' worth of activity from the ATO . On 31 July 2013 , we had a final ruling from the ATO ( Taxation Ruling TR 2013/5 ) on when a superannuation income stream commences and ceases . <p> Should n't it be pretty straight forward ? Of course it should , but we all know it is n't , and the fact that this ruling took two years to be finalised and a regulatory change intervention during that time is reflective of the complexity we have . <p> Within eight days of the release of this ruling , we also had a Draft Tax Determination ( TD 2013/D7 ) regarding asset segregation within a fund and a SMSF Determination ( SMSFD 2013/2 ) on pension commutations and minimum payment requirements . <p> You can certainly say that nothing stays quiet in the world of super , and any attempts to reduce or remove this complexity must be welcomed . <h> 3 . Wanted : a system for the long term <p> Over recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means to solve short-term economic issues , often using the wealthier as an excuse to tap the retirement pool of Australians generally . <p> This can not continue . If a Government truly wants Australians to save towards their own retirement , and reduce the increasing burden on the age pension and social security system more broadly , then certainty needs to be restored . <p> In fact it 's more than certainty -- it 's safety that Australians crave . Safety in knowing that the money they voluntarily put away today will be there in the future . <p> Sure , there is market risk that needs to be considered , and advised Australians are much more considered these days about how their future retirement savings are to be invested . <p> But when a financial plan has to be couched in terms of the high potential for legislative risk -- that is , that the laws may change in the future to the detriment of what a client is planning today -- then it 's no wonder that super is looking less attractive to many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significant issues we face in the future with a rapidly ageing population and that there is an increasing need for people to save towards their own retirement . <p> Current and future Governments need to settle on a long-term economic policy framework that creates certainty in clients ' decisions today , and not a have framework where super looks like an easy way out for the Government because many wo n't touch that money for years to come . <p> Changes to make this happen may involve a great deal of courage from a Government . There have been many suggestions in recent years . Perhaps now is the time to seriously look at these options . Some of these suggestions that have potential merit include : <h> ? The introduction of lifetime contribution caps <p> The initial change on 1 July 2007 from benefit capping to contribution capping was a positive start . Whilst not everyone will agree with this , what it does do is remove what was a penalty on clients being successful with underlying investment decisions . <p> Under the old RBL regime , earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the undeducted contributions that did n't . As a result , as members where approaching ( or in breach ) of their relevant RBL , some took decisions to be more cautious with underlying investments in order to manage a tax issue . <p> But this was at the detriment of a higher retirement saving balance and ultimately the chance of a better retirement lifestyle . Introducing lifetime contribution caps allows people to manage when and how they make contributions . <p> What those caps should be ( and presumably they would need to be indexed in some manner ) would need to be determined through solid consultation , but they would allow someone to make a contribution when funds were available , rather than only being allowed to contribute a certain amount each year . <h> ? Compulsory income streams in retirement <p> Whether in the form of an annuity , or reverting to the old style complying income stream , there is an argument that some portion of retirement savings in the future should only be available in the form of an income stream . <p> Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , throughout a person 's retirement years , rather than allowing it all to be withdrawn by way of a lump sum . <p> Such a move is definitely a number of years away , and may require a staged introduction , but is worthy of consideration . <p> Much education would be needed in advance of this change , and possibly the introduction of added incentives to enhance the attractiveness of such a move . <h> The case for change <p> The case , and need , for change into the future is compelling . But change for the sake of it , or to balance a Budget , is wrong . <p> Australia 's superannuation and retirement system has previously been the envy of the world , but arguably the tinkering , chopping and changing over recent times has diluted its worth , and this is obviously the case in the eyes of those it is built for -- the Australian population . <p> We need to ensure that there is a proper consultative approach to future change to ensure all views are appropriately represented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly , fairly and without ambiguity . <p> Perhaps the best argument about the future of superannuation is for all future Governments to be bound to the same broad principle as superannuation trustees and members .

@@552231 <p> Sex offenders have proven to be exceptionally skilled at using social media to gain access to children . <p> Common sense and privacy will protect you ... More and more people are posting images of their children on social media web sites like Facebook unaware how they can protect who sees them . ( Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) Source : Supplied <p> ABOUT five years ago , while interviewing the subject of an article for the Austin American-Statesman , I was asked if I thought parents should post photos of their kids online or if it was too big a safety risk . <p> Facebook existed at the time , but it had yet to become such a mainstream repository of family photos , replacing for many the printed photo album . Instagram had not yet become the Polaroid of the current generation . Smartphones were not yet the primary tool to shoot and store our digital memories . Only a few years before , it was still a new , frowned-upon idea for a blogger to post photos of their kids online and use their real names . <p> My answer was that the volume of online photos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge that being concerned about individual photos would be like worrying about spitting into the ocean . <p> Five years later , many of us post images of our most intimate moments with family , from kiddie birthday parties to first days of school to graduations . Some parents carefully curate their online photo albums for close friends and family , going so far as to password protect them and limit the online exposure of their kids . But lots more , myself guiltily included , post photos publicly without a lot of regard to who might see them , how they may be used or what our kids will think when they 're old enough to be resentful of everything we do on their behalf . <p> When a recent blog post on the website Slate caused a stir by putting forth the radical idea that parents should n't post any photos of their kids online , my source from five years ago emailed asking if my opinion had changed . <p> I still think that it 's paranoid to assume every photo of a child you post online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of what 's out there . But I 've also found myself , as a parent of two little girls , editing more and more what I put out there as they get older . I post fewer photos of them publicly . More than anything else , I 've been shocked at how quickly the technology has evolved to allow us to snap pics and video , press a button and have them online and available to the world in seconds . It has n't given us much time to pause and consider what it is we 're really doing when we commit images and videos to the internet . <p> Paul Schmidt , the founder and president of Austin 's Photodex Corp. , thinks about the implications of photo sharing a lot in his work . His company makes software that allows anyone to create digital slide show videos . <p> Many of his customers are web novices who simply want to create the digital version of family scrapbooks or family photos set to music . The company 's software does n't post videos publicly or make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slide show must share a direct link for family members to view them . <p> But out in the wilderness of Facebook , Instagram , Flickr and dozens of other online photo services , Schmidt says , many people do n't think about if what they 're posting could be a privacy or safety problem for their kids . <p> " It 's just not on enough people 's mind , ' ' he said . " If you went up to 100 people and asked , most would say they have n't really thought about it . They 're just putting together photos for their family ; it does n't even occur to them that what they 're doing could be seen by anybody else . ' ' <p> Schmidt 's 17-year-old daughter recently posted a photo online that he asked her to take down . It was just a drawing in a notebook ; however , in the margin of the photo , her full name and phone number were visible . <p> " She 's 17 and she knows better , but she still managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Schmidt said . <p> Schmidt advises parents who post photos of their kids on the web to avoid photos that include street signs , license plates , a child 's school building or the front of the house where they live . Some location information is not so readily visible . Information embedded in digital photo files called EXIF data can include geolocation data , especially if the photo was taken with a GPS-enabled smartphone . There are computer and smartphone apps that can strip that data out of photos before they 're posted online . <p> Schmidt also suggests making sure privacy settings are kept up to date on social networks , especially if your kids use sites like Facebook or Tumblr . And , he says , having the " stranger danger ' ' conversation about not giving out personal information online is also important . <p> Many worry that photos posted to Facebook can have future privacy implications , such as allowing those photos to be used in ads . Facebook recently drew controversy when photos of a Canadian teen who committed suicide after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison , founder and CEO of MomCom Life , a blogging and events networking company in Austin , says she finds that parents of students her 5-year-old daughter goes to school with tend to be much more stringent about posting photos online than many of the bloggers she talks to . <p> Many bloggers believe that using common sense and posting photos appropriately is most important . No naked pictures of kids . No photos of kids in inappropriate situations . And no photos , Morrison says , that portray kids in a negative way that could hurt or embarrass them later . <p> " If you 're gon na post a picture , make it positive so they can be proud of it and happy with it , because they 're the ones who are going to have to live with it in the end , ' ' she said . <p> Etiquette dictates that parents get a heads-up if their kids might appear in another family 's photos . " Now the conversation in schools and on play dates is , ' Hey , do you mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tweet this or put it on Instagram ? ' That 's part of the conversation that happens among parents right now that did n't used to happen , ' ' said Morrison . <p> She keeps a photo scrapbook for her daughter on a Facebook page , but it can only be viewed and edited by Morrison and her husband . " When she 's old enough , I hope she 'll see it as a neat thing , an interactive online experience . It 's all about her life . ' ' <p> Morrison believes there 's as much , if not more , danger in putting a bumper sticker on a car with the name of a child 's school than posting photos of them online . Online photos , she says , help keep her extended family connected across the country . <p> " The risk is outweighed by all of the good that you can have of it , ' ' she said . <p> A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING : We collect information about the content ( including ads ) you use across this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relevant to you on our network and other sites . 
@@552232 <h> Hine Q&amp;A : Player movement <p> Collingwood 's National Recruiting Manager Derek Hine keeps his eye out for a diamond in the rough at a junior training session earlier this year . <p> Collingwood 's National Recruiting Manager Derek Hine spoke to collingwoodfc.com.au on Monday about how the club 's list is placed leading into the post-season player movement period . <p> Luke Mason : On the cusp of the free agency and trade periods , what approach are we looking to take this year ? Will it be similar to last year where we appeared to be quite aggressive in targeting both mature aged and younger talent ? DH : I suppose what we 're trying to do leading into this particular period is we have to look at two areas . <p> The first thing we need to look at is where do we see the strength of the draft and just as importantly where do we see the depth in the draft . <p> We 've had some retirements and we 're mindful that 2015 appears to be quite a strong draft with a fair degree of depth . A lot of our planning to date has been around 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forward . Having said that , where we are , we feel that the list is reasonably well balanced . <p> We do n't see the need to address our ruck situation given the development of Brodie Grundy and Jarrod Witts and we 'll be retaining Ben Hudson as a bit of a back up there for them , but hopefully Ben does n't have to play at all . <p> LM : What on-field needs have you identified that may need addressing ? DH : What we 're looking at leading into the period is to look at some specific areas that may help us . We 're unsure of where both Dale Thomas and Heath Shaw sit at the moment . In terms of targeting a particular area , we feel that we 're reasonably well balanced . <p> We will be speaking to Jesse White . We 'll assess our situation as the opportunity presents itself . We 're one of most Melbourne clubs that have spoken to Taylor Adams who has obviously come down from Greater Western Sydney . He 's a young player and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date in his performances at an AFL level have been good . <p> LM : How is our list placed heading into 2014 ? Some critics have argued that it 's a time of a mini-rebuild . Is that how you see it ? DH : In terms of the list rebuild , we do n't feel that there 's any real necessity to be making an overhaul of the list . We 've had some serious injuries in the last two or three years . Next year we get Alan Toovey back , hopefully Clinton Young can get a bit more of a run at it , and he 's training very well at the moment so hopefully he can see some blue skies . <p> Again , our approach will be strategic and targeted with any potential opportunity . <p> We 've got players like Jackson Ramsay who we feel will come in and play some senior football . Adam Oxley had a taste of it and we feel that he can play a role . There 's a few of those younger types -- Josh Thomas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's played , even Ben Sinclair having gone back and shown he has a real position here . Marley Williams has continued to develop . I know that the coaches are pretty keen to get him up and show him some midfield time -- whether that 's in 2014 or beyond is all in our planning 's as well . <p> Tim Broomhead , who had an inconsistent start to the year because of illness , we feel that with a pre-season under his belt he 'll come in and play a series of games as well . Caolan Mooney 's another one , as is Ben Kennedy who , with a full pre-season under his belt , it is hoped will push really hard for a regular senior spot . <p> In terms of the age profile , it sits quite well , but having said that we 'll continue to be looking at opportunities as they present themselves . <p> LM : Hawthorn , Geelong and Sydney were all able to regenerate on the run in the past five years and remain competitive . Is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grundy and others coming through this year ? DH : Yes and no . That tends to evolve . If you look at Hawthorn 's side on the weekend , they 've got seven players that are 30 or above in 2014 , so you 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't . It is about trying to find the right balance and having a bit of luck along the way . <p> From our side of things , we just need to be really progressive in how we balance the list out . We 've had a lot of games of experience go out this year but having said that , we finished sixth on the ladder after the home and away season and I think the average games of the boys that have gone out such as Alan Didak and those sorts of guys is around eight games so in terms of the games played in 2013 , it has n't really hurt us as such . <p> LM : Some clubs have predominantly used the draft as a way to build their list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in during October . Does Free Agency allow clubs to build their lists via both methods at once ? DH : It does . Last year we brought in some mature aged players but we were also able to trade into the draft with picks 18 , 19 and 20 . We were able to address two needs . For argument 's sake , if we were successful in bringing Taylor Adams in , he 's a 20-year-old player , if we were to look at other players we really want to make sure that it fits in with our age profile and what we want to do with the list . <p> I think going forward ; the game continues to get harder to play . We played 40 players this year with eight debutants and finished sixth on the ladder post the season with at times a challenging injury list . Statistically it shows you that you 're going to have to need a series of players that are going to be AFL ready because the game 's physically becoming so demanding . We have to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at mature age players that will fit our age profile and potentially fit a need for us as well and recruit players that we feel we can maximise their potential through our systems . <p> LM : We currently have pick 10 in the National Draft , which would be our first top 10 pick since 2006 . How is this year 's draft shaping up compared to last year 's where we picked two players in the top 20 who went on to play senior football ? ? DH : At the moment we hold pick 10 and again with the draft itself I do n't think that it has a lot of depth . <p> I think we 've got an eye on to 2015 , which really is a strong draft and has great depth in it so at this point in time we 'll probably run with 38 players on our primary list . If something pops up late in the draft that does take our fancy then we 'll certainly have to scope in a TTP ( Total Player Payment ) sense to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll probably run with 38 players due to our planning for 2015 . <p> LM : At the end of the 2013 season , we had several players on our rookie list that had played senior football . How are you looking to use them heading into 2014 ? DH : From our point of view , Sam Dwyer 's come up onto the primary list . We have n't made any commitments to any of the other rookies in terms of potential elevations . They 've all agreed to terms and we 're just finalising one more at the moment . <p> By having the 38 players on our primary list , it gives us the scope to have two nominated rookies and that creates the incentive for your Adam Oxleys , your Jack Frosts and your Kyle Martins of the world , and your Caolan Mooneys for that matter . <p> Those guys can really attack the pre-season with a great deal of potential in the knowledge if they do have a strong pre season and perform , there 's the potential scope to be elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season .

But it 's still above 5,200 points , which is a key level as we head towards the end of the year ... <p> But how much attention should you pay to the US debt ceiling ? <p> After all , this is n't the first time you 've heard a bunch of shrieking and wailing as the government nears its spending cap . <p> So our inclination is to ignore the fuss and use the current pull-back as a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , like the boy who cried wolf , there 's always the chance that this is the big one .

The fact is the whole thing is actually speeding up the demise of government-issued money . Governments have shown that you ca n't trust them to look after money , and so at some point the private sector will show them how to do it . <p> Three charts show how the US government in particular is ' helping ' with this shift to private money . <p> First , a chart of the US debt ceiling , which was USD$16.39 trillion at the end of 2012 : <p> Source : Heritage.org <p> Next is the chart of the US monetary base that shows the extent of inflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Louis <p> And finally , this chart shows the decline in the purchasing power of the US dollar since 1900 : <h> The New Way for Money <p> If you gave a friend a loan and he or she used it as capital to borrow more money from the bank and then made you pay the interest to the bank , would you keep handing over your cash ? <p> One day you 'd say enough is enough . <p> And one day that will happen to the US government and every other government that thinks it can borrow without ever paying back the loans . <p> But will that day arrive tomorrow ? Our bet is that it wo n't . Instead , our bet is that you 'll see a continued decline in faith that governments can manage money correctly . <p> This will happen at the same time as individuals transition towards using non-government forms of money . In a way this is here now with PayPal , iTunes and Amazon . <p> Soon enough the transition will be complete to the point that you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or iTunes account . Instead you 'll store units of currency issued by these private companies . <p> That 's why for all the bumps in the market we view issues such as the US debt ceiling as an opportunity .

@@569232 <h> Big data and competition law <p> Organisations that control large reserves of big data could be heading into murky waters as far as competition law is concerned . Big data might well be a source of market power and could potentially be misused , leading to a breach of competition law . <p> Market power is the ability to act relatively unconstrained by competitors , suppliers and customers . Arguably that ability might be conferred by big data as it arms organisations with targeted knowledge and , as seems to be accepted , confers a competitive advantage , including by allowing an enterprise to act in advance of its competitors . If companies like Woolworths or Coles , for example , were able to use big data for the purpose of damaging or eliminating a competitor or preventing a party from competing in a market , that could amount to an actionable breach . <p> While Australia 's courts have yet to address the issue it is not unlikely that cases will arise in which big data plays a role .

Say one of the large supermarkets found a pattern of customer spending in its big data that suggested sales of a particular type of jam may in the future increase . Big data is particularly useful for predictive analytics , and armed with that future expectation the supermarket could choose to increase the shelf space for its home brand jam -- heading off at the pass the anticipated surge in demand for a rival product . <p> To be in breach of the law the supermarket would need to have the proscribed purpose of damaging or eliminating a competitor or preventing a party from competing ( in , say , the retail market for sale of jam ) .

If two companies combined can corner the market in customer data will that be enough to skew competition in a sector and be grounds to oppose a merger ? <p> Woolworths ' recent acquisition of a stake in Quantium may well be very timely .

The first was headed by Roger Gyles in NSW , the second by Terence Cole for the Howard Government . <p> Both inquiries looked at the effect of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union ( CFMEU ) on the industry 's productivity and efficiency . They found widespread disregard for the rule of law in industrial relations by both the union and contractors in the industry , among other issues . <p> After the Cole Commission recommended widespread changes to the industry 's IR laws , legislation establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission ( ABCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in 2005 . <p> The ABCC was deeply opposed by the unions and in July 2012 was replaced by the Gillard government by the Fair Work Building and Construction Inspectorate , a body with reduced scope and powers . <p> In the last election campaign , the Coalition announced a policy to restore the ABCC within 100 days if elected , and intends to introduce the legislation necessary in the first sitting week of Parliament . <p> This is one of a number of measures the Abbott government is reported to be considering to address union militancy in the construction industry . <p> It 's also the only major IR reform currently expected from the government in its first term , despite considerable pressure by a number of industry bodies for a more wide-ranging reform of IR . <h> The good behaviour commission <p> There are two arguments for restoration of the ABCC . First is the need for an industry specific watchdog to monitor illegal behaviour of union representatives and officials and , if and when necessary , to intervene in disputes . <p> The construction industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of this is attributed to union opposition to workplace reforms that would improve efficiency . <p> The number of days lost in construction over the past five years has averaged around 20% of the total for all industries , although there is a wide variation in the number of days per quarter due to industrial disputes in some . <p> It 's these spikes in days lost -- particularly the big increase in days lost to industrial disputes in Victoria in the second half of 2012 -- that has attracted the attention of large contractors and the government . <p> On one hand the rationale for restoring the ABCC is not strong , based on union unrest and strikes in the industry as a whole . After July 2012 there was a significant increase in days lost in the September quarter , when disputes in Melbourne and Brisbane boosted the numbers . <p> But the following three quarters have not seen unusual or particularly high levels of days lost in the industry , as recorded by the ABS . The view of the employer and contractor associations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half true , given there was an increase in days lost after 2007 , but the disputes have tended to be concentrated on specific , large projects not across the industry as a whole . <p> On the other hand , the construction industry has always tended to have more days lost per thousand employees than some other industries , although only a fraction of the level in the coal industry ( the industry with most days lost in Australia ) . And since the 2012 spike , this measure has come down to the overall industry average , and has been reasonably steady . <h> Clamping down to raise productivity ? <p> Solidarity forever : construction workers and police faced off at a rally in Melbourne late last year.AAP Image/Juilan Smith <p> While the CFMEU has a reputation for militancy and a propensity for industrial action , and it has always had some excessively combative officials , it is in an industry where many employers have shown little regard for issues such as safety . <p> The other argument for the ABCC is based on the potential for improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce on-site efficiency for building and construction projects . <p> This is an even more slippery argument to substantiate . The productivity estimates published by the ABS do not show the industry performing well over the last decade , but it has not done particularly badly either . <p> Construction industry productivity is very difficult to measure accurately . The data from the ABS covers the entire industry , and is collected for residential and non-residential building , engineering construction and the trades . But the ABS definition is wide enough for it to cover anything from self-employed tradesmen who do repair and maintenance work to the largest national contractors . <p> Problems with separating the different sectors of the industry make it impossible to see if productivity in the more unionised non-residential building sector is better or worse than in residential building , which is more labour intensive , or engineering construction , which is more capital intensive . <p> So far the industry has not been prepared to compile good data at a project level in a systematic way . Unpublished research by the Centre for Comparative Construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do vary in terms of cost , time and quality , and these variations do add up to identifiable differences between the state capitals . <p> A more widespread approach to building and construction industry reform would be preferable , because there are issues like procurement practices , regulatory costs , and training and technology to be addressed . <p> But the CFMEU does itself no favours with its confrontational attitude , and the Abbott government needs to be seen to make a move on IR . This is as much a political issue as an economic one .

@@586239 <h> Climate change threat to $1.8b snow industry <p> A government report obtained exclusively by Bush Telegraph reveals climate change could cut Australia 's ski season by more than two months , reducing snow depths by 80cm by 2050 . As Greg Muller writes , the industry is concerned that artificial snow and summer tourism wo n't be enough to sustain it . <p> The future of the alpine ski industry is on shaky ground , according to a government commissioned report , with ski seasons predicted to be up to 10 weeks shorter and snow depths considerably diminished . <p> The report predicts that by 2050 the maximum snow depth could decrease by up to 80 centimetres and the ski season might shorten by more than two months . <p> Dr Jonas Bhend from the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research was one of the authors of the report . <p> ' The maximum snow depth could decrease by around 50 percent by 2050 in the higher elevation sites . Although in the lower elevation sites by 2050 , the strongest emission scenario suggests the snow might be gone by then , ' said Dr Bhend . <p> ' The worst scenario is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and by 2050 it 's 70-80 per cent . <p> ' It depends on what emissions reduction we decide on . At the moment we look like tracking the higher emissions scenarios . ' <p> The latest report , coming 10 years after the original study , offers some valuable insights into the accuracy of earlier work . <p> ' We can actually compare the observed changes with the projected changes and we find there is a very good correspondence between the projected decrease in snow and the actual rate of observed decrease in the past decade , ' said Dr Bhend . <p> The 2003 report by the CSIRO predicted the amount of snow machines would need to increase by 100 per cent by 2020 in order to keep the industry profitable . <p> Colin Hackworth is the CEO of Australia Ski Areas Association , an industry body representing ski area owners and operators . <p> Mr Hackworth says this situation has already played out . <p> ' In the last 10 years , snow making capability has doubled . It 's something which guarantees people a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginner and intermediate slopes and it 's these slopes which will continue to be snow made , ' said Mr Hackworth . <p> Associate professor at the Centre for Tourism Research at the University of Canberra , Dr Tracey Dickson is studying the viability of alpine resorts and she says the stigma associated with snow making is now gone . <p> ' Fifteen years ago you 'd never see a resort talk about their snow making capabilities , it was an embarrassment . Now it 's seen as a point of differentiation and a comparative advantage , ' she said . <p> However , Dr Jonas Bhend thinks the reliance on snow making is a short term fix at best . <p> ' If we are on a high emissions trajectory out to 2050 then even snow making is probably not going to cut the deal , ' he said . <p> Cheap airfares and a strong Australian dollar have lead many people to consider overseas destinations for their next ski holiday , countries like New Zealand and Japan where snow cover is more reliable . <p> Colin Hackworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow will drive the ski dollar offshore . <p> ' It is a very real risk and I think the Australian resorts need to band together and push back , ' he said . <p> ' This is something which is going to take a genuine partnership between governments and private industry . <p> ' The snow industry in Australia is worth 1.8 billion dollars and employs 18,000 people . This is economic value and jobs that are not in capital cities but in regional Australia . <p> ' The Snowy Mountains shire relies on the snow industry for 52 per cent of its employment . If the industry and government sits idly by then you will see investment and jobs leak overseas . ' <p> However , Mr Hackworth does n't think the resorts can attract enough year-round tourists to make up for the shorter snow seasons . <p> ' Whether it 's bushwalking , horse riding or cycling the reality is these are of relatively low yield and this means there wo n't be a lot of investment put into these activities , ' he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from places where the off-season is as long as our ski season . <p> ' When you look at Canadian resorts with their mountain bike season they 're particularly short .

@@594240 <p> Regular readers will know that I have had a bit to say in the past about the way the chiropractic profession is run in Australia . I have refrained thus far from posting about the latest controversy , but I feel compelled to comment again now . <p> The cudgels were taken up again back on 29 September , when Amy Corderoy and Julia Medew published an article in the Fairfax press detailing the story of an infant who had been taken to Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne with an apparent serious injury to the upper spine . The medical slang term for the type of injury is a " hangman 's fracture " as it was commonly seen in those who died at the end of a noose if the job was properly done . It can also occur in situations where the head is forcibly extended ( chin up ) and a lengthening force is applied along the neck , such as an unrestrained head hitting a car dash , or your chin hitting a table violently if you fell forwards . The Fairfax article also detailed evidence from Reasonable Hank , a blogger who had been observing discussions on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about surreptitiously treating patients in public hospitals , including newborns . The screenshots published on Reasonable Hank 's blog post can be viewed here . <p> It 's fair to say the Chiropractors ' Association of Australia ( CAA ) went into crisis management mode . They issued a demand for a retraction of the story on the grounds that the report generated by the Chiropractic Board of Australia 's investigation had found that <p> " In fact no finding was made that any treatment performed by the Chiropractor caused a fracture as alleged . " <p> " It remains the case that not a single serious adverse event has been recorded in the medical literature ( world-wide ) involving a qualified Chiropractor treating a child since 1992 . " <p> I 've heard this line from CAA officials before . I pointed out this case to the CAA Board member who I first heard make this claim . It details a case of suspected child abuse of an infant with fractured ribs . The parents were cleared and the fractures attributed to the use of an Activator instrument ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had treated the baby . To avoid the risk of misquoting , I 'll give you his response verbatim : <p> " Occam 's razor would suggest another , far more common cause of such an injury , no matter how nice the parents may have seemed to the hospital social workers . " <p> Nice . Since it is clearly impossible for a chiropractor to injure a child , the logical conclusion is child abuse , no matter what the experienced social workers and paediatricians who actually did the investigation thought . Classy . <p> But back to the CAA 's response to this latest report of a serious injury . In their initial response to the article , CAA President Laurie Tassell told Medical Observer magazine : <p> " The official report made it quite clear that the chiropractor did not cause the injury but unless AHPRA releases the report we ca n't use those findings . " <p> But it did n't stop him going on to tell everybody that it showed there was no fracture , hangman 's or otherwise . <p> The next blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the wake of Medew and Corderoy 's article , Queensland MP and former GP Dr Alex Douglas announced he would lobby for legislative changes to prevent chiropractors treating children unless adequate evidence of safety and efficacy was found . <p> Somehow , a copy of the AHPRA report , with names redacted , was obtained by Labour MP Jo-Ann Miller , the Shadow Minister for Health in Queensland . It was tabled in the Queensland parliament with a short speech and thus became a publicly available document . This was accompanied by a co-ordinated damage control effort including a favourable report in the Australian , which gave them the reassuring headline they no doubt wanted and which has been widely quoted on chiropractors ' social media . Newscorp journalist Andrew Fraser must have been secretly delighted at the prospect of giving his Fairfax colleagues a bit of a poke in the eye by having such a neat story handed to him . Certainly it emboldened CAA President Laurie Tassell , who trumpeted to Medical Observer that there were : <p> " no features on any images to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone , cleft or surrounding tissues " . <p> " The child did not have a fracture as alleged ; the child had a congenital condition known as congenital spondylosis and the chiropractor could not and did not cause any injury to the child . " <p> Before I discuss the relevance of this new finding , it might pay to reflect for a second on the extraordinary situation of a professional association 's spin program benefiting from the leaking to a politician of a confidential investigation . The circumstances of the chain of events which occurred are now in the public domain , under parliamentary privilege . Such reports are highly sensitive , and are kept strictly confidential for very good reasons . In this case , both the child involved and the father of the child have a rare congenital spinal condition . This , plus other details in the leaked report could easily identify them . Experts and witnesses must be confident that they can speak freely and give frank opinions to the regulator without fear of leaks . Future investigations will be compromised if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their opinions will become part of a media circus . A spokesperson for AHPRA told Medical Observer : <p> " As a regulator , the board is not able to breach the law or confidentiality requirements by releasing information that is not public . " <p> This leak represents a massive governance failure on the part of the CBA , and for the sake of the integrity of future investigations can not be without consequences for those involved . <p> Sadly for the CAA 's efforts , the release of the report has not so much been a bullet in the foot as a landmine which has taken both their legs off . <p> The report in fact DOES confirm that the imaging showed a fracture . Without getting too heavily into technicalities , the congenital condition the baby had makes it harder to exclude a hangman 's fracture than usual , as the piece of bone which fractures is replaced by cartilage and immature bone which does n't image well . Nevertheless , Paragraph 33 of the report notes that " initial radiology opinion was that ( redacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the axis vertebra " . These initial reports and even what type of scan it was are never referred to again . A repeat CT done a couple of months down the track , and quoted at length in Paragraph 33 was reported as showing the spondylolysis but no obvious fracture . <p> Another CT done nearly six months after the child first went to hospital seems damning . The report of the CT concludes : <p> Evidence of some healing involving the left C2 pedicle defect suggesting a likely previous underlying trauma/fracture superimposed on a developmental spondylolysis <p> So in fact , the scenario appears to be that the injury was initially diagnosed as a bilateral fracture , which was hard to see on the next scan , but clearly evident as an asymmetrical area of new bone formation with the appearance of a healing fracture . In anticipation of indignant protests in the comments section , I would hasten to add that normal development of a child 's spine is very hard to mistake for a healing fracture if you have an experienced eye . Monash Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of highly skilled radiologists . I am intrigued to know what the scan was that the child initially had . It may have been an MRI , or another CT , but it is mentioned once , then not again . <p> Later paragraphs of the report are puzzling in their logic . Paragraph 61 admits that the " low force techniques " supposedly used by the chiropractor would provide biomechanical forces which may be exceeded by or matched by forces produced by normal handling . <p> If this is so , why bother doing them ? Perhaps we are all paediatric chiropractors , fixing subluxations inadvertently every time we cuddle our kids or change their nappy . <p> The rest of Paragraph 61 is simply incredible . The expert chiropractor writing the report suggests that : <p> because of inability to completely rule out any other occurence during the period 25-27 January it is difficult to link without reasonable doubt the examination and treatment provided by ( redacted ) and ( redacted ) ' s loss of head control . Temporal relationship does not automatically confirm cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the child lost the ability to control its head movements after a chiropractic neck treatment , do n't assume that the two are related . It was clearly those parents again , probably chucking the kid around at an Australia Day barbie , seems to be the message . Cases of hangman 's fracture due to child abuse are referred to in several places within the body of the report . More innocent peoples ' reputations get pushed under a bus in pursuit of keeping the " no-harm " myth intact . <p> So on that form I am drawn to the unsavoury conclusion that if your child gets injured having chiropractic treatment , there seems a fair chance you as a parent might get accused of injuring your own child if you complain . <p> Andrew McNamara , the CEO of CAA , put his point of view as simply as possible on Twitter . This is what doubling down looks like <p> CAA has also put out a couple of Member Updates , reassuring their members that " an internationally renowned medical radiologist has examined the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are ' no features on any images to confirm there has been a fracture , with no edema of the bone , cleft or surrounding tissues ' " . This radiologist has not been named , and according to a Medical Observer interview with Tassell , this is because of " regrettable fear of retribution " . Now I know that the Big Pharma cabal of which I am regularly accused of being a part is powerful , but are we ruthless and cold-blooded enough to force an overseas radiologist of considerable eminence into witness protection ? Just because he read a few x-rays in a way we did n't like ? And anyway , Monash Medical Centre has its own Professor of Radiology , plus a fleet of Associate Professors so why get some anonymous , terrified foreigner when you could just ask any of these equally capable hometown imaging boffins ? <p> As things stand now , we have CAA categorically stating in a Members ' Update that : <p> The child did not have a fracture as alleged <p> The child had a congenital condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not cause any injury to the child . <p> Of these statements , I would say the first seems highly questionable given the AHPRA report and perhaps other facts of the case not contained or mentioned at length in it . The second is uncontroversial , and nobody disagrees with it . If you believe the third statement , you require a better explanation to be found for such a serious injury . The suggestion from the AHPRA expert is that the parents were responsible , either accidentally or deliberately . This is at odds with the conclusions of the treating team at Monash . One wonders what Dr Pappas and his team saw in this case that convinced them to go ahead with a report to the Chiropractic Board . I doubt Pappas or any other time-poor public hospital clinician would start a process like this for laughs , or even because they hate chiropractors . Still less because they are " camp followers " of the AMA as Tassell has remarked . If you believe the President and CEO of CAA , this is an unprovoked malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers strong enough to meaningfully retaliate against an eminent overseas radiologist . This is a point of view they seem prepared to seek help from politicians and journalists to defend . <p> There never was a baby with a broken neck . 2+2=5 . Ignorance is strength . And we 've always been at war with Eastasia , did n't you know ? 
@@604230 <p> A commitment to sustainability has become a typical component of any modern-day corporation 's public face . Visit the homepages of major organisations in any sector , from coal-mining to cola-making , and you 'll find " green " credentials front and centre . <p> This might be viewed as a predictable and well-intentioned response to mounting concerns over climate change , deforestation , declining biodiversity and other environmental issues . Yet a distinctive component of that response has been to try to incorporate the environment within market capitalism . <p> For example , last year the UK government 's Environment department initiated an Ecosystems Market Task Force to review opportunities to " value and protect nature 's services " . This is typical of the fast-emerging trend for the environment to be accorded a market worth and for corporations to be seen as the central institutions through which that worth can be maintained . <p> Consequently , we seem to have reached a stage where both the environment and the market are treated as social goods . It follows then that the two will occasionally have competing interests . So which tends to benefit and which tends to suffer when compromise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of Sociology , we argue it is the market that is almost invariably and overwhelmingly favoured . <p> The study , focused on the sustainability approaches of a number of Australian and global companies and involved lengthy interviews with their sustainability managers and consultants . They were chosen because their work encompasses precisely the sort of compromises that have come to characterise the relationship between the environment and the market . Many saw their roles as involving not only an allegiance to their employers and shareholders , but also a concern for the environment and society . Some had even changed careers and reconsidered their personal values because of their dedication to environmental issues . <p> We also analysed a range of relevant material , including corporate sustainability reports , policy documents and statements relating to carbon emissions . As has become de rigueur , many of these were festooned with evocative images of forests , oceans and landscapes , as well as employees ' testimonials about the environment 's significance in their personal and professional lives . <p> Yet beneath the warm glow of corporate social responsibility lurked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold light of day ... <p> Staff members expressed a keen and genuine interest in the environment , but at the same time were well aware of the constraints of challenging successful business practices likely to exacerbate ecological degradation . As the director of one sustainability consultancy remarked : " It always comes down to the optimum point . You want them to be as sustainable as can be , but you do n't want them to shut down their operation . There 's no simple path through this . " <p> Moreover , compromise was shown to be at best a temporary resolution -- one subject to continued criticism , adaptation and refinement . The next step frequently led only to a new and ' better ' compromise or an outright shifting of the goalposts . <p> Take , for instance , environmentalists ' much-publicised claim that bio-fuels cause deforestation and food shortages : the result was the promotion of " second-generation " , more environmentally friendly bio-fuels . Or the company whose initial confidence in its " ambitious " carbon emissions reduction target of 40 per cent was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver " because of an increase in business -- despite investment in energy-saving equipment and " sustainable " retail outlets . <p> There are " win-win " situations -- say , when new " green " products or initiatives cut costs or enhance revenues -- but it is generally acknowledged that these are pursued only when the benefits to the market , not the benefits to the environment , can be guaranteed . In such instances compromise serves to deny the inequality of competing goods . There is no space for a reduction of profit or a decline in growth . Boosting the bottom line remains the primary objective . Ultimately , it is the market that records another lopsided victory . <p> Ironically , within any organisation it is the individuals who are most environmentally attuned who are also most often engaged in compromising the environment . They accept -- albeit sometimes grudgingly -- the impossibility of governing innocently . As the environment is reconstructed into a commodity and a tool for profit , they have to get their hands dirty . <p> One key question is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counter-movement of protection and conservation through legislation . In short , can nature have a legal standing ? There may be some hope in this regard . <p> Irrespective of whether they eventually prove of limited practical impact , these fledgling efforts at least illustrate a social awareness of the need for some control over market capitalism 's excesses . They also underline -- as if further evidence were needed -- that the conflict between the environment and the market is likely to prove a source of even greater friction , criticism and compromise as the physical realities of the natural world 's decline become ever more profound .

Once found for a particular galaxy , an exact distance from Earth can be calculated . <p> Although disappointing at first , finding only one Lyman-alpha line was an intriguing discovery , the scientists said . <p> One theory said that , after cooling down from the Big Bang , a cosmic fog of neutral hydrogen gas cloaked our early universe . <p> " That was the case until the very first galaxies lit up , " said Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb , who was not involved in the study . <p> " They produced the ultraviolet radiation that broke up hydrogen .

It did n't -- at least not as far as mainstream business was concerned . <p> For the best part of the last six years , carbon pricing was supported by many of Australia 's leading companies .

It receives and transmits satellite signals to geostationary satellites , and sells that bandwidth on to third parties . <p> It 's one of two teleports owned by NewSat . The other is in Perth . Due to a mix of low rainfall , geographical position , state-of-the-art engineering and political stability , both teleports are considered some of the best places in the world from which to secure satellite bandwidth , offering up-times of nearly 100% . <p> NewSat , a microcap satellite company listed on the ASX , does not currently own any satellites . It 's a middle man . It buys bandwidth from the handful of major satellite companies and sells it on to governments and companies in the telecommunications and resource industry . But that 's about to change . <p> For the past few months , NewSat 's CEO , Adrian Ballintine , has been travelling around the world trying to raise the $600 million necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy . When he started , his company had a market capitalisation of just $60 million . <p> But he 's pulled it off . Through a mix of export development funds and institutional investment , NewSat has the money to build its first satellite . Jabiru 1 is due to lift off in 2015 . If that launch is successful , NewSat will be well on track to become one of Australia 's largest , most profitable companies . <p> The barriers to entry in building , launching and operating satellites are extraordinary . But as governments and corporations increase their usage of high-quality communications their need for satellite bandwidth grows . <p> For companies able to offer new satellites , there 's a huge amount of money to be made . And NewSat is looking to cash in . <p> " The reason we 're launching a satellite is because we just ca n't get enough capacity from other vendors , " Ballintine tells SmartCompany . <p> " At the moment , our business model is that we buy capacity from other satellite producers , we add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandwidth . That 's a 30% margin business . <p> " By launching our own satellite , we become masters of our own capacity , and we go from a 30% margin business to an 80% margin business . " <p> That 's why he could raise the money . The demand for satellite bandwidth is huge . Already , Jabiru 1 has sold 20% of its capacity -- bringing in $800 million . Once it 's launched , Ballintine says it could bring in $3 billion in revenue , with earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ) of at least $150 million a year . <p> And that 's just one satellite . NewSat owns eight orbital slots . There are 160 in the world ( one for every two degrees along the equator ) . Into the eight slots it owns , NewSat can put 20 satellites . It 's already got plans for Jabiru 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 . <p> NewSat got its start through ownership of the teleports . It bought them for $17 million in 2005 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're very good teleports , but there are 1700 in the world overall . Ownership of the teleports was n't enough to break into the satellite game . <p> That took financing . A lot of it . <p> The bulk of the money came on loan from the American and French governments . <p> Building the satellite will create 1000 jobs at Lockheed Martin in the United States . And building the launcher will create 600 jobs at French company Arianespace . <p> " Both those governments spent a year doing due diligence on our contracts and our projects , and decided to lend us $400 million at 2% interest per annum . That 's why export money is the best money you can get . It 's cheap money , because you 're providing jobs . " <p> NewSat itself directly employs 75 people . But the hundreds of temporary jobs it would create in the United States and France got it $400 million in funding . NewSat then put $50 million of its own money in , used debt instruments for another $50 million , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to private investors , the bulk of interest came from the US and UK . <p> " Initially , we were laughed out of everyone 's offices in Australia , " Ballintine says . " We were a little company raising $600 million in a financial community that had no way of understanding anything about satellite technology . Australian analysts understand resources , and digging holes . It was just the wrong place to start . So we started in markets that understood space and satellites . <p> " Funding the first satellite is murder . The due diligence we had to go through was an enormous task . " But since they started , NewSat 's market cap has risen from $60 million to $300 million . As the company gets bigger , raising the funds for satellites will get easier . <p> But one huge risk remains : that of the satellite crashing to the ground . <p> That 's why NewSat is going with Arianespace to build its launcher . The French company has n't had a failure in 57 launches . <p> NewSat 's satellite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says realistically , Arianespace was the only company who had a launcher big enough to carry it . <p> The technical aspects of the satellite and launcher are wholly built to minimise risk . The satellite design aims to change as little as possible from previous successful launches , so as not to introduce any new design flaws . Satellites stay up for at least 15 years , so the engineers are highly conservative , using only materials that have been tried and tested as opposed to the newest innovations . As one of NewSat 's engineers said to SmartCompany : " If a bolt has n't flown before , we do n't want it . " <p> If all else fails , NewSat pays $36 million in insurance premiums every year . It also owns the orbital slot next door , so it could migrate some of the contracts it 's already sold to Jabiru 2 , which it hopes to launch a few months after the first satellite . <p> But launch failure would be a huge setback . " Even though we have insurance , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launches , an explosion is always a risk , " Ballintine says . <p> If it works though , the possibilities are extraordinary . NewSat could come from virtually nowhere to being one of Australia 's largest companies . <p> The sums speak for themselves . <p> Ballintine says satellite companies typically trade at multiples of between eight to 12 times EBITDA . <p> The EBITDA on NewSat 's first satellite is close to $200 million . If NewSat launches five , that 's a billion in EBITDA right there , which you 'd then multiply by at least eight to get a multibillion dollar market capitalisation . <p> " It 's not just a wild stab , " Ballintine says . " If we get our act right , and we launch multiple satellites ... there 's no question this could be a very large company indeed .

@@616230 <p> The Abbott Government 's proposed repeal of Australia 's climate legislation will be heard through history . <p> This action is being taken at a time when the rest of the world is moving in the other direction . As the effects of climate change become clearer to the Australian public , the political legacy of this act of repeal is likely to be seen as a historic mistake . <p> The repeal will remove the principal instruments of government policy that can credibly reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions . Going out the door will be an emissions trading system that places binding limits on emissions on key sectors , and would place a price on carbon , and an effective clean energy finance system that is already having an effect . <p> The present system is as fundamental a reform as Medicare and the floating of the Australian dollar . The replacement is direct regulation and limited funding that **27;341;TOOLONG can not reduce emissions to the same extent nor as cost-effectively . <p> Instead , the repeal seems very likely to result in emissions exceeding 2000 levels , and far away from even the least ambitious goal of a 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to achieve . <p> Doing something serious about climate change means putting a limit and a price on carbon : all economists know that and it has been a finding of successive IPCC reports on the economics of reducing greenhouse gas emissions . <p> To disagree about whether the price should come from a tax or a trading system is one thing . Repudiating the very idea of a carbon price is quite another . This is where climate denialism hits the real world of policy - a denial of one of the core policy instruments needed to reduce emissions is in effect denial of the need to act . <p> The outbreak of denial in Government ranks about the well-established connection between wild fires and increased heat extremes from climate change adds to the surreal aspects of this debate . That a Minister resorts to Wikipedia to justify his position of no connection between climate change and wildfires is nothing less than a repudiation of the world class climate science community in Australia . <p> It is more than extraordinary that this is happening in 2013 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR5 ) on the physical basis of climate change , with the last decade warmer than any before it , climate impacts visible around the world and Australia in the middle of its hottest-ever year . <p> Sadly , the huge fires that have burnt out of control in New South Wales are a portent of what is to come : these fires are big , early and consistent with the predictions of climate models coupled to fire danger index systems . Climate scientists have a duty to point this out to the public : the more carbon we put in air the more climate impacts we will get . <p> Australia is among the regions expected to experience highly adverse effects from increased heat extremes , more extreme droughts and sea level rise , even at warming levels of only 2C . <p> A year from now , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will host a Head of Government Summit on climate change as one pillar of " ambition " including targets and actions by countries . Australia and other nations will be expected to come to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can hold warming below 2C . <p> The Abbott Government will face its first real test on climate policy internationally in a couple of weeks at the international climate talks in Warsaw . One of the main issues will be the willingness of governments to increase the level of ambition on climate action . <p> It will be interesting to see whether the Government even sends a minister , given that it plans to put forward its repeal of the climate policy legislation while the Warsaw Conference of Parties ( COP ) is underway . The absence of an Australian minister at a COP would be highly unusual . Given this would be due to efforts of the new government to dismantle the legislative basis for Australia to increase its level of ambition , would speak for itself . <p> We know that it is scientifically , technically and economically feasible to hold the increase in global warming below 2C .

He should inform the country that climate science is solid and - while no single event can yet be attributed to global warming - the extreme and unusually early fires in Sydney are a signal of what is to come unless we all knuckle down and work on reducing our emissions . <p> In the same breath , he could warn the country , based in the current forecast of the season ahead , that the next six months are going to be unusually hot , dry and risky . <p> And he will send his environment minister to Warsaw with the message to accelerate international action , confirming Australia stands ready to play its part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@616233 <h> Necks question ... how did the biggest dinosaurs get so big ? <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Adam Yates does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Alongside Tyrannosaurus rex , the basic sauropod dinosaur is one of the most iconic and instantly recognisable of prehistoric animals . Not only is their elegant shape with four columnar limbs , a long muscular tail and a hugely long neck with a relatively tiny head perched atop very well known , so is their prodigious size . <p> At masses that were equivalent to those of large baleen whales ( about 85 tons ) , the largest sauropods were far and away the largest land-living animals that have ever lived . This of course prompts the obvious question : <p> Many theories have been suggested , running to the wildly fanciful and improbable such as proposals that the Earth 's gravity was lower in the Mesozoic Era ( around 252 to 66 million years ago ) . <p> Somewhat puzzling then is the paucity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . Why this might be so is not clear ; perhaps it is partly to do with the sheer difficulty and expense of extracting and dealing with such large yet exceedingly fragile fossil bones . <p> Whatever the reason for past neglect , the tide has definitely been turning in the past decade or so . In particular , we have a major collaborative research unit , funded by the German federal government , looking into sauropod biology and in particular the evolution of their gigantism . <p> Headed up by Professor Martin Sander at Bonn University , the unit includes 13 working groups from several different disciplines in science . So far they have published well over hundred papers and a comprehensive book summarising their work on the biology of sauropod dinosaurs - and today , add these 14 new papers to the literature . <p> This collection adds new research into several aspects of sauropod biology and takes a look at how the unit 's overarching model for the evolution of sauropod gigantism is faring with continued testing and investigation , from both within and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascades <p> At the heart of the research unit 's effort lies the " Evolutionary Cascade Model " , or ECM for short . This model posits that it was the sauropod ancestor 's unique mix of primitive and derived life history , physiological and functional anatomic traits that led to several evolutionary cascades of changes , that fuelled by positive feedback loops , that drove sauropod body size up beyond that of any other terrestrial animal group . <p> What is this proposed mix of traits ? Put simply : a high basal metabolic rate and bird-style respiratory system including unidirectional airflow through the lungs ( derived traits ) combined with the production of many small offspring and very limited oral processing of food ( primitive traits ) . <p> These traits are then hypothesised to have initiated five interrelated evolutionary cascades : <p> reproduction <p> feeding <p> head and neck <p> birdlike lung <p> metabolism . <p> To look at how just one these cascades might work , let 's look at the feeding cascade . <p> An Apatosaurus has a drink.Wikimedia Commons <p> If we start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and I should add at this point sauropods were undoubted strict herbivores ) early sauropods needed little time between the acquisition of the food and swallowing it , which meant that they could have a high food intake rate . <p> Indeed through the evolution of sauropods we see the evolution of several specialisations to support increased food intake rates such as very fast tooth replacement , widening gaps through broader jaws and loss of cheeks . <p> This produced a selective advantage of obtaining more energy from the environment , provided that there was a larger gut capacity to deal with the high input of poorly chewed food , and selecting for larger body size . <h> Tiny head , long neck <p> To show how different cascades were linked we can see that the feeding cascade was also intimately linked to the head/neck anatomy cascade . The lack of oral processing of the food meant that the head did not have to carry a massive set of chewing muscles to deal with the increased load of plant fodder . <p> In modern mammals , chewing muscles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger relative to body size as absolute body size increases . Thus free from this constraint , sauropods were able to evolve relatively small heads that required far less energy to carry and to move around , thus allowing necks to elongate and feeding envelopes - the amount of food ( " browse " ) that an animal can reach without having to walk - to increase . <p> Rearing Barosaurus skeleton.Wikimedia Commons <p> By swinging their tiny head around on a very long neck , a huge amount of browse is available at little energetic cost , allowing the evolution of faster food intake rates , larger guts and larger body mass . <p> This is just one cascade chain in model that contains four others . In effect what the unit is proposing is a particularly complicated version of " correlated progression " , a model that has been proposed to explain a number of major transformations in macroevolution such as the origin of turtles and mammals . In correlated progression many traits are interrelated and evolution progresses by small changes in all of them occurring side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to see that even within this collection there is still dissention between various researchers on the question of just how those immensely long necks of sauropods were deployed . <p> One contribution argues strongly that all sauropods held their necks straight out in front of their bodies in a horizontal , or near-horizontal pose . <p> ... a little like this.Wikimedia Commons <p> These conclusions are based largely on digital models of the skeleton where each bone is articulated with its neighbours and manipulated so that the joint facets are minimally or maximally overlapping . This yields both a total range-of-motion ( ROM ) and something known as the osteologically neutral position ( ONP ) , where the joint surfaces are maximally overlapped and the bones fit together most " comfortably " . <p> The researchers finds that the ONP has the sauropods neck sticking straight out , rather than raised up in a swan-like curve , and that the ROM does not allow the head to be lifted very far in the vertical plane although it does allow for wide lateral sweeps of the neck . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were committed high browsers . <p> Not so fast , says a different paper , which argues that the ONP tells us nothing about the typical attitude that the neck was held in life and that these skeletal models fail to take in the effect that soft tissues such as joint cartilages and intervertebral discs would have had on both the ROM and the ONP . <h> Huge body mass <p> Central to the issue of sauropod gigantism is body mass , which is a surprisingly difficult thing to measure in extinct , incompletely known animals . <p> Many estimates for different sauropods have been published using different methods and results have varied wildly even those based upon the same specimen . <p> In this collection of papers there is an attempt to estimate of one of the largest of all known sauropods : Argentinasaurus ( see the video below ) . <p> The method used was to scan in the complete skeleton and in the computer construct " convex hulls " , which are simpler three-dimensional shapes that enclose major regions of the skeleton . <p> From these an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from that an estimate of mass . The technique has been applied to animals of known masses with good results so the estimate of 85 metric tons for Argentinasaurus may not be too far off the mark . <p> However , it is worth remembering that much the scanned skeleton that the convex hulls were built around was itself modelled from scaled-up remains of types of related sauropods because the original remains of Argentinasaurus are so incomplete . <p> Argentinosaurus femur.Wikimedia Commons <p> This is a persistent problem in trying to discover the upper limits of mass that sauropods reached : all of the supergiant sauropod remains that have been found so far are frustratingly incomplete . Some of the researchers suggest a way out of this problem - rather than trying to estimate volume , and subsequently mass , from what is left of their dead remains , why not try to estimate the force applied to the ground when they walked and thus calculate mass in that manner ? <p> Put very crudely the deeper the print , the heavier the trackmaker . Unlike skeletons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , and trying that method with footprints left by elephants of known weight gets good results . <p> However , the researchers do not yet take the next step and apply their method to fossil sauropod prints . For the method to work properly , the physical properties of the substrate , and how it deforms when a heavy animal steps on it , must be known precisely . I suspect that estimating these properties for substrates that have been compacted and lithified by geological processes will present a great challenge - but I look forward to seeing future attempts . <p> There is a lot more contained in these papers that I have n't discussed here . What is clear is that sauropods are fascinating and extreme examples of biological engineering . We have made big inroads into understanding how they worked as living organisms and how they got to be that way . <p> Yet there remains much left to be discovered and these awesome beasts from Earth 's past will keep scientists of all sorts busy for many years to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

You press the thumbstick forward , and he begins to jog . What 's left to do but run ? And so you run . <p> I shudder to think how many cumulative hours I 've spent trapped in Assassin 's Creed loading screens , running . Six ? Eight ? Half a day , perhaps , staring at a screen , watching a man trapped in a digital construct within a digital construct , sprinting endlessly and getting nowhere . <p> That loading sequence functions as both recurring feature and apt metaphor for the Assassin 's Creed series . Each game is a sprawling digital contraption that sends me running in all directions but often leaves me wondering whether I 'm actually getting anywhere . <p> At their best , Assassin'sCreed games provide a wonderful way to occupy one 's time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands in faraway places ; climb to the tops of the highest national monuments ; meet interesting historical figures , and kill them . <p> Assassin 's Creed IV : Black Flag , more than any previous Creed game , arrives at a crossroads between the series ' best traits and its worst habits . It is a vast game , an ocean-sized pirate 's chalice that stands empty and asks you to fill it , drop by drop , with your time and attention . It is if not the best pirate simulator I 've ever played , certainly the most aesthetically pleasing . <p> But just as often as I 'd find myself gleefully sailing the ocean blue , I 'd be churning through the same menial Assassin 's Creed tasks I 've churned through dozens of times before . Where lies the heart of this series ? After six years and seven games , are we any closer to something resembling a destination ? And is that destination -- and the volumes of ongoing lore and backstory supporting it -- even necessary , or could this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Edward Kenway , a ( sexy ) 18th century privateer who sailed the Caribbean and ( sexily ) adventured through the West Indies . This is Creed game as pure historical fantasy . Call it Hot Pirate Simulator 2013 . <p> Right from the outset , Black Flag appears to have studiously learned from the many failings of its predecessor , 2012 's Assassin 's Creed III . That game began with a lengthy prologue in which you controlled the eventual protagonist 's father Haytham Kenway . On and on it dragged , a tiresome setup to a twist that hardly felt worth the wait . By contrast , in Black Flag you 'll be sailing a ship within minutes and engaging in full-on piracy within the first couple of hours . Black Flag 's Edward Kenway may be the eventual father of III 's prologue-dragger Haytham , but the early goings of Edward 's story do not , blessedly , concern themselves with backstory or lineage . <p> The game starts by throwing us into Kenway 's boots as he pilots an ill-fated pirating vessel before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treacherous member of the West Indies Chapter of the Assassin 's Guild , Local 104 . Ever the rogue , Edward dons his victim 's robes and decides to take on a delivery job the former Assassin died while undertaking , assuming the man 's identity in order to get paid . Things do not go according to plan , and so begins Edward 's long and winding road from rapscallionhood to brotherhood . <p> Edward 's story is a mess , but it 's a mess that 's charming just often enough to offset the clumsiness . He 's the series ' most reluctant subscriber to the Assassins ' cause and clan -- he begins the game wearing the iconic robes out of convenience , and it takes him a good dozen hours to begin even grudgingly helping the Assassins in their ongoing battle against the power-hungry Templars . <p> The story , credited to Darby McDevitt , Mustapha Mahrach and Jean Guesdon , often feels like the kind of patchwork you 'd expect to find holding together a game with this many moving parts . Scattered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirate -- who , full ( awesome ) disclosure , is a distant relative of mine -- steals a few scenes as his raging inner demons boil to the surface . I enjoyed the odd overheard banter , like a couple of guards discussing how , when you think about it , " smuggler " is a really weird word . And while history dictates that the scurvy dogs with whom Edward runs are mostly men , women do n't get entirely overlooked -- legendary ladies of the sea Anne Bonney and Mary Read break up the sausage-fest from time to time , always in welcome ways . <p> Things do start to fall apart toward the end , when , as tends to happen in these games , I found myself speaking with , chasing after and assassinating a series of enemies and allies whose names , allegiances and plot-importance I could n't keep straight . Edward 's character arc moseys about for the game 's first couple dozen hours , then sprints for the finish line . His d ? nouement felt substantially rushed , though the finale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on characters I 'd rarely cared about in the moment . <p> On the other side of time lies Black Flag 's present-day story , another familiar conceit in the Creed franchise . The games are set up as two-pronged affairs , with a character in the present using a souped-up VR machine to travel into the ancestral DNA of the descendants of the game 's historical main characters . <p> Thanks to the events at the end of Assassin 's Creed III , Black Flag necessarily moves players from the point-of-view of the series ' previous present-day protagonist Desmond Miles to a silent first-person-perspective researcher working at a game development studio . ( " Write what you know , " as they say . ) <p> Ah , but it 's not just any video game studio ... it 's an evil video game studio run by Abstergo , the corporate face of the villainous modern-day Templars . This obvious bit of meta humour -- Abstergo Entertainment is located in Montreal , just like Black Flag 's primary developer Ubisoft Montreal -- is sometimes cute , but too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched me a game trailer much like the one Ubisoft actually premiered just before E3 this year . I spend too much time thinking about game development as it is , Ubisoft . I just want to pretend I 'm a pirate for a while . <p> The lore-drops and revelations in the present-day will likely disappoint those who had been hoping to see some larger reveals in the wake of the near-apocalyptic culmination of Assassin 's Creed III . A couple of familiar faces turn up , but most of your time will be spent wandering around a game-development studio , breaking into your co-workers ' computers via hacking minigames that range from fun to frustrating to Frogger . <p> I 've always had a fondness for Assassin 's Creed 's convoluted present-day stuff , though I do acknowledge , as John Teti put it in his review of Assassin 's Creed III , that " the series ' techno-spiritual premise is just the flavorless saltine on which the peanut butter of old-timey assassination rests . " By and large , the present-day stuff feels more toned-down and optional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right direction . <p> While past games tasked Desmond with complicated platforming challenges and even the odd bit of combat , Black Flag simply has you checking out your co-workers ' desks and uncovering collectables if you so desire . As each of the few obligatory 10-minute exposition-breaks draws to an end , your kindly lady Abstergo handler usually hustles you back to your machine for more swashbuckling . Would you kindly climb back into the VR machine and resume your excellent pirate adventure ? Why , I 'd be happy to ! <p> I found myself excited to return to the Caribbean because , well , the game is a great deal of fun to play . Black Flag is the most mechanically assured , sturdily designed game in the series . Everything works in concert much more harmoniously than it has in past games , particularly the **33;370;TOOLONG Assassin 's Creed III . Inventory management , aiming , sneaking and sword-fighting all feel more of a piece than they yet have . And two of the series ' primary gameplay tentpoles -- rooftop parkour and stealth -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , largely because of more considered , well-executed level design . <h> Black Flag is the most mechanically assured , sturdily designed game in the series . <p> There are three major cities in Black Flag , each one considerably smaller than any of the previous games ' , but each has been well-designed for rooftop acrobatics . Many of the same people who designed Black Flag worked on the fourth game in the series , Revelations , whose sprawling setting of Constantinople was easily the series ' most aesthetically pleasing , well-designed city . Black Flag 's cities Havana , Kingston and to a lesser extent Nassau are all essentially skate-parks designed for leaping , scaling , swinging and climbing . At any moment , a number of easy-to-read " paths " extend in multiple directions , and traversing from one side of a city to another is often a great deal of fun both to do and to watch . <p> Black Flag carries over AC III protagonist Connor 's expanded , refined move-set -- Edward will deftly hop from rooftop to treetop and back , spurred onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height unless you specifically tell him to . " Creed games have never controlled much better than a mostly-trained dog , " observed my boss Stephen last year , and that holds true in Black Flag . Edward will still run up the wall when you wanted him to run through a door . It 'll happen often , and it remains annoying . That said , Edward is the most well-behaved dog the series has yet offered , largely because III 's improved controls are finally given levels designed to take advantage of them . <p> The strong level design is even more noticeable ( and welcome ) during stealth missions , of which there are dozens . Black Flag 's sneaking is head and shoulders above the previous games in the series . Granted , that 's not a particularly high bar to clear , given the often lousy stealth in past Creed games . But Black Flag often feels like seven-tenths of a bona fide stealth game , which I mean as a compliment . I spent many hours merrily striking from the shadows , tagging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any alarms . I found repeated , often thrilling success while taking on the game 's stiffest stealth challenges , something I ca n't claim for any previous Creed game . <p> Watch a demonstration of the improved stealth here : <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Despite those improvements , Black Flag leans on the series ' bad mission-design habits with a frustrating frequency . There are not , thankfully , any chase sequences as terrible as last year 's Razzie-worthy pursuit of Charles Lee . But there are still far too many follow/eavesdrop missions , better known as the barrel-bottom of Assassin 's Creed mission-types . <p> " Follow these guys , " the game tells me , for the fourth time in an hour . And so I follow the guys , keeping out of sight , until they arrive at a set point . " Eavesdrop on the conversation , " the game then tells me , projecting around them a glowing radius within which I must stay . The guys begin walking again . How many times have I performed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself as I struggle to keep up . How many times have I failed , only to repeat the process , listening to the same conversation over and over again ? How many more of these mini-Hells must I endure before Ubisoft finally drops this tired , terrible , maddening task from their games ? <p> And yet mere minutes later I 'm at the helm of Edward 's ship the Jackdaw , dolphins leaping off of the bow , my hand on the wheel and my eyes on the horizon . Whatever purchase it may find and lose on land , Black Flag is at its best on the open water . Edward bellows orders to his crew , egging them onward through seas both stormy and calm . The game 's distinctive nautical beauty can be supremely evocative : as you peer through your spyglass into the distance , a flash of lightning illuminates the sails of a deadly Man of War , looming on the horizon . It 's coming for you . <p> Special recognition to series art director Raphael Lacoste and his team , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best pirate fiction . Black Flag looks less like a recreation of the 18th century West Indies and more like a dreamy , fantasy version of them . I 've long thought of Lucasarts ' classic 90s adventure game The Secret of Monkey Island as the most beautiful pirate game I 've ever played -- the stars up above and the sand below , orange windows shining against the deep blue night , palm trees shifting in the breeze : <p> It 's a marvellous-looking game , on both current-generation systems ( I reviewed the PS3 version ) and on next-gen consoles . I spent an afternoon at Ubisoft HQ playing the PS4 version , and will have more thoughts about that version on Kotaku very soon . Briefly : This video is n't misleading , and while it 's the same game either way , it does look awfully nice on PS4 , as it likely will on Xbox One and on PC , my platform of choice for past Creed games . <p> Whenever Edward walks to the wheel of the Jackdaw , his crew lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . I 'm happy to be back too , me hearties ! The jargon he and his crew toss around -- " Loose the tops and royals ! " " Trim the yards off the wind ! " -- is drawn from a seemingly endless reserve of recorded dialogue , and has rarely failed to put a smile on my face . On sunny days , as the Jackdaw rides a calm breeze , a sailor may lead the crew in any of a number of period-appropriate sea shanties . These songs may be my favourite of Black Flag 's many small touches . <p> Ship-to-ship combat is just as enjoyable as nautical exploration , if not more so . The cannon-aiming systems introduced in Assassin 's Creed III have all been significantly refined and smoothed out here -- when it comes time to take on an enemy ship , the Jackdaw converts into a multi-pronged death-machine somewhat like an aquatic B-17 Flying Fortress ; the Memphis Belle of the seven seas . Bryan Tyler 's rousing musical score -- a mandolin/fiddle pastiche of Hans Zimmer 's Pirates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds and cannonballs start to fly . <p> After you weaken an enemy ship , you 'll be given the opportunity to board . With the press of a button , the Jackdaw will lock in with the enemy . Your crew will throw grappling hooks to pull the two vessels together , creating a free-floating jungle-gym of sails , ropes and decks onto which spills a fracas of swashbuckling soldiers and pirates . <p> Ship-boardings are rarely less than terrific ; they 're a remarkable feat of programming and a killer bit of video-game theatre . After locking in with the enemy ship , Edward can launch himself up into the Jackdaw 's highest riggings , leaping across to the other vessel before diving from their crow 's nest onto their captain . Or , he can swing Tarzan-style on a rope , landing on the main deck with his pistols and swords at the ready .

In fact , it offers far more to do than is necessary . Among the generous offerings is a fleshed-out multiplayer suite , which I had a chance to try out for an hour and a half at Ubisoft 's San Francisco headquarters . I enjoyed my time with it -- multiplayer matches generally play out like a deadly game of hide-and-seek , with some enjoyable co-op options added for the new game . That said , I do n't feel I 've had enough time with multiplayer to factor it heavily into this review . If and when I 'm able to spend more time with the multiplayer post-release , I 'll share more substantive thoughts . For now : It 's fun , but it 's not the main event . <p> Over the past several years , Creed games ' singleplayer campaigns have swollen to Tetsuo Shima-like proportions , often becoming incoherent , lumbering collections of sidequests , crafting systems , minigames , social and mobile game tie-ins and unlockable extras . Thanks to a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a game I would never call " focused " -- is still a more focused game than recent entries in the series . <p> The changes and deletions are almost entirely for the better , and there 's a newfound sense of pointfulness to a lot of the crafting and collectables that remain . You 'll hunt animals not only out of a desire to collect pelts , but because their bones and hides will allow Edward to craft better holsters and armour , increasing his offensive and defensive capabilities . Sea shanties replace almanac pages as the floating things you chase across rooftops , but they 're worth running down simply because the shanties themselves are so much fun to listen to . <p> Still , so much fat and gristle remains that the dedicated completionist will likely feel as overwhelmed by Black Flag as any previous game in the series .

" these pop-ups announce , littering the screen with text , social readouts , reports , control mappings , contextual prompts , map icons , and all manner of other blinking bits and bobs . You can , thankfully , toggle the UI elements off , but the default setting often feels like the way the game was meant to be played . <p> Many a story mission ends with a quiet moment or dramatic revelation , only to have that moment cut agonizingly short by a charmless results screen . Edward 's friend has died and he 's about to set out on a quest for revenge , but just so you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that last mission , and we really wish you had . And oh , while you 're here , would you like to rate this mission on a scale of one to five ? <p> Every time I untangle myself from Black Flag 's disconcertingly absorbing scaffold of rewards and challenges , I ca n't help but question my motivations .

Why does the armour upgrade require shark bones ? Did n't I just make something similar with deer hide ? <p> What am I doing here , exactly ? Do I even care about Edward Kenway ? Am I happily living the virtual life of an 18th century pirate , or am I trapped in a VR machine , running in place , endlessly chasing a digital horizon that never gets any closer ? <p> As I explored present-day Abstergo Entertainment , I came across an email chain that had been circulating among the studio 's higher-ups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , a tantalising list that included thirteenth century Egypt , the French Revolution and even 1967 's Summer of Love . <p> Here were a half-dozen members of the fictional studio 's creative elite , openly musing about the new settings and characters they could focus on next . What sells , they asked . What do people want to play ? Do they want to be soldiers , fighting alongside Joan of Arc ? Or spies , assisting the uprising at the heart of the French Revolution ? <p> As I read those fictional emails , I detected shadows of Ubisoft 's real-life struggle with this series . Is it time to simply dedicate these games to pure historical adventure-tourism ? Must they perpetuate an ever-more-convoluted tale of techno-adventure and epoch-spanning global conspiracy ? Must each game 's fiction be connected to the one before it , or would players just as happily sign up for a different self-contained adventure each year -- this year Edward the pirate , next year a samurai , the year after that a 1950s detective ? If the Assassin/Templar stuff were removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? <p> Black Flag often feels like two games : One , a pirate game in which you can ram your ship into an enemy brig before leaping onto their decks . The other , a bog-standard Assassin 's Creed game , in which you follow guys on the street , decipher a novel 's worth of lore and backstory , and leap off of buildings into piles of hay . The first game feels exciting , fresh and at times sensationally fun . The second game feels increasingly tired . <p> Like many of the characters who populate its world , Black Flag seems keen to slough off the vestiges of its ancestry and fly free . It is a significant improvement for the Assassin 's Creed series , a gorgeous piece of digital entertainment that makes good on its outsized ambition with remarkable regularity .

Rebecca Healy , Rosalie Kunoth-Monks , the ABC and a defamation action <p> On the afternoon of the 26th of January 2012 Rebecca Healy and Rosalie Kunoth-Monks were both on the lawns near to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy across from Old Parliament House in Canberra and far from Tennant Creek . What happened next would see them on opposite sides in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory . <p> This is a tale of two strong women of this country . They are at once very different but also very similar in many ways . They have both spent large parts of their lives fighting for that which they believe in . <p> Tennant Creek is a small town one thousand kilometres south of Darwin and held fast by a small mountain range to the north , the vast red sand country of the Tanami Desert to the west and the Mitchell Grass plains of the Barkly Tablelands to the east . To the south Alice Springs is 500 long kilometres away . <p> Tennant is in a slow decline from its long-past glory days as a gold mining town . Nowadays ' the Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether ' falling from the fingers ' of the locals or from the wallets of those that provide services to them . <p> Rebecca Healy is a young woman born in Queensland but grown up in the small town of Elliott , two and a half hours fast drive north of Tennant Creek . <p> After her parents separated she was shuffled between her mother in Tennant and her father in Elliott . At the age of 12 she ran away from home and quit school , drifting between a life on the streets or with friends until she was placed in welfare accommodation in her teens . There she prospered , taking on positions of responsibility , studying courses in business and government and training towards public service employment . By the age of 19 she had bought her own house in Tennant Creek . She went on to serve with a number of community organisations and government advisory boards . <p> 2011 was a big year for Rebecca Healy . She was awarded the Barnardos Mother of the Year Award for the NT , later that year taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a member of the conservative Country Liberal Party for a number of years and in late 2011 she was nominated as the Country Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Barkly in the Northern Territory parliament . <p> In 2011 Rebecca Healy was nominated for the Young Australian of the Year Award and on 25 January 2012 she travelled to Canberra to attend the national ceremony as the Northern Territory finalist for that award . <p> Rosalie Kunoth-Monks has , like Rebecca Healy in many ways , also lived a life dedicated largely to service to and care for others . A member of the Arrernte language group , she was born in 1937 at Urapuntja Creek in the Northern Territory and was educated at St Mary 's school in Alice Springs . <p> At 16 she was cast as the lead in Charles Chauvel 's classic Australian film Jedda but soon after joined an order of Anglican nuns in Melbourne where she remained for 10 years . <p> After leaving the order she married her husband and , like Rebecca Healy , ran a foster home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late seventies she joined the Country Liberal Party and ran as an unsuccessful candidate for election of several occasions . After a falling out with the CLP over a dam proposal she and her husband moved back to her country to the north-east of Alice Springs in the early 1990s . <p> In 2007 Rosalie Kunoth-Monks was elected President of the recently formed Barkly Shire Council , which , as well as covering a large area of central Australia , incorporated the town of Tennant Creek in its jurisdiction . In January 2012 Rosalie Kunoth-Monks -- a vocal opponent of the Howard government 's NT Intervention -- travelled to Canberra at the invitation of Amnesty International to discuss issues related to the continuing and endemic difficulties facing her people in the Barkly Region . <p> That sets the scene . <p> On the afternoon of the 26th of January Rebecca Healy and Rosalie Kunoth-Monks were both on the lawns near to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy across from Old Parliament House in Canberra and far from Tennant Creek . <p> What happened next would see them on opposite sides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the decsion of Justice Dean Mildren of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in the defamation case bought by Rosalie Kunoth-Monks against Rebecca Healy and the ABC here . <p> On that day Rosalie Kunoth-Monks had been manning the Amnesty International stall nearby and was somewhat reluctantly pressed into speaking alongside other central Australian representatives giving speeches to the crowd celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy . <p> Rebecca Healy had spent time wandering around the Parliamentary precinct and was at the tent embassy area when Rosalie Kunoth-Monks and others addressed the crowd . <p> What happened next is outside of the scope of this piece but you can read the background here and here . <p> As noted here earlier today , Rosalie Kunoth-Monks eventually issued a legal against Rebecca Healy and the ABC 's PM program for their reporting of Healy 's comments .

@@648235 <h> ABC 's Election Analyst blogs on the wonderful world of Australian Elections . <h> November 15 , 2013 <h> Explaining the Sainte-Lague Electoral System Proposed for the SA Legislative Council <p> ( UPDATE : This bill did not proceed but I have kept the post . ) <p> On Tuesday 13 November the South Australian lower house , the House of Assembly , debated and passed electoral legislation that proposes to toughen the nomination process for South Australian elections , especially for election to the Legislative Council . <p> Some of the provisions in the bill may yet be modified during passage of the Legislative Council , but the end result will be higher hurdles to nominate for next March 's Legislative Council election , and in particular , tougher rules for access to an above-the-line ticket voting square . <p> South Australia has been prompted to make changes by the problems encountered at September 's Senate election . I outlined some of the provisions of the South Australian Electoral Act that could have made the problem worse for the state election in a previous post that you can read here . <p> The new bill proposes to increase the number of nominators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Assembly and from two to 100 for the Legislative Council . The bill denies single independents their own column and moves them to an ' Ungrouped ' column as is the case with Senate ballot papers . Only grouped Independents will have a right to their own group and a group voting square , but each candidate in the group must have their own unique 100 nominators . Registered parties will have their groups listed before grouped independents . The unique South Australian provision where five words can appear after the word Independent is reduced to two words . The nomination deposit for the Council has been increased from $450 to $2,000 . The deposit increase is the change most likely to be amended in the Legislative Council . <p> The surprise in Tuesday 's debate was that Attorney-General John Rau tabled a second bill that went beyond changes to the ballot structure and instead proposed a fundamental change to the electoral system . The bill has yet to be debated . <p> This second bill proposes to elect the Legislative Council using the Sainte-Lague method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously used in Australia . Sainte-Lague is a very simple system and overcomes the biggest hurdle to implementing change ahead of the state election , that a more complex preferential solution would have required the SA Electoral Commission to modify the computer software it shares with other Australian electoral authorities . <p> However , Sainte-Lague is a conceptual departure from the traditional Australian method of electing members from multi-member electorates . Sainte-Lague is an electoral system with no quota , no preferences , and as proposed by the SA government , is a system based on votes for party rather than votes for candidates . <p> It is a very different system from the PR-STV ( Proportional Representation by Single Transferrable Vote ) system that dominates in Australia . PR-STV includes both Senate-style ticket voting as used in upper houses across the country , and Hare-Clark as used in Tasmania and the ACT . PR-STV is based on quotas , preferences and the ability of electors to vote for individual candidates . <p> Sainte-Lague is divisor based rather than quota based . To explain how the system works , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of proportional representation . <p> While PR-STV is the sole method of proportional representation used in Australia , it is little used elsewhere and tends to be treated as a special case of proportional representation in academic literature . Apart from Australia , variants of PR-STV are used in Ireland , Malta , Scottish local government , and also has some use in local government elsewhere . <p> PR-STV is a system best used to elect representatives from electorates with a small number of members and in relatively small electorates . It suffers from problems of scale , being less efficient when large numbers of members are to be elected , or in large electorates where voters are unlikely to know the candidate . <p> It works well in the small electorates used for ACT and Tasmanian elections where voters can get to know the candidates , but preference distortions can make it a strange form of proportional representation for state wide elections to the Senate or to state upper houses , as recently revealed at the Senate election . <p> The vast majority of proportional representation systems do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each party 's share of first preference vote , or votes as they are called everywhere else in the world . <p> Non-preferential forms of proportional representation fall into two categories , quota based and divisor based . The quotas based systems are older and can strike problems in fairly allocating the final seats in a contest . These problems with the use of quotas led to the development of divisor or ' highest average ' based systems . <p> Sainte-Lague is a divisor system . To explain how it works and how it differs from both PR-STV and quota based systems , I 'll explain why divisor systems were proposed as an alternative to quota systems .. <p> Most countries using PR began life with quota based systems . The total votes of all parties are divided by the quota and the integer parts of those divisions correspond to filled quotas . If a party 's votes corresponded to 2.2 quotas , then the two filled quotas are allocated seats , and 0.2 is left over as a remainder . <p> Votes rarely ever match filled quotas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common method of allocating these final seats is what 's called the " highest remainder " method . After the allocation of seats to filled quotas , the remaining seats are allocated to parties in order of descending remainders . <p> There are several formulas for calculating the quota . The best known are to divide the number of formal votes by the number of vacancies ( the Hare quota ) , by one more than the number of vacancies ( the Droop quota ) and by two more than the number of vacancies ( the Imperiali quota ) . <p> To explain how problems can occur in applying quotas to the allocation of seats in non-preferential system , let me use the following table that uses the results of the 1993 South Australian Legislative Council election . <p> 1993 South Australian Legislative Council Election <p> Calculated Quotas <p> Party <p> Votes <p> Hare <p> Droop <p> Imperiali <p> Liberal Party <p> 470,675 <p> 5.50 <p> 6.22 <p> 6.73 <p> Labor Party <p> 248,970 <p> 3.01 <p> 3.29 <p> 3.56 <p> Australian Democrats <p> 73,051 <p> 0.88 <p> 0.96 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.22 <p> 0.24 <p> 0.27 <p> Independent HEMP <p> 16,353 <p> 0.20 <p> 0.22 <p> 0.23 <p> All other parties <p> 80,956 <p> Formal Votes / Quota <p> 908,526 <p> 82,593 <p> 75,751 <p> 69,887 <p> If you used the highest remainder method and the Hare quota , the Liberal party would have won six seats , five filled quotas plus one more by highest remainder . Labor would have elected three members , while the last two seats would have been allocated under the highest remainder method to the Australian Democrats and to the Independent Education is the Key candidate . <p> Using the Droop quota and highest remainder method , Labor would have won a fourth seat instead of the Independent . The Imperiali quota with highest remainder would have allocated a seventh seat to the Liberal Party rather than a fourth seat for Labor . <p> The Droop and Imperiali quotas are lower than the Hare quota , but paradoxically , a lower quota tends to assist larger parties rather than smaller parties . The higher Hare quota allocates fewer seats with filled quotas , leavings more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes it easier for parties that fall short of a quota to fill the final seats than under the other quotas . <p> The Droop quota is used universally in Australia as part of PR-STV . PR-STV as used in the Senate resolves the partial quota problem through preferences . In the 1993 example above , strong flows of preferences from Independents delivered the final vacancy to the fourth Labor candidate . Under PR-STV , proportionality is based not on the proportion of first preference votes but on the interplay of first preferences and subsequent preferences . <p> The use of optional preferential voting with PR-STV , as in the NSW Legislative Council , tends to mimic highest remainder methods of quota based preferential voting . However , as we saw with the defeat of Pauline Hanson in the race for the final seat at the 2011 NSW election , even limited numbers of ballot papers with preferences can change the order candidates finish . <p> Under full preferential voting , PR-STV can distort away from proportional representation based only on first preference votes . This was seen most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party in Victoria and Australian Sports Party in Western Australia . <p> But if we use non-preferential methods , is there a better way to allocate seats than with the quota and highest remainder method ? <p> The alternative is a divisor-based system , the use of highest average rather than quota and highest remainder . Seats are allocated based on trying to equalise the average number of electors per elected member across all parties . The most common divisor based systems are D'Hondt and Sainte-Lague . <p> Looking again at the 1993 example above , let me compare the average number of votes per elected member by party . If the Liberal Party is allocated six seats its average votes per member would be 78,445 , as opposed to 67,239 votes if seven seats were allocated . Labor would average 82,990 per member with three seats and 62,242 with four seats . The Independent Education is the Key candidate would average 18,521 if allocated a seat by the highest remainder method , far short of the average if the extra seat had been allocated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The principle of divisor based PR systems is to allocate seats so that each elected representative will represent roughly the same number of voters . The problem with quota-highest remainder systems is that single seats are allocated to small parties even though this produces highly disproportionate representation based on average votes per elected member . <p> Divisor based systems developed as iterative or repeated processes with seats allocated one by one . At each round of the count a quotient is calculated by dividing the total votes of the party by one plus the number of seats already allocated to the party . <p> In the first round no seats have been allocated so all parties are divided by one and the first seat is allocated to the highest polling party . <p> At stage two the highest polling party gets a new quotient by the votes being divided by two , one plus the seat allocated to the party at round one . The quotients of all parties are again compared and the second seat allocated . And so on with round three , four etc until all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the D'Hondt method . While often described iteratively in legislation , it is usually calculated by generating a table of quotients and allocating seats to the largest quotients in the table . <p> The table below shows the results of the 2010 SA Legislative Council election with results set up as a table of D'Hondt quotients . I 've shown the top five polling parties as all five elected members . <p> The members elected under PR-STV in 2010 were Liberal ( 4 ) , Labor ( 4 ) , Greens ( 1 ) , Family First ( 1 ) and Dignity for Disability ( 1 ) . Dignity for Disability defeated other contestants for the final seat thanks to good preferences flows from the 30 other groups on the ballot paper . <p> The numbers in brackets in the table are the order of election for 11 members under D'Hondt . <p> D'Hondt Quotients ( and Order Elected ) based on 2010 South Australian Legislative Council Election <p> Divisors and Quotients <p> Party <p> % Vote <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 376786 <p> ( 3 ) 188393 <p> ( 5 ) 125595 <p> ( 7 ) 94196 <p> ( 5 ) 75357 <p> 62797 <p> Labor Party <p> 37.3 <p> ( 2 ) 356626 <p> ( 4 ) 178313 <p> ( 6 ) 118875 <p> ( 8 ) 89156 <p> ( 10 ) 71325 <p> 59437 <p> The Greens <p> 6.6 <p> ( 11 ) 63358 <p> 31679 <p> 21119 <p> 15839 <p> 12671 <p> 10559 <p> Family First <p> 4.4 <p> 42187 <p> 21093 <p> 14062 <p> 10546 <p> 8437 <p> 7031 <p> Dignity for Disability <p> 1.2 <p> 11271 <p> 5635 <p> 3757 <p> 2817 <p> 2254 <p> 1878 <p> The D'Hondt method would have elected 5 Liberal , 5 Labor and 1 Green MLC , Family First and Dignity for Disability missing out . The five Liberal MLCs would have been elected with an average 75,357 votes each , the five Labor MLC 71,325 and the one Green 63,358 . <p> The comparable figures based on first preferences under PR-STV at the 2010 election were four Liberal MLCs averaging 94,196 , four for Labor at 89,156 , Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The actual Droop quota used at the 2010 election was 79,723 . <p> Of course , if the 2010 election had been conducted under a divisor rather than a preferential system , many of the parties and independents that contested thanks to being able to control their preferences , might have decided not to run . The distribution of first preferences would have been different . <p> The criticism of D'Hondt is that it is unfair to smaller parties .

Under Sainte-Lague a fifth seat would have been allocated to the Liberal Party . <p> In 2010 the Liberal Party would have won a fifth seat rather than the last seat being won by Dignity for Disability on preferences . <p> The above modelling is only approximate . Under the Sainte-Lague system , fewer parties would have nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets would have been removed . <p> Instead of a multiplicity of votes for little parties , those votes that played a part in the determining the result as lower order preferences would have played a different role as first preferences . <p> The biggest objection many people will have to the proposed system is the inability to vote for candidates . Electors will be asked to vote for party tickets . It is possible to have open party lists where you can choose between the candidates of the party , with all votes for a candidate within a party playing a part in the determining the party 's total vote . <p> However , with only a short time before the 2014 state election , there is not enough time to determine a method of implementing open list Sainte-Lague . <p> The current PR-STV system used for South Australia is a nightmare to count , involving the data entry of all below the line votes and then using a computer system to undertake the complex distribution of preferences . It is changes to the data entry programs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferential voting this close to an election . <p> Compared to this , implementing party list Sainte-Lague is easy . It is a matter of counting the ballot papers by party , putting the totals into a simple spreadsheet , and then reading off the eleven largest numbers in the table . <h> Comments <p> How do they intend to chose the candidates from within the parties ? Closed or open lists ? People could still choose candidates if open lists were used ... you could still have STV ( on a party-by-party basis ) even ... <p> COMMENT : Closed list . Open list is possible but no one has a model they bother to put forward . The debate on open list PR is a bit quiet in this country because all that ever gets put up as an alternative is Robson Rotation and Hare-Clark . <p> What would happen to independent candidates in the Sainte-Lague system ? Would any stand a chance of being elected ? <p> COMMENT : Yes , if they get enough votes . The first bill put up by the government will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own voting square . Unless a candidate had a reasonable chance of being elected , they would be completely wasting their time nominating as without our current ticket voting system , their chances of fluking a victory would disappear . <p> All iterative divisor methods are simply variations on Thomas Jefferson 's original method . It is possible to debate over the exact result provided by the D'Hondt divisor sequence vs the Sainte-Lague divisor sequence , evaluating them on the basis of which one is kinder to minor parties , but the difference is minor and conceptually unimportant . <p> However , because there is no system of allocating preferences , strategic voting becomes important . There is the desire not to throw your vote away by voting for a ticket with no chance of winning -- or even avoiding /overvoting/ on a ticket which is likely to attract overvotes that are unlikely be large enough to allow the ticket to make an additional quota . <p> Spoilers therefore become a significant problem . We know that voters compensate for the spoiler problem by becoming hesitant to waste their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sainte-Lague method gives with one hand , it takes away with the other . <p> COMMENT : Minor and conceptually unimportant ? If you re-calculate past SA LC elections using D'Hondt and Sainte-Lague you 'll find every time there is a difference between the two , D'Hondt delivers the extra seat to one of the two major parties . I 've done the same exercise on the NSW Legislative Council with the same result . It may be conceptually unimportant but it does appear to be practically important . <p> The preferred Australian method would be the optional preferential voting method used in NSW but it is simply not an option for an election in March . <p> The real distortions are produced by the current ticket preferencing system used for the Senate and the SA Legislative Council . I suspect it wo n't be used for much longer . <p> " A lot of fancy mathematics has proven that Sainte-Lague is a fairer system than D'Hondt " <p> With Saint-Lague , a party can get an absolute majority of votes and not get a majority of seats . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact you only quote the first half of my sentence . The Liberal Party polled above 50% of the vote in 1993 , the only time in the last two decades a party did receive a majority of the vote , and Sainte-Lague would have delivered it seven of the 11 seats to the party . <p> Why ca n't they use OPV above the line only by March ? It 's less of a change than Sainte-Lague , and 70% of votes with be bullet 1 votes anyway , it would be relatively easy to do a hand count . <p> ( 1 ) Count all primaries . ( 2 ) Declare groups with over one quota elected candidates . ( 3 ) Calculate the remainder over quota for these groups . ( 4 ) Eliminate candidates with the smallest vote and transfer ( if this happens to one of the groups elected in 3 just keep the transferred votes in separate piles because they 'll be of lesser value ) . ( 5 ) Repeat until candidates remaining are number to be elected ( you might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates reach quota , but these piles are likely to be quite small ) . <p> The biggest task in this will be counting all the primaries . The next biggest task which will only be required if a major party gets beat for their final spot is checking the major party pile again for any preferences . Other than that , you 'll occasionally have to transfer on preferences , but most will be one votes and can be put into the expired pile . <p> Restricting optional preferential to above the line ( so 2 , 3 , 4 on the ticket receive no primaries ) will simplify the count and without full preferential could be counted by hand probably quicker than data entry . The number of non trivial transfers would be no more than a dozen and likely to be relatively small numbers of votes with OPV . <p> COMMENT : Oddly enough , writing law is a little more complex than putting a thought bubble in the comment stream of a blog . The system you describe is not used anywhere in Australia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under electoral legislation and the difficulties that late changes to legislation create for her . <p> This is a system that favours large minor parties , and does more than simply block the micro parties . In WA and NSW it would have negated the decision of electors to confine the ALP and Greens to two Senate places and award the 6th seat to a non-Coalition , non-Left minor party . <p> COMMENT : But it is in line with party support on first preferences . With only six members to elect , divisor based systems may not be the best option for half-Senate elections . Perhaps optional preferential voting with some sort of re-iterative count may be the best option , the quota being adjusted to account for exhausted preferendces . I 'm sure there will be a lot of discussion on the subject . <p> Would the current software support optional preferences below the line without modification ? I suspect it might , based on Senate voting rules that " saved " ballots with less than three sequence errors by expiring the preferences at the first error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does SA Legislative council voting have a similar ballot saving provision ? <p> Supplementary question : could optional preferential above-the-line voting be retrofitted to the data entry in time by effectively recording the ballot as if the numbers were entered ( top to bottom ) for all teh columns that had a number at the top ? <p> COMMENT : Several problems . South Australia does not have a saving provisions like the Commonwealth . South Australia also segments the exclusion of candidate votes into individual bundles , a system not used anywhere else in Australia . There are also other issues . <p> The data entry software for ballot papers is currently designed around entering a preference for every square . If you are introducing OPV , you need to change the data entry software so you are n't having to tab past every square or you will vastly increase you data entry load . <p> But before you change the software , you have to change the legislation . If you do n't know the law that is going to be produced by the Legislative Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The SA Electoral Commissioner has written a long letter where she raises serious questions related to her legal obligations related to conducting an accurate count and organising an audit of the computer software . As the Commissioner points out , that software is actually owned by the AEC on behalf of all the states , so ECSA would need to get full co-operation to have the software changed in time . <p> If we divide voting systems into Full Preferential , Partial Preferential and Non-Preferential then in SA we currently have Full Preferential in both Houses . It appears that what is being proposed is Full Preferential in the Lower House and either Partial Preferential or Non-Preferential in the Upper House . Wo n't this create mass confusion amongst the voters with greatly increased numbers of informal votes ? <p> COMMENT : More than 95% of SA voters already vote ' 1 ' on the Legislative Council ballot paper , <p> The fact that more than 95% of SA voters vote above the line on the Legislative Council ballot would seem to lead to the conclusion that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but non-preferential voting in the Legislative Council then this will not necessarily lead to an increase in informal votes in the House of Assembly . However , I wonder if the same can be said in the case where we have optional preferential voting in the Legislative Council but full preferential voting in the House of Assembly . Would n't it be simpler and more foolproof to have the same system in both the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly ? <p> COMMENT : Yes it would make more sense , but I ca n't see why changing from compulsory to optional preferential voting while retaining an LC ballot paper that looks exactly the same is going to make much difference . If above the line voting was abolished and voters told they must fill in a minimum number of squares , I can understand why confusion might arise . The best way to change the system with minimum impact is to ensure whatever the new form of LC voting , people who try to vote the way they have done for three decades will still have their vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted votes . Votes cast for parties that do not win a seat are simply set aside . Combining Instant-runoff with Sainte-Lague might solve this problem , and this system might work like this : 1 . Give voters a ranked ballot to rank parties . ( This could be optional-preferential ) 2 . Conduct a Sainte-Lague count with primary votes . 3 . If there are parties in the count that have not been allocated at least one seat , exclude the lowest polling party and distribute their preferences . Conduct a Sainte-Lague count with the adjusted vote totals . 4 . Repeat the above process until all parties in the count have been allocated at least one seat . This system would take a while to introduce , but it would eliminate the wasted-vote problem , and would be quicker to count than STV

@@648238 <p> November is a month of two tales for the Australian media industry : one of hope , the other of despair . <p> The arrival on Wednesday of the online news site The New Daily , and reports that The Monthly 's publisher Morry Schwartz is set to launch a new Saturday newspaper , are the industry 's good news stories . In a boost for democracy , the new startups add diversity to Australia 's highly concentrated ownership of news media , and provide experienced journalists with full-time jobs . <p> But first , the industry 's bad news . Last week 's annual general meetings and financial market disclosures revealed a grim advertising market for Australia 's two largest print media owners . Fairfax Media 's total group revenues fell 8.2% compared to the year before . Its larger rival , News Corp Australia , reported even sharper revenue falls of 22% for its Australian mastheads . Advertising shortfalls also struck a blow to free-to-air television . In October , Channel Ten reported a A$285 million loss . In 2012 , these three proprietors between them shed 3000 jobs . <p> The latest print circulation figures are also gloomy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sydney Morning Herald fell 15% compared to the same quarter the year before . News Corp 's Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph also fell 15% . The broadsheets from both companies fared slightly better . The Australian slipped almost 8% ; the broadsheet Saturday editions of The Age and Sydney Morning Herald dropped around 12% . On the upside , digital paywalls ' revenues increased , but not enough to offset print losses . <p> Now , the good news . Australian journalism is flourishing despite print newspapers ' decline . Not only are new start-ups appearing , they are showing that journalism does not need to be funded through a traditional market model . Non-market and mixed-market models , as well as cross-media collaborations , offer high hopes for quality journalism . <p> Look at the latest entrant , The New Daily . With significant start-up funding of A$6 million , together with online advertising , the digital news website has hired 11 skilled journalists -- many from the news desks of established newspapers -- but unlike most mainstream media sites The New Daily is not reliant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . This is not unprecedented in Australia , but it is significant . <p> Unlike the United States , there are still relatively few Australian online news sites that employ journalists to produce original journalism , which are not dependent on traditional media 's resources and revenues . <p> Crikey , New Matilda , the Australian edition of the Guardian , the Global Mail and The Conversation are among the small number of Australian digital news sites that employ journalists without a local hardcopy version to attract advertising revenue . <p> Each of these news sites provides hope for Australian journalism , offering quality reporting , and each is funded slightly differently with a mix of market and non-market mechanisms to pay its journalists . <p> While it is early days , and there should be no pretending that starting up a digital-only news site is easy , it can be done . <p> The Sydney-based Australian Guardian , which launched earlier this year -- admittedly funded in part by its British parent -- also attracts philanthropic support from Wotif founder Graeme Wood and through local advertising . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Melbourne soon . <p> In 2012 , Wood also donated A$15 million to start Australia 's first philanthropically funded news site , the Global Mail . Like the philanthropically funded US public interest website ProPublica , the Global Mail is a not-for-profit news and features website offering independent journalism . But in 2013 -- proving that the startup path can be difficult -- shed 20% of its journalists . <p> Crikey , another influential Australian online news site , relies on the traditional market model of advertising and subscription . New Matilda , which has had its share of tumult , closing and reopening due to financial woes , has managed to survive through crowd sourcing donations . <p> Since 2011 , The Conversation has operated with mixed funding from academia , industry and government and public donations . It employs professional editors and collaborates with academics to provide Australians with expert opinion , analysis and reporting . More than a million readers visit the site each month . <p> My research into who will pay for expensive journalism such as investigative reporting in an era of declining newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact thriving partly because online and print media were engaging in cross-media and institutional collaborations to produce it . We saw this when The Age 's Nick McKenzie returned to his former employer the ABC to broadcast on 7.30 his print story about corrupt custom officers at Sydney Airport . The two media organisations have collaborated on several stories since . <p> Three points are particularly innovative about the latest entrant , The New Daily : its novel source of funding ( backed by three of Australia 's largest superannuation funds which have contributed A$2 million each ) , its ready-made audience and its commercial agreement with the ABC to share audio and video news content . My research found cross-media collaborations with established media deliver larger audiences and boost story impact . <p> The three industry super funds , United Super ( CBus ) , Australian Super and Industry Super Holdings are understood to be using their administrative budget ( rather than investment portfolios ) to contract Motion Publishing to produce The New Daily . Motion Publishing 's directors include experienced media proprietors and editors : Eric Beecher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily 's managing editor , says the site will provide the latest news plus financial stories directed at improving Australians ' financial literacy . Guthrie has signed an agreement of editorial independence with the superannuation fund owners to guard against editorial interference . And , if all goes to plan , the next step for this new media entrant is investigative reporting . <p> If there is a lesson to be learned this month it is that print media 's grim future should not be conflated with the outlook for Australian journalism .

For many of us , some of the first shows we might think of when trying to imagine great teen-oriented TV form a varying but distinguished list : My So-Called Life , Freaks &amp; Geeks , iterations of Degrassi , Press Gang , The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete , Beverly Hills , 90210 , Daria , half of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and so on . <p> The uniting factor is that the only show in that list that began post-millenium -- Freaks &amp; Geeks -- was set in the 1980s . And when you cobble together the best examples made for or about the demographic -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Buffy -- you start to get a picture of what works for teens and what does n't . <p> Not that these are the only examples . Series like Gossip Girl , The O.C. , One Tree Hill , and more recently Pretty Little Liars and Glee have all had huge success with teen audiences ( as well as adults ) . Then there are the younger-skewing sitcoms , including Miley Cyrus ' star-making vehicle Hannah Montana , Miranda Cosgrove 's iCarly , and That 's So Raven , as well as the warm , funny animated series As Told by Ginger . <p> Most of these shows are either chiefly dramas -- My So-Called Life , Degrassi -- high concept or genre-inflected -- Joan of Arcadia , Buffy , Veronica Mars -- unattainable , escapist fantasies of teenhood starring actors playing characters ten years younger than them -- Gossip Girl , The O.C. -- or shows more interested in crafting a phenomenon than good television -- that 'd be Hannah Montana or various other Disney star-spawning machines . <p> So what of the teen-oriented , high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Premiering in 2011 , Awkward . feels like the true ancestor of many of these shows . While it trades in tales of the outcast , girls pining over boys , boys being confused by girls , and all the requisite clich ? s , it feels like the first series tailored for a new generation that aims chiefly for comedy and sticks the landing . <p> Plenty of the aforementioned shows trade in humour , from Kristen Bell 's smart-mouthed teen detective to Joss Whedon 's now world famous wise-cracking , but Awkward . is a 21-minute sitcom in the truest sense of the word . In the first episode , Jenna Hamilton ( Ashley Rickards ) receives a " care-frontation " letter which tells her that she could disappear and no one would notice . She has an accident that is misconstrued as a suicide attempt and shifts from invisible to an oddity to be gawped at . <p> Through all of this , Jenna has lost her virginity to her crush Matty McKibben ( Beau Mirchoff ) at summer camp but he -- a popular jock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events as a sign to change and , through her regular blogging and with help from friends Tamara ( Jillian Rose Reed ) and Ming ( Jessica Lu ) , starts to live her life to what she is told is her potential . <p> Fast-forward to its third season and things look very different . One of the series ' overarching themes is the nature of change in high school ; their friendships shift , relationships ebb and flow , parents and popularity come and go . It 's particularly commendable that the most powerful , organic relationships on the show -- those between Jenna and her mother Lacey ( the terrific Nikki DeLoach ) , and Jenna and Tamara -- are the ones most crucial to how the show operates . This may seem like fairly stock teen show stuff , but it 's less the ' what ' and more the ' how ' , the ' why ' , and the ' haha ' . <p> The series revolves inextricably around Jenna , and her blog -- think a modernised , youthful version of Carrie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puns but more pseudo-Heathers lexicality -- helps to underscore the show 's themes as well as factoring into its narrative . The series embraces technology as a core component of teenagers ' lives and treats it as real and tangible ; more than can be said for most TV shows . The only immediate analogue is the recent , much-mourned Bunheads . <p> The fact that the series airs on MTV works very much in its favour ; it means that the show need n't censor its own content to appease parental advisory boards , for a start . In Awkward . ' s universe , sex is natural and a given . One need only compare it to teen-ish network sitcom Suburgatory to see the benefits of not caring about more puritanical audiences , a series which generally prefers not to acknowledge the more overt aspects of its teenage characters ' sexuality . <p> Where dramas like My So-Called Life seemed like they were charting this territory , Awkward . simply inhabits it , infusing it with many of the same sexual anxieties as you might find on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's because it 's interested in intelligent , nuanced teenage characters . Even the series ' villain , Sadie Saxton ( played deliciously by Molly Tarlov ) , both inhabits and subverts clich ? ; a mean cheerleader bitch with the malicious catchphrase , " You 're welcome , " Sadie struggles with her body image under the pressure of wealthy , uncaring parents . <p> The cast of Awkward . <p> But the comedy is what sets Awkward . apart . Where teen shows tend to merely tap a vein of humour , Awkward . is a punchline-landing sitcom at heart . Much of the comedy comes from Jenna 's warm , superficial mother Lacey , a woman interested as much in being Jenna 's friend as she is in being her mother , and Palos Hills High School guidance counsellor Valerie ( Desi Lydic ) , a deeply dysfunctional , lonely woman whose belief in her own gift for helping people belies her hilarious lack of boundaries . But as with many great sitcoms , a finesse for drama lies at its heart . <p> By retaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the series is able to explore issues -- bullying , suicide , death , sex -- from a completely different angle to shows before it in its lineage . Where most ' 00s teen sitcoms existed in the family-oriented stables of Nickelodeon and Disney , Awkward . enervates pat stories with a witty voice and brassy honesty . It is worth remembering , too , that it may have had company in MTV 's The Hard Times of RJ Berger ( notable for its brief depiction of a closeted jock bully played by Jayson Blair ) but for its cancellation by the network in 2011 . <p> Hosannas for Awkward . ' s significant creative and commercial success must fall at the feet of the writers and particularly its creator and showrunner , Lauren Iungerich . Iungerich 's steady hand and unique voice has guided Awkward . through its share of rough patches and emerged in the second half of its third season at its utmost compelling . Sadly , after disputes with the network ( not least of which must have been their apparent refusal to not censor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iungerich will no longer act as showrunner after the third season 's end . <p> This is not good news for the show as it airs its most dramatically hebetic episodes yet . The first half of the third season was devoted to a systematic undoing of Jenna as she lapsed into the selfishness and egotism we all do as 16 year olds ; as a new , ' mature ' love interest Collin ( Nolan Gerard Funk ) entered the scene , Jenna began to question if the sweet , hangdog Matty was her be-all and end-all . Collin , a beige , smouldering type , is the kind of cipher a narrative must commit to in order to achieve an end . Jenna 's confusion over her own identity -- as a woman , as a young adult , as a writer -- become beholden to an ideal , and thus implodes the relationships most important to her . <p> It has been a brave move by Iungerich and her writers ; some critics , including myself at the time , docked the season 's first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great purpose ( she had already dated Matty 's best friend Jake , played by the adorable Brett Davern ) . However , it immediately became clear after the return premiere two weeks ago that Awkward . was playing a Heisenberg-ian long game . Jenna 's willingness to change for Collin , unconscious as it may be , perfectly captures the fluidity of teenage identity , the changing interests , the growing out of friendships . <p> Collin and Jenna 's flirtation begins in the third season . <p> Jenna convincing herself that there was necessarily more to this blank man of ' substance ' -- he likes photography and takes creative writing classes with her -- than there was to the person she had pined for , fallen in love with , and shared real life experiences with is a terrific way to develop the character , who remains compelling even if her actions are selfish and unlikeable . It 's no surprise that Jenna 's friends and family both knowingly and unknowingly take Matty 's side . It 's a human , mistake-prone side of a female character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare on TV . <p> Awkward . ' s sophisticated approach to character and playful use of teen tropes seat it on the pedestal alongside the best sitcoms currently airing . Where the pubescents of Ja'mie : Private School Girl are teenspeak-spewing paper figurines to be mashed together in forced conflict , Awkward . ' s creation and embrace a kind of neo-teen lingo feels more immersive than cursory ; Iungerich , her writers , and the talented cast and crew are interested in plunging you into a world and letting you inhabit it . It 's not a perfect show ; it often tends towards stasis ( as reflective of reality as this may be ) and the jokes do n't always land . But it 's alive and significant . <p> Even if the incoming helmers -- two male producers of such oh-that-existeds as So noTORIous , Reba and Cashmere Mafia -- sink the show from here ( which seems depressingly possible ) , Iungerich has popped into the comments on Myles McNutt 's terrific reviews at The AV Club to say that " when you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full story told " . What this means for the various relationships held in thrall by Jenna 's mishegoss remains to be seen , but it 's pleasing that it will at least end on a note of reasonable finality just in case . <p> Calling it a teen sitcom is handy for categorical reasons , but this is a show that exists well beyond such limits . Awkward . is far more than the period in its title and far more than just its basic premise -- it 's purely great television . So do n't be surprised when its name appears alongside the laundry list of shows in the first couple of paragraphs in a few years ' time . It will deserve to be there . <p> Having advertising is fine , but having an ad which intrudes into the text of stories and ca n't be removed is over the top .

Too many armchair critics dismiss Webber as a journeyman whose skill or luck - or both - desert him more often than not when he is poised to pick up a victory . <p> They ignore the fact that he has survived in the most cutthroat of elite sports , against the odds , and succeeded against the best driver of the current generation . <p> All of Webber 's nine race wins have been scored while he was the Red Bull Racing teammate of Sebastian Vettel , who this year clinched his fourth consecutive world championship . <p> Advertisement <p> Vettel , 26 , is the youngest four-time champion and is on course to eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fact that Webber , who is 11 years older than Vettel , has kept the ' ' wunderkind ' ' honest during their six years together at Red Bull , arguably pushing Vettel to greater heights , speaks volumes for the Australian 's determination . <p> That Webber has remained a consistent contender in the midst of champions including Vettel , Fernando Alonso , Lewis Hamilton , Jenson Button and Kimi Raikkonen since RBR hit its straps in ' 09 puts things in perspective .

He is a proud Aussie who understands the fickle nature of the nation 's attitude to its sports stars and the sometimes unrealistically high expectations . <p> It is likely that Webber 's local legacy will grow and his status rise closer to that of Australia 's formula one world champions , Jack Brabham and Alan Jones , once he is no longer there to kick around . <p> Compatriot Daniel Ricciardo now has big racing boots to fill and it will be he who will now feel the harsh glare of comparison with Vettel and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races in his first season - particularly if RBR retains its car advantage under the dramatically different technical rules . <p> As Webber prepares for his final formula one appearance in the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix early on Monday morning ( Melbourne time ) , where he rates in the sporting firmament is a topic of discussion . <p> He ends this stage of his career among half dozen best-performing drivers this year , outshone by only Vettel , Alonso , Hamilton , Raikkonen and Nico Rosberg . <p> Robbed of victory in the Malaysian GP by Vettel 's treachery , it has been his first winless season since ' 09 . But two pole positions again demonstrated that , on his day , Webber is one of the very fastest drivers .

He will certainly stand out in sports car racing with Porsche , which over the next few years will give him the opportunity to win the Le Mans 24 Hours , one of the world 's greatest races . <p> Such a success would be a fitting accompaniment to his two wins in F1 's crown jewel event , the Monaco Grand Prix .

@@668236 <p> OverviewWhenever an anime breaches the hundred episode mark , it is clear that the series is quite popular and studios often take advantage of this popularity by releasing a few movies for the series . This is quite popular with the shonen genre especially , with shows such as Dragon Ball Z having over ten movies and now One Piece 's tenth movie has been brought over to English speaking audiences . <p> Now , most of the time these movies are a simple side-story with no correlation on the main plot , however in the case of One Piece : Strong World , we have the English debut of a soon to be main character . Does this unique little addition to Strong World make it worth picking up for One Piece fans ? <p> StoryWhile sailing sometime after the events of the Thriller Bark arc , as demonstrated by a certain skeleton on their ship , the Straw Hat crew learns that an unknown force is causing massive destruction back in East Blue , where the majority of the crew originated from and where many of the friends they left behind still reside . <p> Putting their adventure on hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and put a stop to the city destroying force . While on their way there , a strange floating pirate ship appears above them and after Nami provides a warning about an approaching storm , the captain of the Golden Lion pirates named Shiki introduces himself to the Straw Hats and thanks them for their warning . <p> He even offers to help them on their way to East Blue as a reward for their help , but unfortunately for the crew and for Nami , Shiki has other plans in mind as he scatters the Straw Hats across numerous floating islands while kidnapping Nami in an effort to recruit her into his crew as their new navigator . As such , Luffy and the rest must reassemble while facing off against some of the strongest and oddest looking creatures on these islands and try to rescue Nami from the clutches of Shiki . <p> As far as movie storylines go , One Piece : Strong World is fairly impressive even though it does tend to re-tread old ground from the main series , what with Nami becoming an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hometown being destroyed if she does n't agree to do what the bad guy says , though it must be said that Shiki makes for a far more impressive enemy than Arlong did , as Shiki 's power of gravity manipulation and unique backstory involving his legs , or lack thereof , make him quite intriguing . <p> Perhaps it is because his minions prove to be rather useless or that the various genetically enhanced creatures that run rampant through the islands appear rather imposing at first but are mostly paper tigers , but Shiki could easily pass himself off as long running villain in One Piece . As I just mentioned Shiki 's followers are quickly forgettable and tend to be on the annoying side as both of his main aids are walking jokes that only provide a small chuckle the first time they are used but fail terribly after the fact and eventually become rather annoying . <p> With Shiki serving as a legitimate threat and having a decent plan under his belt , it helps give the Straw Hats ' fight more purpose . Thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated to side-duty with Franky and Robin barely receiving any meaningful screentime and even Brook , making his English debut , only receives a small amount of screen time compared to the likes of Chopper and Usopp . However despite that , the story features some nice build up throughout the first half of the movie with a satisfying amount of action to close things out . <p> VisualsThanks to One Piece : Strong World having a higher animation budget , most of the film features some rather impressive looking visuals . When the Straw Hats are scattered across different floating islands , each island has its own unique design and ecosystem with a variety of wild animals for the crew to face off against as they focus on coming together and defeating Shiki . <p> As for the characters themselves , a nice level of detail has been added to each character and they undergo a few costume changes throughout the movie which is a nice touch compared to the standard clothing we 've seen them in a hundred times so far . The fluidity of the fight scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animators had a lot to work with in Strong World and it benefits greatly from it . <p> AudioTo be fair , it has been quite some time since I 've heard the FUNimation dub for One Piece but all of the characters from the main season retain their roles in the cast and handle their roles nicely . Being the English debut of Brook , we have Ian Sinclair handling the role and thankfully he handles it quite nicely with all of the character 's traits making the transition into English . <p> As for the rest of the audio , the film features some impressive background music at key points of the story and also has an enjoyable ending theme . <p> ExtrasAs far as bonus features go , One Piece : Strong World features only one notable piece of extra content is included in the release . This happens to be the 20 minute long Behind the Scenes of One Piece : Introducing Brook feature . Joining this is a simplistic set of trailers for other FUNimation anime and the US trailer for the movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palencia , the voice of Chopper , and Mike McFarland who directed the dub and a number of fans as they discuss Brook and why Ian was chosen to voice the new character . <p> OverallWhile a number of the Straw Hat crew , oddly enough even Brook , are given little meaningful screentime in One Piece : Strong World , the movie is a blast . Although his minions may be disappointing , Shiki boasts a powerful array of powers and an actual plan that seems viable enough to work . This makes Luffy and the others ' fight against him all the more meaningful , especially now that Nami is in danger once again and the only way to save her is with some impressive looking fight scenes .

@@670240 of the curvy Coke bottle <p> While the curvy Coke bottle may be ubiquitous and instantly recognisable , the details of its design and inspiration remain shrouded in mystery . Coca-Cola 's fuzzy history only adds to its mystique , as Colin Bisset writes . <p> Traditionally , the shape of a wine bottle and the colour of its glass denotes the grape variety and the style of wine is inside . But you do n't need to be a connoisseur to recognise what is inside a Coke bottle . Surely no brand is so instantly recognisable . <p> The carbonated drink , made from the coca leaf from which cocaine is derived , and the cola nut , which adds a caffeine hit , was first made in 1886 as a remedial drink for all kinds of ailments including impotence and morphine addiction . It took the better part of two decades for the drink to lose its bizarre health focus and become seen for what it was , a simple soft drink , but the perception of health benefits would certainly not have damaged its rising popularity . <p> Despite the advent of cheaper aluminium cans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity has never diminished . <p> Colin Bisset <p> The curvy bottle itself was n't designed until 1915 , although who its actual designer was is often disputed . The patent states it was Alexander Samuelson but common knowledge credits Earl R Dean . Equally fuzzy is the shape itself . Was it , as some surmise , inspired by the curves of the female form ? Or was it an attempt to replicate the shape of the natural ingredients of the drink itself , either the coca leaf or the cola nut ? A story runs that no one was sure what either the leaf or the nut looked like and so the bottle 's form was taken from the shape of the cocoa pod , which has nothing at all to do with the drink . A link of nature is , of course , established , as is a certain tropical exoticism . <p> Made from thick glass that was originally tinged green , heavily ridged and with a crown cap sealing in its sugary gas , the first examples were too fat in the middle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistline was reduced to the same diameter as the base then stability was retained . The Coca-Cola script has a similarly sinuous flow , perfectly echoing the flow of liquid within . <p> The unique shape of a bottle is a simple and effective means for a company to create a strong image for its brand . Other companies have tried the same trick , especially manufacturers of liqueurs where a strangely shaped bottle has long been seen as a marketing imperative ( from Cointreau 's chunky , square bottle to Galliano 's towering , elongated shape ) . Soft drinks and mineral water companies have attempted the same , with perhaps the green Perrier bottle finding greatest success as , once again , its teardrop shape reinforces its content ( although it is said to be modelled on the shape of an Indian club , used by the English owner of the Perrier company for his morning exercises ) .

Despite the advent of cheaper aluminium cans and larger plastic bottles , the simple little Coke bottle 's popularity has never diminished . With a nod to the power of recycling , the simple glass bottle has made a welcome comeback . In Sydney 's Kings Cross , the Coca-Cola sign has been a major landmark since 1974 and is now heritage listed . In terms of perfectly integrated and accepted advertising it seems that Coke is , indeed , it . What one makes of the drink itself is quite another matter .

@@2013235 <h> Xanana Gusmao-Mauk Moruk : Timor struggles with its past and future <p> Anna Powles &amp; Jose KL Sousa Santos <p> 5 December 2013 3:48PM <p> Dr Anna Powles is a Senior Lecturer in Security Studies at Massey University . Jose KL Sousa Santos served as an advisor to the Timorese President and Government and was a security analyst with the UN Integrated Mission to Timor Leste . <p> The standoff between Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao and ex-guerilla Commander Paulino Gama ( known by his nom de guerre , Mauk Moruk ) has captured national attention and reflects a wider struggle between resistance legacies and modern government in Timor Leste . <p> Mauk Moruk , speaking at the National University of Timor Leste in October , called for Timorese intellectuals to join an anti-poverty ' revolution ' to improve the lives of Timorese and bring down the Gusmao Government . <p> This is not the first time Mauk Moruk has challenged Gusmao . In 1984 Mauk Moruk was one of four senior officers in the Falintil resistance army who led a coup against Gusmao , then Falintil Commander . The coup failed and Mauk Moruk surrendered to the Indonesians . He recently returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( KR ) , a paramilitary organisation seeking grassroots ( or maubere ) appeal . <p> KR has serious backing . Mauk Moruk 's brother is former Falintil commander and ex-parliamentarian Cornelio Gama ( known as L-7 ) , who in the 1990s established the animist clandestine group Sagrada Familia . He has also led the minor political party UNDERTIM ( the National Democratic Union of Timorese Resistance ) since its creation in 2005 . Mauk Moruk has publicly linked the Revolutionary Council and Sagrada Familia by calling for Timorese intellectuals to join with Sagrada Familia . <p> Mauk Moruk is tapping into an increasingly popular theme of discontent . It is almost a year since the UN Integrated Mission to Timor Leste closed its doors and proclaimed success , yet for the majority of Timorese , the reality of everyday life and politics lack the shine of the capital 's new plaza , cinema and sidewalks . <p> Dig beneath Dili 's fa ? ade and there are communities without adequate housing , access to electricity or clean drinking water . There are children washing in faeces-filled drains minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are increasingly victims of sexual attacks and domestic violence ; and there is a growing -- and increasingly criminalised -- youth militancy borne out of boredom , lack of opportunity and the pyscho-social impact of violence and endemic insecurity . And that 's just Dili . The international community ( and the Timorese Government ) consistently falls victim to the Dili-centric lens . To judge Timor 's progress by Dili standards is to ignore 77% of the population . <p> For the majority of Timorese , there have been few benefits from the anticipated economic dividends of independence and the petroleum fund . <p> The 2010 Timor Leste Demographic and Health Survey found that 88% of Timor 's poor rely on subsistence agriculture , and the 2009 Global Hunger Index ranked Timor Leste 70th out of 84 countries and put it in the ' alarming ' category . The urban-rural divide worsened as a consequence of the 2006 crisis which led to the internal displacement of 150,000 people , predominantly to Dili . The twin issues of urban displacement and land ownership have been compounded by uneven development , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to infrastructure , health care , education and employment . <p> How successful Mauk Moruk and his Revolutionary Council will be in gaining populist currency remains unclear . Recent photos show Revolutionary Council members marching in military uniforms around a field in the eastern district of Baucau , directly contravening the Government 's ban on non-military personnel wearing military uniforms . These provocations have caused public concern . Timorese are weary of conflict and wary of spoilers , suggesting that Mauk Moruk 's strategy is to target the exploitable and increasingly disenfranchised youth demographic . The ban on martial arts groups with a clandestine legacy and involvement in the 2006 violence has created a void that Mauk Moruk wants to fill . <p> So far , Mauk Moruk 's rhetoric has been just rhetoric . The Revolutionary Council demonstration on Independence Day in Dili on 28 November calling for the dissolution of parliament , early elections and the formation of a government of national unity never took place and Mauk Moruk has failed to attend requested dialogues with Gusmao . Mauk Moruk has also claimed he is mobilising groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maritime Arrangement on the Timor Sea case due for arbitration before the Hague , however no permit has yet been sought from the police as required under the law . <p> Gusmao , however , is not taking Mauk Moruk lightly . The Prime Minister has responded by calling on all thirteen district administrators across the country to remain vigilant and has ordered the national police to establish checkpoints throughout the country to identify Revolutionary Council members and hinder their movement . <p> The standoff between Gusmao and Mauk Moruk reflects a potentially dangerous schism between two groups : on the one hand , Gusmao , the former clandestine groups allied to him and the national police ; and on the other hand , the Gama brothers , Sagrada Familia , and the national military whose Chief , General Lere Anan , publicly stated his support and membership of Sagrada Familia during the resistance struggle . <p> The politicisation of the state 's security institutions for the purposes of contesting political and resistance legacies is remarkably familiar .

@@2013236 <h> Meet Tony Shepherd , Transfield 's doyen of debt <p> Tony Shepherd , charged with finding ways for the Commonwealth to pay down debt , knows plenty about debt , and not so much about paying it down , Glenn Dyer and Bernard Keane write . <p> " It is ... essential that the Commonwealth government live within its means and begin to pay down debt , " declare the terms of reference for the Commission of Audit announced by Treasurer Joe Hockey in October . <p> Fair enough , even if Hockey wants more debt at the moment , not less . But Hockey 's hand-picked commission chairman , Business Council head Tony Shepherd , is in a slightly difficult position on that score . <p> As we 've pointed out in the past , Shepherd was appointed deputy chair of construction company Transfield in 2001 and was its chairman from 2005 until October . He 's presided over hundreds of millions of dollars of losses on poorly designed purchases in the United States and Australia , thousands of job cuts and , like many other companies , emergency cash raisings during the GFC . <p> There he was this morning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand of Prime Minister Tony Abbott , and on the front page of The Australian 's business section , leading Abbott and others into the 30th anniversary dinner of the Business Council of Australia . <p> But buried on page 15 of the AFR was a devastating report . Transfield 's debt levels have soared 15% or more in the six months to June 30 this year to $566 million , a rise of $75 million . Nearly half that amount was due to be repaid to a syndicate of banks in December 2014 . <p> Transfield , like many other service companies , has been badly hit by the downturn in the mining sector ; companies like WorleyParsons ( much bigger than Transfield ) , UGL and Leighton have all reported lower revenues and profits as a result of the downturn . The damage from the slowdown is spreading ; small Perth contractor Forge Group was last week bailed out by ANZ , which decided risking more than $60 million was better than Forge going under . And Ausenco , another Perth contractor , is raising around $31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Forge . <p> Transfield 's balance sheet was over-geared , according to analysts . It has sacked 20 senior staff in the past couple of weeks , including its head of investor relations , and there 's speculation consultants have been tapped to investigate options to manage the company 's debt . <p> Among the consultants is the advisory arm of KordaMentha , used by ANZ Bank on Forge to look at options for that company as it failed to convince investors to take shares to raise urgently needed cash . Transfield is nowhere near Forge 's position , but the fact that it is being openly speculated about in the media tells us the situation must be tough and the mess left behind by Shepherd is pretty substantial . As chairman of Transfield , Shepherd presided over the abandonment of dividend payments to shareholders to preserve cash . <p> In the latest year Transfield posted a net profit of $65.5 million before impairments and amortisation . But after write-offs and impairments , the year to June net loss was $254.4 million , a reversal from the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to pass on payment of a final dividend . The Transfield board , led by Shepherd , agreed to what one analyst called an " ill-timed " $85 million buyback in late 2011 , designed to lift the company 's appeal to investors , which lasted a year before being ended as the cash drain became too much , wasting money that could have been used to pay down debt . <p> " Pay down debt . " Indeed . The Business Council under Shepherd is constantly urging governments to " pay down debt " . Its budget submission earlier this year is riddled with demands that the government get on with " paying down debt " . Transfield investors might be wondering why Shepherd did n't take his own advice -- and how much use his counsel will be to the government . <p> " The damage from the slowdown is spreading ; small Perth contractor Forge Group was last week bailed out by ANZ , which decided risking more than $60 million was better than Forge going under .

Paid for by increases in taxing the poorest Australians while keeping the Rory 's for the rich intact : eg superannuation . <p> That 's exactly what the ' conservative right ' has been about at heart since the days of Thatcher and Reagan . It is entirely about reverse wealth distribution , taking from the poor to give to the rich .

The way to Shangri-La is now congested with Tibetan truckies , migrant labourers and 4WDs . Journalist Michael Woodhead reports from Kangding . <p> It must be the highest traffic jam in the world . It 's gridlock on Highway 318 at over 4000 metres above sea level ( pictured above ) , just outside the Tibetan border town of Litang . In a two-kilometre tailback , trucks , buses and Landcruisers sit idling for hours on the main Sichuan-to-Tibet road as work crews upgrade the steep switchback dirt trail into a two-lane tarmac highway . The work is long overdue to cope with the huge increase in traffic to Tibet as " Shangri-La " experiences a boom in tourism and construction . <p> The road starts in Kangding , the traditional border town between the Han Chinese lowlands of Sichuan and the Tibetan plateau .

Han Chinese and Tibetans mingle on Kangding town square every evening , dancing to traditional folk music played on a huge public video screen . At the nearby Anjue Buddhist monastery , authorities tolerate a large portrait of the Dalai Lama , around which local Tibetans have placed prayer candles and wads of Renminbi . Young Tibetans are avid watchers of Chinese soaps on TV . Below the surface , however , tensions remain .

Clad in pristine North Face gear , the new Chinese middle classes are heading out into the wilderness en-masse , wielding their DSLRs and walking poles . Kham is now prime vacation territory for those seeking an escape from the overcrowded and polluted lowland provinces . These are not the coach-bound tour groups with matching baseball caps following a leader with a megaphone ; many of the new Chinese tourists drive their own cars and travel independently .

Several flights a day now disgorge visitors eager to experience the famous " three peaks " of Yading National Park .

This is why there is such a simultaneous outpouring of grief and celebration with the passing of Nelson Mandela , or Madiba . He has brought South Africa and the world together like no other . <p> Perhaps his widow Graca Machel put it best to me when she said : <p> This is his final gift to South Africa . <p> He could have just passed on and we would have mourned . But he lingered on for six months and in the process got us to think about what it means to lose Madiba , what he stood for , and most of all , how to unite across the social boundaries that separate us . <p> South Africa has been united in grief and celebration across race , class , generation , party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how to make it sustainable going forward . <p> South Africans , of course , are not the only ones that are mourning . The world has also come together at Madiba 's passing . This is because he is a global icon .

It also has to do with him having pioneered reconciliation , especially at the moment when South Africa faced its greatest threat : the assassination of Chris Hani in 1993 . <p> But it also has to do with the fact that Madiba gave up the presidency after only one term . He could have been president for life , but he chose to walk away from hard political power . In the process , he became the personification of soft power . <p> No president in the world had what Madiba had . He could have phoned any one of them at any time of the night and they would have taken his call . He could berate any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dined with kings and presidents , but walked with the common man .

Madiba stood for non-racialism . He was an advocate for democracy and political participation . And he was a fighter for economic inclusion . <p> Madiba abhorred not only poverty , but also inequality .

One must be responsive to his entire political message and legacy , not only the aspects that we find convenient . World leaders who want to honour Madiba can only do so if they respect the rule of law and do not engage in extra judicial action , either against their own citizens or foreign nationals . <p> Madiba was intractably opposed to political assassinations of opponents , to armed invasions and attempts at regime change . Honouring him means to respect his views in this regard and not to ignore or make light of it . It also requires one to stand firm against pressures to go to war , to assassinate political opponents , even when it may seem so much simpler to do this . <p> South African leaders who want to honour Madiba need to remember that he stood against corruption and for service delivery and economic inclusion .

Yes , he was a pragmatist . But he was also for economic inclusion . He did abandon nationalisation , and he was president when a conservative macroeconomic program was implemented . But he saw this as a compromise born of political necessity . <p> Madiba also bemoaned how the Growth Employment and Redistribution Strategy was implemented and he was appalled at the increase in economic inequality and at the political and social polarisation that subsequently ensued . To truly honour Madiba requires one to recognise this . <p> Thousands of South Africans will join world leaders at a public memorial for Nelson Mandela today.EPA/Dai Kurokawa <p> Honouring Madiba also requires us to make the collective sacrifices required to address this economic inequality .

Madiba was an astute political entrepreneur who understood the importance of pragmatism in a struggle for equality . He recognised that we live in a world that is , and not in a world that we wish existed . <p> Madiba recognised the importance of the realities of power and the need to engage and sometimes compromise with those who wielded power . But he believed that such compromises must ultimately enable a break through to a better world . <p> This is why it behoves us not to conduct debate in political extremes .

@@2026236 <h> Why are mentally-ill children tied up and tormented ? <p> A new report is warning Aussie kids in psychiatric care are suffering from out-dated practices of seclusion and restraint . Louise Milligan investigates why treatment in modern institutions can still be a form of torment . <h> Transcript <p> LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : Just about every parent knows the angst of having a child throw a noisy tantrum in a supermarket or on a crowded street . <p> But some families struggle daily with much more serious behavioural problems , especially when their children suffer from mental health issues like anxiety or depression . <p> How to deal with those children is a major dilemma for health workers too . In some extreme cases , children with psychiatric disorders are physically restrained and placed in seclusion - something that can be deeply traumatic . <p> A new report has highlighted the unacceptable use of those practices on disturbed children and health professionals say it must stop . <p> Louise Milligan reports . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN , REPORTER : Every day , Kerrin Hall goes for long bike rides but not all of her journeys this year have been this pleasant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt helpless . I felt like the most useless mother in the world , that I could n't even protect my child from this happening . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : The child Kerrin Hall speaks of is 10 years old . As a young boy he was diagnosed with anxiety , depression and Oppositional Defiance disorder , which causes behaviour like aggressive swearing . Earlier this year , Kerrin Hall brought her son to Melbourne 's Austin Hospital 's Child Psychiatric Unit . <p> KERRIN HALL : There were children in there that ... Their voices will forever echo in my mind . The screams . Seeing them restrained . Seeing them put in rooms : the chill-out room . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : The chill-out room is in fact a seculsion room and it looks like this . This is an adult version in the same hospital . When Kerrin 's son became highly agitated , this is where staff put him . <p> They call it the chill-out room . What would you call it ? <p> KERRIN HALL : A lock-up . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She asked for medication but none came . He tried to punch a nurse . Staff brought him to the chill-out room . <p> KERRIN HALL : They grabbed him and they threw him to the floor face-down and he wailed around - no other way to say it - like a stuffed pig . <p> ( montage : photographs of Kerrin Hall 's son ) <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : This is what he looked like . <p> KERRIN HALL : He had brusing under his right eye . He had welts on his left shoulder and slight bruising where he 'd been grabbed . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : An hour and a quarter later her son , then nine , returned quietly to his mother . <p> KERRIN HALL : Sweat was just drenching off his body . His clothes were drenched and he said , " I promise I 'll be a good boy , Mummy . Take me home . I do n't want them to do this to me anymore . I hate it here . They 've hurt me and I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a shit about me . You promised me that they 'd help me and all they 've done is ------ my head even more . I want to home and I want to die . " <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : An Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report , just released , has highlighted the harm that seclusion and restraint can cause . It 's marked them out as areas of critical importance in mental health . And while it 's shown that the numbers of people being held down against their will and put into isolation are declining , alarmingly it 's still more likely to happen to children than to adults . <p> One of those children is the son of Beau Turner , a single mother of three . Ms Turner 's son Saxon recently celebrated his eighth birthday . Despite his cuddly apearance , his Oppositional Defiance disorder and sensory processing problems make it extremely hard for him to regulate his behaviour . He 's been restrained by police countless times . <p> ( describing photograph of restrained child ) <p> BEAU TURNER , MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get tied both sides to the bed . There 's three lots of velcro . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Saxon was also admitted to the Austin Hospital this year . <p> BEAU TURNER : When we first went into the unit there was a little boy . He had a black eye and a scratch , I think , on his chest . And Saxon had said , " Oh , look at him , Mum . What happened to him ? " A nurse then replied , " That 's what happens when you 're a naughty boy . " <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Saxon became well acquainted with the chill-out room . <p> BEAU TURNER : He hated it , absolutely hated it . And as soon as he was in there he 'd be yelling and screaming and he 'd just want me . He 'd be fretting for me . And as soon as they 'd let him out he 'd run and have another meltdown , I guess , because he was in there . So clearly it did n't work . <p> LOUISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BEAU TURNER : Five nursing staff on him at the one time . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : How old was he at the time ? <p> BEAU TURNER : Seven . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Beau Turner says Saxon spent up to two hours a day in the room . <p> BEAU TURNER : If he was extra bad they would then chuck him on the floor there and then and put him in like a hand restraint , usually with his arms behind his back . And two people would sit side by side , sometimes with a towel over his head . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : How did he react to that ? <p> BEAU TURNER : Oh , he went crazy . Hated it . It was like mummifying him . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Do you ever think it 's acceptable for a young child , you know , seven years old to be slammed face-down on the ground by four nurses and have a towel placed over his head ? Is that okay ? <p> RICHARD NEWTON , PROF. , HEAD OF PSYCHIATRY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate use of physical holds where absolutely necessary : where no other things , no other interventions can be effective . They 're certainly not trained to slam people to the ground or to use towels as a restraint device over their face . And I would n't expect that to happen . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : The head of the Austin 's psychiatric department , Professor Richard Newton , showed 7.30 one of the hospital 's seclusion rooms . <p> RICHARD NEWTON : And , as you can see , it is a very plain , empty space . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Professor Newton is a strong opponent of seclusion and restraint , particularly of children . He has been campaigning to stop it . He says cases like this in his own hospital should n't happen . <p> RICHARD NEWTON : I think it can be enormously distressing . They 're much more likely to think , if they 're being held , that that 's a punishment : if they 're being restrained , that that 's a punishment for some things they 've done wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be traumatic and again for it to make the situation worse . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : The chair of the National Mental Health Commission , Professor Allan Fels , says the organisation 's had more complaints about seclusion and restraint than any other practice in psychiatry . <p> ALAN FELS , PROF. , CHAIR , NAT . MENTAL HEALTH COMM. : It is a sign of a mental health system that is not working well when so many people have seclusion and restraint . It 's kind of the last step when the whole system fails , as it so often does . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Kellie Comans can speak first-hand about what it 's like to be thrown in secollusion . <p> KELLIE COMANS , FMR CHILD PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT : There were four or five that came and then dragged me from the bedroom out the back to HDU , where I was then kind of held down . They tried to give me an injection but I was fighting for my life . <p> I did n't need to be shut down and physically restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell my story and have someone bear witness to that . <p> KERRIN HALL : I think it 's a very archaic and outdated practice . If anything , from what I 've witnessed with my son and the other children in there , I believe it causes more psychological trauma . <p> BEAU TURNER : Oh , my heart would just break , just break into a thousand pieces , you know . He 's my own flesh and blood , he 's bloody seven years old at the time . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Despite perceptions , seclusion and restraint are the only options for out-of-control kids . <p> Saxon 's been living in residential care for two months . He has n't been restrained or secluded once . <p> BEAU TURNER : They use a far better approach , more of a therapeutic ... It 's soft , it 's gentle . Look , he still does have meltdowns but nothing , nothing , absolutely nothing like the Austin . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : After hearing the accounts of these two mothers , Professor Richard Newton says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children 's ward all together . <p> RICHARD NEWTON : Yes , it upsets me terribly , but what it leads me to is , well , we just have to find a new way to address this and stop it and do better . <p> LOUISE MILLIGAN : Kerrin Hall 's finally getting help for her son . She 's trying to be optimistic but she wo n't forget what happened to him any time soon . <p> KERRIN HALL : I 'm pretty disgusted in what happened to my child . I 'm actually appalled . I just want to know what sort of message they 're sending these children .

@@2034240 <h> Horsemeat scandal was a damning indictment of the state of our food <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Tim Lang does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> European food politics began 2013 with the horsemeat scandal , and it is ending with meat and horsemeat still high on the agenda . The publication of the interim findings from the review chaired by Professor Chris Elliott of Queen 's University Belfast for the UK Government is significant . Deftly written and carefully phrased it makes damning reading . <p> The horsemeat scandal was n't about horsemeat . It was about passing off horsemeat as higher graded and priced meats . It 's about good old fashioned adulteration and fraud . It 's a 21st-century version of something commonplace in the 19th century . <p> Elliott confirms the scandal has exposed criminal classes muscling in on adulteration as a useful way to siphon money out of both the trade and consumers ' pockets . That burger might look like a burger but what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's food fraud . <h> Meat is a mucky business <p> We should not be surprised by this . Meat is a mucky business . And it long has been . Think Upton Sinclair 's 1906 novel , The Jungle , which exposed dreadful practices in the American meatpacking industry ; think UK sausages after compositional standards were abolished under the 1980s Thatcher government . <p> If meat content drops , what else is in that meat product ? Worse , what is claimed to be meat might actually be " mechanically recovered meat " , a sludge extruded from bones and sinew left-overs , about which there were scandals from the late 1980s on . Not all meat is of this ilk , of course . One nice thing in 2013 has been the rise of local specialist butchers where you can buy what you see , and the mince can be minced before your eyes . Even there , it 's a trust relationship . <p> Whichever way we look at modern developed food systems , the issue of meat looms large . The post-World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily more available to ordinary consumers is one of its great successes . Critics have begun to mount a counter-narrative from health and from environmental perspectives , let alone animal welfare . Meat , particularly processed meats , are bogged down in a persistent troublesome connection with some cancers , and other health impacts associated with fats . <h> Grain and more greenhouse gases <p> Using grain to feed animals , which is actually what has delivered cheaper meat over recent decades , is looking increasingly inefficient land-use ; more so as population rises and per capita land availability shrinks . <p> This year 's big report on meat and climate change from the UN 's Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) showed there are efficiency gains to be made in reducing such impacts if best farming practice is followed . <p> But the report echoes other findings that if more people eat more meat -- the prognosis currently still seducing policy-makers , with meat being an indicator of consumer prosperity -- any efficiency " gains " from better farming practice are wiped out by the simple arithmetic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total greenhouse gases . <p> On top of this deepening ecological public health crisis for policy-makers come the lessons from the horsemeat scandal . It exposes how the EU 's entire system of confidence building over food safety , post mad cow disease in the 1990s is shaky . The 2000 Food Safety White Paper put great store on traceability and authenticity to rebuild consumer trust in Europe 's capacity to civilise the neo-liberal market model . We consumers are supposed to be able to make wise , informed choices in the marketplace and thus drive business dynamics . The reality is that we buy largely on trust . The EU and UK state said they 'd look after that . <p> In October , even before Elliott 's interim report , the UK 's National Audit Office offered the first official account to come out of the British state about how the horsemeat scandal undermines that trust . <p> Companies , worried by reputational damage , had of course conducted many private reviews . Alas , they do n't see the light of day . My understanding is many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal reviews . Supermarket giant Tesco , for one , started making serious commitments to shorten its trade routes and to source more from the UK . Whether it can do so , having led the way to precisely the kind of " efficient " systems -- which are now in the spotlight -- remains to be seen . The commitment is interesting . <h> A sorry tale of public failure <p> And what does Elliott add to this already complex policy-making challenge ? He tells a sorry tale of how public functions that protect our food have been cut and so fail us . Public analysts , a backbone since the mid-19th century , have declined in number . Local authority food inspectors are being cut . Laboratories do n't have the most up-to-date equipment or methods . Responsibilities are being fragmented across the state at national level . The Food Standards Agency - our end of the EU 's confidence building bargain - is being whittled away , with some functions just gone , and others handed over to other departments , before again being cut . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the name of the Coalition government 's obsession about cutting the state to pay for the private sector banking 's crisis . Above all , this is a tale of crime and fraud filling a gap created by political choices . <p> Elliott accepted that the discovery of horsemeat in burgers knocked confidence . Sales of cheap burgers might have risen , but the memories and scepticism remain . He talks of a culture of " casual dishonesty " in the meat industries , which is unacceptable . <p> Echoing the National Audit Office , he finds an appalling mess in " intelligence gathering " . This phrase speaks volumes about the parallel systems of governances long noted by academics : some state , some private standards . Industry gathers lots of information . State functionaries used to know a lot but have been cut and cut . Surely , argues Elliott , this means that whatever intelligence is gathered needs to be shared . Yet it is n't . Indeed , part of the scandal I chose to highlight the moment the scandal emerged is how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the price of their products and track supplies via satellites , but they did n't know exactly what was in the meat products . This is what shook industry . They thought they knew . <h> One lone journalist <p> As this sorry saga has unfolded throughout 2013 , one lone journalist has dug and dug at this . We must pay tribute to the investigative work by Felicity Lawrence of The Guardian . She -- almost alone -- of British journalists went out into the abattoirs , tracked the labyrinthine supply routes , interviewed and door-stepped the horsemeat trader , and alleged the involvement of organised crime . <p> How frustrated she must have felt as the UK and European state machinery did precisely nothing . But now , like a white knight on a charger , Elliott enters confirming the need for a new push on organised crime . He proposes setting up a Food Crime Unit hosted within the Food Standards Agency . I welcome that . It could breathe new life not just into the FSA and but into the Conservative-led coalition . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandals seriously did damage 20 years ago . We remember the then agriculture minister , John Gummer , feeding his daughter Cordelia a burger in the BSE crisis in 1990 to prove all was safe . She refused it , but he ate it instead . If anyone is in the spotlight after the Elliott report , it 's the secretary of state at Defra , Owen Patterson . He 's an active anti-statist and climate-change denier . Will he now accept Elliott 's correct supposition that only the state can sort out issues like food crime ? <h> What do we expect for 30p ? <p> The final thought must go to something Elliott raises about consumers . What on earth do we really expect to be in a burger it it 's being sold to us for ? 0.30 ? On page 22 of the Elliott Review is the answer . A real beef burger should cost around 85p , he says . To get it for 30p , offal , mechanically separated meat , and other ingredients are likely to be in there . We have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far are timely . We get what we pay for . Public health , environmental impacts , land use , climate change , water use , and more , all improve if we cut our meat consumption from today 's high levels . But eating better , grass-fed meat costs more . Equally , if we want trustworthy food and to tackle crime , we need tougher food police . Whether we get and will pay for these will be a defining test for the 21st century relationship between consumers , the state and food commerce .

There are many wonderful things about summer , however I ca n't really think of any of them because I burn at the drop of a sunhat and find the beach boring . But one of the inarguable downsides of the season is the sweaty stickiness that it can bring about . Even after a show five minutes later you are again glistening ( never forget , ladies do n't sweat , they glisten ... ) <p> Like many women my first introduction to the deodorant ( as opposed to an anti-perspirant ) was in the locker rooms in high school where offensively scented body sprays were wielded with abandon . This was enough to put me off them for over a decade , and it was n't until recently I started looking into more natural options after realising my sedentary office life probably does n't require an industrial strength anti-perspirant .

It gives us great pleasure to present the second of four courses in Emilie 's Guide To Chowing Down On The Best Asian Eats : Part Two - Big Experiences On A Budget In Hong Kong . <p> We travel for experience . The opportunity to add stories to our dinner party repertoires , to see , taste and live moments that are otherwise unavailable in the place we call home . In general , these experiences come at a cost , forcing us to pick and choose between all the fabulous places where we 'd planned to ' check in ' . With budget in mind , this month I offer you a few great ways to get the most bang for your buck with quintessential Hong Kong experiences and access to bragging rights that wo n't cost you the world . <p> THE MICHELIN EXPERIENCE : DIM SUM A visit to Hong Kong is incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Cantonese cuisine is historically a lunch time affair , wherein from a dizzying selection of dishes you select numerous smaller dishes to devour . So legendary is Dim Sum 's greatness on the global gastronomic scale that two select venues in Hong Kong have received the much lauded Michelin stamp of approval . In other cities , the opportunity to say you ate Michelin endorsed grub requires hundreds of dollars and plenty of forethought to book in advance . Not so in HK , where each restaurant listed here will set you back around $25 AUD per person - an absolute steal considering you 'll need to roll right on out of there . Think BBQ pork buns , plump glistening shumais ' dumplings ' , deep fried taro and almond dumplings with mayonnaise and , if you 're feeling adventurous , steamed chicken feet with black bean sauce . <p> The venues are characteristically local , full of jovial ambience and Tsingtao beer from the can . You 'll need to wait 15 -- 50 minutes for a table , but that 's all part of the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and explore the surrounding neighborhood of Sham Shui Po , one of Kowloon 's oldest villages . I half live here as it 's the wholesale fabric district with button loads of haberdashery treasures to uncover .

All that streamlined interior design , Zen lighting , raw fish and a dainty saki cocktail brings out the smug Carrie Bradshaw in all of us . However , $20 for a piece of sashimi means that this cosmopolitan experience is generally left to those of more lavish means or much smaller appetites . <p> If you find this so depressing , never fear ; I have a lovely little life-hack up my sleeve .

So as soon as you book your flight , book your brunch . Outside of rainy season ( April-September ) ask for a table on the terrace . Zuma is conveniently situated in the decadent Landmark building , HK 's ground zero of designer fashion . I suggest a post-brunch tumble next door to Harvey Nichols .

Do n't be daunted by the distance , Sai Kung is located in the eastern new territories and easily reached by MTR and mini bus - just take the MTR from Central to Choi Hung station , then take exit C2 and minibus 1A to the very last stop . <p> The village has many seafood options , including the ability to shop direct from docked fisherman and take your catch to nearby restaurants that 'll charge a simple ' cooking ' fee .

Add a side of rice and seasonal steamed Asian greens with oyster sauce and you 're set . Soak up the good vibes , throw back some tinnies and breathe in the fresh air .

@@2053235 <p> Airport security is " all bullshit , " according to the former head of security at an Israel airport , Rafi Sela . <p> " The TSA could n't protect you from a 6-year-old with a water balloon , " he writes on Cracked.com . <p> Sela has seven major issues with the TSA . First , the TSA " essentially makes its own rules , " according to Sela . It 's both a regulatory agency and a security agency . Not even the CIA is allowed to be both . That means , the TSA is supposed to regulate itself . <p> Politics can significantly effect the TSA too . For example , Sela claims one of the reasons there used to be full-body scanners ( and thus naked photos of passengers on the Internet ) was because the former secretary of Homeland Security , Michael Chertoff , was an investor in a full-body scanner company called Rapiscan . <p> The TSA spends too much time on luggage and not enough time looking at the people behind the luggage , Sela says . Also , he notes that it 's incredibly easy to hide something in your suitcase . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an airport . Unless you 're flying internationally , there 's no security when you land and certainly none at baggage claims , where a lot of people gather . <p> Lastly , a lot of airports are n't exactly bomb-proof .

Instead of taking a bomb threat into a blast-proof room like they do at Sela 's airport in Israel , a bomb threat in the states could shut down a terminal for days because it has no good way of getting rid of or testing the bomb on premise . 
@@2053238 <h> Legends Football League from the perspective of a 22-year-old male <p> I am the demographic . The 22-year-old college student with a penchant for beer and most of whose thinking is admittedly done below the waist rather than above the shoulders . <p> Yet no matter how many boxes I tick , I can not for the life of me come to grips with the Legends Football League ( formerly Lingerie ) , and this was no more evident than after my first experience attending a game this weekend . <p> For perspective 's sake , I currently play football at a college in the great state of Oklahoma , adore the sport of ' gridiron ' and as far as I 'm aware am indeed heterosexual . <p> Ignorance to the sport is not the issue that affects my overall experience , I say this because American football 's stop-start nature and complicated rulebook is a great hurdle to its future growth in Australia . <p> That being said , I walked away with quite a few gripes and thoughts of Australia 's newest ' sport ' . <p> The first being that of its constant description as a ' sport ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sport is athletic competition and contains rules and regulations , respect for the game and sportsmanship . <p> From what I witnessed in Australian LFL , it carries merely one of these traits -- the athletic prowess of the competitors . <p> Full disclaimer , knowing a number of the players on the WA team , I greatly respect the amount of hours they put into the sport and the toll it takes on their body . <p> They work hard and are legitimate athletes . <p> Not only that , but in so many aspects of life I am ' pro-choice ' . I do n't believe it is our job to attempt to censor the LFL and that every woman involved has made the conscious decision to make this commitment and we should respect that , no matter how much we may disagree with the product itself . <p> I am not saying that LFL should n't be classified a sport based upon what the participants do on the field , but rather what is common practice for everything surrounding the game itself . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taunting that would bring penalties in any other football league . <p> If I were to take count , and I 'm being generous here , I would have guessed roughly 417 flags for excessive celebration , unnecessary roughness or roughing the passer should have been called . <p> Not quite up to par for any league that would consider itself a sport . <p> Respect for the game As a whole , I am forgiving for not knowing some of the rules to American football , as even the most diehard fan can attest to not knowing of some of its greater intricacies . <p> Hell , even some potential Hall of Fame NFL quarterbacks were n't aware that a game could finish in a tie -- *cough Donovan McNabb cough* . <p> Seeing players line-up on the wrong side of the field for a play and a good old fashion schoolyard pile on after an incomplete pass for no reason are more than acceptable in the heat of the moment . <p> What is not however , are the pre-game video packages which consist of calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insults that would make even the most immature third grade bully shake his head in disapproval . <p> All of which were displayed on the same video screen just seconds before the Nelson Mandela ' in memoriam ' graphic . <p> I 'm hoping this was a biting social commentary about how petty our squabbles can be in the greater context of the world ... but that might just be wishful thinking . <p> Sportsmanship Quite comfortably the least prevalent in the game I witnessed . <p> Apart from the obligatory post-game handshake line , there was very little to any sportsmanship displayed . <p> Now I 've never been one to subscribe to the ' picking up the opponent ' way of thinking but what was on display was so far from that it was deplorable , confusing and in many ways so laughable one could think it was just a very well written piece of satire . <p> In the one game , we saw egos and smack talking from those hardly established enough in any regard to warrant it and then most appallingly the open taunting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe that LFL is more akin to that of professional wrestling than that of its pro-counterpart the NFL . <p> The similarities are strikingly evident . <p> There are ' Heels ' and ' Faces ' ( good and bad for the non-wrestling fans among us ) . <p> The WA team were all smiles and sunshine , whereas that team not from around these parts , not dissimilar to the Iron Shiek versus Hulk Hogan in the early 90 's , came straight out the gate with a bad attitude and free middle fingers for all in attendance . <p> There are gimmicks . The NSW Surge were introduced with their fiery red-haired running back storming the field with a pre-game dance that was part Ray Lewis , part Brock Lesnar and part Blanka from the Street Fighter franchise . <p> The referees let much extracurricular play go unchecked , not dissimilar to how refs never saw that dastardly Mr Fuji help Yokozuna with his powder attack all those years . <p> And the LFL is run by an enigmatic , charisma-charged owner not dissimilar to Vince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or bad at the time ) . <p> The easy response I will more than likely receive is that of " if you saw the bruises the next day you would n't say that " . <p> To that I say , yes , yes I would . <p> Professional wrestlers suffer concussion after concussion , broken bones , muscles torn off the bone and risk their life every show -- it still is not a sport and they would be the first to tell you so . <p> The notion of half naked women tackling each other , taunting and fighting after every play all of a sudden becomes much more forgivable if it is labeled as entertainment rather than sport . <p> In short , I 'm all for freedom of choice . I 'm all for sport . I 'm all for entertainment . <p> However , I am not for the LFL pulling the proverbial wool over the eyes of the Australian public in an attempt to call this spectacle a ' sport ' . <p> It 's not sport . <p> It 's entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone Cold said so . <p> Roarers , we 're on the hunt for talented and knowledgeable bloggers to provide live coverage of basketball on The Roar . If you think you have what it takes and would like to get involved , do n't hesitate to get in contact . <h> Video brought to you by The Roar <h> The Crowd Says ( 8 ) Page 1 of Comments <p> Watched some of it and was very impressed how tough and skillful those women are . <p> I find it ironic that women moan about how this " degrades " them because of the skimpy outfits which are less skimpy than a lot of other athletic pursuits . Look at athletics or swimming . Also if anyone has been to a football match like AFL with a bunch of women knows how they just come to check out the blokes in tight clothes . If you hear them whinge just ignore them , they are a pack of hypocrites ! <p> Jorji , not wanting to get into the is it or is n't it as it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference when the attire is chosen for competitive purposes rather than deliberately accentuate sexuality . Also I 'm not sure if you 've ever seen athletics or swimming but they tend not to have cleavage on display . ( most swimming is in a one piece for starters and deliberately tries to smooth out the chest ) . <p> In terms of them all being hypocrites that is a pretty poor argument you are assuming that every woman that complains about the LFL is an AFL fan that only cares about tight shorts . There are wet tissues more robust than that thought process . <p> There are " Heels " and " Faces " in the NFL ( actually there are some real life criminals in the NFL ) . Tom Brady -- Baby Face . Oakland Raiders -- Heels . Both are/were marketed as such . <p> You make good point about the excessive taunting and post play fights . They cracked down on some of that in the last season in the USA and they should do the same in Australia . But watch a Cowboys/Redskins game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those games too . Fights pre-game and in game are common . But it 's an easy fix if the officials start throwing flags . <p> I think the commentary on respect for the game is completely wrong . I understand respect for the game to involve the conduct and character of an athlete . So showing respect for the game would involve preparation ( Yes I 'm takin ' about PRACTICE Allen Iverson ) , showing up in game shape , on time and prepared to play . It also involves giving your best effort and as some say , " giving your all " when you play ( no walking off the field early Dez Bryant ) . These are the same qualities that we expect out of professionals outside of sport . I think these ladies/athletes show a lot of respect for the game . It seems to me that many of the articles I read about the LFL are flawed because they do n't make apples to apples comparisons . <p> I also went to watch the WA Angels V NSW Surge ( or Sewage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article is spot on ... <p> The entire production was embarrassing .... the players showed terrific endeavour and have no doubt been working hard ... however I have heard the players do nt get paid any money ( not a penny ! ) ; also , they have to pay their own health insurance cover , and even have to pay the legal costs of signing a very one-sided playing contract . They train 6 days every week and are also required to pander to ' devoted male fans ' on social media , which i believe is very demeaning . I do n't know of any other amateur sportsperson that is required to do that , but it is demanded of the girls by the promoter . <p> I believe these sportswomen are being taken advantage of , with promises of glory &amp; media coverage by the promoter . It would be worth some investigative journalist having a close look at the bone fides of the promoter and his support team ...... @ @ @
