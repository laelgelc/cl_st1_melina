Photo : Guardian on Sunday Correspondent <p> Tanzania needs widespread and sustainable economic growth to alleviate poverty . The biggest contribution to growth must come from the agricultural sector , in which most Tanzanians earn their livelihoods . <p> However , the sector remains largely underdeveloped owing to lack of skills among farmers , innovation and technology ; markets are not functioning well , food security is under threat and governments find it hard to cope with the multiple challenges it faces . <p> A structural change is needed . Such a transformation into a highly productive , market-oriented agricultural sector can not be imagined without a primary role for the commercial private sector . <p> Greenhouse horticulture in Tanzania started over 20 years ago in the early 1990s . <p> For years a few foreign and local flower and seed companies produced for export spearheaded the sector . <p> Very few greenhouses were used for vegetable farming by Tanzanian farmers . Since then , small-scale greenhouses became available through input supply companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a greenhouse , the use of improved hybrid seeds became necessary . Some years ago , global vegetable breeding company known as Rijk Zwaan Afrisem came to Arumeru District , Arusha Region to invest . <p> Since then Rijk Zwaan Afrisem has been availing these seeds for high-end greenhouse cultivation from the mother company Rijk Zwaan 's portfolio . <p> Furthermore , Rijk Zwaan Afrisem has been breeding for seven years now improving African eggplant , Chinense pepper and African kale for open field production . From 2016 these will be available commercially . <p> Around the country more and more farmers turn professional and start using improved technologies such as plastic mulching , drip irrigation and greenhouses . <p> A greenhouse allows controlling the temperature and humidity , protects a crop from rain and partially from insects and makes planning and a predictable harvest possible . <p> As you read this article nearly 240 hectares of vegetable farming countrywide now takes place in greenhouses , providing the market with healthy diets while creating a source of income to growers , among others . Vegetable shortage though , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this initiative the country 's second largest city is now assured of the side dish from greenhouses , which have been sprouting in the region since . <p> With the introduction of more greenhouses than any other region on its fringes markets in the lakeside city are now laden with vegetables , prompting some of the farmers to export their surplus harvest . <p> Peter Ngongoseko , one of the farmers based in Magu , a district with easy access to lake water , harvests tomatoes , sweet pepper and cucumber and sells them on the Dar es Salaam market . <p> Ngongoseko , who is one of the Rijk Zwaan Afrisem 's 600 plus trainees , owns a farm bordering Lake Victoria with three hectares of greenhouses . <p> And in the near future Dar es Salaam too will no longer only rely on vegetables from the up-country regions as several farmers on the outskirts of the commercial city have jumped onto the greenhouse bandwagon , Harald Peeters , the Rijk Zwaan country managing director states . <p> Motivated by one of the firm 's trainees , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking the right know-how to maximise harvests from the use of the greenhouses , he observes . <p> " He should , in addition , know the time , quantity and quality of produce his market needs and above all invest in people instead of the hardware alone , " he adds . <p> Some inadequately informed farmers in Dar es Salaam have unfortunately ended up buying greenhouses and recruiting workers they pay meagre wages to grow the vegetables as they visit them once in a while . <p> As a result , they found themselves harvesting insignificant quantities of vegetables whose quality could not fetch good prices enough to recover costs of buying the greenhouses . <p> After experiencing the difficulties first hand , the farmers jointly consulted the sevn-7-year-old Arusha-based Rijk Zwaan Afrisem , which agreed to set up a demonstration plot in Bagamoyo District , Coast Region . <p> " In fact , one of the farmers has volunteered his greenhouses to be used for demonstrations , " says Peeters , cautioning that horticulture was a full time career rather than a part time job . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the country 's subsistence farmers who never bother with knowledge and often loath hybrid seeds because they can not be re-used . <p> They forget that those seeds have added value and can guarantee crops with high yields , long shelf life , early harvest , and protection against pests and diseases . <p> " Vegetable production calls for skills if farmers are to predict their bumper harvests and meet their market demands , " says Peeters , adding that the on-the-job training Rijk Zwaan Afrisem offers its clients , is practical and current state of the art . <p> Rijk Zwaan Afrisem also enlightens farmers on the need for analysing soil and irrigation water in order to raise their vegetable yields . <p> " Farming is all about precise timing and prediction , " stresses Peeters whose firm specialises in vegetable seeds and service provision . <p> The yield potential for hybrid vegetable seeds can give a farmer up to five times production and income provided he adheres to growing methods . <p> As urbanisation is projected to rise from 28 per cent to 45 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow and prices will become more lucrative . <p> " We go into long-term partnerships , you buy our seeds along with technical know-how and support , " says Peeters , believing a happy farmer is a returning client . <p> Rijk Zwaan , which ranks 5 in the world 's biggest vegetable breeding companies , earned the first slot in the annual overview of the 100 most significant companies in Dutch greenhouse horticulture ( Hilenraad 100 ) for four years in a row as a result of its approach of investing in technology , skills and people . <p> The approach is the brainchild of Rijk Zwaan , who started with a seed shop and became the founding father of the family property , which dates back to 1920s when he first developed varieties that improved the business of his customers . <p> It was this investment in people which earned Zwaan extra mileage in the trade as he worked alongside his workers regardless of rank , a legacy to which Rijk Zwaan adheres to date . <p> With 30 subsidiaries throughout the world , Rijk Zwaan stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comprises growers , traders and retailers . Rijk Zwaan prides itself in contributing to a food secure and healthy future . <p> " We respect our business relations and our environment in all areas of our work , " says Peeters . <p> Given the increasing scarcity of arable land , the vulnerability of our ecosystems to climate change and increasing demand for food , it is paramount that yields per area unit have to go up . <p> The use of more sophisticated technology in food production such as greenhouses , drip irrigation and IPM is inevitable so as to feed the rapidly growing African population , he says . <p> Peeters was grateful to TAHA , an apex body for horticulture , for mobilizing and building institutional capacity and facilitates enabling environment and technical assistance . <p> " We have strived to assist peasants to transact business with exporters in a win-win framework , " TAHA CEO , Ms Jacqueline Mkindi explains , adding that the industry now earns the country nearly $500 million annually , up from a mere $64 million in 2004 . <p> TAHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounded by the government numerous taxes and levies , particularly now Skills Development Levy and land rent fee . <p> It also supports investors in horticulture in the registration of essential horticultural inputs including pesticides , fertilizers and biological control agents . <p> TAHA addresses policy and regulatory hurdles for the industry to thrive , chipped in Policy and advocacy Manager , Anthony Chamanga . <p> " We also link farmers to access Rijk Zwaan hybrid seeds for high crop value crops so that they can realize booming yields , " Chamanga notes .

@@1950234 <h> Typography <h> Share This <p> AGRICULTURE is the backbone of the national economy . It accounts for 26 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) and provides employment opportunities to about 80 per cent of Tanzanians , according to available data . <p> The sector has considerable potential for wealth creation and poverty reduction , but is dominated by low productivity smallholder farms . Large scale farming occupies only about 15 percent of the cultivated land or 3.4 per cent of the cultivateable area . The latest initiative to revive the agricultural sector is the ' Kilimo Kwanza ' agricultural strategy . <p> The strategy encourages investments , and one of its ten pillars is effective use of science and technology to increase agricultural productivity . Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) , through Multi-National Enterprises ( MNEs ) , can help build and develop technological capabilities of local farmers as they have elsewhere been found to be key in local technological capability building . Although FDI inflows into agriculture have recently been increasing in Tanzania , very little is known about their impact on local technological capabilities . <p> In 2010-2011 , Science , Technology and Innovation Policy Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) on Local Technological Capabilities in the Agricultural Sector in Tanzania . STIPRO is an NGO engaged in independent policy research in science , Technology and innovation in Tanzania with a view to contributing to the resolution of contemporary issues in STI for the purpose of informing STI policies in the country . <p> The study about impact of Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) , on Local Technological Capabilities in the Agriculture Sector in Tanzania attempts to bridge the knowledge gap about little information on the impact of local technological capabilities . <p> Three researchers in that study , Dr Bitrina Diyamett , Prof Prosper Ngowi and Mr Musambya Mutambala explain that specifically their study sought to address the issues about the level of linkage between FDI and local farmers , the extent of FDI contribution to technological capabilities of local farmers and the policy steps needed to ensure FDI maximum benefit to Tanzania 's technological development in agricultural sector . According to them , the study involved small scale indigenous farmers located near large scale MNE plantations . <p> They say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Moshi Rural District . There were also 50 small scale sugar cane farmers randomly selected from Kilombero in Morogoro region . <p> The study shows that FDI may benefit the host country through several channels including vertical and horizontal linkages . Vertical linkages include forward and backward linkages . While forward linkages refer to relations with buyers , backward linkages are relations with suppliers of parts , components , materials and services . <p> The effect of such linkages on local farmers depends on the quantity and quality of inputs supplied and the willingness of FDI to transfer knowledge and build a long-term relationship with them . <p> The study shows that FDI can also help to raise productivity through providing technical assistance and information to improve quality or facilitating innovations or assisting in purchasing inputs and intermediary goods , setting up production facilities and diversifying . Researchers insist that horizontal linkages refer to the diffusion of technology through demonstration or competition . <p> This occurs when local farmers see the superior technology of the FDI and either update their own , or imitate the new technologies used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of FDI is not automatic and depends largely on the motives for FDI , in-depth knowledge of local conditions and appropriate Policies to enhance the positive impacts The studies show that farmers were involved in 8 out of the 13 possible innovative activities . <p> The most common innovation is in the use of new and improved seeds ( 49.1 per cent ) followed by the introduction of new harvesting techniques and procedures ( 42.7percent ) . <p> A few also apply new methods of tilling and new pesticides and fertilizers ( less than 10 per cent ) and all the other activities were hardly implemented at all . With the exception of new tilling methods , FDI was the primary source of innovation , in particular in relation to inputs such as seeds , fertilizer and pesticides . About 29.1 percent of farmers had backward linkages with local supply companies . <p> However , the greatest linkage ( 71.8per cent ) was noted to exist between farmers and farmers ' associations . Thus , while FDI provided farmers with the knowledge about seeds , fertilizer and pesticides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some 87.5 percent of respondents said that suppliers did not influence their innovations at all . <p> This is because , typically , the immediate suppliers of such inputs as seeds , fertilizers , pesticides and small farm equipment like hoes and spraying machines are agro-dealers who operate small shops in rural and urban centres and some medium agro-vet shops in urban centres . <p> These normally do not impart any kind of knowledge to farmers -- the relationships are purely commercial . Farmers seem to have more forward linkage with FDI ( 44.5 percent ) than local buyers ( 32.7 percent ) . This is largely due to the fact that in Kilombero , the FDI , the Illovo Sugar Company is the only processor of sugar cane . <p> No farmer was exporting outputs . This is natural given the scale of operation of these farms , which was relatively too small to warrant a venture into the export market . Coffee was exported by companies that bought coffee either direct from the farmers or indirectly via the Moshi coffee auction . <p> Although half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their innovations at all , the other half felt that buyers had substantial influence , especially in regard to harvesting techniques which was the area where the FDI had the most influence on knowledge also . <p> Some local sugar cane farmers also got improved seed from the FDI . Both the Kilombero sugarcane farmers and the Kibosho coffee farmers mentioned that they worked on the FDI plantations where they acquired some advanced skills and techniques . <p> In Kilombero they also mentioned that some were employed in the sugar processing factory and the FDI had provided some health and education facilities . Suppliers of equipment and other inputs were also seen as a channel for knowledge exchange by some farmers because they not only supply farm equipment but also give instructions on how to use them . <p> From those findings and in connection to Policy implications , Dr Bitrina Diyamett , Prof Prosper Ngowi and Mr Musambya Mutambala observe that FDI has the potential to contribute to technological capability building of local farmers . They say the first issue that needs to be addressed is the overall relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust and perceived mistreatment seriously impedes the development of technological capabilities of local farmers . Thus , a number of policy implications arise from the study findings . <p> They recommend that the government and other stakeholders should find a way of ensuring harmony between local farmers and foreign investors . This is the sine qua non for improved relations between foreign investors and local farmers and therefore improved linkages and spillovers of knowledge from FDI to farmers . Such harmony must be based on transparent contracts between government and investors and improved communication based on participation of local actors . <p> There is a need also to encourage collaboration and linkages between farmers and other actors that go beyond selling of inputs and buying of products . In particular more emphasis should be placed on improved equipment and marketing , not just seeds , fertilizer and pesticides . The government should revisit the role in practice of research institutes and extension services in the way they relate to local farmers . <p> This should be based on in-depth research into the working of innovation systems in agriculture with particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutes . Research institute should be a go-between between the farmers and FDI.
