One can only hope there 's someone in the Gotabaya Rajapaksa regime who has either read Joseph Nye or at least watched the final episode of Game of Thrones . Prof. Joe Nye 's contribution has been to foreground the strategic importance of soft power , and to augment it with the concept of ' smart power ' ( by which he does n't mean IT or AI ) .

He acknowledged that it did , and that he would acknowledge it in his next book . <p> To illustrate how this works , Israel loses almost all UN votes , except for when it 's at the Security Council and the US exercises its veto on Israel 's behalf . Israel is an undeclared nuclear power . Cuba wins every vote at the UN , beating the USA . Cuba is nowhere as rich or as militarily strong as Israel nor has the open backing of a superpower . Why ?

Because Cuba has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral high ground , which Israel does not because it can not . <p> How did this happen to a country , Israel , which , rightly or wrongly , fairly or unfairly , was admired by much of the world when it won the Six Day War in June 1967 ? It was the Occupation and annexationism that came afterwards . The war and the occupation are quite distinct , which is why there are many veterans of that war , and many spouses , sons and daughters of the heroes of that war ( such as Leah Rabin and Yael Dayan ) who are bitter opponents of the Occupation . <p> Nobody in the UN Human Rights Council attacks Russia over the bitterly-fought war against separatist terrorism in Chechnya ( which involved bombing Grozhny ) .

Falk advocates taking ' Justice ' as the key demand and building trans-state , legal and moral counter-power . <p> This is what is happening to Sri Lanka today . It was n't always so .

( For a summary of the findings in the literature see : Sri Lanka in Geneva May 2009 : International Scholarly Assessments &amp; Interpretations- Colombo Telegraph ) <p> By contrast , Sri Lankan discourse degenerated in the postwar decade into an alternation/ combination of three discourses -- paranoid **26;84;TOOLONG leftism , truculent nativism and abject capitulationism -- reflecting changes in the ethos of the state . <p> Sri Lanka 's soft power ; its capacity to appeal to , persuade and convince diverse others , is down to an all-time low .

Germany 's and Japan 's postwar successes do not shed a kindlier light on the evil of the Axis powers . Conversely , the horror of Pol Pot and the ghastliness of Mugabe do not invalidate the legitimacy of the Cambodian and Zimbabwean wars of liberation . The legitimacy of the French , Russian and Chinese Revolutions were not diminished in the eyes of even the tragic heroes who were victims ( Danton , Trotsky , Lin Biao ) by the post-revolutionary regime practices further downstream . Similarly , what Sri Lanka has become and is becoming in the postwar years , ably described and documented by Bachelet , the Special Rapporteurs , the Elders et al. , does not overturn the basic legitimacy of Sri Lanka 's war against terrorism and for territorial reunification . <p> It is true that there almost certainly were war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves , that does n't alter the very character of the war fought legitimately by one side and illegitimately by the other . However , the story does n't stop there . If the war crimes committed by the state are not independently investigated and justly punished , and if such impunity proves to be a protracted phenomenon , it becomes just as much a part of the history of the war as the valorous victories . Though that may not be the methodology of the historian , it is certainly the habit of the global public imagination , especially of younger generations , to view the war through the prism of the injustices committed against the unarmed/disarmed . That is what has happened in the case of Sri Lanka . That is why Sri Lanka is the accused today . <p> Lakshman Kadirgamar introduced me to Philip Gourevitch who was at the time the Editor of the New Yorker .

We met again in Paris , where I was serving in the postwar years . He had switched from the New Yorker to the editorship of the Paris Review . <p> Gourevitch told me that global public opinion , including in the circles he worked and moved in , changed adversely towards Sri Lanka not when it won the war , defeating the Tigers and killing Prabhakaran , but when it started to see pictures of Tamil women , children and old men who had been held behind barbed wire , with armed guards outside , for many months .

Gehan Gunatilleke recently referred to his Geneva 2008 memories . My own take me to early May 2007 and an indelible exchange with the ( then ) Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Rowan Williams , who was paying a call on President Mahinda Rajapaksa . <p> President Rajapaksa had brought me in to meet visiting US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher and the meeting had a testy moment when Boucher asked the Sri Lankan state to desist from using ' Tamil paramilitaries ' . Douglas Devananda was among those at the meeting . With a glance at MR and a barely perceptible nod from him , I politely interjected that the USA had been using paramilitaries , referred to as ' local allies ' , in many theatres of war including Afghanistan . I mentioned Rashid Dostum . <p> There were two meetings that President MR hosted back-to-back , and the second was very different from the first . The Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Rowan Williams ( who currently teaches Contemporary Christian Thought at Oxford and Cambridge ) was the second guest . The atmosphere changed as the cultured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed with utmost civility some very searching and fundamental questions about the war . This time the President openly asked me to field them . <p> I answered as sincerely as I could , that the war we had been forced into by the Tigers met all the criteria of the Christian theological doctrine of Just War , and went on to explain . My explanation must have had some credibility because at the media briefing that day the Archbishop made a statement that in the defense against terrorism the surgical use of the military option would be unavoidable . That raised a howl of protest from the UK-based Tamil diaspora . But my story is not about how I may have presented a persuasive case . Rather it is about Dr. Rowan Williams ' counter-question to me , how I answered it , and how , in the longer view , he has proven more correct than I , though I still stand by the point I made . <p> Listening to me make the case on Just War , Dr. Rowan Williams made the following point and posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theologians had been revisiting Just War theory and while he could see my point , he wished to inform me that they were in the process of developing a new concept as counterpart and corollary to Just War . That concerned the outcome of a Just War : the problem of ensuring a Just Peace . <p> " Do you think that the Just War as you have argued it is , will lead to a Just Peace -- and why so ? " the Archbishop of Canterbury asked me squarely , with President Rajapaksa leaning forward with complete concentration . I answered : " when the army retakes the North and East , the state will , if only as an exercise in legitimation , have to hold elections thereby reopening democratic space which will be filled by the elected representatives of the Tamil people , who will then press home the grievances and aspirations of those people . In that sense the Just War will open a process that eventually enables a just peace .

Rejecting unilateral statements and hostile resolutions is understandable , but retrenching from or blocking the implementation of the constructive pledges and positive resolutions of one 's own administration is appalling . <p> Sri Lanka can not credibly criticise the UNHRC or the OHCHR for overlooking the LLRC and Paranagama Reports -- with Sir John Holmes ' impregnable annexure -- because the Government itself failed to implement their accountability recommendations and is still not committed to doing so . <p> The postwar prospect is at its grimmest today , judging by the recent remarks of a leading ideologue of the Gotabaya camp , Prof. Rohan Gunaratna : <p> " ...

" <p> Just as concerning , the High Commissioner stressed the emergence of " early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation and a significant heightened risk of future violations . " <p> Given the Government of Sri Lanka 's failure to comply with the State 's human rights obligations and implement agreed-upon accountability efforts and the need for urgent preventative action , it is essential that a new resolution detail immediate , concrete , and independent international efforts , including enhancing monitoring by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) , creating an independent international mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of past and ongoing violations and abuses , and prioritising support to civil society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisations have documented grave human rights violations and abuses in Sri Lanka . <p> The 26-year war between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) witnessed serious violations -- including allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity -- by both parties . The toll on civilians was particularly high in the final stage of the conflict , when tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed , primarily by Government forces ' shelling of " No Fire Zones . " <p> Following the end of the war , the country remained over-militarised and human rights abuses continued , including extrajudicial killings , enforced disappearances , arbitrary detention , torture , sexual violence , and harassment and persecution of journalists , activists , and government critics . <p> Sri Lanka 's Tamil and Muslim populations have disproportionately suffered from these continuing violations and abuses , as they face institutionalised discrimination and higher levels of targeted state-sponsored violence .

" <p> They emphasised the " extremely disheartening " fact that their conclusions echo those of UN experts in 2009 , who found " impunity has been allowed to go unabated throughout Sri Lanka . The fear of reprisals against victims and witnesses , together with a lack of effective investigations and prosecutions , has led to a circle of impunity that must be broken .

The dedicated capacity should come in the form of an independent international investigative mechanism . <p> We also join the High Commissioner 's call for Member States to pursue alternative avenues for accountability and justice , including " taking steps towards the referral of the situation in Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court , " the pursuit of " investigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universal jurisdiction , and the imposition of targeted sanctions , including asset freezes and travel bans against State officials accused of grave human rights violations . <p> A strong resolution with concrete action by the Human Rights Council and UN human rights bodies will not only signal to the Government of Sri Lanka that continuing impunity and abuses are not acceptable , but will also affirm for survivors that the United Nations is committed to securing justice for the harms they experienced .

@@32638231 <h> DG Health Services sets up the wrong criteria for community spread of COVID-19 <p> In his statement , the Director General ( DG ) of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardana states that if COVID-19 reaches community spread , then the positive rate will spike up as an indication . He concludes by this criteria that Sri Lanka does not have community spread . <p> In November 2020 , FactCheck assessed a statement by the Chief Epidemiologist of the Ministry of Health and concluded that Sri Lanka had , even then , reached community spread , based on globally accepted criteria . This fact check will assess whether the current claim , despite not fitting any known definitional criteria , could yet have some merit on an empirical basis . To assess the claim , FactCheck consulted the WHO 's global COVID-19 updates from March 2020 to February 2021 and global COVID-19 testing data from Our World in Data . As of 10 February 2021 , 74 countries were classified as having community spread . Of these , FactCheck evaluated data on the 24 countries for which ( i ) comprehensive testing data was available ; and ( ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of tests per day was at least 4,000 . <p> An increase in the positive rate ( the ratio of cases to tests ) that the DG refers to is the same as a decline in the test-to-case ratio ( TCR ) . Since TCR is the more commonly reported metric globally , this fact check will use it , rather than the positive rate , to assess the DG 's claim . <p> For the 24 countries assessed , the 30-day average TCR ranged from a minimum of 2.79 ( Mexico ) to a maximum of 107.68 ( Ethiopia ) , with a mean of 29.9 . On 10 February 2021 , Sri Lanka 's average TCR was 27.25 -- this puts Sri Lanka very close to the global mean for countries at the point they were classified as ' community transmission ' . The DG 's claim implies that the TCR must " drastically " decline for the transmission level to be upgraded to ' community transmission ' . However , globally this is not the case . In 8 of the 24 countries assessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classification change -- this means that it takes more tests to identify a positive case . This does not necessarily mean that the spread is reducing ; it can also mean that a country 's testing regime has improved . In the month preceding 10 February 2021 , Sri Lanka 's TCR decreased by 2.03 . <p> In terms of TCR , Sri Lanka is worse off than at least nine countries at the point they were classified as ' community transmission ' . Its decline in TCR is higher than at least 11 countries . These numbers means that countries like Finland , Hungary , Lithuania and Luxembourg , were all actually doing better than Sri Lanka in terms of their both their TCR numbers and TCR trend at the point at which their COVID-19 spread was classified as ' community transmission ' . <p> Therefore , in addition to deviating from any known definition on the classification of ' community transmission ' , the DG 's claim is also contrary to empirical evidence . Hence , we classify the DG 's statement as FALSE . <p> Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a platform run by Verit ? Research .

In a swift follow-up , US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since addressed a letter to him ( and to Abdullah Abdullah ) . <p> Blinken 's letter is in public domain and in it the US proposes , amongst other things , to convene under the UN auspices a meeting of foreign ministers and envoys from Russia , China , Pakistan , Iran , India and the US to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan . <p> The intention behind it is to legitimise the transfer of power to an interim government in Kabul on the lines of the 2001 Bonn conference that paved the way for the transition following the removal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . <p> The good part is that despite the testy equations currently among and betwixt the US , Russia and China and the US-Iranian atomic tango , there is a broad international recognition that the Taliban should form part of any inclusive government in Kabul in the prevailing conditions when they control half of Afghanistan . <p> As in 2001-2002 , when the so-called Northern Alliance set-up that seized Kabul following the Taliban 's removal from power needed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim government under Hamid Karzai , a similar piquant situation arises today with Ghani and his faction ensconced in power adamantly digging in and will need to be brought down to terra firma so that the peace process can be pushed through . <p> This is where the opportunity arises for India . Conceivably , there are only a handful of world capitals that wield the degree of influence over Ghani ( and his close circle of security czars ) as New Delhi does . Suffice to say , India finds in the same situation as 19 years ago when at Bonn , it was called upon by Washington to persuade the Northern Alliance to move over and accept Karzai 's interim leadership . <p> The Vajpayee government in 2001 was eager to be helpful in Bonn sensing how much it mattered to the George W Bush administration reeling under the trauma of the 9/11 attacks . But then , India was n't a mentor of the Northern Alliance government ( led by Burhanuddin Rabbani ) as it is today in providing rock solid support to Ghani . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese and chalk . <p> Truly , India 's Afghan policy is at a crossroads . The criticality of the opportunity to be seized in the upcoming Afghan transition can not be understated . It is a historic opportunity not only to recalibrate India 's Afghan policies and bring them in sync with the zeitgeist ( spirit of the times ) but also to transform the climate of India-Pakistan relationship . <p> A constructive Indian role in the Afghan transition facilitating the formation of an interim government in Kabul that includes Taliban can be tuned into a profound confidence-building measure vis-a-vis Pakistan . Simply put , such an Indian role can complement the recent India-Pakistan ceasefire agreement and create underpinning to put a moratorium on cross-border activities altogether that has inflicted countless bleeding wounds on each other 's body polity through the past several years and brought no tangible benefits to either side . <p> The point is , if a beginning is to be made to cut the Gordian knot of India-Pakistan relations , the first move could be by removing the Afghan problem from their cauldron of contentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly government in Kabul , which are no less compelling than , say , India 's concerns in having a friendly cooperative Nepal , which has an open border with our country . <p> Of course , such a first step to harmonise over Afghanistan can not be a substitute for India-Pakistan bilateral dialogue , but it will help matters . It is no coincidence that Ambassador Riaz Mohammad Khan , a former foreign secretary of Pakistan , wrote an op-ed yesterday titled Kashmir talks : reality &amp; myth , which concluded that " If ever diplomacy revives for a ( Kashmir ) peace plan , its contours will be no different than those outlined through the 2005-06 effort . Political realities and demography impose limits on what diplomacy can achieve . " <p> For the benefit of the uninitiated , Ambassador Riaz Khan is a highly respected figure who had played a key role at a somewhat similar defining moment in regional politics in negotiating the so-called Geneva accords that led to the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Afghanistan in 1989 . <p> The prospects are brighter than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months is entirely conceivable . A constructive role by India in this process would not only safeguard its security interests but also could provide the opportunity to engage with the Taliban for crafting a forward-looking relationship based on mutual trust and mutual respect . Trust Pakistan not to meddle with such a positive scenario . <p> The road ahead will be long and winding and much resistance can be expected from the high-flying " hawks " in our skies . But that should not deter the policymakers from planning a road map with the " big picture " in mind . Logically , the time is approaching for India to give thought to resuscitating the SAARC at an early opportunity so that any India-Pakistan bilateral processes would also get synergy from regional cooperation . <p> The bottom line is that India needs to foster a sense of urgency , a new way of thinking that gives precedence to the resolution and not simply the management of conflict situations , to avoid disaster rather than merely dealing with its consequences , to be able to prioritise the national agenda of development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country 's current history . <p> Author Bio : This article was produced in partnership by Indian Punchline and Globetrotter .

Rather , the President seemingly questions that company 's right to continue to inform the public on the increasingly urgent and serious ecological crisis the nation faces . It would greatly help if the President and the relevant mass media authorities pinpoint the actual misreporting incident and make the necessary public clarifications that systematically rectifies any irresponsible journalism , " SAFMA Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the reports of his recent speech in the Nuwara Eliya area are accurate , the President , who is the apex political authority in the land and , furthermore , is one of the most popular and respected political leaders in this country 's history , seems to be indirectly targeting a specific media company and broadly attacking its right to generally continue to inform the nation on key national issues . As a result , there is created an atmosphere of negativity regarding such nationally valuable journalism and undermines the nation 's right to be informed , " the statement said . <p> SAFMA Sri Lanka strongly affirms the public 's right to be informed to the maximum on such a critical matter as the ecological crisis that Sri Lanka faces and the President himself has acknowledged as a national problem .

@@32682238 <h> An insightful collection <h> ' Politics of a Rainforest : Battles to Save Sinharaja ' <p> By Kshama Ranawana <p> Given the controversies surrounding Sri Lanka 's World Heritage Site , the Sinharaja Forest , the timing of Dr. PrasannaCooray 's book , ' Politics of a Rainforest : Battles to Save Sinharaja ' could not be better . <p> Scheduled to be launched on March 27 , the book presents a collection of Dr. Cooray 's investigative reports , as well as some articles included as annexures authored by others on the decades long struggles to protect Sri Lanka 's natural resources and of the key players involved . <p> For the uninitiated , ' Politics of a Rainforest : Battle to Save Sinharaja ' offers a good mix of information ; the legal status of the forest , its history and bio-diversity , the many threats it faces both past and current and the efforts by environmentalists and other enthusiasts to protect this national heritage . Indeed , the information contained in the book will be useful to all those interested and even those actively involved in nature conservation . <p> How many , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its efforts to protect the pristineness of Sinharaja . Formed by actress Irangani Serasinghe , her sister Kamini Vitharana , the former director of the Wildlife Department and the Dehiwela Zoo , Lyn de Alwis , well known photographer Nihal Fernando and Vere de Mel , Ruk Rakaganno had played an important role in opposing Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike 's ' Wagasangramaya ' programme , where large swathes of forests had been cut down to grow food crops as substitutes for imported varieties . We see something similar taking place even today . <p> Ruk Rakaganno <p> was instrumental in persuading Bandaranaike 's successor , Prime Minister J R Jayewardene to halt the cutting down of trees in the Sinharaja for the manufacture of plywood , a project that was in place between 1971 and 1977 . <p> Dr. Cooray 's book also gives a chronological list of events that occurred between November 2019 and 2020 , beginning with former President Maithripala Sirisena 's signing off on a gazette notification amalgamating nine peripheral forest reserves with the Sinharaja , thus expanding its land area , and the actual publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was during this period that current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa commissioned the construction of the controversial Lankagama-Neluwa road . While construction of the road was halted temporarily in the face of protests , the President ordered that work recommence after the Parliamentary elections held in August last year . What 's missing in the narrative though is whether or not reports that appeared months after the road work was completed , showing parts of it washed away , were factual . <p> Given that the book is a compilation of previously published reports some of the information is repeated , nevertheless , it provides valuable input on the need to preserve the indigenous knowledge about the forest , that is now limited to just a handful of people , and the possibility of creating a ' Lankagama Land Trust ' where the land could be purchased by the public and ownership transferred to the Forest Department to act as its custodian .

He is also a member of the Earth Journalism Network . <h> Advice to Youth ; environment ; one in a thousand <p> A video clip of part of a conversation of local radio commentators with probably the DJ joining in during a music session , had them with good humour thrashing Meghan -- the wickedly whining Duchess of Essex -- on her recent Oprah Winfrey interview . They very rightly said that in Sri Lanka folk invariably comment on the skin colour of a newborn -- " kaluda sududa ? " and no one takes the slightest offence . People go further macabrely , Cass adds , commenting on the laid-out dead -- " Myee how dark she looked . Aney , poor thing ! " The final punch line of the video was the best : " Meghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cassandra now adds her own set of warnings to peoples of this fair isle of ours : <p> To young bucks : do not play rugby , aim at captaincy or cock a snook at those who think they are special and superior to all else . <p> To journos : For goodness sake , if you value your life , do not go into investigative journalism about certain families . <p> To the outspoken : Hold your tongue Stupid ! You may land in prison for life just for one statement you make which really harms no one , except that you are of the wrong political colour and too free with your accusations . <p> To those who abhor corruption : pretend to be all of the three proverbial monkeys . Honesty is the worst policy . This applies especially to environmentalists now . <p> Misinterpretation of a single word <p> Cass needs to elaborate on a phrase in her last Friday 's ramblings . She had a sharp critic laugh maliciously at her ( unintended ) imputation that the ' Good Morning Britain ' show anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meghan Markle during her single days . Cass wrote ' Morgan is supposed to have had a relationship with Meghan and she had dropped him ... ' <p> It was a friendship that Cass meant and the fallout was that Morgan took offence at not being invited for the Windsor Chapel wedding to which Meghan had invited her many friends . So , he continued to thrash her on his morning talk show . ' Relationship ' as written in the original Cry of Cassandra was not meant to be a love one , but a platonic friendship . ' Relationship ' need not mean only sexual love ; it has its many connotations . <p> The environment -- topic of present times <p> ' The Environment ' is the A1 topic at the moment and widely discussed in the press , social media and talk shows . Rightly so too . There has never been such a rape of forests and over-exploitation of resources like sand , as of now . And very fortunately the young ' uns have rallied round . They have done it peacefully : planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awaken the somnambulant to the great danger the country faces : further depletion of its forest cover from the meager 17% of now . And how has the government taken it ? The knee-jerk reaction of the President himself has been very disappointing , to say the least , and administrators have come forth in dissent to override the earnest youth . Threats have been issued and the mounted frieze in Viharamahadevi Park ordered to be brought down , in spite of official , written permission having been obtained by the young protestors from Municipal authorities . It was a completely peaceful gesture of awareness creation and timely warning . The large mounted picture was no threat to plant , animal or human , so why did the Municipal Commissioner and others see red and order it brought down ? High ups work in mysterious ways . <p> The environment was the topic thrown forth for discussion by Shameer Rasooldeen to four environmental experts on Monday 22 March at the MTV Channel I Face the Nation panel discussion . Dr Sevvandi Jayakody -- Director/Environment Foundation Ltd ; Dr Ajanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jagath Gunawardena and Ravindranath Dabare -- Director/ Centre for Environmental Justice ; took up the challenge very forcefully , convincingly and knowledgeably and in one voice pronounced our environment , and within it invaluable ecosystems , were in the height of danger from what is being perpetrated now by unscrupulous violators of law and decency . Destruction goes on apace though protests are loud and justified ; the perpetrators of crimes seem to be winning . Like in the case of 19-year Baghya , who spoke of the destruction of a part of the Sinharaja forest before her very eyes , the messenger is targeted and threatened while miscreants and criminals go free to continue their rape and pillage . Another consensual fact expressed by the panel members is that the youth of the country have awoken to the danger of the undercover destruction of our natural environment and illicit exploitation of natural resources . Consensus was that they should be encouraged in their sincere crusade and not stymied or worse , marked for punishment , as they are now . <p> Attorney-at-law Dabare explained his theory : humans spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given all nourishment and sustenance . When they are born , it is to the womb of the Environment , which again sustains them and gives them what they need . So how destroy it ? <p> Dr Ajanta Perera was loud and clear in her condemnation of rackets of tree cutting etc going on with the patronage of VVIPs and lesser officials . She clearly explained the terms <p> economic development and environmental development . It had to be sustainable development without disturbing Nature . An ecosystem once harmed can not be rejuvenated , she emphasised . A consensual and very clear opinion was that no reservoirs should , and could , be built within the Sinharaja Forest as announced by Minister Chamal Rajapaksa recently . No one can touch a heritage site without it being downgraded . Harming it is an act of robbery against future generations of Sri Lankans . Laws must be abided by and law breakers punished . Also , all MPs , top politicians and administrators should be made aware of environmental issues and world opinion and take note of dire warnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the correct action of protecting it , which is the bounden duty of a government . <p> Honest three-wheeler owner/driver <p> Readers of Cassandra have been introduced to the charioteer who spins Cass around Colombo on errands . She detailed in a previous Cassandra Cry how he redid his three-wheeler and made it a showpiece only to have it confiscated by the police disbelieving him and evidence that it was 30 years old . It lay ten days in the police station waiting to be sent to the RMV office . Ten days more in that office and what did this mean in rice and sambal terms ? Tuan 's earnings were curtailed and his family suffered . Finally , a fine of Rs 50,000 was clamped on the poor man ; a sure case of he who fell off a tree gored by a buffalo ! <p> He phoned Cass on Saturday last to say a woman had travelled in his three-wheeler far out of Colombo , and getting down -- nikan para meda -- had left one of the two bags she carried . He discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to Colombo . He has dropped Cass at Crescat Apartments , where she has friends , so since the woman with the two bags got in at the halt opposite the building , he requested Cass to find out if her friends had heard of a bag-losing-employee in one of the apartments . Entrusted mission was not carried out -- very careless of Cass . Then on Monday he says he would hand over the bag with a pair of specs , clothes , umbrella and Rs 10,000 to the police . He did not see any boutiques or houses where the woman had alighted so no going again to the place to question people over there . Going to Vision Care to check on details of the sale of the specs seemed to be too far-fetched . At the mention of his decision on Monday 22 , feeling very guilty at her remiss , Cass asked him to hold it until she phoned her Crescat friend . Merciful ! Unbelievable coincidence ! <p> The bag belonged to my friend 's house maid . Tuan was well compensated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of honesty and concern . So , my friend insisted I make this tale known wider . <p> A very happy note to end this day 's conversation with you . There are honest persons in this fine island of ours ; maybe in the proportion of one to twenty rascals , but getting better in proportion as we descend the money and clout levels . And this Muslim knew full well the woman who got in was Sinhalese . There really is no racial disharmony among the ordinary Menikas , Daisies , Naliahs and Mohammeds of ( so far ) Free Sri Lanka . <p> It 's the unscrupulous , power hungry , always eyeing the next election politicians who create the trouble , added to by thugs and now a small fraction of the Sangha . However , those in yellow robes exposing environmental abuse seem to be sincere and motivated by concern for the country . <h> Hypocrisy of Britain and Class Differences in Human Rights Council Voting <p> It can not be just an accident that the main drafter and the promoter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's colonial master from 1802 to 1948 , and even thereafter until 1972 . It appears that neocolonialism still prevails . Introducing the draft resolution , the British representative Julian Braithwaite has said , " Our Core Group is not anti-Sri Lanka . We are friends of Sri Lanka . " This shows his guilty conscience . <p> We do not know about him much . But we know about Britain 's atrocities in Sri Lanka and other colonies ( see British War Crimes -- Wikipedia ) . After taking over the maritime provinces from the Dutch , they invaded and destroyed the multi-lingual Kandyan kingdom . Was it done in the name of human rights ? Those days the nomenclature was ' civilizational mission ' or ' white man 's burden . ' <p> British Crimes Against Humanity <p> Let me quote from Sydney Criminal Lawyers under the titled Crimes Against Humanity : The British Empire . " <p> " It was the largest empire ever to have existed . And as the saying used to go , the sun never sets on the British Empire . At its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a fifth of the world 's population and for many of them , the sun never rose again . Under the policies of British colonialism , people around the globe were subjected to mass famines , atrocious conditions in concentration camps , and brutal massacres at the hands of imperialist troops . The Brits also played an integral role in the transatlantic slave trade . " <p> Where was the accountability ? When the UN was formed in 1945 , the Fascist atrocities were correctly punished . But the British and other colonial atrocities were completely spared . When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) was adopted in 1948 , still there were many colonies under the British and others perpetrating heinous crimes . What a hypocrisy and double standards ! This is the same today . <p> Most of the roots of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka go back to the policies and practices of the British . Divide and rule , encouraging the minorities against the majority , 50-50 policies , the brining of Indian labour as slaves to the plantations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only some . <p> Some Current Violations <p> Britain is preaching Sri Lanka about human rights . But even at present gross violations are happening in Britain . Sarah Everard 's case and the police handling of the protesters is one . Now , the police powers have been expanded by legislation . Britain preaches the freedom of journalists to Sri Lanka and other countries . But the way Julian Assange was treated is completely despicable . <p> Through the UNHRC resolution , Britain and others purportedly seek justice to the victims of the past civil war in Sri Lanka ( 1983-2009 ) on their terms and dictates . Undue pressure has been the main stumbling block in investigations , accountability , and reconciliation during the last 12 years in Sri Lanka . <p> The Brits were directly involved in supporting and harbouring the LTTE terrorist operatives from the beginning . Anton Balasingham was operating from there and Adele Balasingham is still living in Britain . Our colonial master has also allowed the Transitional Government of Tamil Eelam ( TGTE ) to operate freely in Britain . If they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate in Britain ? <p> The above are only some circumstances under which hypocritical British resolution was rejected by Sri Lanka at the UNHRC . And there are clear indications that the main purpose of the British promoted resolution is to overthrow the present government ( 1 ) through international pressure , ( 2 ) sanctions against those who defeated the LTTE in 2009 , and ( 3 ) discrediting Sri Lanka as a gross human rights violator to keep it under their hegemony and control . Be sure that neo colonialism is still operating in the world and neocolonialism is the main violator of human rights even today . For their purposes , a divided country and a separate state is very useful . <p> Voting at the UNHRC <p> It is true that the UNHRC resolution was formally approved with 22 countries in favour , 11 countries against , and 14 countries abstaining . There are many interpretations given why Sri Lanka failed to defeat the resolution . Some are about the failures of the foreign policy and diplomacy . Antagonising some Muslim countries through short-sighted policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in international power struggles ( between US , China , and Russia ) . <p> All may be true to different extents . It is also obvious that under the circumstances of Covid-19 , a poor country like Sri Lanka was greatly disadvantaged in campaigning among 47 countries , scattered around the world , particularly in Latin America , Africa , and Eastern Europe . It was obvious , that European and Western countries were determined to defeat Sri Lanka . <p> The table contains the list of 47 member countries of the UNHRC with their respective per capita GDPs . The figures are in US$ terms . The reason to relate the economic status is to see whether there has been a division between the rich ( high income ) and poor ( low income ) countries in the vote . <p> From these figures , it is very clear that the very rich Western countries were overwhelmingly behind the resolution against Sri Lanka . While the average per capita $GDP of those who voted against Sri Lanka was 21,791 , just look at the per capita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 51,290 ) , Germany ( 45,466 ) , France ( 39,257 ) , Denmark ( 58,439 ) , Austria ( 48,634 ) , and Italy ( 30,657 ) . <p> As we know , Sri Lanka 's per capita GDP is around $3,373 . This is very much similar to the average GDP ( $3,996 ) of the countries who voted against the anti-Sri Lanka resolution on behalf of Sri Lanka . These are mainly the poor countries in the global context with enormous socio-economic and thus political problems . The 14 countries who abstained from voting for various reasons have slightly a higher average income but in general terms are the same as who voted for Sri Lanka , except Japan and Bahrain . India 's position is dubious to say the least . <p> Conclusion <p> What does this show ? There are enormous economic disparities in the world today impinging on human rights , differently and paradoxically . One thing clear is that the rich Western countries are ' weaponizing human rights ' to keep the poor countries continuously poor , through international pressure , engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although rich , the countries like Japan obviously have a different and a compassionate attitude . <p> It is unfortunate that poor countries like Malawi or some other middle-income countries go behind rich countries for various perks or because of misinformation . <p> The way forward for Sri Lanka might be difficult . The main resolve however should be to develop the country economically on a sustainable and an equitable basis for all communities without distinction to ethnicity , region , religion , or gender . Both the government and the Opposition should get together for this task as much as possible . <p> The accountability process has continuously been sabotaged by the international community through unreasonable and unrealistic demands perhaps for the purposes of separatism . In this context , any external mechanisms for so-called accountability should be strongly opposed and resisted . <p> There is an unprecedented interest across the globe in the currently available vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease . There are many factors to consider in this endeavour to vaccinate the general population . The primary considerations are the effectiveness and safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies of the vaccines , ethics of selection of priority groups for vaccination , logistics of transportation as well as fair and equitable distribution of vaccines to all corners of the world are also important . This article will discuss some of the pros and cons of a few that are relevant to Sri Lanka . <p> The effectiveness of the currently licensed vaccines is by now well established . They do very significantly protect us against more severe symptomatic disease and thereby reduce the needs for intensive treatment in hospitals and of course by virtue of that , reduce the associated mortality . This is of major importance as this little blot of a coronavirus has killed over 2.7 million people all over the world and in Sri Lanka it has taken the lives of around 550 people at the time of writing of this article . The initial premise on which the researchers worked on , as stipulated by even the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , is a committed effort towards reducing more severe disease and mortality . Generally , a vaccine is formulated to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial principle on which the research was targeted . <p> Yet for all this , now there seems to be some accumulating evidence that the vaccines do play a part in protecting at least some recipients against catching the disease and thereby reducing transmission from humans to humans . In some recipients of the vaccine who contracted the virus , significantly lower viral loads have also been seen . All of these do combine to provide a real bonus and would help a great deal in our fight to defeat the virus . However , it must be stressed that it does not provide universal one hundred percent protection against infection by the virus . Vaccinated individuals should not , I repeat. , should not , abandon safe physical distancing , avoidance of gatherings , washing of hands and wearing of masks . If the vaccinated people happen to catch the virus , even if they are asymptomatic , they can still transmit it , at least to some people . So it is very important to follow all health guidelines . <p> The safety profile of the vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humans before these vaccines were licensed for general use . It must be remembered that all types of any vaccine against infective diseases have the risk of developing allergic or sensitivity reactions . Some of the recipients of the vaccine against COVID-19 are also liable to get chills or feeling cold , fever , muscle pains , some abdominal symptoms and fatigue . All of these are quite short-lived , just only for a couple of days . Some more serious side-effects have been noted in the human trials but these were extremely rare and not thought to be of grave significance . The latest problem that was publicised are disturbances in the clotting of blood in vaccine recipients in some Western countries . Clots were detected in deep veins and some detached clots had gone into the blood vessels of the lungs . A lot of fuss was made on this issue , particularly by the media , which even led to temporary suspension of at least one brand of the corona vaccines . However , deep venous thrombosis is a well-known problem in the West and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to establish the vaccine to be directly responsible for these problems . In fact , after firm assurance of the safety of the vaccine being provided by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , many of those countries have restarted their vaccination programme with the incriminated vaccine . It is important also to highlight that even after giving around 800,000 or so vaccinations in Sri Lanka , this problem has not been seen here to a really significant extent , up to now . From an ethical perspective , there is everything to be gained by administering the currently used Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine in Sri Lanka . <p> The real ethical dilemma in our country is how to organise the administration of the limited supplies of the vaccines to cover the most vulnerable groups of our citizens . The administration of the vaccine to front -line health workers and the forces personnel in the front-line went off quite well , except for a couple of hitches initially in the provision of the vaccine for health personnel in the private sector . After that , for a couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 and 59 years caused a profound degree of mayhem and chaos at vaccination centres . At the present time there seems to be some order where the over 60-year-olds are given the vaccine . It took a considerable number of adverse scathing reports in the media and intense pressure brought on by many people , for sanity to prevail . Ethically , it is imperative that the carefully formulated ' Priority List ' of groups of people for administration of the vaccine is strictly adhered to . Queue-jumpers , thugs and those with connections should be very firmly dealt with . <p> There are some other ethical aspects to the administration of the vaccine . There are some concerns regarding the second dose of the vaccine . In a previous article ( The Island -- 17th March 2021 ) , I have explained the rationale for changing the timing of the second dose to three months after the first dose from the earlier recommended time period of one month from the first dose . So far around 800,000 or more first doses have been administered . It is imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months or so from the first dose . The government must , I repeat MUST , ensure that sufficient stocks of the vaccine are kept for this group of people . <p> There have been some arguments put forward in certain quarters to say that we should use all available stocks to vaccinate as many people as possible with the first dose to provide even short-term immunity to as many people as possible . They make it out to be a human rights issue . This author believes that it is a more compelling question of human rights for ALL those who have already had the first dose to be given the second dose at the appropriate time , to provide them with the best possible and sustained protection . This contention would apply to even those between 30 and 59 years , who were given the first dose of the vaccine during those initial disordered days . <p> As far as ethics go , in view of the global shortage of vaccines , it is essential that the powers-that-be take steps to even get as many brands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . It really does not matter where these vaccines originate from . The only criteria that are of paramount importance are whether the vaccine is effective and whether it is safe . <p> As at present it is best to give both doses of the same vaccine to each recipient . However , when more scientific information is available , we may be able to mix vaccines if there is evidence that it would work equally well or even better when vaccines are mixed . All over the world , there are several scientific studies in progress to ascertain the usefulness of such a pathway . However , that decision should be a well-informed one , based on robust scientific evidence . It could only be made by the expert scientific medical community . It should not be made on economic , logistical or political grounds by non-medical people and most certainly not , by lay politicians , on their own accord . <p> The take home message for our people at the present time is that the authorities are trying their very best to provide the vaccines against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are due to receive the vaccine should be reassured of the effectiveness and safety of this vaccination . Misinformation , especially through the social media , concocting of various stories of doubtful repute and spreading of false rumours , should not be allowed to scuttle the current vaccination procedures . A system of well-organised system of administration of the vaccines will go a long way towards ensuring success in this war against a tiny enemy that has the potential to bring all of us to our knees and make us sink to the lowest depths of despair .

@@32800230 <h> Preaching to Sri lanka about Internal Unity <p> I refer to the article , under the heading " Internal Unity -- a priority " , on the Opinion Page of The Island of 30th April . I have no disagreement with the assertion made by the writer that what Jehan Perera stated was a thoughtful and measured message . Jehan Perera usually offers wise and helpful messages to his countrymen , through his writing . But I have a problem about certain other things that the writer of this article : Mr Tony Witham ( TW ) referred to above . <p> From the content and tone of this article , I can easily guess on whose behalf that he wrote it . The official agency resident in this country , which should have responded to what TW called " shrill and hysterical words emanating from a large number of writers " , has significantly kept silent on this matter , because the shrill ( but not hysterical ) voices have been stating the truth . TW 's pathetic attempt to counter them has been a resounding failure . <p> Take for instance his argument that if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about an investigation , because one would be invariably cleared eventually . I am greatly surprised at the extreme naivety displayed by this writer here . In the real world of ours , things are not as simple as that . Fair trials do not happen automatically . Too many innocent people are being convicted of crimes , which they never committed . In a recent research study by the Law Department of a University in USA ( Boston College , Mass . USA ) it was found that since 1989 , more than 2,700 people in the USA have been first convicted of felony crimes , and then released later after they spent varying periods in prison , on finding new evidence . This amounts to an average of nearly 90 a year . Together , these unfortunate people have unnecessarily served 24,600 years in prison . Some others would have been even put to death . The Boston College researchers acknowledge that these were only the high profile cases that received publicity in the media , and that there could be many other lesser known cases not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the USA , then the situation in the UK and other advanced or ' civilized ' countries would not be any better , and what about other less developed countries ? And what about those countries which have laws reminiscent of the Dark Ages . <p> I wonder whether TW would still recommend a passive behaviour to individuals and/or countries confronted with false accusations . TW , please note that miscarriages of justice often happen when the accusers resort to fabrication of evidence or suppression of evidence unfavourable to them , just like what the leader of the Core Group ( UK ) is doing right now in the case of Human Rights accusations against Sri Lanka . <p> Responding to very valid questions raised by the distinguished writers ( TW 's expression ) , he cleverly downplays a valid issue by bringing in a story of how a group of kids playfully accused each other of some mischief by saying " You did it first " , etc . The issue Mr TW , is not who did the wrong thing first , the issue is the credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I pointed out in a previous letter to the editor , this particular country being one of the greatest perpetrators of HR violations in history , has no moral right to talk about HR situations in other countries . We know that this country is certainly not the one that is without sin to claim the right to throw the first stone . <p> Mr Editor , thank you for publishing recently that picture of a whole contingent of African people enslaved , most probably by the British Slave Traders ( who else ? ) . That picture shows how a group of human beings with black skins -- bare bodied , that the slave traders apparently caught to be sold like cows and sheep . These unfortunate men were linked to each other by a heavy steel chain welded to rings round their necks , the chain being similar in size to those used to control elephants in our country . I appeal to you to publish this picture or similar revealing pictures at least occasionally for the benefit of our readers , who may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 18th and 19th Centuries , with the full blessings of their home government . <p> The main concern of the writer TW appears to be the need for internal unity in our country : Sri Lanka . The country in whose defence TW is writing has , however , not proved its genuine interest in the internal unity of other countries . See what it has done to Iraq , Syria and Lebanon . Its interventions have resulted in converting these formerly peaceful countries into battlefields , causing the death of thousands of innocent people . These countries are now hotbeds of international terrorism . Given these facts , how can we have faith in your good intentions anymore ? <p> TW should know that one big impediment to achieving that internal unity in this country of ours has been the activity of Tamil diaspora residents in the UK , which includes former members and sympathisers of the terrorist organization : the LTTE . We note that this group has been installed , nurtured and protected by the government of their host country . The LTTE activists command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the local ( Sri Lankan ) Tamil politics , encouraging extremist positions , and preventing the growth of moderate Tamil groups willing to cooperate with similar moderate groups among the majority community in the South , to forge internal unity in the country . Furthermore , over time , these UK-based Tamil groups have grown in numbers and reached positions where they are able to influence the outcomes of local and parliamentary elections of their host country . Often false propaganda against Sri Lanka are brought before the British Parliament , through some British parliamentarians , who are more often than not quite ignorant about the true situation in Sri Lanka . The LTTE groups have also used their political influence to prevent Her Majesty 's Government from dealing with perpetrators of war crimes in Sri Lanka , such as Adele Balasingham . <p> Mr TW , therefore , there are many things that the Leader of the Core Group has to accomplish to promote internal unity in Sri Lanka , before passing strictures , giving advice and passing baseless resolutions at the UNHRC .

This is surely a more pragmatic and student-friendly approach , because for the past few years we have been trapped in the split between two extremes : either in support of a pass in math to be made compulsory for all A/L students or the exemption of Arts students from this requirement . " Maths Studies " would be a happy compromise between the two extremes , which would stand in good stead for many O/L students . with a gift for Arts subjects to pursue their goals without math being an undue hindrance or , conversely , its total exemption turning out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be another subject not available to many students due to at least two reasons : first , the want of qualified teachers and , second , the standards being set too high for the average student , as in the case of math . This deters many students who are not competent enough to meet the high-end demand for " appreciating literary texts " from gaining many other benefits literature would otherwise offer them , if provided as a more watered down package , as in " Maths Studies . " In short , the introduction of a less daunting variant such as " Literature Studies " for the average student , for whom the regular " English Literature " is virtually a taboo , can ensure the same gains " Maths Studies " intends to bring to those less proficient in math . <p> Such leniency would not be wholly out of tune with the learning outcomes of O/L English Literature , enunciated in the relevant syllabus issued by the NIE , which states : <p> The national goal of making an informed reader means a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate any " well written " book and recognize a " good book " when he sees one . It is a training for life . But the whole enterprise of studying literature has been coloured by non-educational , even non-humanistic objectives . For most students and more for their parents , English literature has become a symbol of prestige , culminating in a fantasy of a distinction pass at the GC.E . ( O/L ) examination . ( http : **38;2130;TOOLONG ) ... This goes to provide at least two good reasons for introducing a less demanding option like " Literature Studies " for the average student . As the latter part of the above paragraph admits , for many students , as well as their parents , studying English literature has become a " symbol of prestige . " This is sad because promoting such snobbery flies in the face of all the lofty ideals contained in the first three sentences , such as making the student well informed , critical and sensitized enough to appreciate good literature , etc . As such , it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonably broadminded and sensitive person , by adjusting the syllabus to focus more on increasing their general awareness of the richness of world literature , without making the study of O/L literature a strenuous exercise of gaining a set of " skills , " which may be more suitable for the purpose of grooming critics rather than making students read for pleasure . Arguably , the emphasis on critical appreciation of the texts might be one reason why the students end up becoming stuck-up , as described in the above passage . <p> There is no doubt that the regular O/L literature course prepares the student to study literature at the A/Ls -- hence the need for its continuation . However , a more student-friendly variant intended for encouraging the average student to read literature , without the unnerving prospect of having to write a critical essay on each of the prescribed texts she has to read , is sure to cultivate the reading habit among students . The performance evaluation defined in the NIE syllabus cited below proves the rigid test-oriented and technical nature of the process : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component of the G.C.E. ( O/L ) examination formatively as well as summatively at the end of a two-year course of study . At school level , it is assessed formally at term tests . It is also assessed informally in the classroom using a variety of techniques , both oral and written . Conventionally literature is tested by written examinations . The test items most frequently used are the context question and the critical essay . The context question is more effective since it directly tests the candidate 's familiarity with the texts . <p> Undoubtedly , a more student-friendly and less formulaic syllabus intended for coaxing the average student to read for pleasure , may ideally minimize the focus on critical writing aspect and the emphasis on a knowledge of the textual mechanics . Instead , such a syllabus may include a prudent selection of interesting biographical details of writers and their famous works , their dominant themes and the relevant social contexts , short samples of texts not intended for critical evaluation but for familiarizing them with various writing forms , etc. -- anything that will stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to read the translations in their mother tongue , if time permits . <p> The most important outcome would be to make them keen readers . The essential fine-tuning with regard to the selection of teaching materials and testing can be done by the syllabus designers and teachers who know the terrain well . Thus , as in the case of math , the modified syllabus of literature would help students who are not adequately proficient to follow the standard literature course , to find a more manageable way of developing a liking for literature . <h> Dangers of banning inorganic fertilisers <p> In 2019 , around Rs 310 billion worth of food has been imported . Among these are rice , sugar , green gram , red onion , big onion , maize , etc. , which can be locally produced . If we are to reduce our expenditure on food imports , it is essential that the local food production is increased . For effectively addressing this issue , several inputs are important . Among these are good quality seeds/planting material , and use of appropriate technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inorganic fertilizers is important . Several research studies , conducted in Sri Lanka and elsewhere , indicate that application of inorganic fertilizers tend to increase growth and yields of crops . <p> In 2020 , we imported Rs. 48 billion worth of fertilizers . These are applied to replace nutrients absorbed by plants from soil . A ton of paddy removes 60 kg of nitrogen , 10 kg of phosphorus and 20 kg of potassium . Similarly , other crops remove nutrients from the soil . If land is going to be cultivated , without replenishing the nutrient level in the soil , it will become deficient in essential plant nutrients . Plants growing in such soil will not grow properly , and , as a result , yields will be reduced . There may be instances when crops will not produce at all . <p> Applying organic fertilizers alone will not replenish the nutrients absorbed by a crop . Organic fertilizers have relatively small amounts of the nutrients that plants need . For example , compost has only 2% nitrogen ( N ) whereas urea has 46% N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not applying adequate amounts of nutrients will cause yields to drop ; making it essential to increase food imports , resulting in our annual import expenditure to rise substantially from the present Rs. 310 billion . This may be impossible as our economy is in dire straits . Further , importing rice may be an issue , as most of the Asian countries which grow paddy are currently facing problems . <p> As indicated by Dr. Parakrama Waidyantha , in his article titled " Agrochemical ban : Heading for national disaster ? " -- in The Island of 3 May -- the President 's decision to shift totally to organic agriculture , from conventional , could lead to widespread hunger and starvation . It will cause a shortage of food , locally , resulting in food prices to increase causing some people , mainly the poor going hungry , creating health and social problems . <p> We export several crops and earn foreign exchange , which is used to import essentials . Tea is the main export crop . We earned nearly Rs. 230 billion , in 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inorganic fertilizers , especially nitrogen , the present tea yields will get reduced , causing tea exports to dwindle ; and , as a result , the foreign exchange we earned by exporting tea will also come down . Thus , banning of inorganic fertilizer imports will cause economic , health and social problems . <p> If the government wants to reduce our import expenditure , it could be done by reducing import of many food items . Those who decided to ban fertilizer imports , to save foreign exchange , may not have realized that we spend colossal amounts to import many food items which can be produced locally . It may be interesting to know that the expenditure on import of ayurvedic herbs is nearly Rs. 1,200 million . As suggested by Prof. O.A. Ileperuma , in his article published in The Island of May 1 , 2021 , the Government can save a considerable sum of money on fertilizer imports if we undertake to manufacture superphosphate fertilizers in the country , using Eppawela Apatite . <p> Some ill-informed people are of the opinion that fertilizers are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown aetiology ( CKDu ) , reported in some parts of the country . In this regard , it is pertinent to indicate that CKDu is not reported in some districts although fertilizers are used in large amounts . An international expert consultation , on CKDu , was held in Colombo , in April 2016 . It was organized by the Presidential Task Force for Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease and the Sri Lanka country office of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . The consultation concluded that there is no conclusive evidence to indicate that there is any relationship between CKDu and fertilizers . <p> The decision to ban fertilizer imports should be taken after considering all the pertinent issues . <h> MWL should separate the wheat from the chaff <p> Government MP Dr. Wijedasa Rajapaksa , a former Justice Minister and an ex-president of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka , stated over a month ago that the Muslim World League " ( owes ) families of those who had perished or suffered injuries in the Easter Sunday terror attacks USD 5 mn . " ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferdinando , The Island , March 25 , 2021 ) . This is money that the MWL General Secretary Dr. Sheikh Muhammad Abdul Kareem Al-Issa was said to have promised on behalf of his organization towards the relief of the surviving victims of those attacks at a so-called National Peace Conference held at Nelum Pokuna under the patronage of the then President Maithripala Sirisena on June 30 , 2019 , a little over two months after the Easter Sunday attacks carried out by eight Islamist suicide bombers in the name of their religion . As claimed by MP Rajapaksa , the Sheikh made the promise in the presence of the then incumbent Sirisena , and former presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa , among other dignitaries . The same three past presidents dutifully attended the second National Peace Conference on March 5 , this year . MP Rajapaksa told The Island that he brought up the issue with the MWL head . This was through a letter of his dated March 22 , 2021 , where he urged the latter to fulfill what he had promised without further delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organised the Nelum Pokuna event , too , will take up this matter with the Muslim World League and finalise the transfer of funds before the second anniversary of 2019 Easter Sunday carnage . " <p> The failure of the MWL was mentioned even at the PCoI , according to the MP , who further said that he had raised the matter with the offices of the previous and present presidents . Dr P.B. Jayasundara ( Secretary to the current incumbent ) had confirmed that the funds in question had not been received . A letter that the then Western Province Governor A. J. M. Muzammil had received from Muhammad Al-Issa , to which MP Rajapaksa refers , seems to have a hint about the possible reason for the unexplained delay in the payment of the promised financial assistance : it is probably being withheld " pending Sri Lanka providing information relating to the spate of suicide attacks " . Whether the MP 's importunity in the given context is shared by the government is in doubt . What should be of greater concern for the government is the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Muslim community of the country , the handful of Islamist extremists who are widely believed to have provided tacit or explicit support for the suicide bombers are also foisting themselves on its ( the MWL 's ) powerful patronage . While being grateful to this organization for offering welcome help at a moment of national distress , Sri Lankan leaders must take care not to allow these Islamist extremists tainted with suspected association with the terrorists who caused that suffering to jeopardise its relations with the traditionally friendly Muslim nations through subterfuge . At the same time , it behoves our leaders to establish the genuineness of the MWL 's intentions and to have a correct understanding of the rationale of its involvement in the post-attack context , before accepting its charity .

The name suggests that it is about the pan-Islamic Muslim world , not the world in general , which Muslims share with people of other non-Muslim faiths . It came into existence for the purpose of serving Islam and Muslims . Its founding charter , according to the information currently given in the Wikipedia , is as follows : <p> " We the members of the Muslim World League , representing it religiously , hereby undertake before God , Almighty to : Discharge our obligation towards God , by conveying and proclaiming His Message all over the world .

Utilize our spiritual as well as material and moral potentialities in furthering the aims of this charter . Unify efforts in order to achieve these purposes in a positive and practical way . Reject all the pretenses of ancient as well as contemporary Jahiliyah ( attitudes of the pre-Islamic era ) . Always reaffirm the fact that Islam has no place for either regionalism or racism .

They do n't have the right to freedom of religion ( as the term is understood in democratic countries ) ; nor do the expatriate workers employed in the Saudi kingdom . The official and dominant form of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia is Wahhabism ( also called Salafism ) which emerged in the 18th century . Its adherents believe that its teachings " purify the practice of Islam of innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh century teachings of Muhammad and his companions " . Saudi Arabia has long been accused of being the principal exporter of Islamist extremism ( WikiLeaks cables ) . " ... Saudi Arabia arguably remains the most prolific sponsor of international Islamist terrorism , allegedly supporting groups as disparate as the Afghanistan Taliban , Al Qaeda , Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ) and the Al-Nusra Front ...

Saudi Arabia denies these allegations , but the Wikipedia entry mentions the prevalent argument that by its very nature Wahhabism/Salafism " encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism " . <p> The MWL , while propagating the religion of Islam , encourages Dawah ( lit. issuing summons to/euphemistically , inviting or calling non-Muslims to join , i.e. , preaching to them ) and conversion of non-Muslims ; funds construction of mosques and provides financial relief for Muslims affected by natural disasters ; finances distribution of copies of the Quran and political tracts on Muslim minority groups . Though the organization claims that " they reject all acts of violence and promote dialogue with the people of other cultures , within their understanding of Sharia " , they are not free from controversy on that point , having been the subject of several ongoing counter terrorism investigations in the US related to Hamas , al Qaeda and other terrorist groups " <p> However , since 2016 , the Muslim World League has been claiming to be dedicated to combating extremist ideology , and to confronting hatred , disunity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its 2019 Country Reports on Terrorism , stated that the Muslim World League 's Secretary General , Muhammad Abdul Kareem Al-Issa " pressed a message of interfaith dialogue , religious tolerance , and peaceful coexistence with global religious authorities , including Muslim imams outside the Arab world . " The same document said that he " conducted extensive outreach to prominent U.S. Jewish and Christian leaders " . No doubt , the MWL is on the same pious mission in Sri Lanka . We may be hopeful that the MWL leader will similarly reach out to the non-Muslim 90% of the Sri Lankan population comprising Christians , Hindus , and Buddhists . <p> But whether the assurances given to the powerful US will hold for a small non-Muslim country like ours is still a moot point .

The rich and powerful Saudi-funded , Saudi-basedl Wahhabism-inspired NGO outfit 's patronage of Sri Lanka 's approximately 10% Muslim minority is bound to have understandably important repercussions . <p> One could argue that the so-called National Conference on Peace , Harmony and Coexistence that introduced the MWL to the country just two months after the April 21 Islamist terror bombings , in effect , both ' nationalised ' and ' internationalised ' Sri lanka 's still nascent Islamic fundamentalist problem . Unless sorted out early , this is not going to do any good to the peaceful and harmonious coexistence which all Sri Lankans of different ethnicities and cultures have been enjoying to date mainly thanks to the influence of the country 's extremely accommodating , tolerant Buddhist cultural foundation , something that is today universally accepted and appreciated by all peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority , the MWL can hope to further strengthen the already existing interfaith harmony and peaceful coexistence in our island nation .

Pic courtesy United Nations <p> The primary reason was the rejection of draft resolutions by the veto-wielding United States during the Council 's closed-door sessions . As a result , the resolution never reached the Council during its open session . But if it did , it would have triggered a US veto -- perhaps its 46th aimed at protecting Israel . <p> As Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason of Ireland said last week " conflict is raging , resulting in utterly devastating humanitarian impact but the Security Council has yet to utter a single word publicly . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international peace and security . " It is high time the Council stepped up , broke its silence and spoke out . " <p> With its traditionally serious agenda of maintaining peace and security , the Security Council is the world 's only political body with a mandate to declare war and peace . But when tensions die down , it also has had its moments of levity -- raising laughter in the august chamber . <p> Ambassador Jamil Baroody , the longstanding Saudi envoy to the UN ( 1945-79 ) , described as the dean of the UN diplomatic corps , back in the 1970s , was a " colourful maverick " known for his mile-long speeches . <p> In its obituary , the New York Times described him as a UN " landmark " who was known for his shouting matches -- while holding the distinction of making one of the longest speeches in the history of the world body , perhaps second only to the long-winded Fidel Castro , who held the General Assembly spellbound for nearly five hours back in September 1960 . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US ambassador was known to slip out of the chamber and return at the tail end of his speeches . <p> When Baroody once noticed the American envoy returning to his seat , he turned to the President of the Security Council and said : " Mr President , I notice the honourable US representative was not in the chamber when I spoke . So , I am going to read my statement all over again for his benefit " . The US envoy , this time , remained trapped in his seat , amidst loud laughter . <p> For long now , there have been four strong contenders for permanent seats , with no veto powers -- Germany , India , Japan and Brazil -- with Africa insisting on two permanent seats with vetoes , which is deemed a virtual non-starter . <p> But during a discussion on reforms in the Security Council in 2019 , one delegate made a strong case for a permanent seat for the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) , the largest single coalition of Muslim countries at the UN . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of over 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide -- much more than China , a permanent member , with a population of 1.5 billion , and India , aspiring for a permanent seat , with a population of 1.4 billion . But in an obvious slip of the tongue , the OIC delegate urged member states to ensure permanent membership to the " Islamic State " -- which really is one of the extremist organisations operating out of the Middle East . <p> The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) , also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) is officially designated as the Islamic State ( IS ) . And the very notion of permanent seat to the Islamic State triggered both smiles and laughter in the Council chamber . <p> Meanwhile , whenever the General Assembly or the Security Council holds a meeting , the speeches of delegates are routinely distributed no sooner the speaker begins his address . <p> These speeches , marked " check against delivery " , are left on the desks of all member states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Assembly . <p> So , there was a moment of hilarity when the Indian Foreign Minister picked up , not his speech , but a speech made by an earlier speaker and began reading it . <p> Iftikhar Ali , the UN correspondent for the Associated Press of Pakistan ( APP ) , who covered that meeting , told me it was a monumental faux pas by the Indian External Affairs Minister as he blindly read out the Portuguese delegate 's speech , instead his own , before his ambassador intervened to help rectify the error . <p> During the debate on security and development , a subject on which most delegates made identical speeches , the Indian minister mistakenly read the wrong speech for about three minutes before India 's envoy to the UN Hardeep Singh Puri , pointed to the right speech lying in a stack of papers in front of the minister . <p> With mikes on , an embarrassed minister whispered to his ambassador : " Should I read it from the beginning " ? And the ambassador advised : " Yes , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese foreign minister Luis Amado 's speech , without realizing his mistake , as the first portion was about development and security , the theme of the Council 's debate . <p> As the minister continued , Ali said , a couple of lines was definitely out of sync : " On a more personal note , allow me to express my profound satisfaction regarding the happy coincidence of having two members of Portuguese Speaking Countries , Brazil and Portugal , together here today , " the minister said , which was incongruous for an Indian minister 's speech . <p> ( This article was adapted from a book on the UN titled " No Comment and Do n't Quote Me on That .

@@33003231 <h> Sri Lanka : English Dilemma <p> The stereotype already contains the standard justification for neoliberalisation , familiar in outline from every corner of the public sector in the last 40 years <p> by Nicola Perera <p> The Arts Faculty admits and graduates the largest number of students every year . The private sector tells us that most are unemployable because they lack English skills . The university 's apparent failure to instill English skills in its students is then taken as reinforcing a stereotype that already exists -- the irrelevance of the Arts and Humanities degree . In this article , I look at how the Arts graduate is constructed as a failure in the public imagination , as well as the need for a more critical pedagogical approach to teaching the English language in the university . <p> The stereotype : public education has failed <p> The stereotype is easy and familiar : the student who is educated on the public dime but instead of learning something useful , like a STEM degree or another discipline with more economic value , learns useless things in an Arts and Humanities degree , engaging in horrific ragging on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets for the state to safeguard free education and furnish them with public sector jobs . This is the university student in the public imagination : the one who does not help themselves although given every opportunity . In turn , students are told that their inadequate English stands between them and lucrative private sector jobs . <p> The ideology : public education is a deep well of untapped profit <p> The stereotype already contains the standard justification for neoliberalisation , familiar in outline from every corner of the public sector in the last 40 years : the students are not learning marketable skills , therefore the Arts and Humanities disciplines in particular and the public university in general are a waste of public funds , and so private fee-levying universities ( and correspondingly , mountains of student debt ) are the future . As an argument , this faces backwards : a more accurate presentation of it would be that private fee-levying universities represent massive profits for their owners as well as a host of ancillary services , and in order to make this option more alluring , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it as inefficient as possible . This process has been happening for decades already , and the resources to teach them are narrower than ever . The state lacks commitment to free education because there is so much money to be made -- by everybody except the students -- in a future of expensive education . <p> The Arts undergraduate 's uncertain English is a deliberate , devastating effect of the cannibalisation of free education in the state 's neoliberal economic policy . Its concomitant social narrative obfuscates the origins of the problem . The stark reality is university students who are determined , desperate , and fearful of learning English . In the first few weeks of class , they speak of the social inequalities of free education in Sri Lanka . We never had an English teacher at all or only intermittently . There were n't enough textbooks to go around . The English teacher seemed befuddled ; read out the textbook ; came to class and did n't teach ; engaged in other work . Consequently , students struggle within the prevalent neoliberal ideology and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of their lack of social capital , that they are reliant on the classroom to learn a language they do not speak at home , the student has already internalised systemic problems as personal failures . Under-resourced schools and too few teachers , poorly trained and poorly paid . <p> When did we become comfortable treating education as a market commodity for an elite few rather than a collective social good ? <p> The necessary complicating factor here is that language teaching is unlike teaching any other subject . The fundamentals of a language are not simple axioms or building blocks that can be quickly imparted in order to move on to more complex material that builds on them . This misconception ( ingrained especially among many English teachers ) leads to oversimplified teaching materials and woefully inadequate coverage of the basics . But the fundamentals are the most difficult part of learning the language , and mastering them requires that students are given the time and space to practice reading , speaking , and writing . Most of all , language is inherently social and communicative : students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arts and Humanities degree seem more " relevant " and " market-friendly , " English has been made mandatory for every student who can not pass the proficiency test at admission well enough to gain exemption . In my own Faculty , such students must pass a Level 2 exam in English in order to get their degree . But this requirement and the focus on examination results rather than language learning has more counterproductive results than positive ones . In practice , it means only that exams have been watered down to the point of irrelevance . Any student who at least attends classes will pass . And since this is the case , students are also encouraged to see the English course as an onerous bureaucratic requirement , with the classes to be skipped whenever possible . This thoroughly distorts the processes of teaching and learning the language . To truly motivate students to learn , English within the university system must be decoupled from examinations that only signify a formal qualification to which learning is incidental . <p> The Pandemic and Online Learning <p> All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place before the pandemic . The switch to online learning has only exacerbated the problems . Vast numbers of students simply do not have internet access at all , or even for those who can manage some degree of access , usually via smartphones , there are serious technical difficulties in connectivity , accessing the Learning Management System , or following the material during classes , especially where the teaching material and strategies have not been actively adapted to the new context . The rote presentation of oversimplified teaching material -- which has long been the existing approach of English language teaching -- which was already ineffective in person is now thoroughly inadequate . While a given teacher is powerless to solve the larger problem of connectivity for hundreds of students , there are nevertheless still hundreds more who do manage to make it to the online classroom , and deserve a learning experience that is as well-adapted to the circumstances as possible . <p> Of the students who are not exempted from mandatory English classes , by far the largest contingent -- at the University of Colombo alone this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest proficiency level .

It is vital that teachers of English as a Second Language ( ESL ) working with these undergraduate students meet them more than halfway . The teaching materials and methods we had pre-pandemic were already inadequate to the task . Under online teaching conditions , we have to be far more creative in how we revamp these materials , and in how we actually teach day to day . <p> The most commonly-cited theory of successful language learning by adults , held sometimes to be the most " realistic " , is total immersion , which assumes the language being learned is the prevailing one in the student 's context outside the classroom . This is not the case in learning in English in Sri Lanka . It 's tantamount to the discipline throwing in the towel and giving up , saying adult learners will be unsuccessful unless and until they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to learn . <p> The Classroom as a site of Collective , Critical Agency <p> English teachers must start by not infantilising undergraduates . This just allows the English teacher to assume the position of a benevolent figure imparting knowledge , which only further reifies the ugly power dynamic of English in SL . The material should not be an insult to an adult learner 's intelligence or personal/social self . For instance , the lowest proficiency students in my Faculty were at one point directed to read Ladybird books in order to improve their language . While the undergraduates ' level of proficiency in English is low , in order to learn they need texts that can sustain their interest , not texts written for very young children . <p> We must throw away the reductive , formulaic teaching of grammar rules as abstractions , in favour of teaching language as it is actually used , so that students can see grammar doing meaningful work in the sentence and paragraph . <p> We need to draw on students ' own social environment to expose them to English in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflective of common experience , to guide students to name and to give language to that common experience . This is not just a plea to throw in a local element or indigenise the curriculum in a knee-jerk fashion by replacing Paul with Ranjith or Cosgrove Square with Kompanna Veediya . Rather , students must be guided to talk about their own social reality . <p> Language learning involves not just different cognitive processes when compared to learning any other subject , but also a different social dynamic . ESL teachers must recognise and acknowledge this . The English language classroom , whether online or off , has to become a site of collective agency and resistance for students . Since students are told that their lack of English is a powerful and concrete social marker holding them back in life , the drive to learn for students must come from a collective desire to claim power , to transform the isolated scholarship of higher education into a collective , collaborative experience of learning English . Despite the outsize importance that actually learning English holds in the public imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English classroom , particularly in the Arts Faculties , is still largely seen as a forgettable space of no consequence and no results . Both teachers and students must realise the tremendous power and potential that lies in that space . <p> ( The writer is attached to the Department of English Language Teaching , Faculty of Arts , University of Colombo ) <h> Sri Lanka Guardian <p> Get all latest content delivered straight to your inbox . <h> Subscribe Us <h> Random Posts <p> 3/random/post-list <h> LATEST UPDATES <p> 3/feature/post-list <h> ABOUT US <p> The Sri Lanka Guardian is an online web portal founded in August 2007 by a group of concerned Sri Lankan citizens including journalists , activists , academics and retired civil servants.Sri Lanka Guardian has registered as an online newspaper in Government of Sri Lanka .

The Environment Ministry just announced that they will completely ban all lunch sheets in Sri Lanka and the Minister said that we would be the first and only country in the world to ban all lunch sheets . According to him the decision was based due to the global report that Sri Lanka is the world 's fifth largest marine polluter of single use plastics . Do you think this is a step in the right direction ? <p> A. Polyethylene bags , since their emergence in the 1940s , is an incredibly useful , highly convenient , strong and inexpensive , to both customers and businesses as a reliable way to deliver goods from the store to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in our daily life . <p> Despite its user-friendly character , it has a huge negative impact on the global environment and the agricultural sector per se . It is said that about 100 billion shopping bags are issued to consumers every year by supermarket chains and 10 million lunch seats are added to the environment every day . Therefore , I consider that this is a step in right direction . <p> Q. We are amid the Covid pandemic . What is the effect of Covid -19 on plastics and environmental pollution ? <p> A. Plastic products have played significant roles in protecting people during the Covid-19 pandemic . The widespread use of personal protective gear created a massive disruption in the supply chain and waste disposal system . <p> Millions of discarded single-use plastics ( masks , gloves , aprons , and bottles of sanitisers ) have been added to the terrestrial environment and could cause a surge in plastics washing up the ocean coastlines and littering the sea bed . <p> The amount of plastic wastes generated worldwide since the outbreak is estimated at 1.6 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion single-use face masks and face shields are discarded daily as a result of Cobid-19 pandemic , globally . <p> Covid-19 will reverse the momentum of years-long global battle to reduce plastic waste pollution .

What are the adverse effects of inhaling these poisonous gases in the environment into our bodies ? <p> A. Under the provisions of Section 23 W of the National Environmental Act , No. 47 of 1980 , an extraordinary Gazette No. 2034/38 was issued .

In general how does inhaling this toxic material affect us ? Can inhaling this toxic material affect those with breathing difficulties. ? <p> A. Micro plastics have already been discovered in human stool , so we know they pass through our bodies . Similarly , plastic components such as bisphenol A ( BPA ) have been discovered in urine , in samples of human tissue including lungs , meaning they linger in our bodies , not just pass through them . <p> These objects often pass all the way through the digestive tract in 24 to 48 hours and cause no harm . But problems may arise when objects are stuck for a long time , are sharp , are magnetic or contain corrosive materials . <p> Q. How long does plastic remain in our system ? <p> A. Plastic will leave your system after a day since it is small and your body tries to get rid of anything that can not be dissolved or used effectively . But , constantly eating plastic or food that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to avoid . <p> Q. Such as ? <p> A. Toxic chemicals leach out of plastic and are found in the blood and tissue of nearly all of us . Exposure to them is linked to cancers , birth defects , impaired immunity , endocrine disruption and other ailments . <p> Inhaled plastics can produce inflammation and lesions in lungs , and repeated exposure is suspected of leading to respiratory problems like asthma and cancer . Those statistics most likely include some of the effects of plastic . <p> Q. It has been said that there are three worst effects of plastic pollution . What are they ? <p> A. They include ; physical impact on marine life : entanglement , ingestion , starvation . Chemical impact : the buildup of persistent organic pollutants like PCBs , and transport of invasive species and pollutants from polluted rivers to remote areas in the ocean . <p> Q.

In addition , there are incense stocks , hair sprays , disinfectants that pollute the air which is especially dangerous in closed environments . How can we protect ourselves from this toxic indoor air pollution ? Your comments . <p> A. Numerous forms of indoor air pollution are possible in the modern home . Air pollutant levels in the home increase if not enough outdoor air is brought in to dilute emissions from indoor sources and to carry indoor air pollutants out of the home . <p> In addition , high temperature and humidity levels can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed into two groups , biological and chemical . <p> Q. What is the difference ? Are they related ? <p> A. Biological pollutants include bacteria , molds , viruses , animal dander , cat saliva , dust mites , cockroaches , and pollen . These biologic pollutants can be related to some serious health effects . Some biologic pollutants , such as measles , chickenpox , and influenza are transmitted through the air . However , the first two are now preventable with vaccines . <p> Influenza virus transmission , although vaccines have been developed , still remains of concern in crowded indoor conditions and can be affected by ventilation levels in the home . <p> Chemical air pollutants include environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) , also known as ' secondhand smoke ' , is a product of combustion . <p> Q.

Their concerns are parochial and insular : policies relating to religion , culture , rights of minorities and other particular sectarian interests of the communities they represent . <p> Ironically , their voting power could determine the economic policies of the country . The UNF has taken the position that the future of the country rests with the establishment of peace . The Prime Minister has articulated the position that without peace , there is no possibility of solving the economic problems . <p> The enhancement of investment , foreign assistance , provision of job opportunities and the increase in income , he argues , are not possible without peace . Peace , he argues , is possible only with a UNF government . Its economic policies are a continuation of the policies begun in 2001 , as proclaimed in the Regaining Sri Lanka strategy . <p> The UPFA takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war will not be allowed to resume . The economic policies are , however , expected to be different from those of the UNF . The main differences are expected to be in an enhanced welfare orientation with larger expenditures on Samurdhi , health and education . Health expenditure is expected to increase to 2.5 percent of GDP from the current level of less than 2 per cent . <p> Especially significant is a reversal in the PA position on privatisation . The UPFA will halt further privatisation . Specifically the two state banks and several other utilities will not be privatised . The policy of not privatising the state banks , in particular , and halting privatisation in general , could have an important bearing on assistance from the IMF that has insisted on the privatisation of at least one state bank as a condition for assistance . <p> In the event of the UPFA coming into office , it would be interesting to see who would bend - the government or the multilateral agencies . Other public utilities , too , would remain in the state with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises would be dissolved and their assets distributed among people . This is especially so with respect to land still held by the state plantation corporations . <p> The UPFA says it will halt privatisation of health services and private health facilities would be governed by regulations . There is uncertainty on trade policies : especially the continuation of the liberal import policies pursued by the UNF and PA governments since 1994 . <p> Import control policies could have a serious impact on future economic development policies . There is more than a hint that the UPFA would return to an adapted form of import substitution industrialisation with controls on imports of goods that could be produced in the country . Such a policy could face serious constraints , be high cost and would affect the development of competitive capacity . <p> Import substitution industrialisation has to be managed with a great degree of selectivity and discretion that the country 's politicisation does not permit . Several UPFA policies are likely to find favour with the poorer sections of the people , in rural areas and among small farmers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The promise of employment to the unemployed graduates is another popular element in the party manifesto . A basic blemish in the UPFA manifesto is that the costs of the increased expenditure on health , subsidies on fertiliser and agriculture , increased expenditure on health , education and social services , would be an unbearable burden on the public finances . <p> Although the manifesto speaks of decreasing the public debt , it increased significantly during the PA regime and continued to increase in the last two years as well under the UNF . Neither party has proposed any specific measures to bring down the debt . <p> If the security situation deteriorates , higher expenditure on defence is likely to increase the debt and the promises of subsidies and other benefits may not only have to be shelved , but perhaps such concessions have to be reduced from the present levels . <p> There is no concrete way by which the UPFA is expected to increase expenditure on the proposed programmes . There are divergences in the interpretation of these policies by the two main constituent elements , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty about the UPFA 's economic policies . Promises are easy to make but difficult to keep . Being in a financial bind , where tax resources are inadequate for servicing of the debt , defence , public service salaries , pensions and welfare at current levels , there is little scope of providing the relief measures that are being promised . <p> The incumbent government is restrained , as any new promise would have to face up to the question why these were not given during its period in power . The extravagant election promises , if kept , could increase the public debt and strain capital expenditure essential to generate economic growth . <p> Reading the Sandhanaya manifesto in between the lines indicates its likely policy thrust . These UPFA policies are likely to attract less foreign assistance , especially from the multilateral agencies . <p> However , the ultimate economic policies may not be the Utopian ones that are promised . Resource constraints , the policies of the IMF , the World Bank and the WTO , may be the determinants than the promises in the manifestos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a government handles the critical national issue of a durable peace settlement . 
@@33006240 <p> " Be HIV Positive ! Positive about HIV Education , Awareness and Support . We must be Positive about educating ourselves on HIV/AIDS , Positive about creating awareness in our communities , and Positive about supporting all those Living With HIV ( PLHIV ) , so they have access to all the necessary aid , medication and emotional/moral support they need to live a " normal , " healthy life . <p> We developed this campaign which originated from Africa , by Nelson Mandela and made it relevant to Pune . We now have HIV Positive Certified companies and housewives and students boldly wearing t-shirts with HIV Positive emblazoned across their chests in support of HIV/AIDS awareness , " said the fiery and passionate Lankan HIV/AIDS activist Hans Billimoria , who helps coordinate the ' Wake Up Pune ' ( WUP ) Campaign in Pune , India . <p> Having been working in the field of HIV/AIDS 1999 , Hans made quite an impact on young change agents from across the country , who attended R.E.A.C.H ' 08 ( Rise for Equality , Act for Change and Hope ) -- the First National Youth Conference on HIV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker , last week . Having completed his BA in Philosophy at the Madras Christian College in India , and his MPhil in Philosophy at the University of Dundee in Scotland , Hans has been working at a non-profit organisation named Deep Griha Society ( DGS ) in Pune , as an HIV/AIDS activist and coordinator . <p> WUP was started as an awareness campaign by DGS , and now runs completely as a civil society movement , essentially involving youth , with the support of NGO 's , corporates , schools , colleges and universities , said Hans . Before leaving for Scotland , Hans was working for DGS in 2002 and having researched a group of 30,000 people and having identified 40 PLHIV in their midst , submitted a request for funds for a HIV/AIDS Prevention Programme from an INGO working in the field at the time . Their request was refused at the time as the INGO did n't think the problem at the time was significant enough to allocate funds for . <p> Thereafter , Hans left for Scotland and fundraised for the programme whilst studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary funds via the Church of Scotland HIV/AIDS Project , as they strongly believed that it was time to arrest/ mitigate the problem before it became an epidemic in the community . When he returned in 2005 to start on the programme , only nine of the initially identified 40 PLHIV were still alive ! If we had got the funds in 2002 and were able to carry out an awareness cum prevention programme then , it would have been a completely different story , he said adamantly . After returning to Pune in 2005 , he spearheaded the WUP campaign , essentially as most people had the notion that they could n't be affected by HIV and that it was only the problem of targeted high risk groups such as truck drivers , drug users , sex workers etc. , he said . " The middle classes can be quite complacent about their probability of contracting the disease too and what 's worse , a majority of the stigma created around HIV/AIDS is also at the hands of this very group . This is why WUP is essentially about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone . We have something called a Bottom Line : If you do n't know how HIV 's transmitted , no matter who you are , or where you come from , you are at risk , " emphasised Hans . <p> A Wake Up Pune mall event <p> " In India , this problem has arisen mostly amidst young college girls , as even though most of them are sexually active , they also want to preserve their virginity till they 're married , so they practice unconventional forms of intercourse , so as to keep their virginity intact and avoid pregnancy . However , the problem is as a result of them practicing unprotected sex , as they 're assured of not getting pregnant , it is not the only thing they need to be protected from . This is where education and awareness are vital . The longer we as a community deny the existence of pre-marital sex , the higher the risk of Sri Lanka following in the footsteps of its neighbour , " elaborated Hans . <p> WUP progressively expanded by involving the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way a NGO can work in isolation , especially with regards to an issue such as this , he added . Even in Sri Lanka , it 's imperative that everyone comes together at the grass-root , village , town and city levels . In comparison to India , it seems as though HIV/AIDS prevalence is still relatively low , but , it 's difficult to make an accurate assessment as there could be numerous PLHIV who have yet to come forward , adds Hans . <p> " I believe strongly that " Stigma Kills . " It 's not the lack of access to medication , information or resources that kill most PLHIV , it 's being ostracised and condemned by their families and society that does it ! " Once , a mother locked her HIV Positive daughter in a back room , cut a hole in the bottom of the door and fed her through it like a dog . A bank manager dropped off his wife at our centre and never sighted the place again . Upon her death , when we called him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT supposedly " uneducated " people . This is why WUP harps so much on " normalising " HIV/AIDS orphans and all conversation surrounding it . How can PLHIV look so normal , you might ask ? But , that 's the reality . They are normal . The portrayal of HIV/AIDS orphans sent out to the world from Africa , to raise funds does tremendous damage to the field . <p> Returning to Sri Lanka next year once his contract with DGS expires , Hans hopes to share the WUP experience with Lankan youth ( www.wakeuppune.org ) , show how to organise the business community and others to get involved , and mobilise youth to take on this project and carry it out no matter where they reside . NGO 's merely getting on the band wagon of this multi- billion dollar industry is not going to solve a thing , as little or nothing goes down to the grass roots . Like at the Youth Conference last week , Hans hopes to organise Training of Trainers ( TOT ) programmes in the regions , where he 'll share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's transmitted and how it 's not , prevention methods and symptoms etc. , " It was evident from the feedback after the conference that HIV related knowledge was not freely available here . We need to start addressing issues such as sexual reproductive health , LGBTQ issues , drug use and the likes and start making them normal to discuss and not scary ! " Unless the ' Stigma Chakra ' of Silence -- Ignorance -- Fear -- Stigma -- Discrimination -- Silence ... is shattered , fear will continue to exist and stigma will continue to thrive , resulting in PLHIV meeting needless and untimely deaths , " highlighted Hans . <p> Hans shares with a heavy heart , " I 've lost many friends to AIDS in a time where people can easily " live " with HIV . In a time , where the World Health Organisation has reclassified HIV as a chronic condition like diabetes ; not fatal ! If AIDS is in fact a chronic condition like diabetes , why do people die every single day of HIV related illnesses ? "

Khan <p> Tajuddin Ahmad 's 96th birthday falls on 23rd July 2021 , whereas he is one the most far-famed politicians to delimitate our glorious past history . In fact , he was an uppercase statesman of international stature . During our glorious Liberation War with the barbarous Pakistan 's military establishment in 1971 to set up Bangladesh , he was our first Premier . He was born on 23rd July 1925 in a remote hamlet of Bangladesh 's soil . Despite his extraordinary human attributes , he always kept a very low profile in his politics and in life time . He still remains an unsung hero in our history which is very sad for a nation like us . <p> We have forgotten to remember this noble soul with due honour . Noted educationist and diplomat Prof Dr. Khan Sarwar Murshid once said , " Disremembering is equivalent to perfidy . " I was then a college student , but when I still close my eyes , I can clearly remember his handsome and bright face when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 just before the national elections of the-then Pakistan at my maternal grandfather 's house at Maison Mia Bari , Kapasia under the Gazipur District , Bangladesh . When I talked to him , I found Tajuddin Ahmad was a man pure in heart and that he owned till his brutal murder in 1975 . <p> Every aspect of his life is a jewel of intellectual prowess , silver-tongued , decent and a politician of perfect refinement with deep patriotism . It is an essential reading on Tajuddin for anyone interested in the struggle for establishing an independent and sovereign state in Bangladesh when Bangabandhu was languishing in Pakistan 's jail . No one will ever know what went through Tajuddind 's mind unless you are familiar with his magnificent character and the very difficult jobs that he did throughout his life , especially during our glorious Liberation War of 1971 to establish Bangladesh , and all the superlatives in the world will never be compensation for his loss in the wee hours of 3rd November 1975 . <p> Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart . Such is the moment ; I am presently experiencing because of absence of Tajuddin Ahmad in the realm of Bangladesh 's politics . I experience this high and saddest moment not for myself alone but for those people who have moved so courageously against the ramparts of injustice and who in the process have acquired a new estimate of their own human worth . <p> It is because of leadership like Tajuddin , people were all united , in absence of Bangabandhu in the country during our glorious Liberation War in 1971 , in the quiet conviction that it was better to suffer in dignity than to accept lives in humiliation . He is the real hero of our freedom struggle ; and a noble-spirited politician for whom we can boast of . <p> We may recall the sorrow that Tajuddin Ahmad and his colleagues endured watching them only died on the gun bullets and bayonet charges in the Dhaka Central Jail by some hooligan junior army officers of Bangladesh Army . We unite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other brilliant compatriots , asking for the grace and strength to endure them for the sake of Bangladesh . We ask to pray so that we may look forward to the joy that comes from remaining faithful witnesses to Tajuddin like honest and patriotic politicians . <p> If we are to survive today , our moral and spiritual lag must be eliminated . Enlarged material powers spell enlarged peril if there is not proportionate growth of the soul . When the " without " of man 's nature subjugates the " within " , dark storm clouds begin to form in the world . So , we strongly feel the absence of Tajuddin Ahmad in Bangladesh . <p> Any student of history should not be surprised . Oppressed people can not remain oppressed forever . The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself . The Bible tells the thrilling story of how Moses stood in Pharaoh 's court centuries ago and cried , " Let my people go . " This is a kind of opening chapter in a continuing story . <p> The present struggle in Bangladesh is a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded the Bengalis of their birthright of freedom , and something without has reminded them that it can be gained . We had been caught up by the Bengali Nationalist Movement , and with our people , we were moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of justice i.e. Bangladesh in 1971 . Fortunately , some significant strides have been made in the struggle to end the long night of injustice by the Pakistan 's rulers ' domination on us . <p> We have seen the magnificent drama of independence unfolded in Bangladesh in 1971 under the able and dynamic leadership of Tajuddin and his pals . It came as a bright interlude in the long and sometimes turbulent struggle for our due rights : and the beginning of an emancipation of proclamation is providing a comprehensive legal basis for equality of opportunity in establishing Bangladesh . <p> What the main spirits of Bangladesh 's Liberation of 1971 are saying is that the demand for dignity , equality , jobs , and citizenship will not be abandoned or diluted or postponed . If that means resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be cowed . We are no longer afraid . The word that symbolises the spirit and the outward form of our encounter is politics , and it is doubtless that factor which made it seem appropriate to award a peace prize to one identified with struggle . <p> Broadly speaking , our struggle has meant not only relying on arms and weapons of struggle . It has meant noncooperation with customs and laws which are institutional aspects of a regime of discrimination and enslavement . It has meant direct participation of masses in protest , rather than reliance on indirect methods which frequently do not involve masses in action at all . Tajuddin Ahmad has stood like a solid rock to uphold these principles . <p> Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day . As Arnold Toynbee says , " Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil . Therefore , the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent by the ever-rising tides of evils perpetrated by the Pakistan 's hellish sawyers on the land of Bangladesh for more than two decades . <p> The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are developing a new sense of " some-bodiness " and carving a tunnel of hope through the dark hill of despair . " The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light . " Here and there an individual or group dares to love , and rises to the majestic heights of moral maturity . So , in a real sense , this is a great time to be alive . <p> When we lose someone we love , it seems that time stands stiff . Those we love and lose are together with us in our heart forever in memory . What we shared will never die . It lives in our hearts , bringing strength and comfort while we are apart . With profound grief and sorrow , we regret the sad and brutal murder of our beloved leader , Tajuddin Ahmad . His departure has left a void that can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but our tears are seldom gone .

A strong soldier and an exceptionally exemplary human being , adoring politician , devoted leader , our dearest man of history , he lived a glorious life always putting others before himself . Today , we miss his grand presence deeply and sorrowfully . No one can replace his presence and we will live by the memories and the values that he gave us in his life time .

@@33105235 <h> Time to resuscitate the vanished radical legacy <p> Today in Europe , we are not dealing with three positions -- populist right , liberal center , left -- within the same universal political arch which reaches from the right to the left : each of the three positions implies its own vision of the universal political space . <p> by Slavoj Zizek <p> The rise of rightist populism across Eastern Europe has formed what I call a new axis of evil -- and it needs to be confronted and defeated . <p> Thirty-two years after the fall of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe , nationalist conservative populism is returning there with a vengeance : the recent turn of Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and some other post-socialist countries -- I call them a new axis of evil -- into a conservative-illiberal direction worries us all . How could have things turned so wrong ? Maybe , we are paying the price now for something that vanished from our view after socialism was replaced by capitalist democracy . What vanished was not socialism but things that mediated the passage from socialism to capitalist democracy . <p> " Vanishing mediator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designates a specific feature in the process of a passage from the old order to a new order : when the old order is disintegrating , unexpected things happen , not just horrors mentioned by Gramsci but also bright utopian projects and practices . Once the new order is established , a new narrative arises and , within this new ideological space , mediators disappear from view . <p> Here is an example . In his Immaterialism , Graham Harman quotes a perspicuous remark on the 1960s : " You have to remember that the 1960s really happened in the 1970s . " His comment : " An object somehow exists ' even more ' in the stage following its initial heyday . The marijuana smoking , free love , and internal violence of the dramatic American 1960s were in some ways even better exemplified by the campy and tasteless 1970s . " <p> If , however , one takes a closer look at the passage from the 1960s to the 1970s , one can easily see the key difference : in the 1960s , the spirit of permissiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a utopian political protest movement , while in the 1970s , this spirit was deprived of its political content and fully integrated into the hegemonic culture and ideology . Although one should definitely raise the question of the limitation of the spirit of the 1960s which rendered this integration so easy , the repression of the political dimension remains a key feature of the popular culture of the 1970s . This dimension was the " vanishing mediator " which later disappeared from view . <p> The reason I mention all this is that the passage to capitalism in East European socialist countries was also not a direct transition : between the Socialist order and the new order , liberal-capitalist and/or nationalist-conservative , there were many vanishing mediators the new power was trying to erase from memory . I witnessed this process when Yugoslavia fell apart . To avoid any misunderstanding , I have no nostalgia for Yugoslavia : the war that ravaged it from 1991 to 1995 was its truth , the moment when all antagonisms of the Yugoslav project exploded . Yugoslavia died in 1985 when Slobodan Milosevic came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it working . <p> In the last years of Yugoslavia , communists in power knew they were lost , so they desperately tried to find a way to survive as a political force during the passage to democracy . Some did it by mobilizing nationalist passions , others tolerated and even supported new democratic processes . In Slovenia , communists in power showed understanding for punk music , including Laibach , and for the gay movement ... ( Incidentally , they financed a gay periodical and after the free elections , this money was canceled -- the newly elected conservative city council of Ljubljana judged that being gay is not a culture but a way of life which does n't need to be supported . ) <p> At a more general level , when people protested against the communist regimes in Eastern Europe , what the large majority had in mind was not capitalism . They wanted social security , solidarity , a rough kind of justice ; they wanted the freedom to live their lives outside of state control , to come together and talk as they pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liberated from primitive ideological indoctrination and the prevailing cynical hypocrisy ... in short , the vague ideals that led the protesters were , to a large extent , taken from socialist ideology itself . And , as we learned from Sigmund Freud , what is repressed returns in a distorted form . In Europe , the socialism repressed in the dissident imaginary returned in the guise of right-wing populism . <p> Although , as to their positive content , the communist regimes were a failure , they at the same time opened up a certain space , the space of utopian expectations which , among other things , enabled us to measure the failure of the really existing socialism itself . When dissidents like Vaclav Havel denounced the existing Communist regime on behalf of authentic human solidarity , they ( unknowingly , for the most part of it ) spoke from the place opened up by communism itself -- which is why they tend to be so disappointed when the " really existing capitalism " does not meet the high expectations of their anti-Communist struggle . <p> At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Michnik for being a doubly successful capitalist ( he helped destroy socialism , plus he heads a highly profitable publishing empire ) ; deeply embarrassed , Michnik replied : " I am not a capitalist ; I am a socialist who is unable to forgive socialism that it did not work . " <p> Why mention these vanishing mediators today ? In his interpretation of the fall of East European communism , Jurgen Habermas proved to be the ultimate left Fukuyamist , silently accepting that the existing liberal-democratic order is the best one possible , and that , while we should strive to make it more just , we should not challenge its basic premises . <p> This is why he welcomed precisely what many leftists saw as the big deficiency of the anti-communist protests in Eastern Europe : the fact that these protests were not motivated by any new visions of the post-communist future . As he put it , the central and eastern European revolutions were just " rectifying " or " catch-up " ( nachholende ) revolutions ; their aim being to enable those societies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , to return to the West European normality . <p> However , the " gilets jaunes " protests in Spain and other similar protests today are definitely NOT catch-up movements . They embody the weird reversal that characterizes today 's global situation . The old antagonism between " ordinary people " and financial-capitalist elites is back with a vengeance , with " ordinary people " erupting in protest against the elites , who are accused of being blind to their suffering and demands . <p> However , what is new is that the populist Right has proved to be much more adept in channeling these eruptions in its direction than the Left . Alain Badiou was thus fully justified to say apropos the gilets jaunes : " Tout ce qui bouge n'est pas rouge " -- all that moves ( makes unrest ) is not red . Today 's populist Right participates in a long tradition of popular protests which were predominantly leftist . <p> Here , then , is the paradox we have to confront : the populist disappointment at liberal democracy is proof that 1989 was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the liberal-capitalist normality . Freud spoke about Unbehagen in der Kultur , the discontent or unease in culture ; today , 30 years after the fall of the Wall , the ongoing new wave of protests bears witness of a kind of Unbehagen in liberal capitalism , and the key question is : who will articulate this discontent ? Will it be left to nationalist populists to exploit it ? Therein resides the big task of the left . This discontent is not something new . I 've written about it more than 30 years ago in " Eastern Europe 's Republics of Gilead " ( a reference to The Handmaid 's Tale ) , which was published in New Left Review back in 1990 - may I quote myself ? : <p> " The dark side of the processes current in Eastern Europe is thus the gradual retreat of the liberal-democratic tendency in the face of the growth of corporate national populism with all its usual elements , from xenophobia to anti-Semitism . The swiftness of this process has been surprising : today , we find anti-Semitism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food , and to Vietnamese the lack of bicycles ) and in Hungary and in Romania ( where the persecution of the Hungarian minority also continues ) . Even in Poland we can perceive signs of a split within Solidarity : the rise of a nationalist-populist faction that imputes to the ' cosmopolitan intellectual ' ( the old regime 's codeword for Jews ) the failure of the recent government 's measures . " <p> This dark side is now re-emerging forcefully , and its effects are felt in the rightist rewriting of history : first , the socialist aspect of the struggle against communism ( remember that Solidarnosc was a workers trade union ! ) disappears , and then even the liberal aspect disappears so that a new story emerges in which the only true opposition is the one between communist legacy and the Christian-national legacy -- or , as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban put it : " There are no liberals , only communists with university degrees . " <p> On July 7 , 2021 , Orban bought a page in the Austrian daily Die Presse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were : Brussels ' bureaucracy acts as a " superstate " which only protects its own ideological and institutional goals -- nobody authorized Brussels to do it . We should renounce the goal of greater unity because the coming decade will bring new challenges and dangers , and Europeans need to be protected from " massive migrations and pandemics . " <p> This couple is a false one : immigrants and pandemic did n't invade us from outside , for both we are responsible . Without the US intervention in Iraq etc. , there would have been much fewer immigrants ; without global capitalism , there would have been no pandemic ; plus it is precisely immigrant crises and pandemics which necessitate stronger European unity . <p> The new rightist populism aims at destroying the European emancipatory legacy : its Europe is a Europe of nation-states bent on preserving their particular identity -- when a couple of years ago , Steve Bannon visited France , he finished a speech there with : " America first , vive la France ! " Vive la France , viva Italia , long live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should put all our forces into resuscitating liberal democracy ? No : in some sense Orban is right , the rise of new populism is a symptom of what was wrong with the liberal-democratic capitalism which was praised by Francis Fukuyama as the end of history ( Fukuyama now supports Bernie Sanders ) . In order to save what is worth saving in liberal democracy , we have to move to the left , to what Orban and his companions perceive as " communism . " How can this be ? <p> Today in Europe , we are not dealing with three positions -- populist right , liberal center , left -- within the same universal political arch which reaches from the right to the left : each of the three positions implies its own vision of the universal political space . For a liberal , left and right are the two extremes that threaten our freedoms ; if any of them predominates , authoritarianism wins -- that 's why European liberals see in what Orban is now doing in Hungary ( his fierce anti-communism ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . <p> For the left , rightist populism is , of course , worse than tolerant liberalism , but it perceives the rise of rightist populism as a symptom of what went wrong in liberalism , so if we want to get rid of rightist populism , we should radically change liberal capitalism itself which is now morphing into neo-feudal corporate rule . The new populist right exploits the fully justified complaints of ordinary people against the reign of big corporations and banks which cover up their ruthless exploitation , domination , and new forms of control over our lives with fake politically correct justice . <p> For the new populist right , multiculturalism , MeToo , LGBT+ , etc. , are just a continuation of communist totalitarianism , sometimes worse than communism itself -- Brussels is the center of " cultural Marxism . " The alt-right obsession with cultural Marxism signals its rejection to confront the fact that the phenomena they criticize as the effects of the cultural Marxist plot ( moral degradation , sexual promiscuity , consumerist hedonism , etc. ) are the outcome of the immanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism ( 1976 ) , Daniel Bell described how the unbounded drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundations of the original Protestant ethic that ushered in capitalism itself . In a new afterword , Bell offers a bracing perspective on contemporary Western society , from the end of the Cold War to the rise and fall of postmodernism , revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the 21st century continues . <p> The turn towards culture as a key component of capitalist reproduction , and , concomitant to it , the commodification of cultural life itself , enables capital 's expanded reproduction . Just think about today 's explosion of art biennales ( Venice , Kassel ... ) : although they usually present themselves as a form of resistance towards global capitalism and its commodification of everything , they are , in their mode of organization , the ultimate form of art as a moment of capitalist self-reproduction . <p> Now we see why we should remember vanishing mediators : today the global capitalist order is approaching a crisis again , and the vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zizek is a cultural philosopher .

Giroux <p> On Monday August 6 , 1945 , the United States unleashed an atomic bomb on Hiroshima killing 140,000 people instantly . 70% of the city was destroyed . A few days later on August 9th , another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki killing an estimated 70,000 people. 2 The Japanese government stated that the death toll was much higher than the American estimates , indicating that it was close to a half million . Many died not only because of lack of medical help , but also from radioactive rain . In the immediate aftermath , the incineration of mostly innocent civilians was buried in official government pronouncements about the victory of the bombings of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

Also applauded was the power of the bomb and the wonder of science in creating it , especially " the atmosphere of technological fanaticism " in which scientists worked to create the most powerful weapon of destruction then known to the world. 4 Conventional justification for dropping the atomic bombs held that " it was the most expedient measure to securing Japan 's surrender and that the bomb was used to shorten the agony of war and to save American lives . " 5Left out of that succinct legitimating narrative were the growing objections to the use of atomic weaponry put forth by a number of top military leaders and politicians , including General Dwight Eisenhower , who was then the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom argued it was not necessary to end the war . 6 A position later proven to be correct . <p> For a brief time , the Atom Bomb was celebrated as a kind of magic talisman entwining salvation and scientific inventiveness and in doing so functioned to " simultaneously domesticate the unimaginable while charging the mundane surroundings of our everyday lives with a weight and sense of importance unmatched in modern times . " 7 In spite of the initial celebration of the effects of the bomb and the orthodox defense that accompanied it , whatever positive value the bomb may have had among the American public , intellectuals , and popular media began to dissipate as more and more people became aware of the massive deaths along with suffering and misery it caused. 8 <p> Kenzaburo Oe , the Nobel Prize winner for Literature , noted that in spite of attempts to justify the bombing " from the instant the atomic bomb exploded , it soon became the symbol of human evil , embodying the absolute evil of war .

The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki forecasted a new industrially enabled kind of violence and warfare in which the distinction between soldiers and civilians disappeared and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians was normalized . But more than this , the American government exhibited a ' total embrace of the atom bomb , " that signalled support for the first time of a " notion of unbounded annihilation and " the totality of destruction .

" 12 The destructive power of the bomb and its use on civilians also marked a turning point in American self-identity in which the United States began to think of itself as a superpower , which as Robert Jay . Lifton points out refers to " a national mindset -- put forward strongly by a tight-knit leadership group -- that takes on a sense of omnipotence , of unique standing in the world that grants it the right to hold sway over all other nations . " 13 The power of the scientific imagination and its murderous deployment gave birth simultaneously to the American disimagination machine with its capacity to rewrite history in order to render it an irrelevant relic best forgotten . <p> What remains particularly ghastly about the rationale for dropping two atomic bombs was the attempt on the part of its defenders to construct a redemptive narrative through a perversion of humanistic commitment , of mass slaughter justified in the name of saving lives and winning the war. 14 This was a humanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of what Edmund Wilson called the Faustian possibility of a grotesque " plague and annihilation . " 15 In part , Hiroshima and Nagasaki represented the achieved transcendence of military metaphysics now a defining feature of national identity , its more poisonous and powerful investment in the cult of scientism , instrumental rationality , and technological fanaticism -- and the simultaneous marginalization of scientific evidence and intellectual rigour , even reason itself . That Hiroshima , in particular , was used to redefine America 's " national mission and its utopian possibilities " 16 was nothing short of what the late historian Howard Zinn called a " devastating commentary on our moral culture . " 17 More pointedly it serves as a grim commentary on our national insanity , which became more exacerbated over time , reaching a culmination to a form of fascist politics under the Trump administration . In most of these cases , matters of morality and justice were dissolved into technical questions and reductive chauvinism relating matters of governmentally massaged efficiency , scientific " expertise " , and American exceptionalism . As Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was symbolic of the power of post-war America rather than a " ruthless weapon of indiscriminate destruction " which conveniently put to rest painful questions concerning justice , morality , and ethical responsibility. 18 <p> This narrative of redemption was soon challenged by a number of historians who argued that the dropping of the atom bomb had less to do with winning the war than with an attempt to put pressure on the Soviet Union to not expand their empire into territory deemed essential to American interests. 19 Protecting America 's superiority in a potential Soviet-American conflict was a decisive factor in dropping the bomb . In addition , the Truman administration needed to provide legitimation to Congress for the staggering sums of money spent on the Manhattan Project in developing the atomic weapons program and for procuring future funding necessary to continue military appropriations for ongoing research long after the war ended. 20 The late Howard Zinn went even further asserting that the government 's weak defense for the bombing of Hiroshima was not only false but was complicitous with an act of terrorism . Refusing to relinquish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he writes " Can we ... comprehend the killing of 200,000 people to make a point about American power ? " 21 Other historians also attempted to deflate this official defense of Hiroshima by providing counter-evidence that the Japanese were ready to surrender as a result of a number of factors including the nonstop bombing of 26 cities before Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the success of the naval and military blockade of Japan , and the Soviet 's entrance into the war on August 9th. 22 <p> Employing a weapon of mad violence against the Japanese people , the US government imagined Japan as the ultimate enemy , and then pursued tactics that blinded the American public to its own humanity and in doing so became its own worst enemy by turning against its most cherished democratic principles . In a sense , this self-imposed sightlessness functioned as part of what Jacques Derrida once called a societal autoimmune response , one in which the body 's immune system attacked its own bodily defenses. 23 Fortunately , this state of political and moral blindness did not extend to a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the dropping of the atomic bombs and the beginning of the nuclear age . <p> In the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima , there was a major debate not just about how the emergence of the atomic age and the moral , economic , scientific , military , and political forced that gave rise to it but also the ways in which the embrace of the atomic age altered the emerging nature of state power , gave rise to new forms of militarism , put American lives at risk , created environmental hazards , produced an emergent surveillance state , furthered the politics of state secrecy , and put into play a series of deadly diplomatic crisis , reinforced by the logic of brinkmanship and a belief in the totality of war. 24 <p> Hiroshima not only unleashed immense misery , unimaginable suffering , and wanton death on Japanese civilians , it also gave rise to anti-democratic tendencies in the United States government that put the health , safety , and liberty of the American people at risk . Shrouded in secrecy , the government machinery of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most grotesque effects of the bomb on the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but also the dangerous hazards it posed to the American people . Lifton and Mitchell argue convincingly that if the development of the bomb and its immediate effects were shrouded in concealment by the government that before long concealment developed into a cover up marked by government lies and the falsification of information. 25 With respect to the horrors visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki , films taken by Japanese and American photographers were hidden for years from the American public for fear that they would create both a moral panic and a backlash against the funding for nuclear weapons. 26 For example , the Atomic Energy Commission lied about the extent and danger of radiation fallout going so far as to mount a campaign claiming that " fallout does not constitute a serious hazard to any living thing outside the test site . " 27 This act of falsification took place in spite of the fact that thousands of military personal were exposed to high levels of radiation within and outside of the test sites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Departments of Defense , Department of Veterans ' Affairs , the Central Intelligence Agency , and other government departments engaged in a series of medical experiments designed to test the effects of different levels radiation exposure on military personal , medical patients , prisoners , and others in various sites . According to Lifton and Mitchell , these experiments took the shape of exposing people intentionally to " radiation releases or by placing military personnel at or near ground zero of bomb tests . " 28 It gets worse . They also note that " from 1945 through 1947 , bomb-grade plutonium injections were given to thirty-one patients in a variety of hospitals and medical centers and that all of these " experiments were shrouded in secrecy and , when deemed necessary , in lies .... the experiments were intended to show what type or amount of exposure would cause damage to normal , healthy people in a nuclear war . " 29 Some of the long lasting legacies of the birth of the atomic bomb also included the rise of plutonium dumps , environmental and health risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaceful development technology to a large scale interest in using technology for the organized production of violence . Another notable development raised by many critics in the years following the launch of the atomic age was the rise of a government mired in secrecy , the repression of dissent , and the legitimation for a type of civic illiteracy in which Americans were told to leave " the gravest problems , military and social , completely in the hands of experts and political leaders who claimed to have them under control . " 30 <p> All of these anti-democratic tendencies unleashed by the atomic age came under scrutiny during the latter half of the twentieth century . The terror of a nuclear holocaust , an intense sense of alienation from the commanding institutions of power , and deep anxiety about the demise of the future spawned growing unrest , ideological dissent , and massive outbursts of resistance among students and intellectuals all over the globe from the sixties until the beginning of the twenty-first century calling for the outlawing of militarism , nuclear production and stockpiling , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kurt Vonnegut , Jr . condemned the death-saturated machinery launched by the atomic age . Moreover , public intellectuals from Dwight Macdonald and Bertrand Russell to Helen Caldicott , Ronald Takaki , Noam Chomsky , and Howard Zinn , fanned the flames of resistance to both the nuclear arms race and weapons as well as the development of nuclear technologies . <p> In the United States , the mushroom cloud connected to Hiroshima is now connected to much larger forces of destruction , including a turn to instrumental reason over moral considerations , the normalization of violence in America , the militarization of local police forces , an attack on civil liberties , the rise of the surveillance state , a dangerous turn towards authoritarianism , embodied in the fascist politics unleashed by Trump and his supine , dangerous allies . Rather than stand in opposition to preventing a nuclear mishap or the expansion of the arms industry , the United States places high up on the list of those nations that could trigger what Amy Goodman calls that " horrible moment when hubris , accident or inhumanity triggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lies , deceptions , falsifications , and retreat into secrecy that characterizes the American government 's strangulating hold by the **32;0;TOOLONG complex , it would be na ? ve to assume that the U.S. government can be trusted to act with good intentions when it comes to matters of domestic and foreign policy . Of course , matters of trust , decency , and a respect for democracy evaporated under the former Trump administration . State terrorism and an embrace of violence as a national ideal has increasingly become the DNA of American governance and politics and is evident in government cover ups , corruption , and numerous acts of bad faith . Secrecy , lies , and deception have a long history in the United States and the issue is not merely to uncover such instances of state deception but to connect the dots over time and to map the connections , for instance , between the actions of the NSA in the early aftermath of the attempts to cover up the inhumane destruction unleashed by the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the role the NSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about government policies while embracing an all-compassing notion of surveillance and squelching of civil liberties , privacy , and freedom . Militarism now pervades every aspect of society , language has become weaponized , state racism has been turned into a tool of political opportunism , and the Republican Party amounts to a criminal organization inflicting lies , conspiracy theories , voter suppression laws , and a denial of science and public health in the midst of a crisis , amounting to untold numbers of death . <p> Hiroshima symbolized and continues to remind us of the fact that the United States commits unspeakable acts of violence making it easier to refuse to rely on politicians , academics , and alleged experts who refuse to support a politics of transparency and serve mostly to legitimate anti-democratic , if not totalitarian policies . Questioning a monstrous war machine whose roots lie in Hiroshima and the gangster capitalism that benefits from it is the first step in declaring nuclear weapons unacceptable ethically and politically . This suggests a further mode of inquiry that focuses on how the rise of the military-industrial complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn by tracing it roots to the development and use of the atom bomb . Moreover , it raises questions about the role played by intellectuals both in an out of the academy in conspiring to build the bomb and hide its effects from the American people ? These are only some of the questions that need to be made visible , interrogated , and pursued in a variety of sites and public forums . <p> One crucial issue today is what role might intellectuals , cultural critics , journalists , and others who trade in lifting ideas into the public realm play in making clear the educative nature of politics ? How might reviving the public imagination function as part of a sustained pedagogical effort to resurrect the memory of Hiroshima as both a warning and a signpost for rethinking the nature of collective struggle , reclaiming the ideals and promises a radical democracy , and producing a sustained politics and act of collective resistance aimed at abolishing nuclear weapons forever ? One issue would be to revisit the conditions that made Hiroshima and Nagasaki possible , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the star of scientific rationality . Another step forward would be to make clear what the effects of such weapons are , to disclose the manufactured lie that such weapons make us safe . Indeed , this suggests the need for intellectuals , artists , and other cultural workers to use their skills , resources , and connections to develop massive educational campaigns that make clear both the danger of nuclear war a society armed to the teeth . <p> Such campaigns not only make education , consciousness , and collective struggle the center of politics , but also systemically work to both inform the public about the history of such weapons , the misery and suffering they have caused , and how they benefit the financial , government , and corporate elite who make huge amounts of money off the arms race and the promotion of nuclear deterrence and the need for a permanent warfare state . Intellectuals today appear numbed by ever developing disasters , statistics of suffering and death , the Hollywood disimagination machine with its investment in celluloid Apocalypses for which only superheroes can respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplores collective political and ethical responsibility . In an age when violence turns into a spectacle , mass shootings become normalized , and violence becomes the primary language of politics , it becomes all the more difficult and yet necessary to remember the horror and legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . <p> There are no rationales or escapes from the responsibility of preventing mass destruction due to nuclear annihilation ; the appeal to military necessity is no excuse for the indiscriminate bombing of civilians whether in Hiroshima or Yemen . The sense of horror , fear , doubt , anxiety , and powerless that followed Hiroshima and Nagasaki up until the beginning of the 21st century seems to have faded in light of the rise of a form of gangster capitalism that embraces white nationalism , white supremacy , the Hollywood apocalypse machine , the mindlessness of consumer cultures , the growing spectacles of violence , and a militarism that is now celebrated as one of the highest ideals of American life . In a society governed by militarism , consumerism , and neoliberal savagery , it has become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to believe that democracy matters and is worth fighting for , to imagine a future in which responding to the suffering of others is a central element of democratic life . When historical memory fades and people turn inward , remove themselves from politics , and embrace cynicism over educated hope , a culture of evil , suffering , and existential despair . Americans now life amid a culture of indifference sustained by an endless series of manufactured catastrophes that offer a source of entertainment , sensation , and instant pleasure . <p> We live in an age in which violence becomes a form of entertainment rather than a source of alarm , individuals increasingly are too numb to question society , and become incapable of translating private troubles into larger public considerations . In the age following the use of the atom bomb on civilians , talk about evil , militarism , and the end of the world once stirred public debate and diverse resistance movements , now it promotes a culture of fear , moral panics , and a retreat into the black hole of the disimagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 and the failure of gangster capitalism to address the COVID-19 crisis , it is clear that gangster capitalism can not provide a vision to sustain radical democratic society and works largely to destroy it . <p> The horror Hiroshima and Nagasaki speak to what James Baldwin once called the " tension between hope and terror . " Hope in the absence of moral witnessing and a culture of immediacy that hawks support for conditions-environmental , economic , social , and cultural-that embrace rather than reject the incessant drive toward the apocalypse appears meaningless . Gangster capitalism has become a metaphor for the recurring atomic blast , a social , political , and moral embodiment of global destruction that needs to be stopped before it is too late . Returning to the memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not only necessary to break out of the moral cocoon that puts reason and memory to sleep but also to rediscover both our imaginative capacities for civic literacy on behalf of the public good , especially if such action demands that we remember as Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell remark " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with , if not sanction from , the violence of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . " 32 <p> Manufactured catastrophes and historical amnesia -- and with them a generalized sense of manufactured helplessness -- now reign supreme in the new interregnum of late modernity , a kind of liminal space that serves to neutralize action , derail the challenges posed by real social and political problems such as the threat of nuclear annihilation , and substitute the escape into fantasy for any attempt to challenge the terrifying conditions that often accompany a serious crisis . Such retreats from reality blunt civic courage , dull the radical imagination , and dilute any sense of moral responsibility , plunging historical acts of violence such as Hiroshima into the abyss of political indifference , ethical insensitivity , and depoliticization . Catastrophe , as Brad Evans has observed , speaks to an era of late modernity marked by " a closing of the political . " 33 Resignation and acceptance of catastrophe has taken root in the ground prepared by the neoliberal notion that " nothing can be done . " <p> If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to address what exactly needs to be done , then what has been lost in the age of catastrophe and historical amnesia and its overwhelming sense of precarity and uncertainty is a properly political response in the face of a pending or existing disaster . In the age of Trump , history has become a curse , and dissent is now viewed as dangerous , reminders of the horrors of injustice , the collapse of conscience , and willingness of too many to look away . The future will look much brighter and new forms of collective resistance will emerge , in part , with the recognition that the legacy of violence , death and cruelty that extends from Hiroshima to the current tsunami of violence being waged on immigrants , people of color , and peaceful protesters makes clear that no one can be a bystander if democracy is to survive . <p> Notes . <p> 1 I have drawn in this essay upon some some previous ideas of mine published on the seventieth anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

From time to time , villagers saw Senevirathna and Piyarathna dressed in white national suit walking across the village to the main road in order to get a bus ; they were going for job interviews . They carried out this journey many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s . <p> In between job interviews , both Senevirathna and Piyarathna had nothing to do at home ; they slept throughout the day . Whenever a neighbour or a relative visited their home , they often found both of them sleeping even if it was daytime . Only their mother was seen working in the land and cooking meals at home . <p> They never got any government job , and they became over-aged for any new job after seeking jobs for more than 10 years . Both of them got married , however , and had children too . The land was also divided between the two brothers . Their family life too was not strong enough to have a major breakthrough in their sleeping habit . Senevirathna 's wife visited the village only once , did n't stay too long and went back to her own home . As she never returned again , Senevirathna had to visit her once in a while . <p> Senevirathna , the elder of the two , is now in the late-70s and , still living all alone in his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury ; the injury was caused by a log that fell on the head from the dilapidated roof of his house . The two children of the relative families who came to stay and study there -- Lal and Sugath also never got jobs . Later the villagers heard the news that both had died after joining the second JVP insurrection in the 1980s . <p> Buried stories <p> The above -- a true story - , was one of the many stories that have got buried in our economic history . In fact , while each person of our older generations has a story of his or her own , I believe a significant number of them were about loss of hopes and disappointments . It would be good if we have the opportunity to dig into them -- at least a couple of them , to understand their loss of hopes in the context and to reveal our economic reality at the time . It 's not because we enjoy digging into buried stories , but because it would be helpful in preparing our path to the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to be equally competitive so that there are candidates who do n't succeed at the interviews . Leaving room for some degree of reservations on the part of the candidates , it 's my attempt to reveal the other side of the coin -- the economic reality explaining the lack of opportunities for many over many years as in the case of both Senevirathna and Piyarathna . <p> Let me first elaborate the demand side of the opportunities : It was a time of a disproportionately large increase in youth population , nurtured well in a newly established free health and free education system of the country . The population growth was as large as 2 -- 3 percent per annum due to what was called " modern death rate combined with primitive birth rate " . As of 1963 estimates , more than half of the people in the country was less than 18 years of age . <p> Shrinking opportunities <p> The problem was , however , on the part of " creating opportunities " to meet the aspirations of healthy and educated youth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their parents ' traditional socioeconomic background for " new opportunities " in a modern environment . But the problem was that economic policies that were needed to create such opportunities were in the opposite directions so that the opportunities were actually shrinking . <p> By 1973 , the unemployment rate was 24 percent , while the majority of the unemployed were the " educated youth " who had secondary or post-secondary education and in the age group of below 25 years . <p> The government thought of doing almost everything " economic " so that the policies and regulations were created in favour of the government and against private business since the late 1950s , deepened in the 1960s and , worsened in the 1970s . Private sector expansion was paralyzed with the initiation of the " nationalisation " programme , tightening import controls and , the regulations constraining private business ; hence , there was no supply of jobs from the private sector . Today we lament saying that " there is no capitalist class in Sri Lanka " which is a result of killing the emerging capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there is anything short of supply , its perceived value is on the rise ; therefore , the " value " of jobs rose rapidly and , it became even more valuable for politics . Thus , giving away scarce government jobs was taken over by the politicians , on a small scale in the 1960s and large scale in the 1970s , while it was never given up even after 1977 . Apart from the shortage of jobs , another reason why Senevirathna and Piyarathna or Lal and Sugath never received jobs , was that they did not have the required political affiliation ! <p> Any lessons ? <p> We have the bitter experience of twin-wars triggered by the frustration of " educated youth " in the South which emerged twice in 1971 and in 1987 as well as in the North which lasted for 30 years ! Our policies and politics have played a major role in both . The question remains , have we learnt any lesson from our catastrophic history ? <p> ( The writer is a Professor of Economics at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter @SirimalAshoka ) .

He says " First , I analyse the virus itself and how its stealthy nature has transformed our lives . Second , I describe how the invisible epidemic of social media sharing of fake news about the virus worsens the situation further . Third , I explore how the virus has revealed to us what really matters in our lives and has forced us to re-evaluate our priorities . Fourth , I go on to explore the underlying structural weaknesses and disparities in society that have been exposed by the virus but previously remained unconsidered for so long that they too have become camouflaged , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neoliberal capitalism is an invisible enemy that has made prisoners of us all . I conclude by suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic represents a hidden opportunity to overcome perhaps the biggest invisible enemy of all : the moral distance that separates us from others . Only by rendering the rest of humanity morally visible to ourselves can we overcome capitalism and stop treating other people as invisible enemies " <p> COVID 19 is the ultimate socialist . It does not discriminate and does not know a beggar from royalty , a Prime Minister from a President or a man from a woman or a General from a Private soldier . It does not know a Tamil from a Sinhalese or a Muslim . A Buddhist from a Christian or a Muslim , a Harijan from a Brahmin .

Labels are freely available to divide and segment human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-create imaginary superiority and inferiority positions amongst the divisions . This surely is not the time for that . COVID could n't care less . It will infect anyone . <p> Sri Lankan politicians accuse each other about the response to contain and eliminate COVID and persons in leadership positions offer medical advice about medicines to use against COVID in total ignorance of facts relating to medicines , and raising unfounded hopes amongst people that there is a cure for COVID , when COVID knows there is no medicine to " cure " it , and has the last laugh about the stupidity of these utterances . The COVID community must be preying for more fools like these so called responsible politicians . <p> A discredited previous health portfolio holder pontificates about how this pandemic can be ended and teams up with similarly discredited persons to mislead the public who are in such a desperate position , ready to swallow not just the " Peniya " , but any concoction sent by the divine . COVID laughs heartily and deliberates why it should not redouble its spread to get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts being made to contain it . The winner is COVID . <p> When common sense , which no doubt ordinary people are expected to have in a country that boasts of a 2500 year history , great civilisations which could have taught a things or two to the rest of the world , dictates that one should wear a protective mask to cover one 's nose and mouth and not the chin , and not congregate in numbers , and maintain a distance between two people to avoid infection ; they do the opposite . COVID cheers saying we want more of this . <p> Opposition parties in Parliament organise demonstrations , totally disregarding health advice , helps COVID to spread , and then blames the government for not containing the spread . Perhaps COVID coffers are rich and overflowing to fund and support these campaigns . Or this brazen political opportunism is a heaven sent gift to COVID where it can spread without any need to spend for it . <p> Some people imagine an enemy that can be beaten by brawn , when what is needed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not cause any harm to them . So they congregate , have parties and disregard health advice . Some do this under the protection of highly placed politicians . <p> Without the knowledge of these brainless people , COVID crashes these parties and leaves its imprint with ever spreading clusters . Hospitals fill up , ICU beds and ventilators have waiting lists , with some not making it to them and ending up in over crowded morgues . COVID probably raises a glass to these morons who deprive people who are sick with other serious medical conditions . <p> COVID must be laughing and having a grand time knowing they have already infected more than 200 million human beings around the world and killed more than 4.4 million people , brought the world 's mighty economies to their knees , all without spending a red cent . Political leaders grandstand about their achievements in containing the pandemic . Infections have risen markedly in the US , UK , Japan , South Korea and virtually in all parts of the world with the Delta variant . COVID has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other variants which are very likely being tested by COVID now . In fact Sri Lankan medical authorities have stated that there are three Delta variants already in Sri Lanka . COVID has struck . <p> Vaccination is the only weapon available to human beings to lessen infections , lessen the impact of infection and lessen the need for hospital interventions . There is nothing else on the table . No omnipotent force can contain COVID . Only vaccines can . Despite this patently obvious situation , millions are refusing to get vaccinated . COVID is cheering for more of such people . <p> In this climate , a situation faced by all countries , big and small , rich and poor , coping with a health fiasco and an economic disaster , recovery from this disaster is even further than a distant dawn . There is very little light at the end of the tunnel , if at all . All Sri Lankans have to come to terms with this reality . <p> While not intending any disrespect to Bangladesh , Sri Lanka 's begging bowl has been extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long ago . The country 's health service is bursting at the seems and its health care workers have been pushed beyond endurance . In this climate , some people march the streets and congregate in large numbers without any regard to health advice and their fellow human beings . <p> While many would point fingers at the government , it is not the intention here as whatever government in power would have faced a similar , if not a worse situation should some of the discredited politicians who were booted out resoundingly by the people at the last election were in power . <p> The intention of this article is firstly to appeal to all parties in the current Parliament to call a halt to all forms of partisan politicking at least for 2 years , and secondly for them to work with the government in the health and economic front . A structure is needed for this , as words alone would not amount to anything . <p> Perhaps a National governing council under the President , with the inclusion of the Prime Minister , Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opposition , leaders of all other political combines if any political party is part of a political combine and leaders of political parties who are not part of a combine ( for example the UNP ) , could be formed with specific responsibilities ( to be determined by the President ) in the area of health and economic management . <p> At this juncture , one hopes that politicians place the country above their political interests , and recognise that both the President and the government has been given an overwhelming mandate by the people in 2019 and 2020 respectively . Destabilising the President or the government at this stage will only hand over even a longer lasting victory to COVID . <p> Paraphrasing the message placed before all countries by D M Shaw , COVID could well be saying that we , COVID 19 , are providing an opportunity to overcome perhaps the biggest invisible enemy of all : the moral distance that separates human beings from one another , the fortunate from the less fortunate , and only by rendering all of humanity morally visible to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop treating other people , the less fortunate , as invisible enemies " <h> Subscribe Us <h> Random Posts <p> 3/random/post-list <h> LATEST UPDATES <p> 3/feature/post-list <h> ABOUT US <p> The Sri Lanka Guardian is an online web portal founded in August 2007 by a group of concerned Sri Lankan citizens including journalists , activists , academics and retired civil servants.Sri Lanka Guardian has registered as an online newspaper in Government of Sri Lanka .

The Finance Bill codifies this -- Pic by Shehan Gunasekara <p> The gazetted Finance Bill is an unfair piece of legislation that rewards the rich , the corrupt , and the dishonest . It allows those with undeclared mansions in Sri Lanka , stacks of gold , and overflowing US dollar bank accounts to regularise these assets by paying a tiny penalty .

It targets those who have not disclosed taxable income or assets , and asks them to pay a measly penalty of 1% on their newly disclosed income and assets . The penalty of 1% is significantly lower than the tax liability that they would have had to pay , and the tax that honest citizens have paid until today . The Bill states that income and assets must be disclosed to the Commissioner-General and must be invested or deposited in Sri Lanka . Finally , those who use this tax amnesty to declare income are provided full immunity from investigations , penalties , and prosecution . <p> Government 's fiscal challenges <p> This Government is introducing this Bill as a quick fix solution , instead of focusing on structural reforms . Government revenue has plummeted since President Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power . This has been driven mainly by tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy , in a bid to increase investment and spur economic growth . With the increased costs of the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments of salaries , pensions and interest , the Government has decided that granting Sri Lanka 's 14th tax amnesty will drive up tax revenue and spur investment . <p> There are three primary arguments in favour of a tax amnesty . Firstly , it allows a government to raise tax revenue from income that is circulating in the underground economy . The hope is that the underground economy permanently reduces . Secondly , it allows those who have large sums of money stashed abroad to safely repatriate them . Finally , it allows those who have underpaid taxes over time to regularise their tax file , instead of accruing penalties for evasion . <p> According to Verit ? Research , since 1963 , the Government of Sri Lanka has granted at least 13 tax amnesties , with the most recent one in 2009 . However , have these frequent tax amnesties permanently increased revenue in Sri Lanka ? R.M.

The present Finance Bill does not have any provisions for structurally improving our tax revenue collection system . <p> Instead , the current tax amnesty penalises honest taxpayers and diminishes the integrity of the tax code . Why would you continue paying their taxes every year if you can just wait for Sri Lanka 's 15th tax amnesty ? <p> The tax amnesty reliefs include writing off penalties and interest , and permitting to invest the undisclosed taxable assets in financial instruments such as shares of a resident company , Treasury bills and bonds , debt securities issued by a company or to buy movable or immovable property in Sri Lanka .

" Stop playing politics at the expense of our international relations , " Gunawardena said , underscoring the need for what he called a national consensus on the post-war reconciliation process . <p> Responding to another query , Gunawardena said that FM Prof. Peiris in his address to the Geneva sessions discussed the progress in what he described as a domestic process in respect of accountability issues . Reference was made to the Office on Missing Persons ( OMP ) , the Office for Reparations ( OR ) and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation ( ONUR ) .

Referring to statements made by then Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then Joint <p> Opposition quite maliciously rejected the move . " They should be ashamed of theirconduct , " relevant ministers and the Attorney General Department could n't be unaware of the agreement on new anti-terrorism law . <p> Gunawardena said that the SLPP administration should n't hesitate to appreciate the previous government 's achievements . " We are quite pleased that mechanisms accepted by the previous government continue to be in operation even though the progress seems slow . However , the SLPP can not deprive the UNP-led administration of the credit it deserved , " lawyer Gunawardena said . <p> Gunawardena urged the government to examine the report of the Committee appointed by then Premier Wickremesinghe to develop what he called the policy and legal framework of the proposed Counter Terrorism Act of Sri Lanka . He said that a politically motivated campaign derailed that effort whereas the Opposition propagated the lie the yahapalana government intended to deprive Sri Lanka of anti-terrorism law . <p> Asked to comment on the revelation of the SLPP government having talks with a group of civil society activists to explore ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a 13-page Foreign Ministry note dated Aug. 31 , 2021 addressed to Colombo-based diplomatic missions acknowledged the pivotal role played by the civil society .

CSP consists of 30 organizations and 36 individuals . <p> Responding to declarations by FM Prof Peiris and Foreign Secretary Admiral Jayanath Colombage that external investigations would n't be acceptable , lawyer Gunawardena said that instead of rejecting the investigation the government should furbish whatever information in its hands or had access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the UNHRC authorized the fresh investigative mechanism at the 46th session with an overwhelming majority with 22 countries voting for the resolution , 11 against and 14 missing the vote . <p> Gunawardena urged the government to take a realistic view as Sri Lanka did n't have time and space to engage in silly maneuvers . The bottom line was that the March 2020 announcement that Sri Lanka withdrew from 30/1 was nothing but a farce , Gunawardena said .

This was only the second Grand Slam Emma has played in , having to withdraw during the fourth-round match in Wimbledon due to breathing difficulties which made some wonder whether she had the mental grit to stand the rigours of tough competitions . She proved them wrong in a spectacular manner , reaching the final in an unprecedented way .

It was well worth it , as Emma won the final again in straight sets , creating yet another record by being the first qualifier ever to win a Grand Slam ! In another rare gesture , Amazon had agreed to donate the fee for advancement of tennis for girls . <p> Emma Raducanu 's spectacular win was witnessed by Virginia Wade , the first winner of the US Women 's title in the open era in 1968 , Arthur Ashe winning the Men 's .

We had good teachers , not ' private tuition masters ' ! We could plan our future as we knew we could get a place for higher education as long as we got the required grades . Our progress in universities was not hampered by student 's unions controlled by unscrupulous politicians with warped thinking .

Lucky politicians got ministries , not because of competence or education , but on the basis of caste , creed , religion , etc . There were no shadow ministers in the Opposition and with the change of government another set of misfits became ministers . For some time , the status quo was maintained by senior administrators who were trained for the job after being selected following a highly competitive examination . <p> Anti-elite campaigners succeeded . Permanent Secretaries became secretaries and Ministers became permanent as long as they did not upset their bosses ! No proper planning was done and the slippery slope started .

We need to reinstall discipline so that we have schools and universities functioning properly , ensuring valuable years in life are not wasted . <p> Perhaps , we need to get out of our insular attitudes . There may be some lessons to learn from studying the background of these two talented players . Leyla Fernandez , born in September 2002 in Quebec , Canada has an Ecuadorian father and a Filipino mother .

Considering their dexterity , women 's tennis may become more popular than men 's . Who knows ! <p> It is well known that mixing of genes has an enhancing effect . It is also well established that inbreeding leads to many genetic defects . Perhaps , this is another reason why we should get rid of artificial divisions like caste .

He is certainly one who likes both Gems and Jewellery . He was ready and fast in giving up Prisons and Prison Reforms , with no charges framed against him . There were only allegations about him , made by a Tamil and other Opposition MPs and such persons . Our system of governance and justice is far removed from what is known as the Rule of Law .

Lohan Ratwatte has displayed his love for gems and jewellery . With his promotion to Cabinet status , will he be known as the " Muthu-menik Lohan Amathi , Sir " ? The true Gem of Pohottuva Politics and Governance ! <h> A neutral foreign policy in current context <p> During a recent TV interview , the Host asked the Guest whether Sri Lanka 's Foreign Policy is in " shambles " . The reason for the question was perhaps because of the lack of consistency between the statement made by the President and the Secretary to the Foreign Ministry relating to Foreign Policy . For instance , the first clear and unambiguous statement made by the newly elected President during his acceptance speech delivered in Sinhala in the holy city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his Foreign Policy would be Neutral . This was followed during his address to Parliament titled : The Policy statement made by Gotabaya Rajapaksa , President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka at the inauguration of the Fourth Session of the 8th Parliament of Sri Lanka on January 3 , 2020 , in which he stated : " We follow a neutral foreign policy " . <p> However , the Secretary to the Foreign Ministry has on different occasions stated that Sri Lanka 's Foreign Policy is " Neutral and Non-Aligned " . Perhaps , his view may have been influenced by the President 's Manifesto , " Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour " , that stated that out of 10 key policies the second was " Friendly , Non-Aligned , Foreign Policy " <p> The question that needs to be addressed is whether both Neutrality and Non-Alignment could realistically coexist as policies to guide Sri Lanka in the conduct of its relations with other Nation-States . Since neutrality is a defined policy that has a legal basis and has a history that precedes Non-Alignment , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with other States according to recognised codified norms with reciprocity . On the other hand , Non-Alignment was essentially a commitment to a set of principles by a group of countries that had emerged from colonial rule and wanted to protect their newly won independence and sovereignty in the context of a bi-polar world . The policy of Non-Alignment therefore , should apply ONLY to the members of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) . Thus , Non-Alignment , being only a set of principles adopted by a group of like-minded sovereign States to protect and preserve their common self-interests , its conduct in respect of States outside the Non-Aligned Movement becomes unstated and therefore undefined . Neutrality instead is a clear policy that defines how a neutral country such as Sri Lanka conducts its relations with other countries , and how other countries relate with Sri Lanka primarily in respect of the inviolability of its territory . <p> NON-ALIGNED and the NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT <p> A statement dated August 22 , 2012 by the External Affairs Ministry of the Government of India on the historical evolution of the Non-Alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations among large and small nations , known as the " Ten Principles of Bandung " , were proclaimed at that Conference ( 1955 ) . Such principles were adopted later as the main goals and objectives of the policy of non-alignment . The fulfillment of those principles became the essential criterion for Non-Aligned Movement membership ; it is what was known as " quintessence of the Movement until early 1990s " ( Ministry of External Affairs , Government of India , " History and Evolution of Non-Aligned Movement , August 22 , 2012 ) . <p> " Thus , the primary objectives of the non-aligned countries focused on the support of self-determination , national independence and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States ; opposition to apartheid ; non-adherence to multilateral military pacts and the independence of non-aligned countries from great power or block influences and rivalries ; the struggle against imperialism in all its forms and manifestations ; the struggle against colonialism , neocolonialism , racism , foreign occupation and domination ; disarmament ; non-interference into the internal affairs of States and peaceful coexistence among all nations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in international relations ; the strengthening of the United Nations ; the democratization of international relations ; socioeconomic development and the restructuring of the international economic system ; as well as international cooperation on an equal footing " ( Ibid ) . <p> These commitments did not deter countries such as India from violating the very principles India committed to in Bandung . To start with , India undermined the security of Sri Lanka by nurturing and supporting the training of non-state actors in late 1970s . Having made Sri Lanka vulnerable , India proceeded to coerce Sri Lanka to accept the Indo-Lanka Accord under which India was committed to disarm the militants . Having failed much to its shame , India violated the principle of the right of self-determination when it compelled Sri Lanka to devolve power to a merged North-East Province . All these actions amounted to a complete disregard and the mockery of the lofty principles of NAM undertaken to protect India 's self-interest . What is clear from India 's actions with regard to Sri Lanka is that when push comes to shove , self-interest overrides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , driven by self-interest , voted in support of UK 's intervention in the Falklands because of the debt owed by Sri Lanka to the UK for the outright grant given to construct the Victoria Hydro Power Scheme , although conscious of the fact that by doing so Sri Lanka was discrediting itself for not supporting the resolution initiated by NAM to oppose UK 's actions . These instances demonstrate that Non-Alignment as a Foreign Policy is subservient to self-interest thereby underscoring the fact that it can not be a clear policy to guide how a State conducts itself in relation to other States . <p> Commenting on the issues of limitations imposed by being a Member of NAM Shelton E. Kodikara states : " For Sri Lanka as indeed for many of the smaller states among the non-aligned community , membership of the Non-Aligned Movement and commitment to its consensual decisions implied a widening of the institutional area of foreign policy decision-making , and collective decision-making also implied a limitation of the area of choice among foreign policy options ... " ( Foreign Policy of Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with common interests such as those by the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) or Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) or any other group of countries with common interests , are mechanisms whose support and solidarity could be sought when needed to advance causes , as for instance when Sri Lanka advanced the concept of making the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace , and later in 2009 did so in Geneva . Notwithstanding such advantages , the hard reality is that Non-Alignment does not represent a clear statement as to how a State conducts its relations with Nation-States outside the Non-Aligned Movement . Therefore , it follows that Non-Alignment can not be considered a statement of Foreign Policy by a State . <p> THE CURRENT CONTEXT <p> The statement by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of India cited above that the " quintessence " of the principles of the Non-Alignment lasted until early 1990s , was because the bi-polar world that was the cause for the formation of NAM had ceased to exist with the territorial break-up of one of the power blocks -- the USSR . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this vacuum what exists currently is one recognized global power with other powers aspiring to be part of a multi polar world . In the absence of recognized power blocks the need to align or not to align does not arise because Nation-States are free to evolve their own arrangements as to how they conduct their relations with each other . Consequently , the concept of Non-Alignment individually or collectively is a matter of choice depending on the particularity of circumstance , but not as a general Foreign Policy to address current challenges . <p> With China attempting to regain its lost territory and glory as a civilizational State following its century of shame , the geopolitical matrix has changed dramatically . The economic gains of China the likes of which are unprecedented alarmed the Western world to the point that the US deemed it necessary to adopt a policy of Pivot to Asia thereby making the Indian and Pacific Oceans the focus for great power engagement . This shift of focus has caused new strategic security alliances such as the Quad to emerge to contain the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Oceans . With the Maldives joining India as the latest members of Quad , Sri Lanka has become isolated ; a development that has brought Sri Lanka 's location in the Indian Ocean into sharp focus as being of pivotal strategic interest to great and emerging powers . <p> It is in this newly formed geopolitical context that Sri Lanka has to formulate its Foreign Policy that necessarily must be fresh if Sri Lanka is to equip itself to meet the new challenges created by a coalition of States to contain the rise of China . One option is to join the Quad . This could mean Sri Lanka distancing itself from engaging with China . The other option is to engage with China to the exclusion of the Quad . Either of these options would cause Sri Lanka to lose its independence and the freedom to protect its core values and interests . Therefore , the choice is not to settle for either option . <p> These unprecedented circumstances and challenges can not be countered by harking back to the glory days of Non-Alignment , because major influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently abandoned the original principles it subscribed to when it became a part of Quad . Therefore , although NAM still represents a body of likeminded interests with the ability to influence causes limited only to resolutions that further the interests of its members , it is not in a position to ensure the inviolability of the territory and the freedom of a State to make its <p> A neutral <p> own hard choices . It is only if a Nation-State proclaims that its relations with other Nation-States is Neutral that provisions codified under the Hague Conventions of 1907 that would entitle Sri Lanka to use the inviolability of its territory to underpin its relations with other Nation-States . Therefore , the Foreign Policy statement as made by the President to Parliament should guide Sri Lanka in its relations with States because it is relevant and appropriate in the geopolitical context that currently exists . <p> CONCLUSION <p> The Foreign Policy of a State is greatly influenced by its History and Geography . Historically Sri Lanka 's Foreign Policy has been one of Non-Alignment . Furthermore , Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date recognized as the beginning of the Non-Aligned Movement . Thus , although the geographic location of a State is well defined , the significance of its location could dramatically be transformed by geopolitical developments . The staggering economic revival of China from early seventies under the leadership of President Deng Xiaoping whose philosophy was to hide capacity , bide time and never claim leadership , was perhaps the reason for China 's tremendous transformations both economic and social , to proceed relatively unnoticed . <p> It was only with the announcement of President Xi Jinping 's policy of the Belt and Road Initiative announced in 2013 , that the world came to realize that the power and influence of China was unstoppable . This policy resulted in China establishing its footprint in strategically located countries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans by funding and constructing infrastructure projects . Sri Lanka happened to be one such country . The need for the U.S along with India , Australia and Japan to form a security alliance to contain the growing power and influence of China in the Indian and Pacific Oceans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shifted the balance in Asia causing China to be the stand alone great power in Asia . As far as Sri Lanka is concerned this new dynamic compels Sri Lanka to make one of four choices . One is to align and develop relations with the US and its allies . Second is to align and develop relations with China . The third is be Non-Aligned with either . The fourth and preferred option is to be Neutral not only with the Quad and China , but also with all other States , and develop friendly relations individually with all States . <p> The policy of Non-Alignment by a State is an external declaration of intent that a nation would not align itself with either a collective or individual center of power such as the Quad or China , in the conduct of its relations . Neutrality by a State , instead , means not only a statement that it would be Neutral when conducting relations with collective or individual centers of power and other States , but also how such a State expects all States to respect its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka 's unique strategic location in South Asia . Thus , while the former works outwards the latter works both ways . More importantly , how Neutrality works is governed by internationally codified laws that are in place to guide reciprocal relations . <h> Comments on bits of past news ; never forget 9/11 and welcome multiculturism <p> The Sunday Island of September 12 , thank goodness its print copy , showered grist on my waiting-to-word-process wrist .

Cass quotes dear departed Sunil of ' Gypsies ' fame when she mourns : ' I do n't know why ' . But Sunil may have known , with many others , hence his laments in song . <p> Karu , the statesman , speaks <p> ' Karu urges President to seize opportunity to rebuild the country together with the Opposition . ' A fairly long write up of what Karu Jayasuriya said , backed by The National Movement for Social Justice , chairman of which he is , succeeding Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera , appeared in the said newspaper .

Curse them Cass swears , all over again , and more their Stalinist leader . <p> Never forget <p> Nearly 3,000 people were killed on that day ; wars were launched , and the carefree , fearless mood of the US changed with fear creeping in accompanied by a new mood : Islamophobia . This happened on September 11 , 2001 , on a sparkling morning when men of Al Qaeda hijacked four American commercial flights and two of them ploughed into the upper floors of the twin towers of the Trade Centre in Manhattan .

It is the same with our Easter suicide bombing of churches . 9/11 in America has been avenged , wrongly or justifiably , mostly the latter , in the case of the killing of Osama bin Laden , the brilliant mind turned completely aberrated by a rabid corruption of Islam .

The first sample was a contaminated one , according to the Minister . <p> In this respect on Thursday seven samples were obtained and sent for testing on Friday , Dr. De Silva confirmed adding that they had arrived in a sealed manner .

Mr Ratnayake is not speaking to a foreign audience , he is not speaking at the UN General Assembly ( heaven forbid ! ) .

If they did the minister produce an iota of evidence ? <p> I mean just because he is in charge of wildlife he should not go about making wild statements without proof ? If he did not provide an answer then have the media pursued it since he has bowled an ethnic ' Chinaman ' , so to say , into this global corruption expos ? . <p> Here was the occasion when state minister Ratnayake had the opportunity to unburden himself of this valuable information about how the Tamil diaspora was able to collate data to implicate a close relative of the Rajapaksa family in what seemed like questionable financial doings . <p> It is all the more reason why the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks back that President Rajapaksa indicated to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres his readiness to associate the Tamil diaspora in the long belated discussions on reconciliation . <p> While state minister Ratnayake , busy as he is saving our precious wildlife and our forests from being felled by those with power and political influence , and lending what we feel is undying support to preserve this planet from man-made ecocide , was able to track conspirators in the Tamil diaspora which deserves national plaudits . <p> I suppose like the recent promotion of thousands of military men , Mr Ratnayake should be duly honoured for taking on the vast Tamil diaspora single-handed like Horatius across the Tiber and giving the scattered diaspora undue publicity . <p> But state minister Ratnayake 's brief narrative at the press conference seems to leak like a dilapidated sieve .

It is run by a Chairman and Rector . But nowhere on its website is there mention of a key backer who funneled funds into the organisation through a Singapore-based company owned by a Trust registered in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI ) : Ramalingam Paskaralingam , a well-known public official who was an influential Treasury Secretary under late President Ranasinghe Premadasa . <p> Pandora Papers Overview ( Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any public domain about Mr Paskaralingam 's role , or how much money he has put into HCBT .

They reveal that he set up a structure in the BVI called ' The Aran Trust ' in July 2012 for succession planning . He and his family members were named as beneficiaries . <p> Mr Paskaralingam last held public office as Economic Advisor to Ranil Wickremesinghe , former Prime Minister , in the ' Yahapalana ' Government . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which projects and contracts were channeled . President Maithripala Sirisena abolished the CCEM in March 2018 . <p> A member of one of the final batches of the Ceylon Civil Service , Mr Paskaraligam was called Premadasa 's " super bureaucrat " . And among the posts he held in that administration were Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Education , Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government , Housing and Construction , Secretary to the Ministry of Highways and Chairman of Air Lanka . <p> Now in his 80s , Mr Paskaraligam -- or " Paski " -- was known to be rational , hardworking , " incredibly efficient " and " certainly more powerful than any Minister in Premadasa 's Government " . Even then , most large projects passed through him . <p> Ramalingam Paskaralingam <p> The Aran Trust owned 100% of a BVI company called Earth-Hold Investments Inc which in turn held 100% of St John 's . Its Deed of Trust states that : " The ultimate asset of the Trust is Horizon College of Business and Technology ( PVt ) Ltd , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net worth of the Trust is stated as US$ 3.5mn in cash and bank accounts . <p> Documents from 2013 hold instructions from Mr Paskaraligam that , should any of The Aran Trust 's income or capital remain indisposed of at the expiry of the Trust period , they should be poured in their entirety into HCBT . <p> Also in 2013 , Mr Paskaralingam decided to dissolve The Aran Trust and set up The Aran II Trust ; to settle Earth-Hold into this new Trust ; and to transfer the shares in HCBT to his niece -- listed as a housewife -- " because she has been investing funds into the company and , as her investments exceed the value of the company , the company will be placed into her name " . <p> Trident Corporate Services ( Singapore ) Pte Ltd ( TCSS ) was handling Mr Paskaralingam 's account at the time . And Trident Trust BVI ( TBVI ) inquired from it how the niece 's " investments " were recorded . Were they donations , contributions or loans to the Trust ? <p> TCSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the company but we are of the opinion that the same was made as a contribution as a donor or not for shares or any particular interest in the Company . " <p> The documents indicate , too , that Mr Paskaralingam had other Trusts ; that some of these were set up through TSNG or Trident Services Singapore ; and that he started terminating them around 2012-2013 , ostensibly as part of " succession planning " . <p> An email dated August 2013 from TCSS explains Mr Paskaralingam 's declared rationale for making his niece a beneficiary : " the main reason for the change and dissolution of the structure is the client wants to eliminate any offshore structures in order to be transparent with the Sri Lankan authorities and will be giving the assets to his niece as she has invested into the college and he feels it 's her right that she receives the college as a matter of a commercial decision . " <p> " Keeping it for the benefit of his immediate family does not make sense as they are not involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through other structures , " it adds . Separate emails state that " the client Paskaralingam will have no use for the BVI Structure in future as Sri Lanka is not in favour of BVI structures " . <p> This decision was made , however , when Mr Paskaralingam was already much advanced in age and ostensibly interested in ensuring there will be no legal issues for his inheritors . The emails call for " a clear paper trail with the whole dissolution of the structure " . <p> Communication between TCSS and TBVI in October 2013 gives further insight into why Mr Paskaralingam had been keen to reorganize his affairs . First , it was getting more expensive to manage his company in Singapore . Second was due to " recent issues with BVI leaks through Portcullis " which prompted the client " to close down all his offshore accounts " . <p> The Portcullis leaks were part of an ICIJ investigation in 2013 named ' Secrecy for Sale ' where the business of Singapore-headquartered offshore service provider Portcullis TrustNet was revealed . In managing their clients ' substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finances , business interests and political links hidden through a variety of methods . <p> Mr Paskaralingam 's niece subsequently set up her own structure named The Baron Trust " for succession purposes and in order to hold the share in a BVI Company " . It is this entity that now holds St John 's Investments Pte Ltd , the majority owner of HCBT . The proposed net worth of this Trust is again stated as US$ 3.5mn in cash and bank accounts . <p> The Trust 's Establishment Form states : " College was gifted to the Settlor niece by her uncle Ramalingam Paskaralingam . " But there is no information in the public domain of her involvement in HCBT . <p> Documents confirm that " St John 's Investment Pte Ltd. owns 80 % of the company shares outright and the remaining 20% is held by a business partner " .

The shares of Earth-Hold were transferred to The Aran II Trust . The reason he did not close down " all his Trusts " was advice he received that this was " not a good idea because he is going to be left without proper succession " . <p> If all this seems convoluted , it is because such transactions usually are . The Pandora Papers and previous document leaks from offshore providers point to a complex organ of trusts , holding companies , other entities and bank accounts . While there are legitimate uses for all of these -- and there is often no documentary evidence to say the wealth is ill-gotten -- the use of multiple instruments across several tax havens via proxies point to a strong desire for secrecy . <p> Meanwhile , Earth-Hold Investments Inc declared and paid interim dividends totaling SGD 364,284.75 ( Rs 54.56mn ) ; US$ 1,100,495.65 ( Rs 222.35mn ) and GBP 94,000 ( Rs 26mn ) to its sole shareholder for the year 2014 .

They were later defined as " interim dividends " . The documents reveal elsewhere that the quoted GBP 1.74mn was for investment in a property in Britain and that , rather than being a dividend , it was a " shareholder 's loan " . <p> There are other large amounts mentioned . " In February 2015 , the Trustee in consideration of a request from RP , a beneficiary of the Trust , requested the Director of Earth-Hold Investment Inc. , to pay distributions directly to an account held in the name of the said Beneficiary in the amounts of GBP 8,000 and GBP 10,000 Rs 2.76mn on the 24th day of each month and the 1st day of each quarter respectively , " says an email dated June 4 , 2016 , from TBVI to TCSS . <p> TBVI did raise some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) transfer that was first requested from The Aran II Trust for investment HCBT but later labeled as " personal expenses " . <p> " As you would appreciate , " it said , " initially we were advised that the US$ 100,000 was being requested for an investment in Horizon College . As we are now being told that the US$ 100,000 is for ' personal expenses ' , in addition to quarterly and monthly distributions of GBP 10,000 Rs 2.76mn and GBP 8,000 2.2mn for ' personal expenses ' , further inquiries were made . " <p> Trident Trust BVI accepted that Mr Paskaralingam was old would be residing in Sri Lanka more often owing to his " health condition " . But it asked why there had to be two separate transfers of US$ 100,000 ( to Bank of Ceylon ) and GBP 10,000 ( to Barclays ) for Mr Paskaralingam for " personal expenses " . And it called for " detailed explanation for the purpose of the transfer " , saying the given reason was " not sufficient for a transfer of this magnitude " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him/his son &amp; family in Sri Lanka " . It asserted that , in today 's world , to order a MRI , ultrasound scans , and a few doctors ' visits , etc , " will easily cost more than USD 30k " . " We do not feel that USD 100k is out of norm for an old man/retiree in today 's world , " it maintained . The second amount of GBP 10,000 , TCSS said , was for Mr Paskaralingam 's wife and his daughter who needed " long-term medical attention in the UK " . <p> The confidential emails show that the US$ 100,000 was , indeed , first requested for the purpose of " investment into Horizon College " . But it was changed to " personal expenses " after TBVI asked TCSS to confirm whether " the investment is being made in the Settlor 's name " . <p> In June 2016 , Mr Paskaralingam closed down The Aran II Trust which owned Earth-Hold Inc . There is no evidence in the documents of the Baron Trust being closed down . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paskaralingam now holds in the school . <p> The ICIJ sent questions to both Mr Paskaralingam and Mr Daranagama of the Horizon College of Business and Technology regarding the information revealed in the Pandora Papers . Mr Paskaralingam did not respond despite having asked for more time . <p> Mr Daranagama spoke over the telephone with ICIJ . One of his more surprising revelations was that , while Mr Paskaralingam has been investing for over 13 years in HCBT , he did not receive any returns . <p> With a background in management and entrepreneurship and a Masters in human resource management , Mr Daranagama said he has been in education for over two decades . He was co-founder of HCBT and it was set up with support from Mr Paskaralingam via St John 's Investment Pte Ltd . It is Mr Daranagama that holds the 20% stake . When the school started in 2008 , the former Treasury Secretary had no public administration or political role and was mostly overseas . <p> " He himself invested in his own wealth , " Mr Daranagama said . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the banking system . Today , Mr Daranagama claims to manage all the institution 's affairs with no involvement from Mr Paskaralingam . <p> His business had nothing to do with Earth-Hold or any other entity " from British Virgin Islands or whatever " , Mr Daranagama said . But he admitted that St John 's owned the 80% stake . On behalf of Mr Pasakaralingam , he said the Trust was set up because " Singapore is very expensive , extremely expensive " . <p> " And , number two , I believe he wanted to actually make the arrangement for his next generation , " in a more " convenient ... very cost effective " manner . " But I do n't have any dealings with them at all , " he maintained . <p> Mr Daranagama repeatedly said St John 's earned nothing from this venture and that Mr Paskaralingam 's only interest had been to see it grow , perhaps for his children to be involved in the business one day . <p> " They want me to keep on developing the organization because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .

This is mainly due to the repeated failures and setbacks in their past approaches with native species restoration and possibly inadequacy of knowledge and training in ecological restoration methodology . <p> The primary reason for past failures in raising mixed native species plantations was that the native species selected for restoration were mostly from among mature phase canopy species of the respective forest type . Seedlings or saplings of these canopy species are ecologically ill-adapted to establish themselves in larger forest openings resulting from deforestation . Furthermore , these forest gaps often get quickly overgrown with shade intolerant and faster growing pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though seed sources are available within the surrounding degraded forest landscape , the natural regeneration of mature phase native species has been painstakingly slow for these reasons . <p> Three Pine rows removal treatment creating canopy gaps ( width 10 m ) along N-S direction and planting of native species of utility vallue in Sinharaja IBR buffer zone .

This healthy partnership between exotic and native species opens up a conciliatory middle path as the proverbial ' rawulath theagene kendath bema ' - i.e. , raising exotic and naturalized/native fast-growing plantations ( some of which are demonised as invasive ) , as the first step in forest restoration initiatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced sequentially by suitable native species along an ecological successional gradient leading to a successful forest restoration programme . <p> In both Sinharaja and Lower Hantana Peradeniya University campus land we have successfully converted pine plantations into native and naturalized plant species of utility value using these successional methods . They are being regularly used for training restoration ecologists and others for over two decades . <p> During this ' Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021 -- 2030 ' , ecologically driven Forest Landscape Restoration is being promoted as the main driving force for global scale forest restoration . Sri Lanka has pledged to restore 200,000 ha of degraded forests as its " Nationally Determined Contribution ' towards the Bonn Challenge which has set a global target of restoring 350 million ha during this decade . While the monoculture plantations of pines and eucalypts have provided superior growth and impressive timber volumes , the downside is that they are not the best for the provision of enhanced ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement , water and soil conservation , reduction of fire and landslide hazards and amelioration of the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eucalypt plantations already established particularly in critical watersheds in Sri Lanka would be given a high priority in systematically converting them to native species using sound ecological principles with a view to increase the ecosystem services they provide to downstream communities . <p> Forest landscape restoration can best be done using ecological succession-based principles . One of these is known in silviculture ( the science and art of growing and cultivating forest trees , based on a knowledge of their ecological characteristics ) as relay floristic method of forest restoration . Both eucalypts and pines are ' early successional ' species that have the ability to grow in relatively poor soil and under strong light conditions common in degraded landscapes like cultivated and abandoned pathanagrasslands and kekillafernlands . The other suitable candidates for this step/lap of the relay are Havari nuga , Kenda , Gedumba , Lunu midella , Ipil Ipil , Acacia spp. , Caliandra sp . Such common plants can colonize the open and degraded lands rapidly and provide some partial shade facilitating the introduction of native species of the second lap . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade to the ground rather quickly due to their rapid growth . <p> The pine and eucalypt stands which have reached maturity in mountain landscapes particularly in the Central , Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces can be manipulated by creating appropriately sized openings simulating gaps in natural forests . In native forests , such gaps originate from natural phenomena such as standing tree deaths due to old age , lightning strikes , wind throws and landslides . The native species selected based on their ecological characteristics either as habitat generalists or specialists for each climatic/floristic region can be introduced in successive laps as in a relay in these artificially created gaps in pine stands . Both timber and non-timber species of utility value such as hora , hal , bedi del , yakahalu , dun , nawada , kitul , weniwel , wevel , enasal , thippili , etc. have been introduced in our demonstration restoration trials in Sinharaja ( 30 years old , now ) and Hantana ( 15 years old , now ) . <p> Unfortunately , despite these pilot-scale successful trials which have the potential for scaling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful to the environment as in Hirikatu Oya region in Ratnapura forest division . Large scale clear felling of Pinusplantations on steep slopes has resulted in extensive environmental damage not only to the site itself but also to the downstream areas . Subsequent reforestation efforts have not progressed as expected and resulted in heavy gulley erosion and soil degradation . <p> There are moves to repeat similar large-scale clear-felling operations in mature pine stands in Diyatalawa-Bandarawela regions . While this is likely to be environmentally harmful as in Hirikatu Oya , it also prevents an excellent opportunity to make these so called ' demonis ed ' exotic plantations partnering in systematic conversion of them to native species forests . <p> The ecological principles and methods showcased in our demonstration models in Sinharaja and Lower Hantana could be extended to this region , initially as a trial conversion . These mature pine plantations would serve as the first lap in a relay floristic model . The key is to select the right mix of native species for second and third laps of the relay floristic silvicultural succession suitable for this climatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species but others of traditional utility value such as medicinal , ornamental , artisanal and food value . We are in the process of preparing a list of such potential species for each subsequent lap . <p> It is our fervent hope that we learn from the environmentally costly experiments of clear felling of forest plantations in steep slopes as evident from Hirikatu Oya example in Ratnapura/Balangoda forest region and not repeat the same mistake in Diyatalawa/Bandarawela or any other similar landscapes . Proven silvicultural methods such as Relay Floristics methods are available to be adapted to suit the site conditions of this climatic region .

The removal of COVID-19 related lockdown measures in October 2021 and the successful nationwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout would help activity in the period ahead .

@@33462238 <p> ECONOMYNEXT -- A ferry tragedy that killed at least six people including four children in Sri Lanka 's eastern district of Trincomalee on Tuesday ( 23 ) has turned into an ugly political hot topic as both ruling party and opposition legislators openly blame each other for the accident . <p> The blame game is on who gave the approval to operate a ferry and why the government did n't provide safe alternate mode of transport as requested by Kinniya residents . <p> An emotional opposition MP Imran Mahroof , who is from the Kinniya electorate , blamed State Minister for Rural Roads and Other Infrastructure Nimal Lanza for ridiculing him when he told the parliament that his constituents needed an alternative road . <p> " Who is responsible for this tragedy ? Who gave the approval for the ferry service ? Was it approved by the RDA ( Road Development Authority ) ? " he asked the government in parliament on Tuesday , hours after the tragedy . <p> Rishard Bathiudeen , leader of a minority Muslim party in the opposition , said the tragedy could have been prevented had the government provided an alternative on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an alternate road should have been considered , " he told parliament . <p> " You should take action against whoever is responsible for this tragedy , " he urged Johnston Fernando , Minister of Highways , under whose purview the RDA comes . <p> Fernando , however , said the blame seems to have been " heaped " on the government . <p> " ' The previous Yahapalana government laid the foundation stone without any estimation and tender . After our government came into power , under the President 's Vistas of Splendour and Prosperity manifesto 's 100,000 bridges programme , we estimated and called for tenders to build a part of this bridge , " Fernando told parliament on Tuesday . <p> " In fact , we had given an alternative road , But that road was 3 kilometers long and people were not willing to use it . Then , the ferry service was started by the ( Kinniya ) urban council . <p> He said one council is controlled by Sri Lanka 's main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) and another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLMC ) . <p> " I consider this a murder . Do n't point fingers at politics on this . I have asked the police to take appropriate action , " Fernando said . <p> SJB MP Nalin Bandara said his party does not have control over any council in Kinniya , to which Fernando replied that if it was not the SJB , then it was the United National Party ( UNP ) , which the SJB had broken away from after the 2019 presidential election defeat . <p> Repeated foundation stones <p> Foundation stones have been laid more than five times for the renovation of the Kinniya-Kurinchakerni bridge , which was originally built in 1977 . It was the main route of transport for over 10,000 people whose families lived in the Kinniya Pradeshiya Sabha ( PS ) and Kinniya Urban Council ( UC ) limits on the two sides of the lagoon . <p> Since the bridge has been under construction for more than seven months , the UC chairman had approved the latest ferry service on October 28 with three key conditions including ensuring the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents complained that there was no compliance . <p> On Tuesday morning , the ferry -- made of long planks of woods across three dinghy boats laden with motors and some plastic barrels -- capsised as one of the two side dinghy boats went off balance . Most of the passengers slipped to the sinking side of the ferry . <p> " It then sank and unfortunately most of the passengers got trapped below the ferry and could not be saved within the first 30 minutes , " A H Akram ( 48 ) , a witness of the tragedy , told EconomyNext . <p> " It was too late to rescue some of them . " <p> Of the four children who drowned , two girls were from the same family and the other two drowned along with their mother . The sixth victim was a 70-year-old man . <p> Residents told EconomyNext that people were compelled to go on the ferry as it was the shortest and cheapest mode of transport for thousands who wanted to cross to the Kinniya UC area . <p> " If we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel 5 kilometres , and there is no public transport . You need to either take a three-wheeler or use your own vehicle , " a Kinniya PS resident told EconomyNext . <p> Another resident said he had to pay 3,000 rupees a month for moving his child across the lagoon via the alternative road since the bridge was closed for renovation . He had paid only 800 rupees when the three-wheeler used the dilapidated bridge before its closure . <p> " Low income families had no choice other than using a ferry to cross the lagoon , " the second resident said . <p> It takes only 10 minutes to cross the 150-meter breath of the lagoon , and most school children use it because the more developed schools are located in the Kinniya UC area . The depth of the lagoon where the ferry capsized was nearly 3 meters , residents said . <p> Clash after tragedy <p> Residents reacted angrily and aggressively . Groups of people attacked the residence of M S Thowfeek , a legislator who was elected under the opposition SJB ticket , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the 20th constitutional amendment was passed . <p> They smashed the metal gate , broke it , entered the premises and pelted the legislator 's house with rocks , CCTV footage showed . <p> The mob was furious that Thowfeek , who is now with the government , did not help to have an alternative route constructed that suited their needs . A rumour that it was the legislator who had started the unsafe ferry service only fanned the flames . <p> Kinniya residents said Thowfeek started a ferry service in April with no approval . However , this ferry operates in an area with a depth of less than one metre . <p> Thowfeek was not immediately available for comment . <p> The spontaneous outburst , some of the residents explained , was due to difficulties they had been undergoing for the past few months since the dilapidated bridge was closed for renovation . <p> On Wednesday , State Minister Lanza reiterated his claim that the opposition was to blame . <p> " The Kinniya PS requested permission from the RDA to operate a ferry . We told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would not allow it . The UC also asked for permission and we clearly told them too that there is no permission for a ferry and told them to use alternate routes , " Lanza told parliament . <p> " It was under this condition that the Kinniya UC , using power it does not have , gave approval for a ferry service to transport people and earn money . " <p> " There was no mention of safety measures to be followed in that approval letter . Not even a life jacket was mentioned . The Kinniya UC , especially the chairman , is clearly responsible for this tragedy as we never gave them the approval . " <p> He said the RDA was given approval to start a ferry service on July 14 and Kinniya UC had no right to start a ferry service . <p> Lanza also claimed that KInniya UC Chairman S H M Naleem was a cousin of opposition MP Imran Mahroof while the person who operated the ferry service was a close ally of Mahroof as well . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . " <p> The ferry owner , operator , and a labourer have been arrested over the incident . <p> The approval letter in Tail , seen by EconomyNext , showed that ensuring all necessary safety measures , free service for school children , and frequent checking of the ferry 's stability had been included as key conditions . <p> " When they discussed the bridge renovation , we requested a shorter by road or a free of charge ferry service or public transport as an alternative when the bridge would be under construction . But nothing was granted by the government , " Naleem told EconomyNext . <p> " Residents know what is the truth and that is why my house was not attacked when people reacted angrily . But after the initial reaction , now some people who are eagerly waiting for provincial council polls are manipulating facts and trying to attack me for something I did with sincerity for the people .

For these discussions to be taken seriously , the reversal of the 20th Amendment is imperative in that sense and sobriety must return to the constitutional discourse .

Who does the CID think , is being murdered ? In actual fact , it is Sri Lanka 's criminal justice system that is being decapitated wholesale by these antics . Does the CID implictly recognise that fact ? Is that unwitting recognition the same when Ministers wring their hands and call upon the CID to carry out ' impartial investigations ' into the thievery of garlic and sugar and allegations over fat commissions in bringing fertiliser , nano urea or otherwise as the case may be , to our furious farmers .

But the fact that his observations had been based on the reports of the Presidential Commissions of Inquiry which had sat to examine the 2019 attacks and were matters of public record , was apparently of no significence to zealous law enforcement officers questioning him .

The reason why this particular theme has now been taken up for further discussion is a recent report of proceedings before a Justice Committee in the UK . At its November 16 , 2021 meeting , much of the evidence was given by Lord Chief Justice Burnett ( LCJB ) who adverted to many issues relating to the Judicial Function . Of these , only one particular issue termed ' Listing of cases ' is taken up for discussion , here . <p> In Sri Lanka 's context , calling and trial dates are declared as ' listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK Justice Committee meeting are relevant to Sr Lanka , too , especially with the moribund attitude of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption ( CIABOC ) . <p> Since this exercise is then merely a comparison , each of the remarks made in the UK will be followed by parallel notes from SL , to enable corresponding assessment for Law and Order in SL . Since space is limited , only a few related issues will be discussed . <p> Listing strategies are varied in the UK , implying each court adopts different approaches to determine the next dates . This issue is then not merely a matter of consistency as a judicial task may entail , but involuntarily takes in other considerations which drive the decision . Such other factors may not be quite ' judicial ' . Much is then left unsaid . <p> It is idle then to term the listing exercise as a judicial function , in itself . In the UK , this assertion as a firm statement was intended to distinguish it from an administrative function . The implication is that judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function is by the Registrar . This difference is carefully nuanced that little else can be insinuated . In SL , the reverse is possibly the normal practice , and the cross implications flowing in either direction can not be easily discounted . A judicial element and an administrative aspect are in truth contained in each other , theoretically and linguistically . <p> The grid reference in the UK , meaning that the cases are listed in the order of a grid framework , is possibly plausible . The idea projected is meant to exclude an administrative element within the judicial function idea . This is in the UK . In SL , such statement is made rarely . <p> On the other hand , however , the UK Justice Committee still accepts the observations of Lord Chief Justice Burnett when it recognises that UK Courts have nonetheless to follow judicial direction and policy , even when cases are taken out of the list at short notice . This means more than it says . That is the reality . The Justice Committee acknowledges that there are yet many ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then that , in the end , despite an honest effort to record observations duly , the odds facing such listing endeavour are heavy . <p> The conclusion reached is nevertheless promising when the Justice Committee notes that the need is to ' keep the show on the road to the extent that has been possible ' . The Justice Committee conceded this on the basis of the evidence of Lord Chief Justice Burnett that impeding factors as the Covid pandemic , physical incapacity , judicial incapacity , finance and other reasons hardly apply to the emerging problem . The matters , noted above , are an array of disconnected issues in the order of proceedings of a Justice Committee . But they apply more or less with listing which is even more directly related to Law and Order . <p> And into this mix in the UK , is added the factor of common law as perhaps means to improve on Justice which encounters these problems than through the statutory law , specifically , the reference in Justice Committee and the evidence of LCJB to family cases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes . A common law approach to family cases and a host of other minor cases is then but a suggestion that methods other than statutory law means may usefully be adopted . That line of attack on the problem was not discussed which can surely be to advance Justice as well as Law and Order . <p> In SL , such idea will entail a redistribution of the cases before court to authorities outside courts as conciliation boards etc . But plain power and related considerations will stand squarely in the way even to ' keep the show on the road to the extent ...... possible ' . ' Delisting ' of cases in SL in this manner is thereby nearly unthinkable . Law and Order will have to wait somewhere along this road for some time to come . <p> ( The writer is a retired Senior Superintendent of Police . He can be contacted at seneviratnetz@gmail.com ) 
@@33475233 <h> Kandyan armies which kept Europeans at bay for two centuries <p> The Kandyan army also had local Malays and Kaffirs ( Africans ) and also Indians like Malabars , Tamils , Telugus , and Canarese ( Karnatakas ) . There was also an assortment of European deserters and prisoners . These mercenaries also served in the armies of European powers <p> The Kandyan Kingdom 's dogged resistance to European invaders from the 17th Century to the second decade of the 19th Century has not received the attention it deserves from military historians , laments historian Dr. Channa Wickremesekera , the author of " Kandy at War : Indigenous Military Resistance to European Expansion in Sri Lanka 1594-1818 " <p> Kandy was but a small , landlocked , sparsely populated place in central Sri Lanka surviving on subsistence agriculture and without any other material resources . But it had kept at bay , and inflicted heavy casualties on , better armed and trained Portuguese , Dutch and British forces for two centuries . This is unique in the annals of warfare , Wickremesekera asserts . <p> The Kandyan ' army ' was not a standing army but only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facing a particular invasion or conducting a particular offensive . Local chiefs and village headmen gathered men under the Rajakariya system ( service obligation to the King ) . The motivating factors were : loyalty or submission to the King or the local chief , Sinhala pride , land grants , awards and also opportunities to plunder and loot . <p> The men carried a wide assortment of weapons including swords , knives , pikes , spears , bows and arrows , clubs and rocks , muskets , Gingals ( large muskets fired from a rest ) and light artillery . However , only a section of the armed men carried firearms . This was so in the Portuguese and Dutch armies too . Pikes and spears played a major role in the fighting in Balana in 1594 . Constantine de Sa Norohna 's army in 1630 fought with spears . The Kandyan and Portuguese firearms were similar . <p> However , weaponry was not a critical factor for the Kandyans because they rarely faced the enemy head-on . They opted for guerilla warfare which suited their terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they could never stay there for long . Typically , the King would evacuate the town and retreat to the countryside and organize guerilla strikes , with the full participation of the people . They would let the heat and rain , tropical diseases and fevers debilitate the invader , especially the Whites . And when the latter withdrew in desperation , the guerillas , hiding in the jungle , would ambush them on the narrow hill-side pathways . Several European armies had been annihilated in this way . <p> According to Wickremesekera , three large Portuguese armies were completely destroyed and one was badly mauled . Nearly 2000 Portuguese troops were captured or killed . Dutch attempts to invade in 1764 and 1765 , were repulsed inflicting heavy losses . In 1803-1804 , the British made two attempts to seize Kandy . One of the British contingents was trapped in Kandy and massacred , and the other escaped with heavy losses . The guerillas put obstructions and batteries with Gingals on the pathways to ambush the enemy trapped in the narrow pathways . <p> The Portuguese <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army headed by Captain General Pedro Lopes de Souza in 1594 . When he was returning to Colombo from Kandy after an unsuccessful attempt to put Dona Catherina ( formerly Kusumasana Devi ) on the throne , the Kandyans killed him and many of his troops . With this , Konappu Bandara who took the name Vimala Dharma Surya I , got back his throne . A force under Dom Janome de Azevedo was sent to punish Vimala Dharma Suriya I. It narrowly escaped annihilation . Thereafter the Portuguese gave up the idea of occupying Kandy and took to raiding , ravaging and burning its territories . However , in 1630 , Capt . Gen. Constantine de Sa Norohna invaded Kandy , but his army was annihilated in Uva . In 1638 , an army under Diogo de Mello de Castro , was annihilated outside Kandy . <p> The Dutch <p> In 1638 , the Kandyans struck an alliance with the Dutch to get rid of the Portuguese .

It needed to import essentials like salt , cloth and Indian mercenaries the Europeans were liberally recruiting . In 1670 and 1675 , King Rajasinha II launched offensives against the Dutch and inflicted losses , but failed to get the ports . In 1765 , the Dutch under Baron Van Eck attacked Kandy and occupied it but harassed by the Kandyans , they withdrew . <p> The British <p> The British , who took over from the Dutch in 1795-96 , and like their European predecessors , eyed Kandy . In 1803 , the British sent 3,400 troops to Kandy to place a puppet , Muttusamy , on the throne in place of the unbending Sri Vikrama Rajasinha . British troops succeeded in doing so , but the Kandyans attacked the British detachment and annihilated it . Eventually , the British exploited the political divisions in Kandy and got disgruntled local nobles to collaborate and hand over the kingdom to them on a platter in 1815 . But in 1818 , when there was a serious revolt in Uva , the British took no chances . Governor Brownrigg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashed a reign of terror , virtually depopulating Uva to stamp out Kandyan dreams of independence . <p> The Kandyan Army <p> The Kandyan soldier was a peasant who brought his own weapons , and learnt to fight on the job .

There was also an assortment of European deserters and prisoners . These mercenaries also served in the armies of European powers . <p> Being locals , the Kandyan soldiers carried very little rations ( usually rice and kurakkan or millet ) when on campaigns which never lasted more than two weeks . They also had access to local resources . At any rate they never went too far from their villages . When food stocks were over , they would get back to their villages for replenishment . In contrast , the invading European armies had to collect provisions from their bases on the coast , and transport them using carts , pack animals and coolies . Camp followers could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer would have a number of attendants . Top officers even took their furniture on campaigns . But the porters were very vulnerable to Kandyan guerilla attacks and would often abandon their carts and run . This would create a shortage of food , especially meat , and that would seriously affect the Europeans . Starvation , leech bites , diseases and fevers typical of tropical jungles , were common among the Europeans and their men . Deaths and diseases badly affected the fighting strength and fighting capability of invading foreign troops . A fifth of the British troops died of disease in the 1818 Uva campaign . In the 17th Foot the death toll was 410 out of 1000 . <p> However , the Kandyans were over-run eventually . Technological backwards , the subsistence economy , outdated military techniques and lack of access to outside ( Indian ) manpower , and lack of material resources , led to a weakening of morale . The Dutch and the British in the second half of the 18th and early 19th Century had cannons and mortars , which could take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier and more frequent volleys . Furthermore , the Europeans were able to bring mercenaries from India . <p> While both sides indulged in unspeakable brutalities , the wanton devastation inflicted on the land and the subsistence economy every time the Europeans invaded , broke the will of the Kandyan peasant fighters . The Kandyan subsistence economy was no match to the economic strength of the British Empire , Wickremesekera points out . In a surrealistic denouement , the brave Kandyans submitted to the British meekly after some of their top chiefs handed over the Kingdom to the British on a platter in March 1815 only to get rid of King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.

@@33475238 <h> Human Intelligence in the Digital Age <p> Richard Moore , Chief of the UK Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) , has made his first public speech since taking up his role in October 2020 . He talked about the seismic changes he sees in the world , specifically in the espionage environment . He discussed China , Russia and Iran , three of the " Big Four " priorities for the intelligence world . He also explained what the UK is doing to address the fourth priority - the amorphous , shape-shifting character of international terrorism . As part of wider government strategy outlined in the Integrated Review , MI6 is adapting to meet the new threats and challenges that the accelerating pace of technological change now poses . With the shifts in the security landscape and revolutionary advances in technology , the business of espionage has become considerably more challenging . MI6 has traditionally relied primarily on its own capabilities to develop world class technologies . But , as Richard Moore tells the International Institute for Strategic Studies , mastering human intelligence in the digital age is a national security imperative , and it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnering with the private sector to find new technologies to allow continued mastery of human intelligence in the digital age . Critically , the workforce of MI6 needs to be as diverse as the population it serves . Richard Moore says in his speech this means the organisation must be more open and able to continue to attract the very best of British talent . <p> by Richard Moore <p> Good morning . I am delighted to be here for my first public speech as Chief of SIS -- or MI6 as it is popularly known . <p> We have come a long way , since the 1980s when I first joined MI6 , as John noted , and the identity of ' C ' was still secret . <p> But it is still unusual for the holder of this office to give public speeches . This is something that I want to change , judiciously , for two reasons . <p> First , it is an important part of the way we hold ourselves to account , within a democracy , of how we retain public support for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire people to want to come and join us . <p> Second , the changing nature of the threats we face requires a greater degree of openness from a modern intelligence agency . There is a paradox in play here , one I will try to explain more fully later in my speech . It goes as follows : to stay secret , we are going to have to become more open . <p> There will always be limits to what I can say . MI6 is an organisation that deals in secrets . Indeed , one of my few specified responsibilities under the 1994 Intelligence Services Act is not to disclose our information on an unauthorized basis . But , that said , I will share with you this morning as much as I can about our work to protect the security , and advance the interests and values , of the United Kingdom . <p> In my 34 years with MI6 I have seen extraordinary change in the strategic environment : from the Cold War to today 's starkly contested era , in which nation states and non-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the domains of the virtual and the physical in a world of , at times , bewildering complexity . <p> There are elements of continuity , Russia , China and Iran , and for instance , have long been three of what I might informally call the ' big four ' priorities within the intelligence community ; the fourth being the threat from international terrorism . <p> But , mostly , we are living through an era of dramatic change in the security landscape . <p> We have to defend ourselves as a country against a growing threat from state actors , within an international system which is not working as it should do to constrain conflict and aggression . We face adversaries who are feeling emboldened , encounter fewer constraints , and are able to draw on greater resources than in the past . <p> We face transnational challenges from climate change to pandemics , which create an entirely new level of need for global cooperation . We must cooperate on these issues even when we compete fiercely elsewhere . <p> Furthermore , we live in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolutionary advances in technology which will affect the manner in which we live and work in ways we can not fully foresee . <p> Advances in quantum engineering and engineered biology will change entire industries . The huge volumes of data now available across the globe , combined with ever increasing computer power and advances in data science , will mean the integration of artificial intelligence , AI , into almost every aspect of our daily lives . <p> Others would speak to you about the benefits associated with these new discoveries ... and they are myriad . But I am paid to look at the threat side of the ledger . MI6 deals with the world as it is , not as we would like it to be . And the ' digital attack surface ' that criminals , terrorists and hostile states threats seek to exploit against us is growing exponentially . <p> According to some assessments , we may experience more technological progress in the next ten years than in the last century , with a disruptive impact equal to the industrial revolution . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact and its potential impact on global geopolitics . But it is a white-hot focus for MI6 . <p> My mission as Chief is to ensure the successful transformation and modernisation of our organisation : extending MI6 's secret human relationships to reflect the changing nature of power and influence in the world ; investing in the skills a global intelligence agency needs in the digital age ; and meeting the technological challenge head on by opening up -- to an unprecedented degree -- to partners who can help us master the technologies we need for our operations , and to enable us to innovate faster than our adversaries . <p> I will speak to you today about this mission , seen through the lens of what I earlier called the ' big four ' set of threats : China , Russia , Iran and international terrorism , as well as the over-arching technological challenge . <p> But , before that , a few words on who we are and what we do . <p> MI6 is Britain 's overseas human intelligence agency . We recruit and run clandestine agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships to provide government with secret information , and to make things happen that would otherwise be impossible to achieve . <p> We do this for strictly limited purposes as set out in that 1994 Act : in the interests of national security , for the economic wellbeing of the UK , or for the prevention and detection of serious crime . <p> And everything we do is bound by UK law . <p> We take this very seriously . We have been given powers by the state to operate in an ethically complex area . I ask my officers to do things in their professional existence which they would not do in their private lives . A democratic society should only grant such powers to its most ethically literate citizens , who are the very people we aim to recruit as MI6 officers . <p> I am in this job because I believe in the positive power of the human relationships MI6 builds . I have recruited and run agents overseas myself , and seen the risks these courageous men and women of other nations are willing to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the difference our work makes . <p> What we do , as a human intelligence agency , is essential , because at the end of the day , even in a digital world , critical decisions are made by real people . <p> We need to understand what motivates our adversaries ; their intentions , their plans , and their methods . <p> We need to be able to reduce the space within which they believe they can act against us with impunity -- on or offline . <p> And we need to provide the government with options to lawfully disrupt , deter and suppress threats to the UK -- wherever they originate -- as well as help them take advantage of opportunities for our country and its citizens . <p> This is what we do in MI6 - working with our sister agencies GCHQ and MI5 and with our partners in Defence Intelligence and UK Special Forces . <p> We need MI6 's global network of secret human relationships more than we ever have done , in an increasingly contested international landscape . <p> The tectonic plates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert it , grows . <p> A large part of the UK 's security and prosperity is increasingly tied up with China 's actions and policies . <p> There are many areas where our country needs to engage with Beijing , including trade and investment , cultural links and the transnational challenges of climate change and biodiversity . <p> But the fact remains that China is an authoritarian state , with different values from ours . This is reflected in the threats we see emanating from the Chinese state , that coexist with those opportunities for cooperation . <p> The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and continue to conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and our allies . This includes targeting those working in government , industries , or on research of particular interest to the Chinese state . They also monitor and attempt to exercise undue influence over the Chinese diaspora . <p> Chinese intelligence officers seek to exploit the open nature of our society , including through the use of social media platforms to facilitate their operations . We are concerned by the Chinese government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the globe . <p> Beijing 's growing military strength and the Party 's desire to resolve the Taiwan issue , by force if necessary , also pose a serious challenge to global stability and peace . <p> The Chinese Communist Party leadership increasingly favour bold and decisive action justified on national security grounds . The days of Deng Xiaoping 's " hide your strength , bide your time " are long over . <p> Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and underestimates Washington 's resolve . The risk of Chinese miscalculation through over-confidence is real . <p> The Chinese Communist Party brook no dissent . Beijing have eroded Hong Kong 's ' one country , two systems ' framework , and removed individual rights and freedoms , in the name of national security . Its surveillance state has targeted the Uighur population in Xinjiang , carrying out widespread human rights abuses , including the arbitrary detention of an estimated 1 million Muslims . <p> Worryingly , these technologies of control and surveillance are increasingly being exported to other governments by China : expanding the web of authoritarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the rise of China is the single greatest priority for MI6 . We are deepening our understanding of China across the UK Intelligence community , and widening the options available to the government in managing the systemic challenges that it poses . <p> This is not just about being able to understand China and Chinese decision making . We need to be able to operate undetected as a secret intelligence agency everywhere within the worldwide surveillance web . <p> And we want other countries to be clear-eyed about the debt traps , data exposure and vulnerability to political coercion that arise from dependency on relationships where there is no recourse to an independent judiciary or free press . <p> We will seek an overlapping set of partnerships with different countries and regions on these issues -- making common cause on common concerns . <p> Turning to the second of the " big four " , we continue to face an acute threat from Russia . <p> My father was posted to Moscow in the 1960s , and my first memories are of Russia . I have a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current difficult relationship with Russia is not the one the UK wants . But we will do whatever it takes to keep our country safe and to deter and defend against the full spectrum of threats Moscow poses . <p> These include state-sanctioned attacks , such as we have seen in Salisbury and the Czech Republic ; interference in democratic processes such as the attempted coup in Montenegro ; cyber-attacks , such as the SolarWinds cyber intrusion which we and our partners publicly attributed to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service ; or the use of political proxies to undermine stability in the Western Balkans . This activity is on an upward trend . <p> More often than not these Russian state activities are designed to be covert , or at least deniable . However , we are also seeing more brazen activity - often linked to the personal enrichment of elites around President Putin - the denial of which is increasingly implausible . The deployment of private military companies in Africa and Syria , such as Wagner , is one such example . The poisoning of Alexey Navalny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up to and deter Russian activity which contravenes the rules-based international system . No country , in Europe or beyond , should be seduced into thinking that unbalanced concessions to Russia bring better behaviour . <p> As the Foreign and Defence Secretaries have made clear in their visits to Ukraine , Moscow should be in no doubt of our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine , within its internationally- recognised borders including Crimea . Ukraine is a separate , sovereign country with a separate , sovereign Ukrainian people . <p> Russia ceasing its destabilising activity would enable us to focus on common threats , and address Russian legitimate interests through dialogue . That dialogue might reassure Russia that , as the Prime Minister noted in his recent Mansion House speech , we have no desire to be adversarial towards Russia , to undermine or encircle it . <p> Meanwhile , my organisation 's commitment to understanding Russia and what it is doing has been sustained for a century , and will remain a core part of what we do . <p> Thirdly - in the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran . Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 , the Iranian leadership has embraced an explicit doctrine of conflict with both Israel and the West . Indeed , we deeply regret that a country with an almost unparalleled depth of history and culture such as Iran has been a source of instability across the region and beyond for over forty years . <p> Hezbollah , incubated in Lebanon by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Force was Iran 's first foreign insurgent force ; it has since grown to become a state within a state , contributing directly to state weakness and political turmoil in Lebanon . Iran has repeated the model in Iraq , where it has exploited a fragile transition to democracy to seed the country with armed gangs who are undermining the state from within , murdering those who seek to uphold the law . This month one of those Iranian armed and trained gangs attempted to kill the Iraqi Prime Minister . We see attempts to pursue similar policies in Syria , Yemen and the Gulf . <p> Iran has also built up a substantial cyber capability which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in Europe and North America , and maintains an assassination programme which it uses against regime opponents . There are many parallels with the challenge that Russia poses , and it is no coincidence that the two countries have made common cause in Syria . <p> As the Foreign Secretary has made clear , we will continue to work to contain the threat posed by Iran to the UK directly and to our allies in the region . That includes contesting Iran 's development of nuclear technology which has no conceivable civilian use . Yesterday negotiations resumed in Vienna which could provide a path back to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , or nuclear deal , between Iran and the West . That would be in the interests of Iran , the region and the world . We all want a diplomatic outcome . <p> The fourth and final of the ' big four ' challenges I referred to is the threat from international terrorism . <p> To do this , MI6 continues to recruit agents in the most dangerous organisations in the world . We benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our international partners . <p> In the last twenty years , the UK intelligence community as a whole has disrupted dozens of overseas attack plans before they could reach the UK - saving potentially thousands of lives . <p> However , Al Qaeda , Daesh and their affiliates and imitators retain an undiminished appetite for violence and the inflicting of mass casualties , and the world still presents fertile ground for radicalization . Terrorist networks have spread in the Middle East , the Sahel , Sub Saharan Africa , the Horn of Africa and beyond . <p> Counter-terrorism work is more difficult in a more fragmented world , with rising internal conflicts , some states regressing in economic development as a result of conflict , and the diffusion of technologies making it easier for terrorists to conceal their planning . <p> The home-grown threat of terrorism - with the attendant difficulty of disrupting lone wolf attacks -- means that , sadly , some attacks are always likely to get through . <p> Furthermore , there is no doubt about the morale boost the Taliban victory in Afghanistan has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential emboldening effect on countries such as Russia , China and Iran . <p> I mentioned before that MI6 deals with the world as it is , not as we would like it to be .

Al Qaeda and Daesh will seek to increase their foothold , and to rebuild their ability to strike Western targets . <p> Our priority , as the Prime Minister has said , is to stop the re-emergence of large scale international terrorist operations from a Taliban controlled Afghanistan , and to protect the UK homeland and our citizens from any threat that might emanate from there . <p> As an intelligence community we will now do this ' outside in ' : working from the outside to identify and disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extremely difficult task , and will rely extensively on regional partnerships as well as coordination with our allies . <p> At the same time , we are engaging with the Taliban and testing their willingness to cooperate . It is also the job of my Service to provide the independent secret intelligence from our sources to illuminate this murky scene . With our allies , we will be ready to disrupt Al Qaeda if the Taliban renege on their promises not to allow Al Qaeda to rebuild external operations capability and to tackle the threat from Daesh . <p> The context in which we have to confront the challenges I have mentioned is of course the global digital environment . <p> As the counter terrorism example shows , there is no longer such a thing as an analogue intelligence operation in this digital world . <p> Our intelligence targets have online lives . Our officers need to operate invisibly to our adversaries . And we need to be able to run our agent and technical operations in an environment in which " Made in China " surveillance technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights from data , the tools to manipulate data and , most important , the talent to turn complex data into human insight . The combination of technological prowess and insights from human intelligence gives the UK a powerful edge . The Integrated Review elevated science and technology as a component of the highest importance to our national security and we need to work to shape international norms in collaboration with allies and partners . <p> Our adversaries are pouring money and ambition into mastering artificial intelligence , quantum computing and synthetic biology , because they know that mastering these technologies will give them leverage . <p> An intelligence service needs to be at the vanguard of what is technologically possible . <p> This is not new : we have always been at the leading edge of innovation , from the chemistry that enabled us to produce secret writing technologies in the early days of the service , to the wireless and secure speech technologies we developed during the Second World War . And today we are founding members of the National Cyber Force - the UK 's unified cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrorists , and criminals and to support military deployments . <p> What is new is that we are now pursuing partnerships with the tech community to help develop world-class technologies to solve our biggest mission problems . <p> We can not match the scale and resources of the global tech industry , so we should n't try . Instead we should seek their help . Through the National Security Strategic Investment Fund we are opening up our mission problems to those with talent in organisations that would n't normally work with national security . Unlike Q in the Bond movies , we can not do it all in-house . <p> I can not stress enough what a sea-change this is in MI6 's culture , ethos and way of working , since we have traditionally relied primarily on our own capabilities to develop the world class technologies we need to stay secret and deliver against our mission . <p> This is the paradox I referred to earlier in my speech : we must become more open , to stay secret . <p> This openness also relates to our workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workforce must represent the very best of British talent , and be as diverse as the population we serve . This is my personal priority as Chief , and it will include a huge effort on recruitment . We need to increase the diversity of our workplace and draw in those who never thought of working for us before . Come and join ! There is no more important or - I believe - more exciting time to work for MI6 . <p> To my colleagues , who I serve alongside today , I want to take this public opportunity to thank and acknowledge the men and women of MI6 for their extraordinary achievements - and , most importantly , the brave people who work with us secretly , our agents . <p> I know that if you could see what they do for our country , as I do every day , you would be as proud of them as I am . They will remain in the shadows even as I steal the limelight today to applaud their work . <p> And I should stress , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of our agents . Their names will go with us to our graves . <p> In an earlier era , Winston Churchill described the men and women of Bletchley Park , then part of MI6 , who played such a critical role in defeating Nazi Germany , as the " goose that laid the golden eggs but never cackled " . We retain the ethos of our predecessors . We keep our word and our secrets . <p> So this is how MI6 is adapting to respond to the challenges and opportunities of our era : further expanding our human relationships and networks , investing in our people and our capabilities , and opening up to new partnerships - in the technological arena and with governments overseas - to make common cause on the greatest global challenges of our time . <p> There are no down arrows in any areas of our work .

And we are a creative , innovative nation with immense soft power derived from our values , our history and our culture . <p> We should have every confidence that we can seize the opportunities of the 21st century , and navigate our country successfully through it .

But in 2020 it had jumped to 44 percent . <p> He said , throughout multiple governments the telecommunications sector was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at it as a basic piece of infrastructure , which is connectivity , which is important for the country 's digital transformation has to be set in place . <p> Sri Lanka 's rulers have a tendency to put tax payer funds to state-owned infrastructure that makes losses , but tax private owned ones that run at a profit , critics say . Telecoms also used to get state guaranteed bi-lateral credits when it was fully a state monopoly . <p> " We have a tax on the telecommunication towers , " Senanayake said . " Now when we want to accelerate connectivity , how are we justifying a taxation on every tower that the telecommunications sector invests ? We can not do that . " <p> " From a technology perspective or telecommunication perspective , these absolutely not a delight . " <p> The telecom tower tax critics say may have been a result of environmental activism . <p> Senanayake said there was also multiple court cases in recent year with " fragmental regulators " . <p> " In 2019 , there were 16 Supreme Court cases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> " Now what does that mean ? The complete regulation and the management of spectrum , and the awarding of spectrum that is required to manage quality of service and to expand 4G and connectivity was an absolute deadlock for three years .

While taxing the firms to the hilt , fund collected for rural connectivity had also not been used . <p> " So how are we basically expecting a private sector environment to just keep on investing on areas that does n't make financial sense " , " he said . <p> " We have to understand these are listed organization , of course , there has to be shareholder value that has to be created .

" And today the GamataSannivedanya project or we call it the Connect SriLanka project , is cutting across today , as we speak , we 've started working seven districts , by the end of December , we are launching three more districts , that was our target . <p> : And we are investing 50 percent of the capital expenditures required for these towers .

Many athletes took part in the 1948 Olympic Games in London with Duncan White winning Silver Medal in the 400m hurdles .

In the 1954 Asian Games in Manila only sprinter June de Krester and I , still a schoolboy , represented Ceylon . Though I was one of the four who established the new Asian Games high jump record I was placed fourth due to more misses . <p> Recommendation to improve Athletic Performance in Schools <p> The following recommendations , if implemented , will ensure that future athletes have a fair chance of qualifying to represent Sri Lanka and win medals in the South Asia and the Asian Games . <p> It is important for young athletes to take part in running and jumping events when they are in Primary Schools . <p> 1 . Dual athletic meets between schools in the same Education Zones . <p> The first three in each event in the Inter-House meets can represent their school to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preferably every weekend or every other weekend . If a weekday is scheduled then the events should be held after school hours . It is best if the Dual meets are held before the District and Provincial meets . <p> The dual competitions between schools can be similar to one-day Cricket matches once a week . Unlike cricket , Athletic Dual meets can be concluded in half a day . For example , from 1:00pm to 6:00pm . All events will be finals as there will only be 6 competitors ( 3 from each school ) for each of the 10 to 12 events . Athletic tracks marked for the School Inter-house meet can serve for all meetings during the track and field season . <p> In schools and universities in the USA , there are no speeches or ceremonial presentation of trophies or certificates . Sri Lanka schools can follow similar traditions . The results published by the schools ' website and in the local newspapers will serve as the record of performance and encouragement . The ceremonies after each event or at the end of the meet consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce resources . <p> Schools in a District or Education Zone can prepare schedule of Dual competitions for ages 13 to 19 . At present individuals who are placed in the first three in each of the competition move on to the next level . Those who did not get placed do not get a chance to compete until the next year . Dual athletic meets will give athletes in each school eight to 10 meeting to compete thus increasing their chances of improving their performance . <p> 2 . Academic Requirement to Represent the School in Competitions <p> Currently there are no academic requirements in Sri Lanka for a student to represent the school in sports competitions . In all high schools in the United States student need to maintain a credit pass average to represent their school in any sports . Similar regulation exists in all universities . Such requirement ensures that the student-athlete focus on learning also .

@@33527232 <h> Black , White and Grey Markets : The Dynamics of Foreign Exchange and Remittances in Sri Lanka <p> December , 17 , 2021 <p> By Bilesha Weeraratne <h> Written Ahead of International Migrants ' Day on December 18 , 2021 <p> Despite the pandemic and related difficulties in remitting , remittances to Sri Lanka had picked up by December 2020 to record year-over-year growth of 5.8 % , contrary to all expectations . <p> The reasons for such a quick rebound include catching up on postponed remittances , accumulated terminal employment benefits and savings-related remittances of migrant workers laid off due to the pandemic , receipt of counter-cyclical remittances from less frequent remitters and the shift from informal to formal channels . In the current context of the foreign exchange crisis in Sri Lanka , the latter is the most critical factor to focus on . <p> From Informal to Formal Channels <p> The fundamental reason for remitters to shift from informal to formal channels was the accessibility issue during lockdowns or limited physical operations . Similarly , the increased risk of informal channels may have encouraged the use of formal channels . With adjustments to operate under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reasonable to assume that the informal remittance channels may have also evolved to function during the pandemic . As such , the Central Bank of Sri Lanka 's ( CBSL 's ) Special Deposit Accounts ( SDA ) , with its 1-2% higher interest rate and the LKR 2 higher foreign exchange rate for remittances channelled through licensed commercial banks ( LCBs ) , were woefully inadequate to retain such recently converted formal remitters . <p> Black , White and Grey Foreign Exchange Rates <p> One of the key attractions of informal remittances is the relatively low cost , partly due to the more attractive exchange rate offered by informal channels . The recent movements in the official LKR/USD foreign exchange rate indicated high pressure towards further depreciation and the excess demand amidst the deteriorating supply of USDs within the Sri Lankan economy resulted in a wide divergence between the exchange rate offered by the LCBs -- the white market , and non-bank but authorised money exchangers . The latter can be termed ' the grey market ' because they are permitted to buy foreign exchange , albeit did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced compared with those of the black market or kerb rate . <p> Figure 1 below indicates a wide gap exceeding LKR 25 across the different foreign exchange markets from July to November 2021 . This gap created an opportunity for informal remittances exchanged in the Sri Lankan grey or black foreign exchange market to be more rewarding to remitters . The extra LKR 2 and the subsequent top-up to an extra LKR 10 offered by the LCBs paled in comparison ! Finally , in early December 2021 , those in the grey market were forced to adhere to the soft pegged LKR/USD 198-202 rate . <p> As seen in the top panel in Figure 2 , when the CBSL intervention stabilised the LKR-USD exchange rate , formal remittances to Sri Lanka shown in the bottom panel continued on a steeper decline in October and November 2021 . <p> Desperate Measures <p> In 2021 various mechanisms were rolled out to access foreign currency available in the economy . In May 2021 , the CBSL directed that LCBs sell 10% of inward worker remittances converted to the CBSL . In October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export proceeds was expanded to cover services . The change also shifted away from a 25% limit , to converting the " residual " after utilising goods and services export proceeds . <p> The Attractiveness of Informal Channels <p> This latest update has resulted in much confusion . Though the CBSL indicated that this directive would not affect worker remittances , operationally , this does not appear very likely . A single Personal Foreign Currency Account ( PFCA ) may receive foreign exchange as worker remittances from a family member or a well-wisher and payment for trade-in services . The method of distinguishing the two types of inward remittances is still unclear to many . At the same time , many individuals have already received correspondence from commercial banks requesting to convert the funds in their PFCAs . <p> Amidst the confusion and effort to protect workers ' foreign currency earnings , more migrant workers are seeking informal channels to remit , while others refrain from or delay remitting . Yet others are diverting their remittances to accounts held overseas . <p> Remittances are seasonal . As such , official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prematurely considered an indicator of the success of the recent efforts to increase remittances or divert from informal to formal channels . The departures for labour migration during the first half of 2021 are a mere third of the pre-pandemic departures in the same period in 2019 . Many migrant workers who return are unable to find foreign jobs and this depleted stock of Sri Lankan migrant workers is a weak base to prop up formal remittances . <p> Moreover , domestic economic hardship makes many migrants and families desirous of a possible extra return through informal remittance channels . As such , excessive regulations to clamp down on informal remittances may inadvertently create a breeding ground for even greater informal activities and black markets , thereby proving entirely counter-productive to the intended objectives . <p> Future efforts to increase remittances should not underestimate the resilience of informal remittance channels crafted along the centuries-old method of Undiyal or Hawala . Thus , instead of overly focusing on shifting from informal to formal channels of remittances , policies should mainly focus on ensuring a more realistic exchange rate .

@@42815240 <h> Behind and Beyond Burqa Ban <p> Speaking in Parliament on the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry ( PCoI ) into the Easter serial blasts of 2019 , Public Safety Minister , Rear-Adm Sarath Weerasekara ( retd ) has indicated the government 's decision to ban madarasas and burqua , both identified with the Islamic community the world over . He has claimed that this would help de-radicalise Islam in the country . <p> True of not , it is the kind of cure , Europe has been practising post-9/11 , citing similar reasons . Hence , the protesting Muslims in the country are most unlikely to get a sympathetic hearing in the West . This is unlike in the case of the Government 's refusal to let the burial of the nation 's Covid dead until it became an add-on issue for the pending UNHRC resolution , due for vote later this month . <p> Questions are often raised if such decisions are motivated by reasons other than de-radicalising Islam in individual countries and communities . They are not wholly untrue , maybe , yes . Both are considered symbols of Islamic religious orthodoxy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremism and terrorism . Or , that have become prescribed pointers in non-Islamic countries the world over . <p> Truth to be acknowledged , madrasas for the teaching of Islam , and burqua , a full-body cover for Muslim women in the presence of male members of the society that are not immediately family , are identities that Islam has followed almost since inception , centuries ago . But they were confined to the region in which the religion was born , but did not travel with Islam wherever it travelled during those early centuries . <p> Instead , they were interpolated externalisation that travelled to distant lands such as Sri Lanka in the past couple of decades . In the non-orthodox regions across the world where these symbols , especially the burqua , has since become a symbol of orthodox Islam , radicalisation was either a step ahead or has followed -- - or , has accompanied the same . <p> Of the two , the burqua especially has become a visible symbol , on the streets , schools and other public places , unlike the madrasas , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities -- unless of course newer ones have sprouted up , either to spread the message to more of the faithful , or to give a call for the same . <p> Non-traditional region <p> The burqua did not belong here until not very long ago . Supporters and sympathisers in non-traditional region , including South Asia , want to argue that it was a cause of the US-led West 's targeting of individuals and communities post-9/11 , and the wars against Islamic nations such as Afghanistan and Iraq . Afghanistan had slipped into chaos long ago , ever since the West , in the company of Pakistan , and the likes of Osama bin-Laden , joined hands to force the exit of Soviet Union from the link- nation between South Asia and Central Asia . <p> In Afghanistan , the Islamic warriors enforced orthodoxy , fundamentalism , death , terrorism and destruction . Not so in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , which was as ' modern ' in religious practices as modern religious practices could go , anywhere in any faith . It is this that made the Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with geo-politics and geo-strategy of the times and since , rather than Islam . But the US used religion to push Saddam and Iraq into a pre-determined corner . <p> Born-again Muslim <p> In Sri Lanka , Islam came after the Arab traders had been doing so for centuries earlier . When families back home converted to the new religion , founded in the name of Allah , those traders brought it to the Sri Lankan shores . It was so also in the case of southern Tamil Nadu . There was no war or blood-shed , as was the case in north India and what is now Pakistan , Afghanistan , etc .... <p> So , until Islamic revivalism reached the nation 's shores in recent decades , no Muslim woman here had worn , and possibly even seen a burqua , until tourism began bringing in rich Arabs with their families . The dress was an attraction up to a time , intrusions afterwards , and imposition , later on . <p> Today , the burqua has become a symbol of the religion , religious togetherness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of born-again Christians across the world , it should be just as much and nothing more . This is true of Buddhism , Hinduism and all other faiths . Caught in the web of globalised materialism , which is a part of market capitalism of the West , everyone seems wanting to take to religion in a big way or small , at some point in their lives . <p> This seems to be happening with Islam , too , in this country . But this has got a new meaning and method , no thanks to the emerging and evolving global situation . Today , burqua , in a non-traditional Islamic community/country , is not a symbol of a born-again Muslim woman , but that of a **26;4267;TOOLONG person from the religion . <p> The same can not be said of madrasas , which should have reached these shores along with the religion .

It was argued on the side that wanted culprits could cover themselves with a burqua and make good their escape . Does a ban on burqua , however , serve anything more than symbolism of a different kind ? <p> True , Muslim women who may have taken to orthodox religion , would want to wear burqua , yes . At least some of them had done so while in the Gulf-Arab nations , where their husbands were/are employed -- and may have brought the practice back home . For others in the neighbourhood , it could have become an identification-mark , but not necessarily for all those that had imported the symbolism in the first place . <p> As war-time Navy official , Minister Weerasekara should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt out for the same only aggravated the situation , forced the LTTE to the wall , from which they began fighting back and hitting back with a vengeance . And ending those symbolisms did not help in the end , with the LTTE . It will not help in the case of Islamic radicalisation . The latter class will survive and thrive despite such bans . It would only hurt the sentiments of the religious orthodoxy , pushing them to the wall .... <p> It is not the case with madrasas . But banning the same alone would not help . What could instead be tried is for the Government to modernise and regulate madrasas , and make their functioning more transparent and accountable . In doing so , the Government should also appeal to the good senses of the ulema , which had alerted the previous Government , for instance , about the arrival and advent of the Zaharans of the world , to see if learning religion in Arabic , a foreign language in these parts , should be encouraged . <p> It 's after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strident streak of Wahhabism rather than moderate Islam .

Its more premium sibling , the Xperia 1 II , was a better phone on paper but the value/specs ratio of the Xperia 5 II trumped it . We 're not quite sure if that 's going to happen this year with the Sony Xperia 1 III , though . <p> Simply put , the Xperia 1 III might be the best 2021 choice for Android enthusiasts . It makes very few compromises in almost all respects and even offers a few features that competitors simply do n't . Of course , its price , availability , and software might be its ultimate downfalls . In this buyer 's guide , we 'll break down everything you need to know about this premium flagship ! <h> Sony Xperia 1 III at a glance <p> The Sony Xperia 1 III is Sony 's top-tier premium flagship for 2021 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every other Sony phone on the market is now objectively weaker than this one in nearly all regards . <p> One of the best aspects of premium Sony flagships is their cameras . While they often lack the versatility of some other brands ' offerings , they usually are terrific at capturing crisp , stunning images as well as beautiful video . This year we expect to see more formidable results from the Xperia 1 III . Unfortunately , we also expect to see the same confusion regarding hardware capabilities and software usage -- more on that in a bit . <p> The Sony Xperia 1 III has a 4K display , a Snapdragon 888 processor , and a headphone jack . What more could you want ? <p> Outside of the camera , the Sony Xperia 1 III features all the usual 2021 premium flagship staples . That includes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor , 5G support , tons of RAM , plenty of internal storage , wireless charging , reverse wireless charging , and fast wired charging . You 'll also get a 4K OLED display , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unfortunately , we expect the Xperia 1 III to be a very expensive phone . We also expect it to be tricky to get in some areas of the world . Software updates will likely be slow and infrequent as well . These are the trade-offs one needs to make with pretty much any Sony phone . <h> Is the Sony Xperia 1 III worth buying ? <p> With Sony phones , you need to make your decision based on what you prioritize . If you want an affordable flagship with frequent Android updates and ultra-fast wired and wireless charging , this likely is n't the phone for you . <p> Instead , folks who want a powerful camera , a headphone jack , expandable storage , and one of the highest-resolution displays you can get on any phone would likely love the Sony Xperia 1 III . The headphone jack , in particular , is a feature that pretty much no other OEMs offer with flagships . The only other company that frequently did so was LG , and it is no longer in the smartphone game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone with a headphone jack , the Xperia 1 III is one of your very few choices . <p> We have more information on the camera below , but the biggest thing you need to keep in mind there is that the software has a reputation for being really confusing . Professionals love it because of its versatility , but people acclimated to the point-and-shoot ease of cameras on Samsung , Google , and Apple phones will face a learning curve . <p> Overall , the Sony Xperia 1 III looks to be an incredible phone that could be worth its sure-to-be-high price . However , the phone appeals to a pretty niche audience rather than the average buyer . <h> What AA readers think of the Xperia 1 III <p> In October 2020 , we ran a poll asking our readers what they were most excited to see on the Xperia 1 III . There were five preset options and then a catch-all " other " option . You can see how the poll results break down in the chart below : <p> Interestingly , Sony delivered on pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The camera has a very unique telephoto lens which will offer a more versatile experience . The headphone jack stuck around , the display refresh rate is high , and the phone has 30W wired charging . It even works natively with the Sony PlayStation DualShock 4 controller , which fits in with the " Better PlayStation integration " option . <p> Of course , this poll happened months ago . We 'll run more polls in the future to get a gauge on what our readers think now that the phone is official . If you want to participate in some polls right now , head to the bottom of this article ! <h> Sony Xperia 1 III specs <p> The Sony Xperia 1 III features the predictable 2021 upgrades . However , it also boasts a stunning 4K display and a unique telephoto lens setup . See our specs table below , and scroll down a bit for a comparison between the Xperia 1 III and last year 's Xperia 1 II . <h> What 's up with these camera lenses ? <p> In the specs table above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a quad-lens array on the back . Predictably , there 's a primary lens flanked by a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens . Rounding it out , there 's a time-of-flight sensor ( ToF ) that helps with depth perception and focus tracking . <p> Fun fact : Sony makes the lenses that appear in most high-end flagships . The sensors in the Galaxy S21 lineup , as well as the OnePlus 9 lineup , are all made by Sony , for example . As such , the lenses here are predictably high in quality and represent some of the best hardware available . <p> The odd-ball-out , though , is the telephoto lens . In the specs table , you 'll see that this lens has a 70mm and 105mm size label . To be clear , this does not mean it is capable of zooming in from 70mm to 105mm . It actually means that it has just those two distinct focal lengths : 70mm ( 2.9x ) and 105mm ( 5x ) . You can jump from one to the other , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sony used a mechanical periscope-style system to physically move the lens to those distinct points . This allows for a true optical zoom of 2.9x or 5x . Interestingly , though , anything between those two focal lengths ( like 4x , for example ) will involve a digital crop . That 's the big difference between this setup and the one we 've seen on phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra , which offers 1x , 3x , and 10x optical zoom with hybrid zoom in between . <p> The bottom line here is that this is a very unique camera setup that is a bit more limited than it might seem . Yes , you 're going to get lossless optical zoom at 2.9x and 5x , but you are locked to those two settings . <h> How is battery life on the Xperia 1 III ? <p> The Sony Xperia 1 III has a 4,500mAh battery . This is n't a huge battery when compared to other ultra-premium flagships . The Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 5,000mAh battery , for example , and the Asus ROG Phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fine for a phone of this size . The wildcard , though , is that 4K display . A display pushing that many pixels at a 120Hz refresh rate is going to tear through battery power . We 're going to need to conduct our usual tests before we can say if the battery lasts long enough or not , but it 's likely battery life wo n't be incredible with the Xperia 1 III . <p> Thankfully , the phone can charge at a rate of 30W using the in-box charger . That 's the fastest wired charging we 've yet seen on a Sony phone . Granted , OnePlus has phones that charge more than twice as fast as that , but the entire Galaxy S21 lineup charges slower ( and does n't have in-box chargers ) . In other words , Sony 's 30W speeds are faster than some , slower than others . <p> The Sony Xperia 1 III also features wireless charging and reverse wireless charging . That means you can charge the phone at standard speeds using a wireless charging system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by placing another wireless charging device on the back , such as earbuds or a smartwatch . However , with the expected power-drain of that 4K display , you might be looking to preserve as much juice as possible for the phone itself . <h> How is the Xperia 1 III performance ? <p> Inside the Sony Xperia 1 III , you 'll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset . This is currently the fastest and most powerful mobile chipset for Android phones . It 's paired with a hefty 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage . As such , we expect performance to be pretty great while using this phone . <p> Granted , hardware only tells half the story . Sony 's Android skin -- known as Xperia UI -- is a pretty lean system that usually performs well . We 'll need to put it through our suite of tests , but we 're expecting solid marks when it comes to overall performance . <h> Phone software and updates <p> Simply put , Sony 's history when it comes to Android updates and upgrades is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst offender , most of its phones languish on older versions of Android even months after the latest launch . Likewise , Android security patches come at a slow and irregular pace . <p> For a lot of our readers , software updates are a big deal . Not only do they bring new features and bug fixes , but security patches help keep phones safe . For them , Sony 's historical lack of regard for the importance of software upkeep is a major issue . <p> You , however , might not care much about software updates . You also might be the kind of user who likes installing custom ROMs and relying on that community for your upgrades . If you 're in either of those situations , you 'll likely be happy . If official software is important to you , though , proceed with the Sony Xperia 1 III ( or any Sony phone ) with caution . <h> Sony Xperia 1 III vs Xperia 1 II : What 's new ? <p> Overall , Sony mostly brought the predictable 2021 upgrades to the Xperia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , a very similar camera setup , and a similar build/design . <p> The big upgrades compared to last year are the Snapdragon 888 processor , a 120Hz display refresh rate , a bigger battery , reverse wireless charging , 30W wired charging , and the more advanced telephoto lens . Outside of those , the rest of the upgrades are pretty subtle . <h> What are some good Xperia 1 III alternatives ? <p> Credit : Eric Zeman / Android Authority <p> There are a few aspects of the Sony Xperia 1 III that are unique . This includes the headphone jack , 4K display , and telephoto lens configuration . It will be tough to find those on any other 2021 flagships . <p> That being said , if you can do without those three details , here are some other phones that might be worth a look : <p> Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra ( $1,199 ) : While this phone wo n't have the same display resolution , it will be more than good enough . It also will have a more versatile camera system with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has an in-display fingerprint sensor rather than a side-mounted one . Of course , there 's no headphone jack , no microSD card slot , and no charger in the box.OnePlus 9 Pro ( $969 ) : This is OnePlus ' best phone to date , with the best camera system we 've ever seen on a OnePlus device . It has a display with similar quality to the Galaxy S21 Ultra and features wired charging that 's twice as fast as what we see on the Xperia 1 III . Of course , there 's no headphone jack , no microSD card slot , and no 4K display.Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra ( ? 1,199 ( $1,415 ) ) : This just-launched phone features the largest camera sensor of any Android phone ever . It also features similar high-end specs as the Xperia 1 III while also offering a larger battery that charges faster . However , this phone will be harder to buy for some folks , especially those in the United States.Asus ROG Phone 5 ( ? 899 ( $1,066 ) ) : This phone is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good of a camera system . However , it is one of the very few Snapdragon 888 phones out there with a headphone jack , and it does feature a 144Hz display refresh rate , trumping the Xperia 1 III 's 120Hz . This is a very different phone for a very different consumer base , but still worth a look . <h> Where to buy the Sony Xperia 1 III <p> Sony has confirmed that the phone is coming to the US in summer 2021 . The company has n't revealed the price of the Sony Xperia 1 III though . We expect the company to announce pricing closer to the launch window . <p> However , judging from Sony 's pricing history , this phone will likely be quite expensive . Last year , the Xperia 1 II launched at $1,199 . With the bevy of upgrades coming with this new model , we should expect pricing to be the same or even higher . <p> Of course , Samsung threw us all for a loop by dropping the overall pricing for its latest Galaxy S21 phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to that in kind and drop the pricing of its flagship , too . However , we would n't put too big of a bet on that . <p> We will update this article as soon as Sony gives us pricing and availability info ! <h> FAQs <p> Q : Does the Sony Xperia 1 III have an IP rating ? A : Yes , but it is not a full IP68 rating . Instead , it is IP65 rated against dust and IP68 rated against water . In other words , you 'll need to be a bit more careful in dusty/dirty situations with this phone . <p> Q : Can I use the Xperia 1 III to connect to 5G networks ? A : Yes , but only certain kinds . The Xperia 1 III works with Sub-6GHz 5G , which is the most readily available variant . It does not support mmWave 5G , which is the faster-but-rarer version . <p> Q : Does it come with a charger in the box ? A : Yep ! The charger is capable of charging the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : Did Sony bring an in-display fingerprint sensor this year ? A : No . Just like last year , the Xperia 1 III has a side-mounted capacitive fingerprint sensor . <p> Q : What are the big differences between this and the cheaper Sony Xperia 5 III ? A : The Sony Xperia 1 III is physically larger than the Xperia 5 III . It also has a higher-resolution display , a ToF sensor on the back , louder speakers , a higher-grade variant of Gorilla Glass , and wireless/reverse wireless charging . Other than those features , the phones are very similar . <p> Q : What colors can I get for the phone ? A : There are two choices this year : Frosted Black and Frosted Purple .

' <p> On Twitter , Jeremy Vine alleged that the tulip attack might have been the work of One Chiswick , a local group campaigning against the cycle lanes , which it sees as dangerous , congestion-causing and damaging to local businesses . <p> Vine wrote : ' I do n't know if any member of the anti-cycling group @RealOneChiswick is involved in this , but it might be good if they offered to fund the replanting of this lady 's garden to indicate they regret the abuse they have levelled at her . They will know who she is . ' <p> Yet we have established there may be rather more to the story than Mr Vine has claimed . <p> On the Twitter account run by Ms Liebreich under the name of her business , Abundance London , she has furiously blamed squirrels -- not anti-cycling campaigners -- for causing mayhem in her garden . <p> ' Before we get too sentimental about cute squirrels , they decapitate tulips just for fun . . . Bloody wildlife ! ' she complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 . ' He sic ate all the tulip bulbs except two , and now he has wilfully destroyed both flowers for no reasons other than spite . ' <p> And last year , she wrote : ' Bloody squirrel ! Here he is . . . enjoying one of the 100 tulips . . . we 've just planted for him to enjoy . ' <p> Could Mr Vine have been mistaken and been unfair in hastily blaming Chiswick 's cycle-lane opponents for the damage ? It would certainly appear so . <p> Guy Barter , chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society , also believes testosterone-fuelled squirrels were to blame . <p> ' Young male squirrels , when trying to find a mate , are quite happy to engage in acts of random violence , causing substantial damage , ' he told me . ' They do n't eat the tulips , just leave the heads on the ground . ' <p> Despite this substantial evidence , there seems to be no question of an apology or retraction from the broadcasting star . <p> The Mail emailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a list of detailed questions . Mr Armstrong told us the broadcaster was in studios and working back-to-back all day so would not be able to comment . <p> Nor would Ms Liebreich comment on Mr Vine 's allegations by email , and when we called on her home -- the scene of the crime -- we were told that she was not available . <p> Those campaigning against Chiswick 's cycle lanes are outraged that Mr Vine rushed -- without , it seems , any proof -- to blame them for the vandalism , when Ms Liebreich 's own evidence strongly pointed to the true culprits being rodents . <p> Her group has collected 10,000 signatures for a petition against the council 's anti-car measures -- the population of Chiswick is less than 35,000 -- and is aiming to seek a judicial review of the cycle lanes and LTNs in the High Court . <p> They believe Mr Vine has taken advantage of his position to strong-arm neighours into accepting his own views on cycle lanes -- and unfairly blamed One Chiswick . <p> ' This must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is simply bullying us -- and is allowed to get away with it because the BBC looks at ' talent ' differently from anyone else who might be working there . ' <p> Ms Frew has complained to the BBC about Vine 's behaviour , which she insists breaches the strict guidelines on social media brought in last year by new Director-General Tim Davie . <p> Margie Frew thinks Vine 's tweet about the tulips ' was all about his ego . He is an exhibitionist -- that 's why he cycles on a penny-farthing -- and I suspect he was just trying to wind up his 700,000 followers who are often militant cyclists . ' <p> The BBC 's guidelines say that staff should not ' express a personal opinion on matters of public policy , politics or ' controversial subjects ' ' , or be seen to support a particular campaign . <p> A spokeswoman said the BBC 's Executive Complaints Unit was dealing with the complaint . She added : ' Jeremy is aware of his duty under the BBC 's social media guidelines . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of Chiswick will reach any sort of truce soon . The council is adamant that its green agenda will prevail , irrespective of the impact of the cycle lanes and the LTNs on local residents . <p> Muriel Langley lives in Home House , a 100-flat residential complex for elderly people close to Chiswick High Road . <p> ' Since the cycle lanes were put in , I 've found it almost impossible to walk across the road with my walker , ' she told the Mail . ' I used to be able to walk across slowly and then stop in one of the refuges . But they 've gone now -- to make way for the bikes . It 's very dangerous . ' <p> Another resident , Lorraine Nepstad , emphatically referred to the lanes as ' the rape of Chiswick ' . <p> Sally Price , who runs local interior design shop Insider Dealings , told us it now takes her 25 minutes to drive along Chiswick High Road , adding : ' That is going to be off-putting to my customers . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now under review , adding : ' Once the review has considered all the feedback and evidence , we will decide which Streetspace LTN trials will be made permanent and which removed or amended . ' <p> In Ealing , next to Chiswick , the council 's Labour leader Julian Bell was recently deposed after his catastrophic handling of the council 's LTNs , which outraged locals and led to widespread gridlock . <p> Perhaps Chiswick , too , will soon suffer some political casualties -- and it wo n't just be a handful of tulips losing their heads .

@@62763236 <p> Have the Superpowers ever helped the Third World Countries ? Posted on March 23rd , 2021 <h> by Garvin Karunaratne <p> Today at the UNHRC in Geneva we have seen the UK and other Developed Countries sponsor a vote against our country . In detail , this resolution involves the UNHRC establishing a programme to document human rights violations and find and preserve evidence against our war heroes for prosecution in International courts for incidents where they had to use fire power to defend the sovereign country . It is time we stop adoring the UK . It follows that sanctions will inevitably follow . <p> Even India that should have stood with us abstained . Yet we implement the 13 th Amendment imposed on our country by force- our President Jayawardena shivered in his boots and gave in and he even incarcerated his members of parliament in a Four Star Hotel and marched them to Parliament to approve the 13 th Amendment , the implementation of which will someday split our country into two . He held letters of resignation signed by his members of parliament which he threatened to use to deprive them of their seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy ' of Jayawardena , the Don Juan Dharmapala of our time who sold our country to India and the IMF . <p> In this context it is worthwhile assessing whether the Superpowers ever helped our countries . <p> From the Fifteenth Century , the Superpowers conquered over half the World and imposed their colonial domination . Sovereign countries that had till then enjoyed peace , had self reliant and self sufficient economies were structurally altered to produce crops for export and also to be the consumers of the manufactured products of the Superpowers . The highlands lands in the hills , that enabled people to obtain their firewood and building materials , where their cattle were tethered during the paddy cultivation and also retained water throughout the drought months for cultivation was taken over under the Crown Lands Ordinance which deemed that all unoccupied land belonged to the State . These lands were then sold to Europeans at some five shillings an acre for opening up plantations . <p> In Sri Lanka the railways were built to bring down tea and rubber from the hill country . To build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( normally enlisted for two weeks a year , to maintain the village infrastructure of tanks and channels ) , to pull down the forest , clear the rail track and laydown rails . People were forced to travel from far . It is reported that the number of people killed by snake bites while laying the rail track is more than the number of sleepers on the rail track . <p> The Superpowers benefitted from the colonial economies . From Bengal , a small state of India , when the East India Company defeated Shiraj Ud Daulah , the ruler of Bengal 2,750 million pounds was sent to Britain , - in the first eight years of Company rule , 5.9 million pounds were extracted out of Bengal ... In the 1770 famine where a third of the population of Bengal died , more taxes were colleted than in the earlier year .... the yearly drain of wealth from India represents at least pounds 35 million . " This income from all colonies enabled Britain to become wealthy , build skyscrapers , develop social security and free health systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign states the Superpowers had to change their modus operandi . Then it became controlling the countries very unofficially , covertly and at times enforced with threats . <p> In 1953 , a CIA Coup was staged in Iran . . The CIA ousted the democratically elected ruler , Mohammed Mosadegh , ushered in a quarter century of brutal rule under the Shah and stimulated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and anti Americanism in the Middle East . ( Stephen Kinzer : All the Shah 's Men ) <p> Mossadegh had sought to make Iran a full democracy . He nationalized the Iranian Oil industry that belonged to the Anglo Iranian Oil Company . In August 2013 , the CIA formally admitted that it was involved both in the planning and the execution of the coup , including the bribing of Iranian politicians , security and army high ranking officials as well as pre-coup propaganda .

He told me again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Afghanistan when he promised to take me all over the country when he goes on circuit . Afghanistan was a prosperous country till the USA and Russia invaded it under various pretexts . Today it is a country torn between war lords . <p> The sovereign countries mustered their resources and developed their agriculture and industry . Sri Lanka was in the forefront and achieved self sufficiency in paddy , the staple crop by 1970 and did wonders in the import substitution type of industry . <p> The countries developed their agriculture by having streamlined extension systems , also using people 's organizations like cooperatives and cultivation committees to plan and enlist the participation of the people . The USA itself- its , Agency for International Development and its Ford Foundation backed by expertise at Michigan State University , spearheaded a rural development programme in the Kotwali Thana of the Comilla District . In under a decade the yield of paddy was doubled , industries were developed and poverty was totally alleviated . Kotwali Thana is today an oasis within a poverty stricken country . Its method was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural development had to be stopped . <p> This the Superpowers did in around 1978 , through the World Bank . As each trained agricultural officer at the village level had over a thousand farmers , cooperatives were used to enable the farmers to cooperate . In Sri Lanka there were two peoples organizations- the multipurpose cooperatives and the cultivation committees to organize paddy cultivation . The World Bank barred agricultural officers from using peoples organizations . Instead the officers were asked to contact farmers direct . To make the various countries accept this system , an Aid package was offered . The Training and Visit System is financed under IDA Credit where funds are brought in on foreign aid to meet the salaries of local officers and servicing costs . The IDA Credit is also based on a grace period of 10 years so that the Government that takes the loan has nothing to worry about the consequences of repayment . " ( From : **25;2257;TOOLONG Rural Development in the Third World(1983) <p> The adoption of the Training &amp; Visit System totally destroyed the agricultural extension systems that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The USA was very keen to develop their sale of wheat .

A USA Department of Agriculture Officer once said : We taught people to eat wheat , who did not eat it before . " Orville Freeman , US Secretary of State said ; in the last seven years our agricultural exports to Taiwan climbed by 531% and to South Korea by 643% . PL480 makes good sense . " ( From Lappe &amp; Collins ; Food First : Beyond the Myth of Scarcity ) It has been proved that the inroads of wheat sales has had a detrimental effect on local agriculture in that bread found a place and ousted local grains , yams etc. that were consumed by people earlier . <p> The Third World countries were at the forefront of developing new varieties of paddy , Sri Lanka established seed producing stations and developed new varieties well before 1955 . This enabled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IMF advised the privatization of seed farms . Many important seed farms were privatized . The USA also established the International Rice Research Institute in Manila , Philippines in 1990 and sought to undermine the production of new varieties by countries . In my words : Sri Lanka was the first country to come up with miracle paddy seeds . In 1955 we had H4 and immediately afterwards H 8 . <p> We privatized most seed farms and thereby can not assure our farmers of high yielding certified seed . Distributing high yielding certified seed and organizing cultivation was the mantra by which we became self sufficient by 1970 . Our country was deprived of certified seed as well as the extension service through cooperatives , all at the behest of the World Bank . <p> Further , multinationals in the USA that deal with seeds are engaged in a massive campaign to buy all the seed farms all over the World ... Led by Monsanto they are buying seedfarms .. The multinationals are seeking patents for the seeds they develop and they have also developed ' terminator technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed does not germinate . It follows that once the multinationals develop new varieties the farmers even in the remotest areas will have to purchase new seeds from the multinationals . Gone are the days when farmers can retain their stock of seeds from the earlier harvest to the next . " ( From : How the IMF Ruined Sri Lanka ) <p> Sri Lanka is blessed with many resources . <p> The Superpowers have tried again and again to wrest control of these resources . Eppawela has a major Phosphate resource . A US multinational was interested in securing this phosphate and I quote from the Report done by scientists appointed by Minister Batty Weerakoon once Minister of Technology. ( who passed away today-6/01/2019 ) : <p> The proposal of the US mining company will exhaust the resource in 30 years , with insignificant benefit to the country . The proposal is highly environmentaly damaging and does not serve in the national interest in any manner .

This included the Marketing Department(MD) activities- the Vegetable and Fruit Purchasing Scheme under which the MD purchased vegetables and fruits from producers at a higher rate than what was offered by traders , This produce was transported to the Cities and sold at Fair Price Shops at cheap rates . The MD kept a margin of 15% for handling and wastage as opposed to 100% kept by traders . The fruits were processed into Jam and Juice , which enabled the country to become self sufficient . The MD ran rice mills which milled paddy into rice . The MD had a Bakery which produced bread and pastries . The MD used to run canteens at festivals like Kataragama where food was sold at cheap rates , competing with hoteliers . This was the infrastructure we had to combat inflation . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) forbid the countries from attending to commercial undertakings and the MD was abolished . With this the producers found it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . <p> Under the advice of the IMF , which is run by the Superpowers , development was brought to a standstill . <p> Despite the overtures of President Clinton on his current visit to Bangladesh , the Prime Minister of Bangladesh has refused to change Bangladesh 's long held stance against the liberalization of of gas exports until local needs were met and a fifty year reserve was assured . President Clinton had earlier announced $ 97 million in food aid , $ 84 million in clean energy initiatives and $ 8.6 million to reduce abusive child labour , ' debt for nature ' swap and forgave $ 6 million in Bangladesh 's external debt but Prime Minister Sheik Hassina stood her ground stating , ' we would like to lead a life of dignity ' . The decision of the Government of Bangladesh disappointed US and British Companies as well as the World Bank . Their idea was to prise open the gas reserves of Bangladesh for exploitation by multinationals and the bulk of the wealth created would flow to the Western Companies .

Instead they want us to produce raw materials , sell it to them and buy their manufactures . <p> Sri Lanka is already trapped by the International Monetary Fund- the IMF by their imposing the Structural Adjustment Programme on us which advised us to spend foreign exchange which we did not have and advised us to meet the shortfall with loans . We are now an indebted country to the extent of $ 60 billion , of which say half was spent on development projects-Mahaweli , roads and armaments to win the war etc and half spent to help the rich , on IMF advice . <p> It is time we shake off the shackles of domination from foreign Superpowers and their IMF .

@@62800234 <h> Senaka Weeraratna <p> There is so much publicity today in the Western Media of the vile nature of the Burmese ( Myanmar ) Army . <p> Before the Army took power overthrowing the Govt. of Aung San Suu Kyi recently , the entire Western media was gunning for Aung San Suu Kyi branding her as a tyrant engaged in the persecution of Bengali Muslims who had infiltrated Myanmar illegally and calling themselves as ' Rohingyas ' . <p> All the accolades she had won previously were withdrawn one by one by western institutions and Universities for the ' crime ' of not allowing illegal immigrants to settle down in Myanmar permanently . <p> Now again she is projected in better light by the media in order to demonise the Myanmar Army . <p> What the vast majority of readers all over the world do not know ( and which is kept hidden from them ) are the factors that have contributed substantially to the political and economic crisis of Myanmar . <p> The exploitation of Burma by the British Empire . <p> This article was written by an Englishman E.A. Blair in 1929 and archived by the Orwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN BURMA <p> Following the recent troubles in India , we have asked our contributor , Mr E. A. Blair , whose investigations on ' The Plight of the British Worker ' have already appeared in these pages , to tell us something of the unrest which has been fermenting in the sub-continent for some years , and which is threatening to spread to English Indo-China . <p> Mr E. A. Blair , who lived in Burma for some years , has written the following interesting article for us1 , which shows the methods the British Empire uses to milk dry her Asian colonies . <p> Burma lies between India and China . Ethnologically it belongs to Indo-China . <p> It is three times the size of England and Wales , with a population of about fourteen million , of whom roughly nine million are Burmese . <p> The rest is made up of countless Mongol tribes who have emigrated at various periods from the steppes of Central Asia , and Indians who have arrived since the English occupation . <p> The Burmese are Buddhists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to talk in their own language to the people of such diverse origins living in Burma , you would need to know a hundred and twenty different languages and dialects . <p> This country , the population of which is one-tenth as dense as that of England , is one of the richest in the world . It abounds in natural resources which are only just beginning to be exploited . <p> There are tin , tungsten , jade and rubies , and these are the least of its mineral materials . <p> At this moment it produces five per cent of the world 's petroleum , and its reserves are far from exhausted . <p> But the greatest source of wealth-and that which feeds between eighty and ninety per cent of the population-is the paddy fields . <p> Rice is grown everywhere in the basin of the Irrawaddy River , which flows through Burma from north to south . <p> In the south , in the huge delta where the Irrawaddy brings down tons of alluvial mud every year , the soil is immensely fertile . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enable Burma to export rice to India , Europe , even to America . <p> Moreover , variations in temperature are less frequent and sharp than in India . <p> Thanks to abundant rainfall , especially in the south , drought is unknown , and the heat is never excessive . The climate as a whole can thus be considered one of the healthiest to be found in the tropics . <p> So it is hardly surprising that the English tried for a long time to gain possession of it . <p> In 1820 they seized a vast expanse of territory . This operation was repeated in 1852 , and finally in 1882 the Union Jack flew over almost all the country . Certain mountainous districts in the north , inhabited by small savage tribes , had until recently escaped the clutches of the British , but it is more and more likely that they will meet the same fate as the rest of the country , thanks to the process euphemistically known as ' peaceful penetration ' , which means , in plain English , ' peaceful annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to praise or blame this manifestation of British imperialism ; let us simply note it is a logical result of any imperialist policy . <p> It will be much more profitable to examine the good and bad sides of British administration in Burma from an economic and a political standpoint . <p> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <p> Let us turn first to politics . <p> The government of all the Indian provinces under the control of the British Empire is of necessity despotic , because only the threat of force can subdue a population of several million subjects . <p> But this despotism is latent . It hides behind a mask of democracy . <p> The great maxim of the English in governing an oriental race is ' never get something done by a European when an Oriental can do it ' . In other words , supreme power remains with the British authorities , but the minor civil servants who have to carry out day-to-day administration and who must come into contact with the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burma , for example , the lower grade magistrates , all policemen up to the rank of inspector , members of the postal service , government employees , village elders etc. are Burmese . <p> Recently , to appease public opinion and put a stop to nationalist agitation which was beginning to cause concern , it was even decided to accept the candidature of educated natives for several important posts . <p> The system of employing natives as civil servants has three advantages . <p> First , natives will accept lower salaries than Europeans . <p> Secondly , they have a better idea of the workings of their fellow countrymen 's minds , and this helps them to settle legal disputes more easily . <p> Thirdly , it is to their own advantage to show their loyalty to a government which provides their livelihood . <p> And so peace is maintained by ensuring the close collaboration of the educated or semi-educated classes , where discontent might otherwise produce rebel leaders . <p> Nevertheless the British control the country . Of course , Burma , like each of the Indian provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parliament has very little power . <p> Nothing of any consequence lies within its jurisdiction . Most of the members are puppets of the government , which is not above using them to nip in the bud any Bill which seems untimely . <p> In addition , each province has a Governor , appointed by the English , who has at his disposal a veto just as absolute as that of the President of the United States to oppose any proposal which displeases him . <p> Yet although the British government is , as we have shown , essentially despotic , it is by and canals-in their own interest , of course , but the Burmese benefit from them-they set up hospitals , open schools , and see to the maintenance of law and order . <p> And after all , the Burmese are mere peasants , occupied in cultivating the land . <p> They have not yet reached that stage of intellectual development which makes for nationalists . <p> Their village is their universe , and as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do not care whether their masters are black or white . <p> A proof of this political apathy on the part of the people of Burma is the fact that the only British military forces in the country are two English infantry battalions and around ten battalions of Indian infantry and mounted police . <p> Thus twelve thousand armed men , mostly Indians , are enough to subdue a population of fourteen million . <p> The most dangerous enemies of the government are the young men of the educated classes . If these classes were more numerous and were really educated , they could perhaps raise the revolutionary banner . But they are not . <p> The reason is firstly that , as we have seen , the majority of the Burmese are peasants . <p> Secondly , the British government is at pains to give the people only summary instruction , which is almost useless , merely sufficient to produce messengers , low-grade civil servants , petty lawyers ' clerks and other white-collar workers . <p> Care is taken to avoid technical and industrial training . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from becoming an industrial country capable of competing with England . <p> It is true to say that in general , any really educated Burmese was educated in England , and belongs as a result to the small class of the well-to-do . <p> So , because there are no educated classes , public opinion , which could press for rebellion against England , is non-existent . <p> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <p> Let us now consider the economic question . Here again we find the Burmese in general too ignorant to have a clear understanding of the way in which they are being treated and , as a result , too ignorant to show the least resentment . <p> Besides , for the moment they have not suffered much economic damage . <p> It is true that the British seized the mines and the oil wells . It is true that they control timber production . It is true that all sorts of middlemen , brokers , millers , exporters , have made colossal fortunes from rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> It is also true that the get-rich-quick businessmen who made their pile from rice , petrol etc. are not contributing as they should be to the well-being of the country , and that their money , instead of swelling local revenues in the form of taxes , is sent abroad to be spent in England . <p> If we are honest , it is true that the British are robbing and pilfering Burma quite shamelessly . <p> But we must stress that the Burmese hardly notice it for the moment . Their country is so rich , their population so scattered , their needs , like those of all Orientals , so slight that they are not conscious of being exploited . <p> The peasant cultivating his patch of ground lives more or less as his ancestors did in Marco Polo 's day . If he wishes , he can buy virgin land for a reasonable price . <p> He certainly leads an arduous existence , but he is on the whole free from care . <p> Hunger and unemployment are for him meaningless words . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> But , and this is the important point , the Burmese will begin to suffer when a large part of the richness of their country has declined . <p> Although Burma has developed to a certain extent since the war , already the peasant there is poorer than he was twenty years ago . <p> He is beginning to feel the weight of land taxation , for which he is not compensated by the increased yield of his harvests . <p> The worker 's wages have not kept up with the cost of living . <p> The reason is that the British government has allowed free entry into Burma for veritable hordes of Indians , who , coming from a land where they were literally dying of hunger , work for next to nothing and are , as a result , fearsome rivals for the Burmese . <p> Add to this a rapid rise in population growth-at the last census the population registered an increase of ten million in ten years-it is easy to see that sooner or later , as happens in all overpopulated countries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of semislavery in the service of capitalism , and will have to endure unemployment into the bargain . <p> They will then discover what they hardly suspect today , that the oil wells , the mines , the milling industry , the sale and cultivation of rice are all controlled by the British . <p> They will also realise their own industrial incompetence in a world where industry dominates . <p> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <p> British politics in Burma is the same as in India . <p> Industrially speaking , India was deliberately kept in ignorance . <p> She only produces basic necessities , made by hand . The Indians would be incapable , for example , of making a motor-car , a rifle , a clock , an electric-light bulb etc . They would be incapable of building or sailing an ocean-going vessel . <p> At the same time they have learnt in their dealings with Westerners to depend on certain machine-made articles . So the products of English factories find an important outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign competition is prevented by an insuperable barrier of prohibitive customs tariffs . And so the English factory-owners , with nothing to fear , control the markets absolutely and reap exorbitant profits . <p> We said that the Burmese have not yet suffered too much , but this is because they have remained , on the whole , an agricultural nation . <p> Yet for them as for all Orientals , contact with Europeans has created the demand , unknown to their fathers , for the products of modern industry . As a result , the British are stealing from Burma in two ways : <p> In the first place , they pillage her natural resources ; secondly , they grant themselves the exclusive right to sell here the manufactured products she now needs . <p> And the Burmese are thus drawn into the system of industrial capitalism , with any hope of becoming capitalist industrialists themselves . <p> Moreover the Burmese , like all the other peoples of India , remain under the rule of the British Empire for purely military considerations . For they are in effect incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for modern warfare , and , as things now stand , if the English were to give up India , it would only result in a change of master . The country would simply be invaded and exploited by some other Power . <p> British domination in India rests essentially on exchanging military protection for a commercial monopoly , but , as we have tried to show , the bargain is to the advantage of the English whose control reaches into every domain . <p> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <p> To sum up , if Burma derives some incidental benefit from the English , she must pay dearly for it . <p> Up till now the English have refrained from oppressing the native people too much because there has been no need . The Burmese are still at the beginning of a period of transition which will transform them from agricultural peasants to workers in the service of the manufacturing industries . <p> Their situation could be compared with that of any people of eighteenth-century Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowledge and power necessary for their commerce and industry belong exclusively to foreigners . <p> So they are under the protection of a despotism which defends them for its own ends , but which would abandon them without hesitation if they ceased to be of use . <p> Their relationship with the British Empire is that of slave and master . <p> Is the master good or bad ? That is not the question ; let us simply say that his control is despotic and , to put it plainly , self-interested . <p> Even though the Burmese have not had much cause for complaint up till now , the day will come when the riches of their country will be insufficient for a population which is constantly growing . <p> Then they will be able to appreciate how capitalism shows its gratitude to those to whom it owes its existence . <p> E.

@@62800235 <p> Introduction of digitalization during the festive season for sustainable educational framework <p> World is fast changing despite dangerous ' ' Covid19 ' ' -- a Pandemic leading towards success in Sri Lanka through education on vistas of prosperity and spender in order to digitalize the system and modernize the natural knowledge based on human capital to suit the 21st century on the theme ' ' Towards a perfect education that enriches wisdom and experiment ' ' on steps taken by the programme and vision of the President ' Gotabaya Rajapaksa ' , in education and digitalization on introducing a new platforms and programmes coupled with education , development and other subjects including trade and international issues- a leap frog from programme for the future . It is a salutary news that Sri Lanka is keeping pace with the modern developments even during the festive season easing the citizen pressurised with pandemic and economic hardships due to economic downturns world over . It is indeed salutary that digitalization and modern international platforms are utilized in combating ' ' Covid 19 ' ' and development strategies including agriculture which is in the topic of the agenda today . <p> Festive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime <p> Festive season is nearing and the talk of the town is the prices of consumer items and the legal frame work which has not still been settled on trade , business , competition and prices of items in demand . There is a leading news by the Minister ' Bandula Gunawardena ' that Consumer Protection act of 1979 will be amended when in fact it is repealed by the Consumer Affairs Authority Act no 9 of 2003 on 17th march 2003 with other existing legislation amalgamating the current act which is a combination of Australian , Canadian , Modelled system with basic English principles partly embodied in the act which is not a properly effective piece of legislation in action today . It is the duty of the officials to brief the minister on updates on legislature on making such important public statements which are the basis of current and future changes on legislature , when the Minister again claims to change current old and outdated legal structure to be proactive modern and applicable for the current developments . Minister has quite correctly stated that the current legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' needing drastic changes and vigour with modern changes on the digital age with new international platforms and developments in line with the changes world over . Act no 9 of 2003 changed the existing ( then ) pattern and structure of successful concept of price control still in force in the United Kingdom to the current system of regularization of trade also based on competition law and modern commercial law concepts , which has not been understood by the successive regimes attempted to implement the concept introduced by Hon ' Lalith Atulathmudali ' then Minister of Trade who introduced the legislation with best of intentions which unfortunately unsuccessful on implementation . Undisputedly change of the CAA act is badly needed and the CAA during successive Chairmen has attempted to do so with no success . It is advisable to seek the advice of the previous chairmen in the process . <p> Drastic changes necessary <p> This is not the time for immediate major drastic changes of law , and best is to give time and long space for a complete and comprehensive study in the law and practice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is news today is the controversy over coconut oil , paddy and rice prices , alleged sugar scam , and rising cost of living due to price rise of every consumer item the CAA has miserably failed to answer . How does the price structure operate in Sri Lanka is very interesting . Trader can sell consumer prizes at any reasonable price provided it is of good quality and of quality health standards in order to provide the prize mark is exhibited on the show room cage for the citizen clearly seen identifying the items , whereas under the previous legislation control of prices act 173 ( which is repealed ) prize mark was strictly adhered to on conditions on price control legislation with prize control system . Then what is the maximum prize ? In the current prize regime and the fluctuation of the prizes of paddy , rice , sugar , coconut ect are issues confronted to the consumer which is bit hard to understand to follow . It is operative under S/18 of the act when the Minister and the Authority can determine the wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notification with the condition that 18(2) . No manufacturer or trader shall increase the retail for wholesale price of any goods of and services specified under subsection ( 1 ) except with the prior written approval of the authority . This is not effective and straight as the price control procedure which is working well in UK which is repealed here in 1979 . Attempts have been made to change the consumer law on many previous occasions and today we have to be extra cautious due to the modern trends , introduction of new international platforms and changes due to digitalization process which is ever growing with the mobile penetration of 110% of the population and the developments on the knowledge an practice one learning when village children climbed water tanks for WIFI and the villager got use to what 's up for the payment of water and electricity bills through the network of computer centres at aver junction . A good trend ever increasing in deed ! We have to take note of all international trends and changes in framing if any legislation or rules on consumerism in future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their computer literate children -- our future scientists . <p> ' ' Covid 19 ' ' - do not see and end so soon- let us be ready for any eventuality <p> ' ' Covid 19 ' ' has changed the entire marketing developments and life of the ordinary citizen including students and the working class . There is no guarantee the ' ' Covid 19 ' ' will end or a time frame to end thereby we have to live on hopes and be prepared for any eventuality , so that future planning is near impossible . Sri Lankans proved themselves to be adoptable to any adverse conditions or situations on facing for ' ' Covid 19 ' ' and hardships to citizen all of whom are consumers . Prices of consumer items are going up with ' ' Covid19 ' ' in addition many other considerations which effects the consumer in all fronts , food being the main consideration . Food that is available should be reasonably prized and of quality as requited by section 7 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) and ( d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority to see that consumer is provided with goods and services not hazardous to the consumers ( section 4 ) protect against unfair trade practices , adequate access to goods and provide redress against exploitation . All this has to be implemented by regulatory powers in part two of the Act . Anti-competitive practices are dealt with in the Consumer Affairs Council also engaged in research and procedure on air trade practices . ' ' Covid 19 ' ' also has melded the attitudes of the citizen with better relations with the trader consumer , and the regulator , for the trader and industrialist to be fair and the consumer to be smart sharp and careful to have the ideal combination of fair trader , alert consumer and able regulator . Consumer must change attitudes to be simple and smart to ascertain a ) when to purchase , b ) where to purchase and how to purchase items available . Consumer items to be purchased with required quantities and well planned for the day or week giving priority to health and quality . Fruits should not be purchased from long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we have such great verities- for example Banana in UK has only one variety which is available with not much taste when we have so many verities at very reasonable of taste and quality . Fresh vegetables and fruits could be purchased cheap in markets . Cola should not be consumed at any cost which is poisons and expensive . Why consume bottled water in plastics bottles which can be poisonous , and unhealthy , when we can have boiled and cold water in glass bottles which is cheap and healthy . Where you purchase consumer items is north worthy to note as the best would be ' Sathosa ' when non-perishables can be stored and it is a good idea for the family to plan out the week or month as an exercise to save and be healthy . During goods online purchase can be practised which can extend to clothes and other consumer items for convenience and safety . Now that the entire life style is changed due to ' ' Covid 19 ' ' , it is time to be prepared to go through it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state that all precautionary measures are to be followed to the last word for a long term solution and healthy stable and happy life with the family . <p> Bogus Sales , Congestion , perches of varied items and presents to family and friends <p> Consumer should be aware of rights , duties and the expectations from the trader and the industrialist . It is the duty of the trader to give the consumer dignity , quality goods , and services , at a reasonable price indicated on the rack or the showcase . Consumer has the right to complain to the CAA or a branch office which you will have access form 1919 system , or personal complain to the CAA office or a branch . Telephone and written complaints are accepted and the CAA is prompt on complaints by the consumer who the CAA and the trader considers as top priority . Consumer need not be hesitant to question or complain and it can be done in friendly manner as it is your right to do so . Bogus sales are plenty and the consumer should use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is advisable to take your own time in selecting the gods as it is your money that you are parting with . Consumer should know the basic needs rights and duties and expectations from the trader to be a satisfied consumer . When you purchase electric and electronic items one should be careful on the make , quality and the condition you may not be conversant with when you have to be careful on the **25;2533;TOOLONG and specially the letters in small letters in a language not known to you . It is advisable to demand for a receipt for which you are entitled to and you can request more details on the receipt . Some traders will encourage you to give on credit on hire purchase schemes , and you should be careful in signing documents on conditions with small letters in a language not known to you , and giving your personal information . It is advisable to seek the advice of a known family member generally conversant with trade practices . Always ask for the visiting card and other details of the trader and trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trader , consumer , regulator , and industrialist for a better consumer regime and a fair trading regime . Especially during festive season be extreme careful of the 8000 drug addicts on the road in Colombo awaiting for preys which can be dangerous with their addictions on drugs . Always be in touch with security forces and loved ones always during exposure to the traders and public . <p> Quality of consumer items/ Consumer Organisations <p> Trader is bound to give items of quality to the consumer and finding the quality is an issue always unless it is tested by the standard bureau or tests by a group of consumers . It is imperative for the consumers to be a member of one or more consumer organization which is very forceful in other parts of the world . In the United Kingdom the consumer organizations are very powerful and the trader is obliged to be consumer friendly based on the famous adage that consumer dies no wrong and always correct . Consumer Affairs Authority is expected to assist monitor and encourage consumer organizations as powerful groups though less powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then what about the rice prices , adulterated coconut oil , consumer items of inferior quality , and hiding a storing the consumer items refusing to sale are offence under the consumer liable to be prosecuted . In UK and west the returned items are accepted but sadly not in Sri Lanka , when you can exchange if and when you need to change or return . Consumer organizations should agitate for this right with the help of CAA . <p> Digitalization modernization and modern trends on trade practices <p> The quality of goods services of food and consumer items are substandard , and of inferior quality due to lack of supervision and regulation by the CAA and other regulators such as TRCEL insurance , and Trade Ombudsman , Public health inspectors local councils , health department , and many statutory bodies . With advancement of technology Sri Lankans are at the doorsteps of digitalization with mobile phones in everybody 's hand ( 110% of the population ) and computer literacy of 40% ever increasing ? Younger generation is now armed with excellent computer skills able to use credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via face book and other social media platforms for day to day office with computer centres every corner on the road used by adults . However in Sri Lanka online shopping is not practiced often as in the United Kingdom where 40% of the consumer items are purchased online when the practice is fast used in Sri Lanka too . Sri Lanka appears to be ready for a leap frog with the advanced applicability of modern technology and day to day transections and day will not be too far when the majority of the population makes its purchases online .

Digitalization in the world is fast spreading with adverse effects shedding billions of jobs with no strategy from the state and the leaders of the private sector to find alternate arrangements to use them as innovators as in Israel . Digital Market places are thriving in west has a foothold in Sri Lanka and the potential is very interestingly limited changes of lifestyles due to innovative changes making life easier . However these changes include the risk of health other unexpected and undesirable changes in the economy .

Trade and consumerism is a part and parcel of the life and digitalization and modernization are complementary . World is ever changing with challenges they are faced with especially on ' ' Covid19 ' ' pandemic when village bravely faced by using what 's app to make payments , children climbed water tanks for WIFI and teachers were guided and trained by children for distant teaching on line are proof that Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans are adoptable to any challenges . Invasion of international digital platforms to Sri Lanka is inevitable and be ready to accept and meet challenges without changing ourselves culturally and age old traditions and habits we are lived with . Consumerism is not an alien concept to us when we had the Badulla ' ' TAM ' ' in 1857 AD , with instructions to the consumer and trader along with other 4000 ' ' TAMS ' ' found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject . Therefore it is time for us to give and interpret the correct meaning on consumerism to have the balancing livelihood of consumer , trader , regulator and the industrialist .

@@63387236 <h> By Lu Yuanzhi Source : Global Times <p> Indian National Security Adviser ( NSA ) Ajit Doval visited Colombo on Friday and Saturday to participate in the fourth NSA Level Meeting on Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation hosted by Sri Lanka . <p> However , Doval 's visit was also to deepen India 's cooperation with Sri Lanka . India sees China 's coordination with Sri Lanka as somewhat breaking into India 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , China-India ties have been gravely undermined because of their border tensions . In this context , India intends to exploit its advantages in geopolitics , culture and religion to rope in Sri Lanka to contain China , counter the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) and consolidate India 's influence in South Asia . <p> The Diplomat magazine on Saturday said , " Even though Sri Lanka has rhetorically committed to an ' India first ' approach when it comes to security , the fine print indicates that Colombo will engage with other major powers -- read , China for its economic development . " <p> China and Sri Lanka are good friends and partners who always support and help each other . The two countries have deepened their economic cooperation under the BRI framework . <p> By contrast , the story of New Delhi-Colombo ties is that of ups and downs . The two have frictions in areas such as the Tamil issue . Successive governments of both countries have tended to adjust policies toward each other based on the updated situations . <p> In recent years , India has repeated ly wooed Sri Lanka . In response , in order not to offend New Delhi , who acts as a hegemon in South Asia , Colombo has made overtures to please New Delhi . For example , Sri Lanka 's foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage said in August that Sri Lanka will adopt an " India first approach " as its new diplomacy plank and protect India 's strategic security interests , an attempt to ease India 's concern over China 's growing presence in Sri Lanka . <p> The island country is of great strategic importance , connecting the Strait of Malacca and the Persian Gulf . Additionally , Sri Lanka lies in the Indo-Pacific region , which has drawn global attention . Hence , Colombo has become a target for not only New Delhi 's , but also Washington 's machinations . <p> US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in October visited Sri Lanka , where he groundlessly slandered China and attempted to drive a wedge between China and Sri Lanka . However , Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa responded that Sri Lanka is not caught in a " debt trap " by accepting help from China . <p> India , by ganging up with the US , is piling geopolitical pressure on small countries . Sri Lanka , like others involved in the fierce geopolitical competition , is pleased to have maintained long-term and close ties with China , which has never interfered in its internal affairs . <p> On the other hand , the wooing from the US and India has indeed exerted considerable pressure on these countries . They can not afford to pay the price if they offend either the US or India . They try their best to strike a balance between great powers . Qian Feng , director of the research department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University , told the Global Times on Sunday that the pressure on Sri Lanka from the US and India may to some extent wield an impact on its ties with China . <p> From Bangladesh and Nepal to Sri Lanka , India recently seems to be busy with resetting , restoring and strengthening ties with its neighboring countries . Qian said that against the backdrop of ongoing border tensions with China , India hopes to expand its influence , in a bid to gain more strategic capital and room to maneuver with China . <p> South Asia plays a big role in the China-proposed BRI . China should continue to deepen its cooperation with regional countries on the basis of win-win principles . Qian said that India should not continue the geopolitical confrontation , but expand " China-India Plus " cooperation , which leaders of the two countries agreed to in 2019 . This will be conducive to China , India and the whole South Asian region . <h> By Alistair Mason , PA Courtesy Belfast Telegraph <h> Rob Lewis stayed in Sri Lanka when coronavirus meant Joe Root and the England team returned home in March . <p> A cricket fan who travelled to Sri Lanka in March to watch England 's tour is still there eight months after it was cancelled -- and has vowed to remain until Joe Root 's team returns . <p> Rob Lewis , a web designer from Sunbury-on-Thames , has been on a personal adventure during his unplanned stay in the island country , adopting a stray dog while living on a beach , becoming a DJ with his own alter ego , getting a tattoo and befriending members of the Sri Lanka cricket team 's coaching staff . <p> Now the 37-year-old is hoping England will return in January so he can finally see the cricket he travelled out for -- and has offered his services to Sri Lanka coach Mickey Arthur as a waterboy in the hope he will be able to get into the ground even if fans are not allowed.ADVERTISING <p> I 'm hoping on January for the cricket , " he told the PA news agency . And if they do n't come then it 's been a long wait for nothing . <p> Let 's just stay positive and hope that they come ... or the little quest will fail and corona will win . " <p> ( Rob Lewis ) <p> Mr Lewis was on the plane to Sri Lanka when the announcement was made on March 13 that England 's matches in the country had been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic . <p> But rather than head back to England , he decided to remain in the country and has been there ever since . <p> When curfew came , Mr Lewis found himself staying in a hostel near Hiriketiya beach , east of Galle . <p> England were playing a warm-up game when their tour was called off ( Rory Dollard/PA ) <p> It 's normally a really popular tourist beach and it was deserted , " he said . So I was swimming in the sea most days and had the whole beach to myself . It was insane . <p> I was so fortunate -- reports from back home , all my family are stuck in their houses , very hard lockdown , so I was pretty lucky . <p> I was in touch with people back home and they were like , man , you 've just got to stay there , because the UK is just completely shut up . " <p> While there , he also made a new friend . <p> I adopted a beach dog , called him Pup , " Mr Lewis said . <p> The hostel owner did n't really like me because he did n't want the dog in there . " <p> The dog has since been rehomed . <p> After a couple of months of lockdown , Mr Lewis said Sri Lanka opened up pretty fast and life went back to normal " . <p> He added : That 's when I had one of my stupid ideas in my head where I was just , like , well , is there any point going home or shall I just try and stay for England to return to Sri Lanka ? " <p> While in Sri Lanka , Mr Lewis met a DJ who taught him how to operate the decks and -- despite his lack of experience -- managed to pick up some gigs at bars and parties . <p> Rob Lewis has been DJing under the name DJ Randy Caddick ( Rob Lewis ) <p> Twice I got kicked off because I just was n't good enough , " he said . Or I was playing disco while they wanted this weird tech house stuff . <p> But I 've managed to get a few gigs in Colombo where I was on flyers , which has been super fun . " <p> He now DJs under the name DJ Randy Caddick -- a nod to a former England bowler . <p> If I do well , I 'm going to have like a highlight reel of Andy Caddick playing behind me while I DJ . " <p> Thanks to an introduction from a mutual friend , Mr Lewis has also become friendly with some members of the Sri Lanka coaching team , including head coach Arthur , who was taken with his story . <p> He was like , ' you 've been here for five months ? ' , and yet I was like , ' yeah , I 'm waiting for England to come back , " Mr Lewis said . <p> He just laughed at my idiocy . " <p> Rob Lewis had the normally popular Hiriketiya Beach largely to himself during lockdown ( Rob Lewis ) <p> Since the start of the pandemic , no international cricket has taken place in Sri Lanka . <p> Bangladesh 's proposed tour was cancelled because Sri Lankan health authorities insisted they must quarantine for 14 days in their hotel rooms on arrival with no access to training facilities . <p> But there is hope compromise can be reached for England 's proposed tour in January . <p> Even if England do tour , there is the small matter of whether Mr Lewis will be allowed into the ground . <p> He said : I 'm like , are there even going to be fans allowed in ? I 've been waiting all this time . But I 've offered my services to be like the Sri Lankan waterboy so I can get in the bubble . " <p> This is not the first time Mr Lewis has found himself on an overseas adventure . <p> ( Rob Lewis ) <p> Last year he impulsively booked himself a last-minute flight to Japan to watch England in the Rugby World Cup final -- despite having no ticket for the game , nowhere to stay and being on crutches after undergoing a knee operation . <p> Things worked out in his favour as he sourced a ticket for the match and even ended up receiving free accommodation . <p> This time he believes his adventurous nature has again been to his advantage , as he says the situation in Sri Lanka has largely been better than in the UK during the pandemic . <p> I 've landed on my feet , really , " he said . <p> Whether it be luck or you have to put yourself out there to get in these situations , I do n't really know , but I 'm just trying to make the most of the situation . <h> Courtesy Hiru News <p> Another seven COVID deaths reported . <p> The Government Information Department stated that the number of COVID reported in Sri Lanka has increased to 116 . <p> 1 . A 50-year-old woman from Colombo 02 . Died at the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital . 2 . A 48-year-old man from Gothatuwa . Died at his home . 3 . A 73-year-old man from Moratuwa .

Mahindapala <p> Donald Trump continues to keep America and the world guessing as to his next move which should be to concede victory to Joe Biden . But he has not done so formally , though he is sending signals indicating that he is willing to concede without , of course , taking any meaningful action to vacate the White House . This appears to be a game he is playing for a tactical reason : he is playing for time . Though Joe Biden won on the popular vote by nearly seven million votes nothing is certain until the Electoral College confirms his victory . On paper he has the votes of the Electoral College too . But there is speculation as to whether the electors from rogue " Republican states will vote for Biden at the Electoral College . <p> Despite all traditions and precedents binding the electors of the states won by Biden to vote for him there is no guarantee that they will do so in the coming Electoral College vote on December 14 . There are instances where electors have voted against the will of the people of the state and voted for their favourites . In 2016 , " states POLITICO ( November 19 ) , seven electors ultimately broke their pledge to vote for who they said they would support.Five electors voted for someone other than Hillary Clinton despite Clinton carrying their states , while two abandoned Trump . " This means that Trump still has a chance of overturning the will of the people if a sufficient number of electors certified to vote for Biden at the Electoral College turn against him and vote for Trump . Remember Trump lost the popular vote and won in the Electoral College in 2016 . According to David A. Bell of POLITICO , election experts are still worried about the talk of legislatures going rogue between Election Day ( November 3 ) and the selection of Electoral College electors . " ( December 14 ) . If , as speculated , the Republican rogue " states gang up against Biden on the pretext of vote fraud , or some other technicality , there is still a chance available for Trump to remain in the White House . So why concede victory too early when there is still some hope , though it is diminishing fast . And who cares if more Americans die as a result of the obstructionist policy of Trump to prevent the new Biden administration working out strategies for the Corona crisis . Corona-caused deaths have gone beyond 250,000 . What does it matter to Trump who dismisses it as only another kind of flu ? <p> Clearly , Trump is putting America through a meat grinder . His ego-centric politics is tearing America apart . It is difficult to find in living memory another rough and divisive passage in American history like the post-2016 period . At the core of the American apple is Trump wriggling and eating into its vitals like a revolting worm which came from within the system . He is doing to America what pariah dogs on the run do to lamp posts . He defines himself each time he opens his mouth and fills it with lies . Each time he spits out his egregious hyperboles unsubstantiated by facts or figures he drops deeper and deeper into Dante 's hell . He is fixated on creating and living in the Napoleonic cult of greatness -- a small man with big ideas . He imagines that history began with him . In his statements he tries to give the impression that nothing great has happened in American history before his arrival at the White House . Nor has there been anyone in history as great as him . Once , he made a concession to Abraham Lincoln but that too was done grudgingly . He has dragged America to the depths of despair with two devastating crises : 1 . Corona pandemic and 2. the constitution . The most notable part of his Presidency is in creating a cult of his own fathering a following that is ready , willing and able to go along with all his crudities . <p> He performs theatrically on the political stage as the most popular public figure hero-worshipped by the millions . Considering the figures he had scored in the last election he is not wrong either . It reveals that there is an on-going love-hate relationship between him and America . Half of America loves him and the other half is divided between hate and awe . He had brazenly done what all other politicos had feared to do : he had unmasked America and exposed the hidden face caked with liberal cosmetics . He has revealed the fragility of the American democracy which can flip any time under the demagoguery of a swaggering braggart bent on breaking the rules and dismantling the institutions that safeguard the security and the democratic values . Above all , he has proved that he can silence with one twitter even the most respected Republicans who hated his guts in the beginning and then fell in line like a herd of rhinos with thick skins impervious to the rising threats to everything of value created and preserved by the mighty American adventure . <p> He displays all the symptoms of an egomaniac riding the populist path overdetermined by Trumpism -- the new political cult rising to shape the next generation of American policy-makers . It is putting deep roots into the soil fertilized with hate politics . His aim , as declared by him , is to make America great by putting America first -- seemingly innocuous labels marketed to disguise the hidden racist ideology of white supremacists . Instead of the fiery , mob-manipulating , hate politics of Hitler he does it the modern way with a consistent flow of Gobbelsian twitters . The only thing that seems to stand in his way of becoming a Yankee Hitler is his Jewish son-in-law , Jared Kushner -- the man behind the historic move of making Jerusalem the capital of the Jews . <p> His total indifference to the hundreds of thousands of Corona virus victims is inhuman and unpardonable . Like the way he places himself above the law he places himself over and above the universal laws of physics and science . His delusional belief in his own power to force men , events and the laws of nature obey his commands is a trait that is a serious threat to planet earth lurching from one critical crisis to another . There ca n't be a bigger threat to the welfare and the future of the world than a voodoo Frankenstein presiding over the mightiest nation on earth . The consequences can be far-reaching and colossal as seen in the way he has handled the Corona virus . He condemns his best experts like Dr. Fauci as idiots " and disasters " . With his inhuman policy of presiding over the premature deaths of 250,000 Corona victims he deserves to go down in the annals of American history as the most obnoxious and notorious undertaker ever . <p> At least on basic humanitarian necessities it was his moral duty to cooperate with the Biden team to alleviate the suffering of the victims of the Corona virus . Trump 's vindictive politics is aimed at obstructing and frustrating any Biden initiatives to succeed . In his last days he is making desperate moves to tie down the Biden administration to his dangerous policies in global and domestic affairs . Trump out of office can be more dangerous than in office . A part of his tactic is to play the role of victim whose victory was stolen by a rigged election . He knows that his future is not going to be rosy with rows of legal cases awaiting his exit from the White House . The evidence against him is overwhelming . His main defence is to play the innocent victim of a corrupt , rigged system . <p> What is the legacy he is leaving behind ? Take the case of Israel . He is leaving legacy mined with explosives . His policy of legalising the Jewish occupation of Palestinian lands in the West Bank is a time-bomb placed under Biden 's chair . The 600,000 Jews in 142 West Bank settlements in Palestinian land has been declared illegal by the global community . Biden will go along making Jerusalem the capital of Israel . It is accepted by the Christian voters of America . But legalising the land occupied by the Jews is an issue that is going to burn the Middle East -- and perhaps the world -- in the foreseeable future . <p> Above all , his decision not to abide by the democratic will of the people is going to make him the ugliest American in history books . For the moment he will survive because he is riding high on the passions he has injected into the apathetic veins of the sleepy Americans . Credit must be given to him for keeping the American nation awake 24/7 with his provocative twitters . He kept the nation alive and kicking on a regular diet of lies . Not surprisingly the latest polls indicate that a substantial percentage of voters believe that Trump lost because the election was rigged . <p> What is happening in America is surreal . Only a brash maverick like Trump could make it happen . He has validated the rejection democracy as a fit form governance as first declared by Socrates and Plato . They opted for philosopher kings " . The problem with that theory is that there are enough Donald Trumps in the world who claim to be philosopher kings " . In fact , philosopher Bertrand Russel blamed the Platonic concept of philosopher kings " for breeding Hitlers and Stalins . They presumed that they had the key to unlock the mysteries of history by playing the messianic role of political saviours . Driven by their ideologies they made the 20th century the cruellest age in history . <p> Humanity has suffered untold miseries at the hands of these fake messiahs -- from Hitler and Stalin to Rohana Wijeweera and Prabhakaran . What is unacceptable is the willingness of a section of humanity to follow the Wijeweeras and Prabhakarans . A good example of this is Prof. Jayadeva Uyangoda , who , for all intents and purposes , seems to be a rational human being . After all he was an academic who held a chair in the professoriate . He not only believed in the goodness of these brutal messiahs but also theorised on their behalf to justify their obscene violence . Once he returned from a fleeting meeting with Prabhakaran as if he had seen the earthly manifestation of the heavenly Prince of Peace . Taking Prof. Uyangoda and a Trump-follower as empirical evidence that demonstrates the political mind-set of messianic devotees one is entitled to ask whether there is any difference between the two ? <p> If you look around the pundit class ( synonymous , of course , with the chattering class ) you can find enough and more theorists who pretend to be the panacea to complex and all intractable problems of the nation . Take the case of Dayan Jayatilleka , another one of those pundits whose theories are tailored mostly to advance his next career move . In his latest outpouring he has blamed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his model of governance for the second wave of Corona virus . <p> After circumambulating around his pet hates , including Sinhala-Buddhism , he concludes that the fight against Covid-19 is n't going well because of the unscientific or pseudo-scientific metaphysical ideology through which the Rajapaksa regime sees everything . To him the end of the world has come . It is the Corona Chernobyl . The holocaust . And Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- all rolled into one . <p> It is apparent that the hidden agenda behind his attack is to target the Rajapaksa regime which has rejected him . It is partly a personal attack on Gotabaya Rajapaksa and partly an attack on the Rajapaksa model of governance . All his theoretical conclusions about the second wave is to downgrade the Rajapaksa achievements which he had praised to the skies not so long ago when he was with the Rajapaksas . He says : For this regime , it is more important to believe in its model of governance , its system , than to seek truth from facts " as was Deng Xiaoping 's motto . The regime does not see the need to look at how the really successful countries have managed this and learn from their strategies ... " because it is an article of faith that Sri Lanka under the present leadership is the really successful country " , and it is felt to be more important than anything else to keep the faith in this postulate , whatever the empirical evidence to the contrary . Nobody dares to contradict the new model , still less learn from the strategies " of the really successful countries " . In consequence , we may be running the risk of a Corona Chernobyl . <p> The current Sri Lankan model is one which is derived a priori from a sense of superiority stemming from a mix of having won the war ( again , falsely listed as the only or the first victory over terrorism , at least in the 21st century ) and the innate superiority of the Sinhala-Buddhist culture , civilization and way of being . To question the results on the basis of evidence , i.e. the successes of the model , acknowledge defeats and failures , and shift course " as Dr. Ranan-Eliya urges , is to question the sacrosanct model itself and verges on heresy and treason . " <p> This attack covers a whole range of factors that characterise the Rajapaksa government . He is making use of the Corona crisis purely to hang his political attack on it . His real motive is to use the second wave as an excuse to run down the Rajapaksa regime for acting without seeking the truth from facts " . By the way , I am not citing Deng Xiao-ping to show off my familiarity with the founding fathers of the Chinese Revolution because it is threadbare statement commonly used in practically every civilization long before he was born . In any case , it is not such a profound or original statement that needs the backing of a distinguished authority . It would have had the same impact if he quoted Haramanis Singho instead of Deng . Throwing in big names as authorities for trite statements is a part of his style to show off that he is not one of those the run-of-the-mill political scientists . Writing advertisement about himself to enhance his image as a political scientist is also a common ploy of his to impress his readers that he must be taken seriously and not treated as a frivolous yes-man " hired to manufacture excuses to boost the political fortunes of his new master . <p> Now that he has parked himself in Sajith Premadasa 's camp he is doing just that : struggling to manufacture excuses to boost his master 's fortunes . Both are trying to politicise the COVID-19 wave to gain some political mileage . But the more sensible and constructive approach to the Covid-19 crisis was enunciated by Ruwan Wijewardene , the Deputy Leader of the UNP , who urged all parties to unite to overcome the crisis . ( Daily Mirror -- 17/11 ) . Now that is a sign of a mature and responsible leader who genuinely cares for the people . <p> The last thing that this nation needs is another fake theorist who is singing for his supper <h> By Senior Lawyer <p> Refer to the article ' A Plan To Ensure Every Sri Lankan Plate is Full During COVID ' A paper submitted by Sri Lanka Study Circle in the Lanka published recently <p> Finally in 2020 the world has realised that Globalisation has completely failed . It 's master , USA is struggling unable to select a President , leading the world with the spread of COVID . Sri Lanka had the wisdom to appoint a President and to go beyond many countries to protect the people from COVID . <p> Wake up Sri Lanka face the truth , get your heads out of the sand , do not wait for foreign funds to research and manage our lands . <p> The most distinctive approach for us is to act now for a new strategy , provide our own food . Forget all the World Bank reports and MCC . They all planned to capture our lands ; to hand over our lands to large Agri based companies that had commercial interest . People rose to save our lands . The MCC introduced foreign laws to remove all our traditional laws Bim Saviya that apply to small farmers and Chena cultivators . Until COVID came along , we could not face these external storms , where we were virtually to believe we are doing well if we reach higher positions of the indices drawn by them ; such as the Doing Business Index . <p> Rights of freeborn men enjoy the maximum use of land not access to land which is the capitalist theory , which says lands must be arranged in a register to be able to be sold and mortgaged as vehicles . <p> Robbed of the truth for centuries and for 72 years after independence , at least now shall we plan our own strategy for our capital asset land . Let 's have local reforms to allow lessees of government lands to cultivate . Lets give those who deserve Rs 5000 a piece of land on lease to cultivate . I am sure our politicians will not disagree . <p> How could we have not realised , <p> 1that we have land that will allow anything to grow . <p> 2there is sunshine from 6 AM to 6 PM every day with plenty of water <p> 3 that we do not require deeds , lease rights permit bank loans according to the statutes we have <p> These pictures are from a small plot of land . The boy has no job but he feeds the people in his neighbourhood . He says he does not need any funding . <p> The Indian NSA said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic , many countries in the region had to face similar economic and social problems . However , economic revival and governance must continue in order to overcome the obstacles of this pandemic . He stated that despite the Covid-19 epidemic , a lot of diplomatic deliberations have been held virtually on the development of bilateral relations and foreign affairs between leaders . <p> Doval further said that immigrant workers , both from Sri Lanka and India , have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and this has reduced the inflow of foreign currency . <p> Prim Minister Rajapaksa has been instrumental in creating a dialogue between the countries of the region to devise strategies to develop the economy , to address the strategies of economic development and to address the recession inferred , Mr Doval noted . <p> The Indian NSA assured that the government of India would extend its full support in reviving both nations and that despite the Covid-19 situation , development in the region should be prioritized . <p> Prime Minister Rajapaksa stated that housing projects have been implemented in the north-east and upcountry areas with the assistance of the government of India and requested India to commence such housing projects with a clear approach . Doval reassured the Indian government 's utmost support in this regard . <p> Under the guidance of Indian PM Narendra Modi , it was agreed at this meeting to adopt modern technology and to focus on drinking water supply projects initiated in India and to adopt such technology in Sri Lanka also . <p> Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Mr Gopal Baglay and Secretary to Prime Minister Gamini Senarath have also attended the event , the Office of the Prime Minister said . <h> Xinhua <p> " We do not accept this downgrade as it fails to recognize the robust policy framework of the new government for addressing the legacy issues , including the concerns raised by Fitch Ratings , and ensuring ongoing economic recovery and macroeconomic stability of the country , " the ministry said in a statement . <p> Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka 's sovereign rating from B- to CCC following the government 's budget proposals for 2021 , local media reported . <p> Fitch said the downgrade was due to Sri Lanka 's increasing sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio amid COVID-19-induced shocks to the economy . It estimates that Sri Lanka 's debt-to-GDP ratio may increase from 86.8 percent in 2019 to 100 percent in 2020 , possibly reaching 116 percent in 2024 . <p> " The government 's external-debt obligations amount to USD 23.2 billion between 2021 and 2025 , or about 4 billion USD annually , against FX reserves at end-October of just USD 5.9 billion , " the statement said . <p> However , it said the country 's current account has not deteriorated thanks to import restrictions and higher-than-expected remittances . <p> Fitch projects Sri Lanka 's growth to reach 4.9 percent in 2021 , while official government figures have projected a 5.5-percent growth rate . <p> The Sri Lankan government announced its budget proposals for 2021 on Nov. 17 , projecting a revenue of 10.6 million U.S. dollars , expenditure of 19 million U.S. dollars and a deficit of 8.5 million U.S. dollars .

The courts have accepted the Attorney General 's submissions on Mahaviru ( Maaveerar ) commemorations . <p> Further , Jaffna High Court dismissed four petitions which challenged the efforts of the police to prevent LTTE commemoration events in the north . <p> In the meantime , four suspects were arrested on Friday ( 27 ) by the Eravur Police for sharing posts related to LTTE commemoration on social media . <h> Courtesy Hiru News <p> Activists of Sinhale Api today ( 28 ) inspected unauthorized cattle sheds at flood plains national park in Polonnaruwa that have been in the spotlight for several days now . <p> The team was led by its president Ven . Jamburewela Chandarathana Thera . <p> They found that court orders to remove these cattle sheds were not being implemented due to political influence . <p> On 25 November , tempers flared over this issue between state minister Wimalaweera Dissanayake and wildlife officers during an inspection tour of the wildlife park . <p> Wildlife officers disagreed with calls to the state minister from farmers to allow them cultivate in parts of the national park , allow their cattle to graze there and to reopen a closed road across the national park . <p> To protest the state minister , wildlife officers across the island staged a token strike yesterday . <h> Courtesy NewsIn.Asia <h> Health authorities yesterday warned of new COVID-19 subclusters emerging across the country if public movement is not minimised <p> Colombo , November 27 ( Daily Mirror ) -- Health authorities yesterday warned of new COVID-19 subclusters emerging across the country if public movement is not minimised from high-risk areas to low-risk areas , unless most essential . <p> Deputy Director-General of Public Health , Dr. Hemantha Herath told Daily Mirror that the country still faced a threat from the COVID-19 virus despite a decline in numbers in recent days outside Colombo , but the threat of new subclusters emerging remained till as long as people moved from the high-risk areas to low-risk areas . <p> This is a problem . Our advice is that those who are in Colombo should stay in Colombo and those who are outside Colombo should refrain from entering Colombo as much as possible . Unless it is most essential , " Dr. Herath said . <p> Even at this moment of time , we can not say the threat is over . We are continuing all our controlling activities but at the same time people must contribute by limiting their movements and preventing any further clusters from forming , " he added . <p> In recent days , authorities have seen a decline in numbers emerging from the clusters reported out of Colombo , that is the Minuwangoda cluster and the Katunayake cluster . Dr. Herath said the Minuwangoda cluster had almost been deactivated while very few numbers were now being reported from the Katunayake cluster . <p> While the overall Peliyagoda cluster was also now under control , the spread from this cluster in Colombo , however , was continuing . Due to this , Western Province continued to be a hotbed for the virus and people were warned to remain cautious . <p> On Wednesday we had over 500 cases . Unless the people reduce their movement and support to prevent the further spread of this virus , it will still drag on . The flatten level will continue , and we will not be able to bring an end to it , " Dr. Herath said . <p> There are many people who are carrying out unnecessary movements . We need to help the authorities to stop this , " he added . <p> Till last evening , the Punani Treatment Centre had the highest number of patients followed by the Bingiriya Treatment Centre and the Kandakadu Treatment Centre . <p> Till last evening , there were over 5,800 active patients reported in the country . ( Jamila Husain ) <h> Courtesy NewsIn.Asia <h> The Government will facilitate the first round of COVID-19 Vaccines , once released to the market <p> Colombo , November 27 ( NewsWire ) -- The Government will facilitate the first round of COVID-19 Vaccines , once released to the market , to be received by 4.2 million Sri Lankans , Health Minister Pavithra Waniarachchi informed Parliament yesterday . <p> The Minister stated that the first round of vaccines will be provided to 20% of Sri Lanka 's population . <p> A national committee has been appointed to look into COVID-19 vaccines despite vaccines still being in trial stages and with no fixed date for its availability to the public . <p> Three technical subcommittees have been appointed to focus on matters such as target groups for the vaccine , prioritization , cost , and usage , the Health Minister said . <p> Discussions on the Covid vaccine have been continuously followed by Health Ministry officials since the outbreak in March , while they have also joined COVAX , which is co-led by Gavi , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , and the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) . <p> COVAX focuses on accelerating the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines , and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world . COVAX also offers a diverse and actively managed portfolio of vaccines , immediate delivery of vaccines upon availability , an end to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic , and the rebuilding of economies , she explained . <p> Commenting on the Rapid Antigen Test kits , the Health Minister said 4000 tests have been carried out so far . The tests are being used to decide if patients with symptoms can be discharged from treatment centres and to test if an individual had contracted the virus previously . <p> Epidemiologists are yet to state a necessity for antigen tests to monitor the spread of the virus in the country , she said . <p> The Health Minister further said that as all decisions pertaining to COVID-19 prevention are taken based on the recommendations of epidemiologists , the antigen tests will be used in prevention measures as soon as epidemiologists indicate to such a need . <p> Minister Wanniarchchi made the comments in response to a question raised by Leader of the Opposition and Samagi Jana Balawegaya MP Sajith Premadasa in Parliament yesterday ( 26 ) . <p> To illustrate a cart before the horse situation , the Minister of Agriculture stated in Parliament yesterday that his ministry will submit a National Agriculture policy for the country within a year . While welcoming this , a question has to be raised as to how there could be such a policy without a comprehensive land management policy being introduced first . An agriculture policy and others such as a water management policy has to be part of a broader land management policy . <p> It is heartening that the minister has set up 5 sub committees for development of strategies to address laws delays in the areas of infrastructure development , Digitization and court automation , criminal law reforms , civil law reforms and commercial law reforms . This is no doubt long overdue . <p> However , it is somewhat perplexing why an existing institution within the Ministry of Justice , Law Commission of Sri Lanka , established under the Law Commission Act No. 03 of 1969 , and being the main government institution which recommends legal reforms has not been asked to look into the reform areas assigned to the five sub committees appointed by the Minister of Justice . The website of the Law Commission identifies its role and functions as follows . It says that the main objective of the Law Commission is to promote the reforms of the law , and its functions are , the codification of law , the elimination of anomalies , take and keep under review the law , both substantive and procedural with a view to its systematic development and reform . the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments , the simplification and modernization of the law , to receive and consider any proposals for the reform of the law , to prepare and submit to the Minister , from time to time , programmes for the examination of different branches of the law with a view to reform , to obtain such information as to the legal systems of other countries , to keep under constant review the exercise by bodies , other than parliament , of the power to legislate by subsidiary legislation with a view to ensuring that they conform to well established principles and to the rule of law , to formulate programmes for rationalizing and simplifying legal procedures including procedures of an administrative character connected with litigation , and to formulate programmes for the codification of the law in Sinhala , Tamil and English . <p> The appointment of five sub-committees by the Minister to undertake reform recommendations appear to be well within the functions of the Law Commission unless it is an entity that requires reform as well . The need for law reform seems quite evident . One can not but get the feeling that successive ministers of Justice have evaded this urgent need and a heavy and expensive price has been paid by the general public as a consequence . <p> The legal maxim Justice delayed is justice denied " usually refers to legal redress or equitable relief to an injured party is available , but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion , and therefore it is effectively the same as having no remedy at all " . It appears that in Sri Lanka , there has been a denial of justice not only on account of delays , but due to fault lines in a legal system that is outdated , full of holes , is inefficient and ineffective . <p> It is hoped that the effort of the minister does not end up as work of some previous committees that were appointed to present findings and recommendations . There had been no follow up and recommendations implemented . A senior lawyer pointed out that for example , the amendment to the Notaries ordinance and the amendment to the Power of Attorney Ordinance , recommended by two committees in 2010 appointed by the Ministry of Justice has not been passed to date . This lawyer stated that without the amendments , with all the loopholes available in the colonial statutes , Sri Lanka has moved on to the eRegister with perhaps invalid deeds being registered in a day , a great advantage to fraudsters . <p> In this context , the Ministers attention is drawn publicly ( as the private communication was not acknowledged ) to an area that requires urgent attention , the reform of land laws that has not been subject to the process announced by the Minister . As was pointed out in the letter to the Minister , there are major issues concerning the Bim Saviya titling system based on the Land Registration law introduced in 1997 and implemented in 2007 , and the issues related to the electronic registration system for such titles . This vital area has not been included in the review announced . <p> In the letter to the Minister and in several articles published by eminent lawyers , it was pointed out that ( a ) the fact that less than 5% of the 12 million land allotments have been registered since 2007 was proof that Bim Saviya was not working , and ( b ) the reason why it is not working was the unsuitability of the Bim Saviya for Sri Lanka as it is based on an alien system , the Australian Torrens Title system . This system has not worked for the indigenous people of Australia , and it would not work for Sri Lanka , as this system does not recognise the country context when it comes to land and land rights . The now famous and ground breaking Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia is evidence that it had not worked for the original inhabitants of Australia . <p> The Ministers attention was also drawn to a recent gazette notification issued by the Lands Ministry in regard to what has been described as Residual State land " , and transferring the management of these lands to Provincial and district Secretaries . What is referred to as Residual State land " , is not well understood and there is suspicion of an ulterior motive behind this gazette notification as this definition can lead to large scale abuse and encroachment into forests and Wild Life sanctuaries and reclassifying them as residual State land " and disposing them to individuals for commercial purposes . <p> It has been reported that 82% of land in Sri Lanka is State land . Possibly why it has been difficult to issue titles for State land maybe due to absence of cadastral , or in the least , proper land surveys and identification of boundaries if indeed titles are needed for State land , for such land to be registered under Bim Saviya . <p> There are two issues that raises suspicion of an ulterior motive . Firstly , the absence of a Cadastral or as a minimum , well defined boundaries with land survey maps for State land , which results in encroachment into forests and wild life protection lands and increasing the residual land " extent which the can then be disposed of in the guise of cultivation , and sold to locals and foreigners . <p> Secondly , the purpose of issuing titles for State . Why are titled required for State land unless it is to privatise and sell them to locals and foreigners in the guise of development " ? If increasing productivity of some State land is the motive , no doubt this can be done collectively by the inhabitants around such land , and also where feasible , by entering into joint ventures with the private sector in Sri Lanka with the government retaining full ownership of the land . <p> What is needed for State land are proper surveys and identification of boundaries in order to make sure forests , wild life parks , nature reserves etc. are safe from encroachers . Titles for such land is secondary and in fact not needed as this land has and should remain in State ownership for perpetuity . Knowing the dangers of not having such a policy , Sri Lankans should not give countenance to another Hambantota fiasco where a Port and Land has been given to a foreign country on a 99-year lease . <p> In the context of land management policy reform , the Ministers attention was drawn to the fact that land titling and eRegistration issues had not been included in the Cabinet paper referred to and the announcement of the 5 sub committees . <p> The Minister was urged , even at this late stage , to nominate a sixth sub-committee comprising of retired Supreme Court of High Court judges and eminent lawyers drawn from the Academia and others with expertise in land titling and registration to examine <p> The Bim Saviya and its relevance and suitability for Sri Lanka <p> Changes needed to laws that existed prior to the introduction of Bim Saviya in 1997 <p> The need for land laws to regard and respect the traditional customs and practices <p> Management of the eRegister and reasons as to why it can not be done by an institution like the Moratuwa University <p> The classification of State land a residual land , and until the proposed sub-committee has submitted their report with recommendations and a decision is made on them , to withdraw the gazette notification recently issued <p> Finally , based on the findings of this sub-committee , the Minister , along with other relevant ministers and ministries , and considering the national interest of the country , the Opposition as well , develop a strategic , transparent and comprehensive State land management policy which could be presented to the Parliament , discussed , debated and passed as the law of the country in regard to Land Management in Sri Lanka . Such a law supported hopefully by all political parties would give the long term certainty that is needed for the country in land management and preclude the necessity for future governments to make changes to the essential elements contained in such a comprehensive law . <p> It is hoped that the Minister will consider this appeal and take appropriate action and earn a deserved reputation as a cabinet minister with guts and resolve who had the foresight to address a long felt need that could otherwise fracture and destroy the small parcel of land we call Sri Lanka . <h> By Senior Lawyer <p> Finally in 2020 the world has realised that Globalisation has completely failed . It 's master , USA is struggling unable to select a President , leading the world with the spread of COVID . Sri Lanka had the wisdom to appoint a President and to go beyond many countries to protect the people from COVID . <p> Wake up Sri Lanka face the truth , get your heads out of the sand , do not wait for foreign funds to manage our lands . <p> The most distinctive approach for us is to act now for a new strategy , provide our own food . Forget all the World Bank reports and MCC . They all planned to capture our lands ; to hand over our lands to large Agri based companies that had commercial interest . People rose to save our lands . The MCC introduced foreign laws to remove all our traditional laws that apply to small farmers and Chena cultivators . Until COVID came along , we could not face these external storms , where we were virtually to believe we are doing well if we reach higher positions of the indices drawn by them ; such as the Doing Business Index . <p> Rights of freeborn men enjoy the maximum use of land not access to land which is the capitalist theory , that says lands must be arranged in a register to be able to be sold and mortgaged as vehicles . . <p> Robbed of the truth for centuries and for 72 years after independence , at least now shall we plan our own strategy for our capital asset land . Let 's have local reforms to allow lessees of government lands to cultivate . Lets give those who deserve Rs 5000 a piece of land on lease to cultivate . I am sure our politicians will not disagree . <p> How could we have not realised , <p> 1that we have land that will allow anything to grow . <p> 2there is sunshine from 6 AM to 6 PM every day with plenty of water <p> 3 that we do not require deeds , lease rights permit bank loans according to the statutes we have <p> These pictures are from a small plot of land . The boy has no job but he feeds the people in his neighbourhood . He says he does not need any funding . or . <h> By : A.A.M.NIZAM -- MATARA . <p> Unlike the olden days the modern budgets need to concentrate more on the development of digital and the distance learning facilities and only by which our future generations will be capable to be competitive to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of other countries . Fotnnately we have elected a President who has a wide knowledge on this subject and his vision is to enhance IT and digital facilities to cover all aspects of life in this country . Accordingly the Prime Minister has performed his task very well in presenting his budget giving more preference to the development of the IT sector , which has received much accolades from all those in the modern IT world . Their views and opinions continue : <p> Indirect boost to IT/BPM <p> The Budget aims to create digital governance using Information Technology and the establishment of an international e-commerce and e-payment systems , the high-speed data exchange system and the related mobile network systems are investment priorities " . This would offer many opportunities for the IT/BPM industry to be partners . <p> The proposed techno parks could be a boost to the electronics industry as well as businesses engaged in the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . <p> It is proposed to provide loans of Rs. 500,000 at an interest rate of 4% as start-up capital to support the young men and women , who start their own businesses on the successful completion of vocational education . This loan scheme will have a grace period of one year for both principal and interest , with a further four years to settle the loan . This will help encourage entrepreneurship which will benefit the IT/BPM industry as well any business today has some level of IT/BPM involvement . <p> Summary <p> This appears to be a dream budget for the IT/BPM industry . <h> BOI to target more strategic investments with tremendous opportunities provided by Budget <p> The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka ( BOI ) said it will target more strategic investments following the tremendous opportunities provided by 2021 Budget . <p> BOI trusts that incentives are part of the landscape of the investment strategy to attract sustainable investments , as they are often a decisive factor in investment decision-making . <p> Combined with the more obvious hard infrastructure offerings , locational benefits , sound legal framework and access to talent pools , investment incentives are another important piece of the puzzle to attract investments , which could also open doors to other economic benefits including technology clusters , skills development and linkage to global value chains , " BOI Director General Sanjaya Mohottala said . He emphasized With the incentives offered to investors by the 2021 Budget along with the endorsement by the Government for a consistent policy environment , has fulfilled the aspirations of BOI as the national investment promotion agency , " <p> He said Now BOI has much to play with when it comes to enticing investors with discretionary dollars and much to gain by attracting top-notch investors to establish in the country , which would provide anticipated economic and social benefits , " <p> He has pointed out that some of the new openings for investments introduced in the 2021 Budget include five fully-fledged plug and play Techno Parks in Galle , Kurunegala , Anuradhapura , Kandy and Batticaloa districts ; investments in the pharmaceutical sector ( products and medical devices ) in the dedicated state-of-the-art investment zone in Hambantota ; investments in textile manufacturing in the textile zone in Eravur ; Investments in floating solar plants and Investment opportunities under the SDP Act . <p> Apart from those , Mohottala said an array of benefits , including exemptions from Customs Duty , VAT , PAL , CESS , etc. , are available for the right investment , depending on the sector of investment and its market orientation . <p> Furthermore , benefits continued under the Inland Revenue Act No.24 of 2017 : CIT exemptions for farming including agriculture , livestock and fish farming with effect from 1 April 2019 ; CIT exemption for Information Technology and enabling services , with effect from 1 January ; CIT exemption for income earned from services rendered to persons outside Sri Lanka including foreign sourced earnings in foreign currency ; Dividend Tax exemption for dividends paid by a resident company to any non-resident person and dividends distributed by Commercial hub Enterprises with effect from 1 January ; and CIT exemption for Income derived by any non-resident person from laboratory services or standards certification services , with effect from 1 January . <p> Exemptions continued under VAT ( Amendments to VAT Act No.14 of 2002 ) include : sale of condominium housing units from VAT with effect from 1 December 2019 ; IT and enabling services with effect from 1 January ; reduced VAT of 8% other than financial services with effect from 1 December 2019 ; quantities supplied/donated of health protective equipment and similar products by export-oriented BOI companies to the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services , Department of Health Services , Tri-Forces and Police on their request ; and reduction of piece-based VAT rate applicable on domestic sale of certain garments by the export-oriented BOI companies from Rs. 100 to Rs. 25 , he said . <h> CSE welcomes Budget 2021 directed at developing the capital market <p> It said long-term sustainable measures have been proposed to encourage companies to list on the CSE , encourage savings and investments among Sri Lankan citizens and improve the attractiveness of Real Estate Investment Trust ( REITs ) through tax concessions . <p> As a measure of promoting new listings on CSE a 50% tax concession for the years 2021/2022 has been proposed to be granted for companies listing on the CSE before 31 December 2021 and to maintain a corporate tax rate of 14 percent for the subsequent three years upon listing . <p> Stock market investment will continue to be exempted from Capital Gains Tax and as an additional measure to encourage stock market investment , the Government has proposed to include investments made in shares of listed companies incurred up to Rs.100,000 per month as deductible expenditures in the calculation of personal income tax . <p> In a measure that would largely improve the attractiveness of REITs investment , the government has proposed to exempt such investments from capital gains tax and dividends free from income tax . The proposal further seeks to reduce the Stamp Duty applicable to real estate transaction associated with REITs to 0.75 percent ( from the currently applicable 4% for property transactions ) . The CSE , working with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka , introduced REITs as a new investment product on the CSE earlier this year . <p> CSE Chairman Dumith Fernando commenting on the proposals stated CSE is pleased to learn of these progressive proposals and we applaud the commitment of the Sri Lankan government to promote capital market development in the country . The tax concessions proposed to draw in stock market investments and encourage companies to explore a public listing will most certainly complement our efforts to develop a larger listed company base . <p> CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike stated The tax concession offered to companies listing on CSE by 2021 will offer financial benefits to companies and extra impetus to pursue a listing . This proposal offers vital policy support to expedite new listings in the market and greatly complements measures taken by CSE to expand listing rules to attract more companies and streamline the listing process . We believe CSE as a result is well-placed to attract new listings in 2021 . " <p> The Joint Apparel Association Forum ( JAAF ) expressed confidence in revival of the country 's biggest export sector next year onwards aided by policy direction and support outlined in the Budget 2021 as well as recovery in key markets post-COVID-19 . <p> We made submissions to the Government and most of our proposals have been incorporated in the Budget 2021 . We are pleased to see such policy direction at this critical time for the export oriented industries , " JAAF Secretary General Tuli Cooray told the Daily FT . <p> Although the industry took a harsh blow from COVID-19 which wiped out close to $ 1 billion in turnover , Cooray said resilience has always been the cornerstone for the apparel industry . <p> History has amply proved that Sri Lanka is a resilient nation and the apparel industry remains to be a major contributor . At the moment we are not thinking of revisiting our targets , but we all know that it has been a very challenging year for the entire world . In that context , we will probably see a decline in our total exports by 25% to 30% this year just over $ 4 billion . But it is with great confidence I say the apparel sector will come out of this crisis stronger than before , " he said . <p> Sri Lanka last year earned $ 5.3 billion from apparel exports , an increase of 5.1% from 2018 . Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the industry originally expected a 6% increase in exports for 2020 . Export earnings from apparel and textiles in October declined by 18.93 % to $ 356.52 million and by 21% to $ 3.6 billion in the first 10 months of 2020 from a year earlier . Despite the decline in the sector , earnings from exports of other textiles increased by 43.92% in October 2020 in comparison to October 2019 , vthe JAAF spokesman said . <p> Earnings from export of Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) related products increased by 46 % to $ 731.63 million in January to October . The strong performance was mainly due to the increased exports of other made-up articles ( HS 630790 ) and articles of apparel and clothing accessories of plastics ( HS 392620 ) . <p> Cooray said it was very challenging as the industry markets remain closed , with the world still continuing to battle the impact of the virus . Many countries such as India , China , Russia and the US are having very protective policies and not open for trade , " he added . <p> Noting that the apparel industry is continuously looking for access to new markets , he highlighted that they were exploring opportunities to open up trade dialogue with all existing and emerging markets . The UK , Japan and the US are currently reviewing unilateral trade agreements and we are open to explore such opportunities given the current circumstances , " he said . <p> Boost for fabric manufacturing <p> Cooray also commended the timely move to establish fabric processing park in Eravur , noting that it is a reflection of the Government 's confidence in the apparel industry . <p> The 2021 Budget announced tax concessions up to a maximum of 10 years under the Strategic Development Law for over $ 10 million investment in setting up fabric plants . <p> We stand firm even in the current climate that it is our intention to continue to be a strong player in the global apparel sourcing world . The establishment of the Eravur Fabric Processing Park will help reduce the imports of fabric as apparel manufacturers would be able to replace a part of their imported fabrics with fabric sourced locally , " he said . <p> According to him , there are currently seven textile mills manufacturing fabric for the export-oriented sector and these mills are capable of producing the finest quality of fabrics where the daily output is around 175 MT . <p> This is a vital component in the building the industry value addition to over 52% even after accounting for the yarn imports of the local mills . Sales from these seven fabric mills to the BOI registered apparel exporting companies amounted $ 499 million last year . In 2019 , Sri Lanka imported 255,437 MT of fabric both for the export-oriented apparel manufacturers and for consumption in the local market . The import bill for this fabric came to $ 2.2 billion . <p> Worker saety <p> With regards to work at apparel factories , he said operations continue with strict health guidelines as the industry remains a critical contributor to the sustainability of the economy . We are a part of the society . <p> Our workers ' health and safety is our prime focus , as all our businesses rely on them . Despite the heavy losses the industry incurred due to COVID-19 , we have not neglected the welfare and job security of our workforce . We now incur an additional heavy cost for the regular PCR tests , lodging facilities , transport because their lives matter . Apparel industry largest overall employer , " he said . <p> Entirely privately owned and operated , the apparel industry have successfully utilised the opportunities in the international market to evolve beyond traditional exports and tailoring designs to provide sophisticated and creative solutions through fashion BPO services , research , development and innovation centres . Around 300 garment factories employ 990,000 and over one million people are indirectly dependent or employed . <p> Budget endorses our Vision -- ICTA <p> ddThis Sharing ButtonsShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to More <p> Multiple proposals of ' Vision 2024 for ICTA : A digitally transformed Sri Lanka ' were echoed in the Budget 2021 proposals , the maiden of the present Government , it was observed BT icta . <p> In January 2021 , the current administration has charged the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka ( ICTA ) with implementing a detailed roadmap in line with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's vision to establish a digitally inclusive Sri Lanka , with a citizen-centric digital Government for the convenience of every Sri Lankan . The Budget 2021 proposals further endorses the initiatives within their road map . <p> Tech-based society and a smart nation <p> President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has given special attention to enhance digital governance using Information Technology as a tool to simplify Government mechanisms as well as market structures and processes ensuring efficient and people-focused service delivery and exchange of knowledge , says the Budget 2021 proposals . <p> Establishment of an international e-commerce and e-payment systems , the high speed data exchange system and the related mobile network systems are investment priorities . It also emphasised the establishment of new laws and organisational structures in relation to data protection , cyber security and intellectual property rights . <p> The aim of this is to convert Sri Lankan economy as a technology-based entrepreneurial economy by expanding entrepreneurial development , technological infrastructure and related services to enable enhancement of the contribution of the technology sector for exports and its contribution for knowledge and professional services of the national economy . <p> Digital government , which makes up a large part of the ICTA 's mandate , would empower citizens of Sri Lanka , allowing easy access to information that would help them in decision making , ensure participation in governance at various levels , allow automated services for public welfare and streamline government functions while ensuring transparency . <p> ICTA will also be the catalyst that drives Sri Lanka 's digital economy , which will facilitate industry expansion and increased foreign direct investment , while creating opportunity for startup innovation and entrepreneurship through capacity building and tech diffusion . Preferred business and employment opportunities would open up for local companies and the country 's technology industry would move steadily towards the goal of becoming a $ 3 billion export earner by 2024 . <p> Though not explicitly mentioned in the Budget proposals , the other important pillar is digital society . The ultimate goal of digital transformation is achieving a digital society . Both digital government and digital economy must be citizen focused and citizen centred -- with due recognition given to the public . <p> ICTA recognises this need in its design of the ' Vision 2024 for ICTA : A digitally transformed Sri Lanka ' roadmap that is entirely built around the citizens of the country , be they rich or poor , urban or rural and educated or not . The ultimate goal of ICTA 's vision is to make even the ' poorest of the poor ' sections of society benefit from ICTs in uplifting their living standards . <p> Tech parks <p> The Budget 2021 also proposes creating a techno-entrepreneur-led economy that will contribute to increase of exports and foreign earnings from the technology field and broaden the knowledge and professional services to the national economy within the coming two years . It is expected that the establishment of technology-centred investments and allied service industries will transform into high income employment opportunities for Sri Lankan youth . It is envisaged to establish five fully-fledged plug and play techno parks in Galle , Kurunegala , Anuradhapura , Kandy and Batticaloa Districts . A sum of Rs. 10 billion has been allocated to develop these techno parks as eco-friendly new cities connected to the expressway network and other infrastructure facilities . <p> Distance education <p> As the first step towards educational reforms , according to the Budget proposals , there is a requirement to formalise learning methodologies within schools , and the need to expand the provision of internet facilities to schools as well . It is also necessary to update the E-Thaksalawa learning portal , created by Ministry of Education with inputs from ICTA , along with the strengthening of the provincial IT education centres.To minimise the difficulties faced by students in rural and non ' national schools ' , due to shortage of teachers , and ensure the provision of continuous school education in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic , the ' Guru Gedara ' education channel should be made available to all students by providing television sets to schools in difficult areas . It is proposed to allocate Rs. 3 billion to convert the syllabi in line with the contemporary requirements , regulation of teacher education and training , and examination procedures are planned to be regulated under a national education policy . <p> With the inevitable disturbances to normal life during the COVID-19 situation all over the country , one of the biggest challenges to educators was to compensate the lost education by the students . With no means for students to meet their teachers face-to-face , the only possible solution was through educating them by distant learning modes . The Ministry of Education came forward with E-Thaksalawa ( http : **25;1979;TOOLONG ) the official E-learning portal for schools with learning content from Grade 1 to Grade 13 which has been made accessible to all students from March 2020 , without data charges with the support of all operators enabling school children to study from . <p> ICTA also facilitated Ministry of Education by introducing how distance learning can be adopted with live video conferencing in teaching and learning process for school children with its own newly-introduced video conferencing too , meet.gov.lk . What the Budget proposes is the continuation of the same for future in the ' Living with COVID-19 ' situation expected for a relatively prolonged period now . <p> Expanding tech education opportunities <p> The Budget has also given priority to strengthening the island-wide network of new technological universities , by modernising the technical colleges to be attractive to Sri Lankan youth , under the ' one TVET ' concept within a formal regulatory framework , by converting these institutes into degree awarding entities in parallel to the expansion of opportunities for university education . <p> Capacity building activities like these are the key in achieving the goal of making a Smart nation . ICTA is taking steps to build an empowered workforce who can join the industry at multiple levels . ICTA will ensure the competency and employability of the workforce through programs such as vocational training , foundation and conversion programs and social education , apart from the traditional tertiary , higher , professional and postgraduate education . Social education will also play a key role in developing intelligent citizens with the skills to use citizen services . <p> Electronic identity <p> The Budget also allocates Rs. 3 billion for the new digital identity project to be spearheaded by ICTA jointly with Department of Registration of Persons . Internationally governments are increasingly adopting the strategy of having a unique digital identity for their citizens with the objective of improving service quality and efficiency . That also drives financial and social inclusion by providing citizens access to citizen services and benefits of healthcare , education , and other government programs . Government of Sri Lanka has given priority to a national level program for the establishment of a Unique Digital Identity framework for the country . <p> ICTA has developed its digital government and economy frameworks with this aim in mind . The objective is to digitise the service delivery from the Government to citizens , creating nationwide digital service delivery infrastructure that can be utilised digital public utilities serving and bridging all the sectors of the economy . UDI together with the National Data and Interoperability Platform ( NDIIP ) forms the nucleus of the digital economy and Government frameworks . <p> Healthcare <p> The Budget also allocates Rs. 100 million to introduce electronic medical records at more Government hospitals . This is an extension to a project ICTA has been engaged in for the last few years . The Digital Health Project is a collaborative project being implemented by Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services and ICT Agency of Sri Lanka . The project supported 49 Government hospitals in implementing electronic medical records systems . <p> A National Project Steering Committee , Provincial Project Steering Committees and Hospital Steering Committees were formed with the representatives of Ministry of Health , Provincial Departments of Health Services and ICTA to direct/guide the project implementation at different levels . The project provided computer hardware , software , network and training for the selected hospitals to establish electronic medical records systems . <p> Nurturing tech startups <p> The Budget proposals also include providing loans of Rs. 500,000 at an interest rate of , as low as , 4% as start-up capital to support the youth , who start their own businesses on the successful completion of vocational education . This loan will have a grace period of one year for both principal and interest , with a further four years to settle the loan . <p> Accordingly , these entrepreneurs will be facilitated to receive the opportunity to pay an instalment together with interest less than Rs. 12,000 . In order to ascertain that the said loans are invested on the approved business , an annual commitment fee of 0.25% will be charged for follow up and extension services . It is proposed to give tax exemptions of five years to these businesses and the cost of funds of funds provided for such start-up capital , provided by banks and finance agencies as deductible expenditure in the calculation of taxes . <p> ICTA , over a long period , has been working assisting start-ups to establish themselves in the local ecosystem . Startup Sri Lanka was an initiative by ICTA with the former Ministry and startup community . Its mission is to transform Sri Lanka through technology and entrepreneurship . ICTA is working to support the tech community and accelerate the growth of Sri Lankan startups with the belief that strong home-grown startups and freelance community is vital to the future growth of Sri Lankan jobs and wealth . <p> ICTA 's efforts are focused on trying to get the big picture right for Sri Lankan startups and freelancers -- improving the regulatory environment , building a case for the right sort of Government support for a fast-growing sector , and increasing public awareness of the impact of tech startups and freelancers across the country . ICTA works with startups , freelancers and investors to help around the country get the settings right to create successful startup ecosystems . <p> ICTA recently worked together with Ministry of Finance in establishing guidelines for State organisations to exclusively procure their software and hardware requirements less than Rs. 2 million from local startups We need to end the era of sending our mothers , sisters and daughters as domestic workers , and sending our brothers and children as unskilled workers , drivers , room boys and white color workers to foreign countries and enhance our future generations as highly digitasl/IT knowledge based personalities who can become a beacon to the future world . The Budget has done its part very well and it is now the student population to grab the opportunities it has presented . <h> Courtesy Hiru News <p> The Ministry of Finance has responded to Fitch Ratings downgrading Sri Lanka to ' CCC ' . <p> Issuing a statement the MoF states that Fitch Ratings have failed to recognize the robust policy framework of the new Government for addressing the legacy issues , including the concerns raised by Fitch Ratings , and ensuring ongoing economic recovery and Macroeconomic stability of the Country . &lt; <p> It further states that Fitch Ratings project a government debt to GDP ratio of 100 per cent at end 2020 and 116 per cent at end 2024 , while grossly overestimating the budget deficit at around 11.5 per cent of GDP in 2021 and 2022 . As the relative share of outstanding foreign debt has already fallen to 44 per cent as per the latest available data , projecting a rise in foreign debt servicing obligations in the period ahead can not be corroborated with facts . <p> The Ministry of Finance states that the Government wishes to reiterate that Sri Lanka will engage with all investment and development partners and implement necessary measures to build up reserves through non-debt creating inflows . <p> Therefore , investors are invited to approach the Sri Lankan policy authorities at the highest levels who are dedicated to facilitate any one-on-one or roadshow discussions , without being dissuaded by such baseless rating action . <p> The Full text of the message is given below <p> We observe , with disappointment , today 's rating action by Fitch Ratings expressing concerns about Sri Lanka 's external debt repayment capacity over the medium-term , financing options and debt sustainability risks , at a time when the newly appointed Government has just announced its medium term policy framework in its Budget 2020 . We do not accept this downgrade as it fails to recognize the robust policy framework of the new Government for addressing the legacy issues , including the concerns raised by Fitch Ratings , and ensuring ongoing economic recovery and macroeconomic stability of the Country . <p> It is surprising to note that Fitch Ratings ' assessment has ignored several key proposals presented in the Government Budget 2021 with regard to deficit financing in the period ahead . As indicated in the Budget 2021 , the Government has adopted a novel approach in relation to foreign financing while enhancing the effectiveness of already secured financing channels , aimed at reducing the share of foreign financing of the budget deficit over the medium term . Yet , Fitch Ratings builds up its argument based on the ' existing financing model ' , thus adopting a backward looking approach . In contrast , the forward looking financing model of the Government , which is skewed heavily towards domestic financing and will capitalize on the benefits of increased domestic savings and the low interest rate regime already in place given subdued aggregate demand conditions and well anchored inflation expectations . It is also noteworthy that the low interest rate regime will improve economic growth prospects in the period ahead , alongside the incentives being offered for capital investment , thereby supporting the envisaged debt consolidation efforts significantly . As the relative share of outstanding foreign debt has already fallen to 44 per cent as per the latest available data , projecting a rise in foreign debt servicing obligations in the period ahead can not be corroborated with facts . Based on such unfounded assumptions , Fitch Ratings project a government debt to GDP ratio of 100 per cent at end 2020 and 116 per cent at end 2024 , while grossly overestimating the budget deficit at around 11.5 per cent of GDP in 2021 and 2022 . The rating action announced today is based on these ill-informed model projections , without any evidence-based and objective analysis . Further , as the share of domestic government debt rises in a low interest rate regime , some increase in overall public debt to GDP in the near term is not considered as a significant concern . Furthermore , with the strong pro-growth policy orientation of the Government as clearly articulated in the Budget 2021 , a possible rise in local currency denominated government debt in the near term can be effectively managed within the envisaged fiscal consolidation path in the medium term , as government revenue increases helped by the envisaged take-off of the economy . It is also unrealistic to assume that the Government will take a rigid expenditure path , if by any chance , the expected improvement in revenue does not materialize . <p> Sri Lanka , similar to many of its peers in the emerging market group , experienced initial capital outflows , exchange rate depreciation , slowdown in activity , and pressure on government finances , in response to the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic . However , Sri Lanka recognized its priorities early , and swiftly introduced a policy package to withstand and mitigate potential adverse effects of slowing economic activity , while building buffers for countering possible external financing challenges . With the decisive conclusion of the Parliamentary election in August 2020 , the Government of Sri Lanka is now moving along a recovery path towards growth and stability even in the midst of the transitory disruptions caused by the second wave of the pandemic . The Sri Lankan economy is expected to have recovered strongly during the third quarter of 2020 , when the second wave hit economic activity . Earlier than expected return of merchandise exports to pre-COVID monthly averages of US dollars 1 billion and the curtailment of non-essential imports have reduced the trade deficit notably for the sixth consecutive month in October 2020 , saving US dollars 3.3 billion in import expenditure so far during the year . Meanwhile , larger than expected increase in workers ' remittances , together with other services exports , including IT services and shipping , helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic . Improvements in trade balance and workers ' remittances have helped cushion the current account deficit to a large extent in spite of the downturn in tourism , thereby reducing pressure on the exchange rate and official reserves . <p> Foreign Direct Investments , which slowed in the first half of the year , appear promising in the period ahead , particularly with the expected inflows to the Colombo Port City project and for new manufacturing projects in industrial zones , including Hambantota . The new legal framework conducive to promote commercial services and investment in Port City will be presented to the Parliament in January 2021 . The first phase of the Port City project is scheduled to begin in 2021 , boosting economic activity and attracting sizable non-debt creating financial flows to the country . Further , from the list of FDIs approved by the Board of Investment totaling over US dollars 5 billion , a considerable share is expected to materialize , supported by the new business-friendly environment of the country , and several major investment projects are already in the process of implementation . Other expected investments include import alternative industries as well as investments by the World Bank and other international development finance institutions . Nevertheless , the Government will adopt a policy of ' guided ' imports as the envisaged improvements in growth prospects would experience some rise in import demand on raw material and investment goods , as the foreign exchange liquidity concerns are expected to wane in the period ahead . It is noteworthy , however , that the Government will remain committed to strengthening the dynamics of the economy based on the principle of self-reliance . With regard to portfolio flows , foreign inflows to the government securities market are yet to resume but no significant outflows were noted in recent months . Stock market indices have improved continuously and surpassed the pre-COVID levels with a record level of activities over the last three months . The tourism sector has been supported by domestic tourism and is expected to flourish once global tourist flows resume after the pandemic subsides . Despite the COVID-19 driven slowdown in economic activities in the first half of 2020 , the economy is expected to rebound strongly in 2021 and sustain its growth momentum over the medium term , supported by the stimulus measures already in place and the effective implementation of the pro-growth policy proposals announced in the Government Budget 2021 . <p> Given these developments , the exchange rate remains broadly stable , and the Central Bank was able to absorb foreign exchange of over US dollars 500 million on a gross basis since May 2020 . Gross official reserves were estimated at US dollars 5.9 billion at end October 2020 , with an import cover of 4.2 months . The Government has repeatedly expressed its ability and willingness to meet all its debt obligations falling due in the period ahead . With the observed rise in foreign debt servicing and public debt in the period ahead , the Government focused more on curtailing government expenditure , by resorting to several self imposed austerity-like economic measures on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , through announcing measures such as restricting imports of non-essential goods , encouraging the State Owned Enterprises to curtail non-essential expenditure including purchasing of motor vehicles , instructing the state entities to strictly manage expenditure on fuel and other utilities , non-priority procurement , etc . The Government 's strategy in foreign debt management is to avoid total rolling over of the upcoming maturities , while its strategy in overall debt management is to repay the outstanding debt , while not raising more loans over the existing level over the medium term . <p> The recently introduced measures to entice foreign investors to the government securities market and the real economy through an attractive foreign exchange swap arrangement are likely to help enhance foreign currency inflows , in addition to the support of friendly countries , such as the swap arrangements and the expected disbursement of the 2nd tranche of the Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility proceeds from the China Development Bank in December 2020 . Accordingly , gross official reserves are expected to improve to around US dollars 6.5 billion by end 2020 . <p> Sri Lanka 's policy environment remains facilitative of enabling high economic growth beyond the recovery phase while preserving macroeconomic stability . On the back of over 11 years of well anchored mid-single digit levels of inflation , the Central Bank has pursued an increasingly accommodative monetary policy stance . Fiscal policy , as re-emphasized in the Budget 2021 , remains focused on supporting the economy , while expecting to return to the envisaged path of consolidation from 2022 . Hence , both fiscal and monetary policies have prioritized supporting people , businesses and thereby the economy , without jeopardizing the macroeconomic balance of the country . <p> In the above context , it is puzzling why Fitch Ratings downgraded Sri Lanka when the well-articulated policy framework presented in the Budget 2021 is receiving wider commendation for consistency and continuity , with a clear medium term view of fiscal consolidation on a realistic economic footing . Such action simply demonstrates the prejudicial approach of Fitch Ratings , and lacks due consideration to alternative strategies that the Government is committed to embark on in the period ahead . Practices of this nature by an international rating agency without a constructive engagement with the Government on the promising alternative , policy approaches are likely to make the agency concerned completely irrelevant as the country rises strongly in the period ahead . <p> Given these circumstances , the Government of Sri Lanka wishes to reaffirm to foreign investors that have put faith in Sri Lanka continuously over the past several years that Sri Lanka remains willing and able to meet its debt obligations , as it has done impeccably in the past . Furthermore , Fitch Ratings question Sri Lanka 's ability to meet its external debt repayments based on their forecast of a decline in foreign exchange reserves in 2021 and 2022 . Fitch Ratings also raise concerns on Sri Lanka 's external financing options . The Government categorically denies all such uncorroborated concerns . It is notable , that the Government has honoured all its liabilities so far during the year amounting to over US dollars 4 billion , in spite of the adverse speculation faced by the Sri Lankan economy since the end of 2019 . The Government wishes to reiterate that Sri Lanka will engage with all investment and development partners and implement necessary measures to build up reserves through non-debt creating inflows . <p> Investors are invited to approach the Sri Lankan policy authorities at the highest levels who are dedicated to facilitate any one-on-one or roadshow discussions , without being dissuaded by such baseless rating action <h> Courtesy Reuters <p> LONDON , Nov 27 ( Reuters ) -- Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka 's sovereign debt to CCC " on Friday , warning that the country was at increasing risk of missing debt payments due to the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Heavily reliant on tourism and garment exports for foreign exchange reserves , the island nation has been hit hard by the pandemic , which has dampened consumer demand and curtailed almost all global travel this year . <p> The CCC rating means Fitch considers default to be a real possibility " . <p> We think there are now increasing risks to Sri Lanka 's ability to meet its external debt repayments , " Fitch analysts said in a note . <p> Sri Lanka has around $4 billion of debt repayments due annually until 2025 , while total foreign exchange reserves stand at just under $6 billion . <p> Earlier this month Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa presented an ambitious budget that aimed to more than halve the fiscal deficit over the medium term . <p> But Fitch said it expected the country ' fiscal position to worsen , not improve , over the next few years . <p> It expects Sri Lanka 's government debt-to-GDP ratio to increase to about 100% in 2020 from 86.8% in 2019 , and to rise to around 116% in 2024 . <p> This is in sharp contrast to Sri Lanka 's own targets , which see a reduction in debt-to-GDP to 75.5% in 2025 , from an estimated 95.1% in 2020 . <p> Spokesmen for Sri Lanka 's finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment . <p> The ministry said in September that a similar downgrade by Moody 's was reckless " and unwarranted " , noting Sri Lanka has consistently received support from India and China .
