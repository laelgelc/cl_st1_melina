But when you dig below the surface a bit , you 'll see that that is n't really the case . In fact , wide divergences had appeared in the market late in 2017 . <p> The dispersion between the best- and worst-performing sectors in the S&amp;P 500 Index since the beginning of last year has been eye-popping . In 2017 the performance of the tech sector nearly doubled that of the broad index , gaining 41 percent on a total return basis versus around 22 percent for the index as a whole ( as of Dec. 20 ) , a truly astonishing figure . <p> Even more astonishing is the spread between the best- and worst-performing sectors , with the telecom and energy sectors each underperforming tech by about 45 percent and the index as a whole by more than 25 percent . <p> So clearly , not all ships are rising at anywhere near the same pace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort have happened in the past , and in the case of the energy sector , it sometimes has been a harbinger of a downturn in the price of crude oil . In past instances , this coincided with a stronger dollar and broad commodity price weakness which has contributed to downward pressure on earnings for the overall S&amp;P 500 Index , so we view the energy sector divergence in 2017 as a warning sign for 2018 . <p> My tax take <p> Here 's my two cents on the impact of the new US tax legislation . The tax reform will impact large-cap companies differently . For instance , domestic-facing companies will tend to experience a big drop in effective tax rates which should boost operating earnings on the order of 8-10 percent over the previous year , all else being equal . <p> However , the high-flying tech sector , with its heavy overseas sales , pays an effective tax rate , on average , of about 19-20 percent , close to the new statutory rate of 21 percent . So it is unlikely to be helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new tax law , highly-indebted companies could end up worse off , as they will not be able to deduct interest expense above 30 percent of their cash flow . Companies with large research and development budgets , such as pharmaceutical companies , and big capital goods manufacturers are likely to benefit from the immediate expensing of short-lived capital investments . <p> Overall , the law is generally beneficial for large-cap US companies , but not in equal measure . Your mileage may vary . <p> It 's my view that the new tax legislation wo n't lift all stocks immediately or in a lasting fashion . I would not use the approval of the package as justification to blindly purchase baskets of stocks . The devil is in the detail and those ramifications need to be analyzed . <p> I also believe that the solid global economic growth we 're seeing today does n't benefit all markets . The undercurrents are dramatic and may carry messages . For example , they imply that future growth may not be as strong as that which we 're seeing today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk that complacency supersedes scrutiny . Ignoring fundamentals and valuations has the potential to trip up unwary investors . The traps are there ; we 've seen episodes like this before . <p> This is all the more reason for investors to tread lightly and deliberately into non-selective packages of expensive financial assets . <p> As StartmeupHK ( http : //www.startmeup.hk/ ) , Hong Kong 's annual flagship startup event , gets set for its 2018 lineup of programs and events later this month , we examine a core question that underlies the very startup process : deciding ... <p> Last week , on January 4 , the People 's Bank of China ( PBoC ) accepted a license application for consumer credit bureau led by the National Internet Finance Association of China .

Stay tuned to read stories from the runners-up and Adult category . <p> Junior first prize winner : Jia , by Oliver Lee <p> Jia flew across the room , smashing into the hardwood floor with a sickening thud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles of pain jabbing into her skin . Tears welled in her brown eyes , the features of her face contorted into an ugly smirk . Her father stood over her , beer bottle in hand , glaring at her with those all-too-familiar sinister eyes . His hair was tangled and matted , a horrific smile etched on his face . He turned quickly on his heel , sinking back into the sand-colored sofa in front of the rusty television . <p> " Do n't bother me again . " <p> These beatings were common in the Kwok household , not a day went by without little four-year-old Jia having to endure horrors that no one should ever have to go through . Jia held back a whimper , slowly struggling back to her feet . She wanted so desperately to do something , but there was no salvation for her . No mother to protect her , no friends to care and no one in the entire world who gave her a second thought . So this was how she lived : helpless , alone and abused , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how she learned tolerance . <p> *** <p> Jia leapt from her mattress , sending dust and bugs flying into the sunlight that entered through a small window in the corner of the room . Her flowing black hair caught in the loose seams of her bed , sending her crashing back onto it with a giggle . She ran barefoot to the bathroom , gazing at her teenage features in a moldy , cracking mirror . Her face had matured quickly since she was a child , and she had blossomed into a beautiful young girl . <p> She flinched as she heard the thud of her father 's footsteps , scrambling to hide in a corner . His head rounded the corner , his eyes glazed over with what seemed like a thin layer of cloud . He stared blankly for a few seconds before his wrist twitched , the coins which he had thrown clattering across the marble tiles . His head retracted , and his steps could be heard shuffling back to the study . <p> Jia sighed in relief , picking up the coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed back to her room , slipping on a pair of tattered flip-flops before bolting from the house . <p> As she headed towards the marketplace , she was met with a horrifying sight . A leper and her children lay in the street , their pus covered eyes struggling to open against the radiant sunlight . Their hands were stretched out , imploring anyone passing by for a shred of kindness . Jia 's eyes widened in pity , and she approached them slowly , her mind blank . She dropped the coins into the palms of their hands before turning to run , speeding back towards her home . Jia did n't know what had made her do it , perhaps it was shock , perhaps it was an instinct . But whatever it was , it changed something inside her . And as the door to her home creaked open , she stooped her head , awaiting the beating that she knew was coming . <p> This was how she learned generosity . <p> *** <p> Jia screamed , her father was n't breathing . She grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it through her shirt . She dialed the numbers 9-1-1 with shaking fingers , panicked breaths escaping from her gasping lips . <p> " Hello this is the police department , how may I- <p> " It 's my father . H-He is n't breathing " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " I-I do n't know , can you please come ? " <p> " What is your address Ma'am ? " <p> " 95th Mek kau way " <p> " How old is your father ? " " 52 " <p> " And you ? " <p> " Twenty , c-can you please come ? N-now please ... " <p> " Please stay calm ma'am , we have officers and an ambulance on the way " <p> " Th-thank you . " <p> The next hour was a blur , she remembered police sirens wailing , blue , red , and the muffled voices of the paramedics as they burst through the door . And as she sat next to her father on the ambulance , the freezing metal of the seats plastered against her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow . The sound of his heart flat lining filled the tiny back room . She placed her pale hand on her fathers wrinkled forehead , and a single tear leaked from the corner of her eye as she waved away the medics . There was nothing they could do . And as her father slipped away into the arms of death , she held his hand , heaving sobs racking her slim frame . Wishing that just for a moment , she could have him back . <p> This was how she learned forgiveness . <p> *** <p> Jia sat next to her fathers grave , rain drops pattering down around her . Her breath formed little clouds , the brittle winter air biting into her skin . In her hand she held a bouquet of flowers , not minding the sting of the roses as they sunk into her skin . She chanted a prayer for her father before laying the roses at the foot of the grave , the icy wind blowing little flecks of snow onto her red lips . She started in shock as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she snapped her head towards him , her brow wrinkled in confusion . A handsome man set next to her , his blue eyes gazing into hers . Jia did n't know , did n't need to know who he was . Something about this man seemed to resonate within her . And without saying a word , they silently connected through some unknown force . She parted her lips to ask him who he was , but she was met with a singe one of his fingers resting on her lips . <p> " Let us mourn together . " <p> " You knew my father ? " <p> " No , but mine rests here too . " <p> Jia closed her eyes and sank onto his shoulder . And this was how they sat for hours and hours . <p> This was how she learned harmony . <p> *** <p> Jia grinned from ear to ear , it was the perfect day for a wedding . Balloons and streamers floated through the air , a mixture of blue , pink and white . A cool breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her wedding dress flowing behind her like a river of marble . The smell of fresh cut grass filled her nostrils , and the hum of the wedding guests continued as they adjusted their ties and hair bows . All heads turned as the wedding bells began to chime , she let out a breath of excitement and began walking down the aisle . Although it was only a matter of 20 meters , it felt like an eternity before Jia reached the pagoda , her hair embezzled with sapphire and gold . Her husband stood at the top of the steps , his blue gaze beckoning her . Her feet ascended the shining white steps towards him , excitement building with every step . She quickly glanced behind her , looking back at the hundreds of smiles that greeted her . She still could n't believe that all this had blossomed from that one moment that her soon to be husband had sat next to her in that dreary graveyard . She ascended the last few steps with a bounce , her lips quivering in anticipation . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into her eyes , her heart did a little twirl inside her . <p> This was how she learned love . <p> *** <p> Jia screamed as the car skid across the frosty road , the wheels scraping along the asphalt . The glass of the car windows shattered as the truck smashed into them , crumpling their car like paper . Jia 's head slammed against the dashboard as their car flipped into the air , the sheer impact jolting her into unconsciousness . And as the world faded to black , all she could hear were the screams of her five-year-old son in the back seat . <p> Jia awoke , but found that she was unable to move . Blood trickled into her mouth , the metallic taste of it overwhelming her senses . She heard loud ringing in her ears , and pieces of glass had embedded themselves into various parts of her body . Her legs were trapped by crushed metal , and as she looked downwards , her mouth opened in a silent cry of agony . Her pregnant belly had been crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod that passed directly through the skull of her unborn smile . She turned to scream for her husband , only to find that the side of the car which he had been sitting on had been ripped clean off , leaving nothing but entrails scattered on the icy ground . Jia tried to swivel around to make sure her son was fine , but the sheer agony that this caused was unbearable . She winced as the pain began to build , and sank back into unconsciousness against her will . <p> This was how she learned loss . <p> *** <p> Jia had once had visions of the future . Of how she would marry a rich , handsome man , live in a huge home , have two children and live to a ripe old age . All this would have come true if it was n't for that fateful night . The night that her life may as well have ended . Now she was a single mother of one with almost no money ; her rich relatives had bombarded her with the best lawyers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At first Jia had tried to fight back , but without her husband 's last will and testament she was soon forced to give up . Her son was now 17 , and she was working double-shifts at a dingy little restaurant to provide for his college funds . As stress began to set in , so did age . Her features had begun to soften , and her once bright eyes had dulled . Little wrinkles had begun to creep onto her face , and the inevitable demons of sickness and weakness had begun to plague her . But none of these things were enough to stop Jia , she worked as much as her body would allow to support her child , throwing her life away to nourish her son . <p> This was how she learned strength . <p> *** <p> It took Jia all of her remaining will and strength to return to her childhood home . Her body , now that of an old woman , was now riddled with the complications of old age . Her hair was silver now , and liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cane to walk now , her legs had folded beneath her after years of work . <p> Although age had finally caught up with her , she still possessed a beautiful smile , and the twinkle in her eye that had been absent for so many years had now returned . She was now blessed with two grandchildren ; her son had gone on to become a successful businessman . The little car that belonged to the man who had driven her there rattled to a halt , tiny particles of dust puffing up from the seats as it did so . The driver opened the passenger door for Jia with a click , and she grunted in effort as she got out of the car . She handed the driver a few notes with her unsteady arthritic hands , and gave him a nod before beginning to hobble down the stone path . <p> The streets of her home were emptier than she remembered , but they were still filled with the familiar smell of barbecue smoke . She stepped past a puddle , and in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murky water , a pale , round face . An almost unrecognizable face staring back . Her face . Time had gone by so fast In an instant , her life came rushing back to her , images and memories pouring back into her mind . As these images faded , a final piece seemed to click into her heart . She let out a deep , long sigh of relief , something inside her had finally been completed . She had learned to accept and let go . And as she continued to hobble down the smoky streets of her childhood , a smile spread across her face . She had found meaning . <h> Support independent media <h> Partner with HKFP <h> HKFP Weekly Newsletter <p> Email address : <p> We will not share your details with third parties . <h> What is Hong Kong Free Press ? <p> Hong Kong Free Press is a non-profit English language news source seeking to unite critical voices .

@@24350232 <h> Does Carrie Lam have the guts for drastic property measures ? <p> Will Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor dare go where no other chief executive has gone before to tackle Hong Kong 's housing crunch once and for all ? Will her administration have the guts to shut Hong Kong 's housing market to all outsiders ? Is Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po 's idea of taking action against property owners who hoard vacant flats just empty talk ? <p> In his budget speech in February , Chan floated the idea of penalizing property owners who kept flats vacant . He then told me in a TV interview that about 9,500 vacant were left vacant at the end of last year . With the number rising , he hinted a penalty tax was one option . <p> We all know why some developers and homeowners hoard vacant flats . They want to further drive up already sky-high home prices . The financial secretary seemed sincere when he told me he had asked the Transport and Housing Bureau to look at how to stop this practice . <p> Hong Kong 's housing shortage has no light at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tunnel , so forget about the light at the end of it . It is not illegal for property owners to squeeze aspiring homeowners . Most would , however , agree it is immoral . Taxing vacant flats wo n't ease the housing shortage but it 's the moral thing to do . <p> Greed in the property sector , combined with government impotence , is ingrained in our culture . That 's why Hong Kong 's home prices are the most expensive in the world . That in itself need not be shameful if citizens could actually afford the high prices . But most ordinary Hong Kong people have long been priced out of the market . There is neither government political will nor property sector conscience for this to change anytime soon . <p> Two months have passed since Chan floated the idea of taxing vacant flats . The idea has since died a silent death . I have reliably heard from some people that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor may not be too keen on imposing such a tax . If this is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under pressure or fears pressure from the property sector . <p> It would be a mistake to bow to such pressure . Developers have been allowed to get away with too much already at the expense of ordinary people .

It 's bound to be a contentious and divisive debate . Options range from reclamation outside Victoria Harbor and using fringes of country parks to brownfield sites and the Fanling golf course . But the truth is no amount of land can ease the housing shortage and make homes affordable to ordinary Hong Kong people . <p> Our housing market does n't only serve Hong Kong 's 7.4 million population .

Price is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money out . <p> They consider Hong Kong property to be a good investment . Prices will never come down regardless of how many flats we build . There will always be hot money chasing these flats at whatever price . That means affordable homes in the private sector will remain a pipe dream for ordinary Hong Kong people . <p> Making Hong Kong homes available only to Hong Kong people goes against the free market principle that we cherish . This principle has long served as the cornerstone of our prosperity . But when the going gets tough , the tough must get going . That means daring to pursue unconventional but bold ideas . Shutting our homes market to not only mainland but all foreign buyers is unconventional and will generate fierce opposition from vested interests led by the property sector .

Yes , it went against our free market principles , as did limiting the number of visits by Shenzhen tourists to combat parallel goods trading . But both measures worked well . <p> At times of crises , departing from principles is a necessary evil . Unaffordable housing is Hong Kong 's biggest crisis , far bigger than the lack of democratic reforms . It is the source of the greatest disillusionment and unhappiness among Hong Kong 's young people . It is a ticking time-bomb that , if left unsolved , could explode . <p> Lam 's predecessors have all tried conventional means to tackle the housing crisis . None of them worked .

Their shift away from the financing of coal plants reflect a trend led by global insurers in sustainable investing . <p> Major European insurance firms such as AXA and Allianz are leading the way by divesting from businesses that are involved in large-scale coal-fired power plant expansion projects . The trend could expand throughout the financial sector . 
@@24638231 <p> He adds that the yardstick used to assess sovereigns is quite different from corporates . ESG is also a developing field . Methodologies are being constructed and tested . In some areas , such as in the case of corporates , it is quite rich . " When it comes to sovereigns , we have done quite a bit work internally . We are focused on the E part of ESG or environmental . " <p> As you start assessing these emerging markets based on criteria shaped by investment values , Ahmed points out , then you lock yourself out of 95% of the emerging-market countries . " The environment side is quite interesting and relevant because tangible signs of climate change are happening and have links to macro outcomes . <p> Most of these emerging markets are exposed to climate change , especially the more populous ones in Asia . There is a lot verifiable data available -- carbon intensity , sustainable development goals ( SDG ) and other World Bank indicators . " <p> But there is still complexity in how to apply that to portfolios because there are still a lot of hidden variables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in fixed income using GBI ( JPMorgan Government Bond Index ) and if you include India and China as well , you might as well rank those countries on a per-capita income basis -- countries that are poorer will have lower SDG scores ; you might as well not use any ESG criteria and reward/punish these countries on the basis of per-capita income . " <p> Ahmed says that his firm therefore has to apply " sophisticated investment machinery to take those pseudo effects out and to see what the rankings of these countries actually are , based on the various variables " . He adds that the key is the E part of ESG that has some kind of impact on future performance rather than the S or the G when it comes to the larger emerging markets . <p> On the equity side , Ross Teverson , head of strategy , emerging markets , Jupiter Asset Management , which has US$71.5 billion in assets under management , says that people care a lot about ESG because clients care about it . " I have always been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance is an important part of long-term investing in emerging markets . Ideally , you have a good alignment of interest between management and minority shareholders . " <p> There is increasing awareness on E and S , he says , because there is a great push from clients to make sure that they can report to their end-customers that they take these things into account . Teverson is of the view that governance in the emerging markets has improved a lot over the past two decades . One of the easiest ways to prove that is to look at the proportion of companies paying a dividend . " When I started investing in emerging markets in the late 1990s , at the time 40% of companies paid some sort of dividend . Now , that is closer to 90% . Cash coming back to us is the single best measure or evidence that there is some alignment between management and us as minority shareholders . " <p> In China , Teverson agrees that when the topic of governance is discussed , the question is can the numbers be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past that have made investors understandably quite wary that companies in China audited by some of the big accounting firms have been lying about their cash balances . As an investor , you always have to be slightly cautious , do your due diligence to make sure that you are avoiding those types of cases of poor governance . " <p> He argues that those have become less common . It has been a while since we have had an accounting scandal like that in China . Overall , governance is improving even in state-owned enterprises . " China Unicom , which is the second largest mobile operator in China , has recently introduced a management share-based incentive scheme that sets very clear targets for net income growth over the next three years . You have a state-owned enterprise , which previously could just have been a tool of state policy . Now you have a management team that are very clearly incentivized to grow profits and increase value for shareholders . " <p> Focusing on governance is very important and a good thing to do when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets and EMEA macro research , fixed income , at Invesco , which has US$934.2 billion of assets under management . Taking a step back , he says the difference between ESG in emerging markets -- in China and India in particular -- compared with the developed markets is that when poor governance issues emerge in countries with strong institutions and the rule of law , something changes . " Somebody goes to jail ; a price is paid ; rules are tightened , and things hopefully change , and we do n't have a repeat of the same sort of crisis , " he points out . " In countries with weaker institutions , where the state is involved in large swathes of the economy and very close to many large corporations , it may be quite difficult to make those kinds of changes . " <p> That is the core reason , he thinks , why you would have a stronger misalignment of minority shareholders ' interest with the majority shareholder . " If you are running a company for a state , presumably you are running it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an authoritarian entity , or the institutions of the state are not necessarily geared towards what you might generally describe as the wider public interest but a much narrower public interest , which is in the case of many emerging-market countries , it may be quite difficult to get that alignment right . You may be able to persuade people that you are doing that by paying them a dividend and it may even be true . But there will be some doubt about that , and therefore there will be a discount for that governance issue .

@@24990233 <h> Why have so many Hongkongers developed amnesia over the Tiananmen massacre ? <p> Nearly 30 years after the brutal , bloody fact , it was always predictable that the rest of the world would move on and largely forget the hundreds , if not thousands , of people who died in and around Tiananmen Square on June 3 and 4 , 1989 . <p> After all , since those dark days in Chinese history -- currently not included , by the way , in the revised history curriculum for Hong Kong secondary students -- many new crises have broken out and much additional mayhem has been perpetrated around the globe . It 's hard to stay focused on a single historical tragedy when so many others rise up to take its place . <p> What 's hard to fathom , however , is how and why so many Hongkongers have also developed Tiananmen amnesia lately . <p> Students mourning Hu Yaobang in 1989 . Photo : RFA . <p> This is the proud city that witnessed a massive demonstration against the decision by China 's then-paramount leader , Deng Xiaoping , to launch a military assault on peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occupied the square for nearly two months following the death of their hero , Hu Yaobang , the purged former general secretary of the Communist Party who became a symbol of political and economic reforms opposed by hardliners in Deng 's government . <p> Hu 's death inspired thousands of students across the country to leave their universities and march through the streets of Beijing and into the square , singing patriotic songs and demanding greater democracy . <p> In the weeks that followed , additional tens of thousands would join the protesting students . By May 13 , with some 300,000 people now gathered in the square , a student-led hunger strike would win wide-spread public support as well as a meeting between student leaders and then-premier Li Peng . <p> But soon thereafter , of course , came martial law and a night of horror and bloodshed on June 3 that spilled into the morning hours of June 4 . <p> The youthful dream of a democratic China had ended in a People 's Liberation Army massacre of innocents five years after the signing of the Sino-British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty and eight years prior to the agreed-upon handover date of July 1 , 1997 . <p> Hongkongers , deeply shaken by the Chinese government 's ruthless assault on its own people , were quick to express their outrage . In a city which then had a population of only 5.6 million , one million protesters poured into the streets to demonstrate their support for the students and their disgust for a regime that had rolled over their lives and dreams with PLA tanks . <p> And every June 4 since then has been marked by a solemn , candlelight memorial vigil for the Tiananmen dead in Victoria Park during which speeches are made urging the Chinese leadership to reverse the official verdict on the Tiananmen protesters as a traitorous group of counterrevolutionaries who deserved their grisly fate . <p> Through times of searing heat and torrential rain , the vigil has stubbornly persisted and , after 1997 , Hong Kong became the only city in China where people enjoyed the freedom to challenge the central government in this way . On the mainland , June 4 is just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice is perennially resurrected . <p> Understandably , depending on the weather and the events and mood of any particular year , turnout for the vigil has been up and down since the first 150,000 people lifted up their memorial candles on June 4 , 1990 . Indeed , after a turnout of 80,000 in 1992 , numbers dropped dramatically for several years as Beijing 's hands-off approach toward Hong Kong inspired confidence in the " one country , two systems " agreement that was supposed to guarantee the city 's personal freedoms and autonomy . <p> Attendance spiked again at 70,000 for the 10th anniversary of the crackdown and at 82,000 on the 15th anniversary but otherwise , those two years aside , averaged around 47,500 between 1999 and 2008 . This relatively low figure was no doubt welcomed by the Chinese leadership at the time as a sign that Hong Kong was gradually entering the fold . <p> Then came the record turnout of 200,000 to mark the 20th anniversary and , as Beijing 's heavy hand reached more frequently and forcefully into Hong Kong affairs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110,000 , according to the vigil 's organiser , the Hong Kong Alliance for the Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China . <p> Lately , however , in the wake of the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy protests -- which sputtered out after producing no concrete results -- and during the rise of a radical localist movement that shuns everything associated with the mainland , the alliance has come under attack for sponsoring an empty ritual that no longer holds relevance for the 7.4 million people who live in Hong Kong today . <p> Nothing could be further from the truth . As the rest of world rushes to embrace China as a 21st-century economic superpower with an ambitious international agenda and an open wallet , it becomes even more important for Hong Kong , still the only free Chinese city , to stage this annual reminder of a brutality that is now papered over by an ever-mounting wad of cash . <p> These days an aggressively hands-on central government , spooked by Occupy and recent calls for self-determination and independence , is actively moving to bring recalcitrant Hong Kong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . <p> Over the past several years , we have seen Hong Kong booksellers abducted by mainland security agents and duly elected lawmakers ousted from the Legislative Council while other popular would-be candidates were banned from running for office altogether . <p> Mainland laws -- and perhaps mainland-style interrogations and detentions -- will soon apply in the West Kowloon terminus of the high-speed express rail system that we were , at great expense , steamrolled into joining , and the city 's leaders now go silent when Hong Kong reporters are beaten up on the mainland . <p> Amid all these alarming developments , candles still shine through the night on June 4 in Victoria Park ; the vigil goes on , rightly honouring those who died in Tiananmen 29 years ago , denouncing a government that refuses to acknowledge its murderous mistake and underscoring Hong Kong 's unique identity as a special administrative region of China . <p> Despite all the recent setbacks , that identity remains strong and robust .

@@24990234 <h> Italy 's slow-motion euro train wreck <p> The possibility of a populist , euroskeptic government coming to power in Italy has focused investors ' minds like few other events this year . The yield differential , or spread , between Italian and German bonds has widened sharply , indicating that investors view Italy as a riskier bet . And Italian equity prices have fallen -- particularly in domestic bank shares , the best proxy of country risk -- while insurance premia against a sovereign default have increased . There are even fears that Italy could trigger another global financial crisis , especially if a fresh election becomes a de facto referendum on the euro . <p> Even before Italy 's March election , in which the populist Five Star Movement ( M5S ) and the right-wing League party captured a combined parliamentary majority , we warned that the market was being too complacent toward the country . Italy now finds itself in more than just a one-off political crisis . It must confront its core national dilemma : whether to remain shackled by the euro or try to reclaim economic , political , and institutional sovereignty . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eurozone in the short run , if only to avoid the damage a full-scale rupture would cause . In the long run , however , the country could increasingly be tempted to abandon the single currency . <p> Since Italy returned to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1996 -- after withdrawing from it in 1992 -- it has surrendered its monetary sovereignty to the European Central Bank . In exchange , it has enjoyed much lower inflation and borrowing costs , resulting in a dramatic reduction in interest payments -- from 12 percent of GDP to 5 percent -- on its massive public debt . <p> Still , Italians have long been uncomfortable with the lack of an independent monetary policy , and that sense of lost control has gradually overshadowed the advantages of euro membership . The adoption of the euro has had massive implications for the millions of small and medium-size enterprises that once relied on periodic currency devaluation to offset the inefficiencies of Italy 's economic system and remain competitive . <p> The inefficiencies are well-known : labor-market rigidities , low public and private investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax evasion and avoidance , and a dysfunctional and costly legal system and public bureaucracy . And yet several generations of Italian political leaders have cited " external constraint , " rather than domestic necessity , when pushing through the structural reforms required for euro membership -- thereby reinforcing the sense that reforms have been imposed on Italy . <p> The loss of monetary sovereignty means there are effectively two chains of political command in Italy . One extends from the German government , through the European Commission and the ECB , down to the Italian presidency , treasury , and central bank . This " institutional " chain of command ensures that Italy meets its international commitments and maintains strict adherence to EU fiscal rules , regardless of domestic political developments . <p> The other chain of command starts with the Italian prime minister and extends through the government ministries that are responsible for domestic affairs . In most cases , the two chains of command are aligned . But when they are not , a conflict inevitably ensues . Hence the current crisis , which came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist Paolo Savona as Italy 's next economy and finance minister without first consulting the other chain of command . The appointment was duly rejected by the Italian president . <p> Let us return to the question of whether Italy will now choose to break free of its straitjacket . Despite the euro 's advantages , it has not delivered for Italy economically . Italy 's real ( inflation-adjusted ) per capita GDP is currently lower than it was when the euro experiment began in 1998 , whereas even Greece has managed to register growth , despite its depression from 2009 onward . <p> Some would explain this poor performance by arguing that the eurozone is an incomplete monetary union , and that its " core " countries like Germany drain labor and capital from " periphery " countries like Italy . Others might counter that Italians failed to conform to the rules and standards , and to implement the reforms , upon which a successful monetary union is based . <p> But the real explanation no longer matters . The prevailing narrative in Italy holds the euro responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have either openly or implicitly called for leaving the eurozone currently hold a parliamentary majority , and would likely retain it in another election later this year or in early 2019 . <p> If Italians were confronted with the choice of retaining or abandoning the single currency , recent polls suggest that they would initially decide to stay , for fear of a run on Italian banks and public debt , as Greece experienced in 2012-2015 . But the long-term costs of remaining in a club dominated by inherently deflationary , German-dictated rules might tempt Italians to leave . That decision could come in the midst of another global financial crisis , recession , or asymmetric shock that pushes several fragile countries out of the euro at the same time . <p> Like the United Kingdom 's Brexiteers , Italians might convince themselves that they have what it takes to succeed on their own in the global economy . After all , Italy has a large industrial sector that is capable of exporting worldwide , and exporters would benefit from a weaker currency . Italians might be tempted to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or end up in foreign hands , as is already happening ? <p> If Italians do eventually go down this path , the immediate costs will be borne by domestic savers , whose nest eggs will be redenominated in depreciated liras . And the costs would be still greater if an Italian exit precipitated another financial crisis with bank holidays and capital controls . Faced with these possibilities , Italians -- like the Greeks in 2015 -- might blink and stay . But they also might decide to close their eyes and take the plunge . <p> Though Italy would be better off staying in the eurozone and reforming accordingly , we fear that an exit could become more likely over time .

Merak Energi had expressed interest to work with Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd ( BHEL ) , the country 's largest power generation equipment manufacturer , for the construction of a 2 ? 60 MW coal-fired thermal power plant in Merak , West Java , Indonesia . But the contract agreement did not materialize . BHEL filed a civil suit at Delhi High Court seeking restraint of invocation of a bank guarantee issued by State Bank of India ( SBI ) in favour of the Indonesian company .

Many of these changes are particularly relevant to foreign companies doing business in Europe .

Obligations to notify data processing operations or obtain prior permission from data protection authorities will be scrapped . <p> A number of key concepts are clarified and adapted to the needs of the digital economy . International data transfers from the EU will be simplified and facilitated . All this will mean increased legal certainty and a significant reduction in compliance costs and red tape . <p> The GDPR is also based on a modern approach to regulation which rewards new ideas , methods and technologies which improve privacy and data security .

Empowering consumers means also ensuring that they feel safer and more confident when sharing their data . <p> These are just a few examples of how the effective protection of a fundamental right can go hand in hand with unleashing the full potential of the digital economy . <p> These developments are of course not limited to Europe .

@@26135237 <h> Why building a huge man-made island off Lantau is a smart idea <p> Our Hong Kong Foundation has put forward a bold and visionary proposal known as the ' Enhanced East Lantau Metropolis " program . <p> Under the proposal , the foundation suggests that the government build a gigantic man-made island with a total land area of 2,200 hectares , or half the size of Kowloon peninsula , off the east coast of Lantau Island for the purpose of building new homes and developing Hong Kong 's third central business district ( CBD ) . <p> I am strongly in favor of this proposal , and I believe it is a far better idea than the option of taking back the Fanling golf club for public housing development . <p> Simply put , the proposal of building a new man-made island is so smart , while retrieving the Fanling golf course is so stupid . Here 's why : <p> Due to our geographical limitations , Hong Kong had been relying heavily on reclamation to provide new land for development over the last hundred years or so , right until the beginning of the 21st century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indefinite halt amid mounting public calls for enhancing environmental conservation efforts . <p> As a result , between 2001 and 2015 , the government only reclaimed 690 hectares of land , down nearly 80 percent compared to 3,000 hectares between 1985 and 2000 . <p> And the continued plunge in land supply due to public opposition to land reclamation has undoubtedly led to the acute land shortage , skyrocketing property prices and the rapidly deteriorating living conditions our fellow citizens have been facing in recent years . <p> The Enhanced East Lantau Metropolis program has simply provided a way out of the current zero-sum deadlock between urban development and environmental conservation that has been persisting for years . <p> Under the program , around 30 percent of the total area of the man-made island would be allocated for housing projects , which , once completed , can provide 250,000 to 400,000 private and Public Rental Housing ( PRH ) flats that can house an estimated 700,000 to 1.1 million people . <p> To address public concerns about the potential for abuse of the program by big real estate developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury homes , Our Hong Kong Foundation has proposed that at least 70 percent of the land earmarked for housing be designated exclusively for constructing PRH flats . <p> In the meantime , 20 percent of the land would be developed into a new CBD to boost our economic growth . <p> The proposal also suggests that the government build three railways that connect the man-made island with the Kennedy Town , Mei Foo and Tuen Mun South , as well as three main highways linking the island with New Territories West , Lantau and Hong Kong Island West . <p> Along with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge that connects our city with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area , it is hoped that the new man-made island can fully integrate into the " one-hour living circle " concept proposed by the central government . <p> The biggest merit of the Enhanced East Lantau Metropolis program is that it is much more efficient than other options and can provide our city with a vast piece of vacant land ready for housing projects within a relatively short period of time . <p> Compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have less impact on vested interests , and would n't entail providing huge compensations for indigenous residents and carrying out massive population relocation programs . <p> Instead , all it takes for the project to fly is for it to pass environmental assessment . <p> As the saying goes , time and tide wait for no one . In order for our city to address the land shortage issue , which we have failed to do in the last 20 years , going for land reclamation might not be the only option but , in my view , is definitely the smartest option . <p> As far as the suggestion of taking back the entire Fanling golf course for building new homes is concerned , I just could n't disagree with it more . <p> The golf course has provided the major training facilities for the Hong Kong golf team and has remained the city 's only world-class venue for hosting major international golf tournaments . <p> So far the Fanling golf course has hosted 59 Hong Kong international golf opens , and the tournament has already become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does Hong Kong really only have room for developing mass-participation sports like some people have claimed but no place for so-called aristocratic sports like golf ? <p> Executive Council convenor Bernard Charnwut Chan has referred to this notion as " so stupid " .

@@50032230 <h> Ethereum Witnessed a Massive 20% Drop in Hashrate <p> Recent data from Etherscan.io shows that Ethereum has witnessed a massive 20% drop in its hashrate . It is said to be one of the biggest drops in ETH hashrate over the last year and is said to be on the same scale as those that have occurred since its creation . The hashrate has dropped from 294 TH/s to 246 TH/s . <p> ETH had recently witnessed a drop from 300 TH/s to 270 TH/s in August . The 30 Terahash drop had frightened the community , raising concerns about decreasing security on the platform . It is speculated that the recent drop occurred due to simple variance or because mining ETH was not profitable anymore . <p> ETH has suffered significant losses in price from more than $1100 to $400 , which it then hit the price range of $167 before recovering to $218 , during the writing . This might be one of the reasons for the drop in the hashrate as the miners can not cover the costs of electricity , hardware maintenance , and other associated costs . Cooling the equipment has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mining , thus there is a need to cool the equipment down to avoid the melting of components . <p> This movement could be indicative of a more serious problem for miners down the line . There are some efficient ASICs which are developed in order to mine Ether , but these ASICs activities are n't being shown in the data because of the bouncing hashpower of some cryptocurrencies .

This has led to them being well-organized and not requiring any central coordination or authority protecting the business . This movement marks ETH reaching the cost of production floor , similar to what Bitcoin faced in 2014-15 .

From koreatimes.co.kr <p> More than 40 years after the end of the Vietnam War , a Korean Buddhist monk has made it his mission to help heal the deep wounds the conflict created between his country and Vietnam . Running thousands of miles to raise funds and demonstrate his solidarity with the people of Vietnam , Venerable Jino has dedicated his life to helping Vietnam and to improving the lives of Vietnamese migrants in South Korea . <p> To date , Ven . Jino has run some 15,000 kilometers across Cambodia , Ecuador , Germany , Nepal , South Korea , Sri Lanka , and Vietnam -- averaging around 50 kilometers per day -- since 2011 , and in the process raising about 400 million won ( US$358,000 ) . <p> Expressing a profound sense of remorse for the role the South Korean military played in the conflict -- including atrocities committed by Korean troops against Vietnamese civilians -- Ven .

Approximately 5,000 South Korean soldiers were killed in the conflict , with many others returning home injured and with ailments caused by exposure to defoliant chemicals such as Agent Orange . <p> To manifest his efforts , Ven .

@@50195230 <h> Lantau plan becomes key focus in Legco debate on Policy Address <p> The Legislative Council on Wednesday began debate on a motion of thanks in relation to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor 's 2018 Policy Address , with most of the discussion focused , as expected , on Lam 's controversial Lantau reclamation plan . <p> During her policy speech on Oct. 10 , Lam put forward a plan to build artificial islands in the sea to provide land for housing development . <p> Dubbed " Lantau Tomorrow Vision " , the plan envisages large-scale reclamation in waters off Lantau to create 1,700 hectares of land that can then be used for construction of 260,000 to 400,000 residential units . <p> The reclamation plan has come in for sharp criticism from many people who argued that the project would amount to waste of government resources and that it would also damage the marine ecology . <p> During the Legco debate yesterday , Chan Kwok-ki , Director of the Chief Executive 's Office , said reclaiming about 1,700 hectares of land is only a vision rather than a decision . <p> The official also said that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how much the project will cost , before a feasibility study is carried out . <p> That said , Chan stressed that the total cost of the mega reclamation project will not reach HK$1 trillion as some people have speculated , and also insisted that the reclamation will not deplete the government 's financial reserves . <p> Lawmaker Wu Chi-wai , chairman of the Democratic Party , said the reclamation proposal amounts to a breach of procedural justice since there have been no detailed estimates regarding the cost efficiency and the population growth projection . <p> Given the lack of information to justify the government 's plan , it is no wonder the public is alarmed , he said . <p> Joining Wu as one of the seven democrats demanding an amendment of the motion on the issue , Gary Fan Kwok-wai , a lawmaker from the Neo Democrats , questioned whether building artificial islands to accommodate between 700,000 and 1.1 million people is necessary . <p> That is because Hong Kong 's population growth in the long term will be slowing down , he said , citing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 7.7 million in 2066 . <p> Fan noted that once the Legco approves funding for the project , there will be no turning back , even if the administration would experience cost overruns , which may impact Hong Kong 's finances . <p> Arguing for the other side , lawmaker and New People 's Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee , who is also an Executive Council member , said reclamation is the best option to increase land supply . <p> The government must not to give up or quit pursuing its vision just because of the opposition it is facing , Ip said , adding that some people are attempt to spark unnecessary social panic . <p> Starry Lee Wai-king , chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong ( DAB ) , said creating land through reclamation is not something that should be a cause of worry or fear . <p> Some people are intentionally demonizing the plan and opposing it just for opposition 's sake , Lee said . <p> Lee noted that if the administration of former chief executive Tung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce 85,000 flats each year , and proceeded with major reclamation , Hong Kong would be a very different place today , RTHK reported . <p> In reply to written questions from the Legco , the Development Bureau said the 1,700-hectare reclamation area is only a preliminary proposal and that the government will focus on the studies for developing artificial islands of about 1 , 000 hectares near Kau Yi Chau in the first phase . <p> As for the remaining artificial islands of about 700 hectares near Hei Ling Chau and the waters south of Cheung Chau , the bureau said there is no concrete implementation timetable at the moment . <p> The findings in the final report to be submitted by the Task Force on Land Supply , expected in December , will be taken into consideration , the bureau added . <p> As the trial continues of nine leaders of the 2014 Occupy street protests , a Hong Kong courtroom on Thursday witnessed emotional scenes , with some of the defendants bursting into tears as they recalled the ... <p> Veteran politician and democracy advocate Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming Legislative Council by-election for the Kowloon West geographical constituency , said he stands a very good chance of winning ... <p> Liberal Party leader Felix Chung Kwok-pan has officially withdrawn his Legco motion that called on the government to launch a public consultation on enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law .

@@50195231 <h> Europe 's consternation at latest football leaks <p> Following another hack of FIFA 's computers , we have a new set of leaks about global football . <p> Having already covered everything from a proposed European club breakaway league to the flouting of UEFA 's Financial Fair Play rules , the leaks look set to continue dripping for some time to come . <p> In Europe , the reaction to world football 's latest revelations has predictably been one of uproar . It is no coincidence that materials garnered by the hacker , someone commonly referred to as " John " , were given to the continent 's news outlets , each of which shares the freedom to publish without the threat of state sanction , as well as common western liberal values . <p> The continent is therefore a captive market for stories of malfeasance , helped by the fact that many of them originate in and refer to Europe . After all , the continent is not just the administrative home of global football , it is also the place where many of the self-proclaimed " best clubs and leagues in the world " reside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were hardly surprising . Rather , they have merely served to confirm what most of us already think we know . For instance , although FIFA officials have claimed the governing body has changed since the times of Sepp Blatter , the organization is clearly still subject to bureaucracy , politics , and the cult of leadership personality . <p> As for documents appearing to confirm that Manchester City ( and its Abu Dhabi owners ) and Paris Saint Germain ( and its Qatari owners ) both inflated the value of commercial deals to ensure they were compliant with UEFA Financial Fair Play rules , we knew this already , right ? What appears new is that football 's authorities were somehow complicit in helping them . <p> All of which suggests that standards of ethics and governance remain an issue in football . For the game 's administrators , perhaps the biggest challenge they face is in the recruitment of ethical hackers , who might be able to address the susceptibility of governing bodies to external cyber attacks . The first rule of deviance is surely not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counterclaims ) in some ways constitutes little more than tinkering at the edges of something more profoundly fundamental . That leading clubs across Europe are considering a breakaway league , that many of them are owned by non-Europeans ( or else are owned by corporations from other industrial sectors ) , and that governing authorities have apparently turned a blind eye to all manner of infractions , are the effects , rather than the causes , of world football 's travails . <p> To critics and cynics , it might seem obvious and natural to blame FIFA or UEFA for the situation they find themselves in . And it may seem cathartic to point a finger at Manchester City and Paris Saint Germain because this helps one make sense of a complex , confusing world . But , all of these organizations are mere instruments in an environment that is characterized by the accumulation and manifestation of power . <p> Power can be thought of as the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others , or the course of events . Even such a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This inevitably raises the question of where power comes from , and it is in answering this that the real causes of world football 's challenges are rooted . <p> In a world where there is increasing demand for natural resources , there is a consequent scarcity of them . This means that countries fortunate enough to have the territorial rights to extract and sell resources such as oil and gas possess considerable power ( economic and otherwise ) which manifests itself in terms of the ability to control . <p> In turn , this broad notion of resource-based economic power has been legitimized and enhanced by a sense of political power . The latter has been the result of states such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi ( as well as the likes of Russia ) being sanctioned by their governments to utilize football as a means to acquire other resources ( like soft power influence and nation brand strength ) in which these countries can be deficient . <p> As some Europeans become ever more flustered by Football Leaks ' latest revelations , so another group of Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global dominance by their clubs and leagues . Yet the apparent willingness of numerous entities in European football to accommodate people such as Nasser bin Ghanim Al-Khela ? fi and Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan . Khaldoon Al Mubarak says something about how significant the power balance has shifted towards non-European football owners and investors . <p> Indeed , nobody and nothing has stopped what has been taking place over the last two decades . Liberal European governments have failed to step in , and the European Union has largely remained silent on such matters . Even football fans have typically welcomed overseas investments , more excited than concerned about what the spending might bring . <p> But this is not just the domain of Asian autocrats ; resource-based power in football is also manifest among North American sports investors . These people have similarly spent big on European football , generally without hindrance . They have brought financial resources , but also entrepreneurial resources and commercial competence that have seen football morph into something considerably different to what most Europeans have historically encountered . <p> While fans in Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doha , the pressure for breakaway leagues , overseas games and the relentless pursuit of revenues has come from the boardrooms of New York and Los Angeles . This is them , the entrepreneurs , exercising their power and control in pursuit of their goals , not the tiny oil- and gas-rich states of the Gulf . <p> So , where does this leave Europe , its governing mechanisms , and its football ? The continent 's adherence to liberal values has effectively created an ideological vacuum that American capitalists and Asian states have been happy to fill . Though there is something about global economic shifts , which European is still struggling to convincingly address . <p> All of which leaves the continent in its current position : of grappling with the effects of problems that it has created for itself . Indeed , unless London , Paris , Berlin and other European governments change their positions and develop the stomach for a fight , then Football Leaks ' regular reports may ultimately become an epitaph on the gravestone of what European football used to be . <p> Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club allegedly inflated the value of commercial deals to ensure it was compliant with UEFA Financial Fair Play rules , according to the leaked documents .

This is not to say that there are n't any belligerent encounters offline , or that public discourse was always polite -- the gleeful satires of ancient Greece and the angry polemics of Roman essayists come to mind . However , we must not pretend that everything deserves equal consideration . The idea of finding common ground or compromising simply to avoid disagreement on big issues is also not an ideal path , as it tends to muddle compromise with harmony . <p> It is also true that the phenomenon of " trolling " -- making deliberate insults and provocative statements to get a negative reaction , while masking such statements and insults as sincerely held beliefs -- has been around for a long time . It has been a phenomenon ever since it was possible to hide behind an anonymous letter or computer screen and get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this does not quite explain why there is so much malice in online discourse today , or why so many get a rush from pushing people 's buttons . As the Internet has become more central in our everyday lives , confrontational comments on discussion forums have become more and more common . Trolls send targeted insults and threats to ( easy targets ? ) vulnerable people , celebrities , and public figures . Entire websites pushing sexist or racist thinking popped up , reveling in controversy and attention . <p> From 4. bp.blogspot.com <p> One explanation is that some people really do believe in the opinions they voice . In that case , the best response is to correct their notions and exhibit the emotional intelligence ( and self-care ) to know when to let go , regardless of whether such corrections are accepted . People coming from a troubled place might also enjoy posting mean-spirited online comments , whether or not they take extremist or violent ideology seriously . We should take their sense of social isolation and alienation seriously . For various reasons , some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when they are in a troubled place themselves and might be able to interact with them through messages and public writing but do no know them personally . <p> Yet this is not an excuse to waive moral responsibility for anti-social behavior . Indeed , a third possibility is that some people hurt other 's feelings simply to demonstrate feelings can be hurt and sentiments can be offended . The ability to raise others ' hackles intentionally is somehow a mark of imagined intellectual superiority , in contrast to the so-called " snowflakes . " <p> This is not simply a repudiation of political correctness , but an anti-social idea of online conversation and interaction : castigating , ridiculing , and insulting others become not unskillful acts done in moments of personal weakness , but a morally distorted vocation . <p> From mashable.com <p> Here we make no judgment on the causes that drive misanthropic attitudes . The conditions are manifold and commentators have blamed all kinds of trends : digital alienation , postmodernism , secularism , extremist thinking , a media centered on celebrity and selfishness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhist psychology teaches that for every context there is a cause , it is not easy to identify them . Experts have already spilled much ink exploring the experiences and mindsets that lead to misanthropy or anti-social behavior online . <p> Yet this online free-for-all is the new frontier of Right Speech and the exercise of compassion and wisdom . While there are major questions about implications of censorship of ideas or discourse in the hands of a small group of tech magnates , the ethical question of how the Internet maximizes Right Speech at a technological , algorithmic level remains . There is also the need to keep sight of the subjectivity of the insulter , even if they have lost sight of ours . People lash out because of something that has happened , perhaps deep in the past . We may never know what that was . As our columnist Shveitta Sharma has argued , " A person in pain is capable of sharing only pain . The trolls also need our empathy , as they are truly hurting . They have no way of expressing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next time you encounter a nasty comment , know that it was written by someone in extreme pain ; send them love and compassion in return . " <p> It can be jarring to encounter the nastiness of some netizens . However , the truth is that the Internet needs us to be netizens of noble conduct , to be arya in the way the Buddha meant -- in ethical mindfulness and spiritual insight . Our personal example is often the only chance we have to help others see that they can break free from the negative cycle of being hurt and hurting others .

These included the ultraviolet ( UV ) disinfection system , equipment for secondary sewage treatment such as air blowers , electrical installations and sludge pumps and some pipework . As a result , only primary treatment could be maintained at that time , with partially treated effluent discharged nearshore . The DSD immediately activated a contingency plan to remove some of the boulders and debris and pump out the seawater in order to assess the damage of the mechanical facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment , the DSD has immediately implemented an additional procedure to disinfect the effluent that was treated to primary level . On September 24 , the DSD completed the restoration of some major pipework and diverted the partially treated effluent back to the original submarine outfall for dispersed discharge at a location some 400 meters from SKSTW in Port Shelter . On October 12 , the DSD installed some temporary facilities to further upgrade the treatment capability to chemically enhanced primary treatment ( CEPT ) ( Note ) . Initial restoration works for the damaged seawall was completed on October 3 with the assistance of the Civil Engineering and Development Department ( CEDD ) . At present , the DSD is expediting the installation temporary facilities such as power distribution units , blowers , auxiliary pipes , sludge pumps and UV disinfection systems , with a view to resuming secondary level sewage treatment by December .

The monitoring results showed that there has been no obvious sign of deterioration of water quality near SKSTW , and the effect of the incident on the three beaches has also been minimal , with the E.coli level of water samples largely remained within the normal ranges of fluctuation . As regards the water quality of the Port Shelter Water Control Zone , the monitoring data up to October 2018 ( including those obtained after the incident at SKSTW ) shows that the levels of E. coli , dissolved oxygen , total inorganic nitrogen and non-ionised ammonia nitrogen have fully ( 100 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPD considers that the emergency measures adopted by the DSD have been effective in mitigating the potential impact to water quality due to the typhoon damage of SKSTW . <p> ( 4 ) In order to strengthen the resilience of the seawall against extreme waves , the CEDD has taken into account the impact of climate change in the design of seawall strengthening works in accordance with the latest requirements of the Port Works Design Manual -- Corrigendum No.1/2018 and adopted the most critical loading condition ( i.e. 100 years extreme wave plus 10 years extreme water level ) .
