A camper conversion for the Toyota Prius could be your answer . <p> Looking a little like a giant telephone handle stuck onto the top of a Prius -- or even a Smurf if you owned a blue Prius -- the camper conversion was unveiled at the 2012 Tokyo Auto Salon in Japan over the weekend . <p> It 's a custom ( obviously ) creation developed by a camping specialist called Campinn . The company starts out by cutting rear sections of the Prius out and adapting a special fibre-reinforced plastic mould over the top . <p> The large mould conceals a door entrance at the rear , with its own roller blind , and two beds -- one of which sits on top of the roof , and another that takes place of where the rear seats and boot space used to be . <p> Campinn says there 's also an optional flip-out coffee table and sofa that can be added to the rear ' living area ' , while the exterior comes with Prius taillights which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large camper section adds 520mm to the Prius ' overall length ( 4460mm in standard form ) , and 560mm to the overall height ( 1490mm in standard form ) . <p> We 're not sure how much weight this conversion adds to the back of the rather sorry-looking Prius , but it would likely put additional loads onto the Prius 's hybrid powertrain . <h> SOCIAL SHARE <p> ugly as it can be ... home this conversion flies away at the speed of 30km/h <p> Johnny <p> Well that 's rather different . <p> Labryz <p> What .

You never put forward a balanced position and correctly inform your readers . You know this but treat your readers as gullible fools . You obviously have an axe to grind . What happened ? Did they at some time in the past knock you back on a journo freebie or not give you an upgrade ? You infer in your article that the fuel surcharge applies to Qantas website fares only and not to travel agent sales . What hogwash . Perhaps you have been duped by your travel agent . Like all airlines , the surcharges are filed and automatically loaded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents must collect them as part of the fare or else they are retrospectively sent a bill by the airline . What you are confusing in your comments about airline web fares is that on its website Qantas does not undercut its travel agents by selling then to consumers at a net level . Most international fares are distributed to travel agents by airlines at a net level and agents are free to mark them up with any margin they wish . It 's like general market wholesale/retail pricing of any product or service . In other words prices vary by agents by how much they mark them up ( their retained margin ) . Qantas on its website I understand marks those same fares up by a reasonable margin ( I was told about 5% ) so that its fares do not undercut its travel agents net fares plus mark-up . Some agents appear to offer discounts as compared to other agents by reducing their mark-up or retained margin . It is market competition at work . And some agents will push one airline over another because they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also know many agents that will always mark-up Qantas fares by more than their primary competitor even when the net fare is the same because they know that many consumers will pay more to travel on Qantas .

And good on them . <p> Now , read the following again , carefully , and tell us where it says agents are n't charging the fuel surcharge and so forth , and then come back so we can have a polite discussion on these matters .

" On what basis did you draw the conclusion that the Qantas announcement " only address what will appear on its on-line booking screens " . I have an understanding of the travel industry and what they have announced will apply to all airtickets regardless of how or where they are sold . Agents can not discount the fuel surcharges or taxes etc. or overlook them or whatever . Whether they disclose them or not , they are still there on all tickets on all airlines . And these components are the same regardless of where or from whom you buy them . And as you know , by law in Australia , any advertising of airfares by anyone ( travel agent or airline ) must include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The price variation in the market you refer to comes from their discounting ( reduction ) of their margin in the base fare by marking it up less and/or taking into account commissions and overides . As you also know the big agency groups receive from all airlines significant " incentive commissions " or overides which are usually subject to volume targets or share of total sales . Carriers that do not have a natural market presence ( consumer brand awareness ) pay larger overides and have lower fares on the understanding that agents will push them to because they have more earnings in each sale . They will almost certainly will not apply this same rule in their home market . <p> Ahhh , yes . Carbon price hikes .

@@732232 <h> Sacrifices in vain on the Afghanistan war path <p> A NATO report made public yesterday suggests that the Taliban , backed by Pakistan , is set to retake control of Afghanistan after NATO-led forces withdraw . <p> Although not a strategic study the report begs the question , has the sacrifice of our Australian diggers been in vain ? Has our contribution to the war on terrorism as Australian taxpayers been money well spent ? <p> Early this year Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar reportedly confirmed having opened peace talks with US authorities , demanding the release of Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay and the complete pullout of US led forces . Of course , US president Barack Obama wants to maintain America 's prestige and negotiate a withdrawal that leaves America 's credibility intact , which may be fair enough , but what if the Taliban wo n't compromise ? What leverage will the United States have at the negotiating table ? <p> Peace talks require groundwork , mutually acceptable compromises about things like the location for formal negotiations ( Qatar ) and procedural issues like a possible ceasefire . These preliminaries help to buy time domestically for political leaders who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are faced with bad choices , like the symbolic withdrawal of troops when there 's been no victory or fighting a war for something less than vital interests ( ie national security ) . Any peace talks doubtless will be lengthy , costly and exhausting ; for what end they 're being pursued remains unclear . <p> Peace talks with the Afghan Taliban logically are a spoke in the wheel for the recently vocal proponents of " we dare not withdraw troops from Afghanistan and let Afghan women face the prospect of the return to Taliban rule " , so it 's strange that we have n't heard a word - not one word - from any Australian politician from the major political parties calling for negotiations to include Afghan women if the Taliban is to be reincorporated into the political system . <p> After going toe-to-toe about war strategies with US " institutional interests " from shortly after his election , Mr Obama in 2009 determined and issued his " final orders " for Afghanistan ( and Pakistan ) . December 2010 was selected as the next assessment point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops committed in 2009 arrived in Afghanistan , allowing enough time to assess progress and validate the operational concept . <p> When a leaked 2011 National Intelligence Estimate report found that Afghanistan was " mired in stalemate " , military and Pentagon officials argued that assumptions used by intelligence agencies were flawed . Virtually the same line was taken following the release of the 2010 National Intelligence Estimate report . <p> " Stalemate " probably means that the Taliban can continue to absorb casualties , and continue to fight at the level they have been , and seek safe haven when required , indefinitely . If so , there is n't any point where military pressure or troop escalations can achieve diplomatic or political success . Perhaps that is consistent with Mr Obama symbolically announcing the withdrawal of 33,000 " surge " troops by the end of this year , leaving 68,000 troops . Ignoring the rhetoric , that move appears to be a unilateral withdrawal of about a third of US troops without a single concession from the Afghan Taliban . <p> Indicators of progress towards any solution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of killing 25 Pakistani soldiers last year , the United States now pays six times as much to supply its troops in Afghanistan via alternative routes after Pakistan closed the border crossings to NATO convoys . <p> Earlier this year the United States Air Force released its investigation into a 2011 killing of eight American airmen and a security contractor by Afghan air force officer , Ahmed Gul . Gul had declared his desire to kill Americans , behaved erratically at work and frequented a mosque known for its anti-American views . <p> Similarly , reports about the recent killing of French soldiers in Afghanistan 's eastern Kapisa province suggest that the responsible Afghan soldier was prompted by the video showing US Marines urinating on the dead bodies of Taliban insurgents . France apparently is pulling out forces by the end of 2013 . <p> A more recent classified coalition document indicates that Afghan forces have attacked American and allied service members nearly three dozen times since 2007 . <p> Events like these do n't auger well for peace and stability if the 2014 deadline is contingent upon Afghan Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghan Opium Survey for 2011 finding that the value of opium in the country had increased by 133 per cent , violence against women being on the rise in Oruzgan , Afghans complaining about Oruzgan projects , continuing night raids still sparking anti-US protests , and two out of four Afghans suffering from trauma , depression and anxiety . Read the Human Rights Watch World Report 2012 : Afghanistan for an alarming assessment of " conditions on the ground " . <p> The Bush and Obama administrations have long known about the depth and breadth of corruption in the Karzai government , about the expanding opium trade and about the sanctuaries provided to Al Qaeda and others in nuclear-armed and radicalised Pakistan . <p> Having asked the question in the Situation Room on September 13 2009 , Vice President Joe Biden also well knows that there is no evidence of the Afghan Taliban advocating attacks outside of Afghanistan or on the United States . Reporter and author Michael Hastings puts it this way : " The question one has to ask oneself is that if everything we 're doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , certainly not a direct threat by any means , then why are we expending so many resources ... with all the lives lost , to do it ? " <p> Consecutive Australian governments must have asked the same question , but what answer did they come up with ? What answer have they given us ? <p> In 1960 president Dwight D Eisenhower spoke of the need for balance so that security and liberty may prosper together . <p> Should n't Australia - and debt-laden countries like the US and UK and the other countries currently embroiled in the European financial crisis - have made such assessments of their Afghanistan involvement long before now ? <p> It was reported last year that our bill for fighting terrorism is at least $30 billion .

Has any Australian government sought , let alone found , and sensible balance between defence and security needs and other functions of government ? <p> If , as many suspect , wars are fought for oil ( Alan Greenspan candidly said so in 2007 in relation to Iraq ) , it 's somewhat ironic that the money we have spent on fighting terrorism could have made serious inroads into our oil deficit by funding a high speed rail network along the entire east coast . Its estimated cost is between $61 billion and $108 billion , but it would serve the 80 per cent of Australians living within 100 kilometres of the coast .

Peace with honour is gilded honour shamefully misplaced . <p> It was n't so long ago that president Nixon delivered his 1969 speech urging the American people " to persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement if possible , or through continued implementation of our plan for Vietnamisation if necessary , a plan in which we will withdraw all our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program , as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom .

The Australian government merely followed the United States lead in Vietnam , and the same applies in Afghanistan . Consecutive Australian governments have tagged along unreservedly . <p> Though public opinion might count for little in the decisions of those who determine our fate , and that of our children , we have an obligation to support those with true insight who also have the courage to speak out for what we believe to be right . <p> Matthew Hoh , Senior Fellow for the Centre for International Policy and former US Marine Officer and US State Department official , is a good example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war in Afghanistan , on the one hand , and fighting terrorism on the other .

" <p> Sure suicide is stupid , depression is stupid , and the public 's understanding of mental illness is especially stupid . But a victim of suicide was n't stupid , they just lost the battle . <p> No-one with a terminal illness would be called stupid for giving up the fight . For them it 's a tough fight . They were brave to push on as long as they did . But depression is a private illness , the symptoms are mostly internal and many people do n't like - or know how - to articulate it , so it 's no wonder they do n't understand why someone would take their own life . <p> I do n't claim to know what goes through the mind of every person with a mental illness . I can only speak from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into why depression , if left untreated , can be fatal . <p> Have you ever had a nagging thought that just would n't go away ? The harder you try to stop thinking it , the louder and more prevalent it becomes . What if that thought was an image . An image of self-harm ? How would that thought make you feel ? Sad ? Angry ? Desperate ? How about relieved ? Settled ? Calm ? <p> My experience of depression , which was diagnosed in 2003 during my final semester at university , manifested itself through obsessive thoughts . At first they were thoughts of self-harm . That was my way of expressing the anger and self-loathing I felt . I wanted to punish myself for what I thought I was . Or perhaps what I felt I was n't and would never be . <p> It 's important to note that I have lived a charmed life . My parents are happily married and now so am I. Growing up I always had a roof over my head , food in my belly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt my mother refused to buy , I never wanted for anything . I 've never experienced abuse , addiction or a major trauma . I am a straight , white woman who has never known prejudice . But I still developed depression . <p> I was experiencing relative success but I did n't trust it . I graduated university with distinction but as I saw it , the course was just too easy . I practically fell into my dream job , therefore I did n't believe I earned it . My colleagues were happy with my skills and progress , but I could n't understand why . I just did n't believe I was worthy and for whatever reason the idea of harming myself offered a form of relief . <p> Then a colleague in another city completed suicide . It was a shock and a tragedy for everyone who knew him . I did n't know him well , but I was nonetheless affected . <p> After that my images of self-harm developed to images of suicide . I 'm not sure why the suicide of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it just made that form of self-harm a reality . <p> I sought counselling and after several months of self-analysis I started to feel better . I began to look at my life and achievements with a more positive outlook . I believed I had recovered . <p> It was around this time that I moved to Canberra with my fianc ? and I saw the move as an opportunity to leave my illness behind . A fresh start where no-one knew I was ' the one with depression ' . I even felt ready to wean off my anti-depressants . With hindsight I can see what a bad idea that was . To think that I would n't be emotionally affected by a major upheaval in my life was , to return to my opening theme , pretty stupid . <p> Once again I found work with relative ease but in Canberra everyone seemed smarter , more cultured , and had so much more confidence than me . Once again my colleagues and employers were impressed by my abilities but I felt like a fraud . <p> Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and friends and I was sticking with my vow not to tell anyone in Canberra that I had depression . <p> Eventually I did start talking , to my colleagues , my fianc ? and finally to a psychologist , and I have no doubt talking openly about my illness saved my life . <p> It 's been about three years since I recovered and the issue of whether I should still be talking about it weighs on my mind . <p> It 's one thing to say I suffered from depression . The illness has received a lot of publicity in recent years and people are becoming more comfortable with the term . But I 'm more reluctant to say I suffered from suicidal tendencies , not because I 'm ashamed , but because I worry about how uncomfortable it makes others feel . <p> Then I wonder , as someone who did win the battle , and desperately wants to see an end to the stigma surrounding mental illness , do I have a responsibility to be completely open about my experience ? I want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time was spent worrying about the consequences , the stares I might get , the respect I could lose , but the irony is there is still a part of me who fears the stigma . <p> I believe politicians and celebrities like Andrew Robb and Jessica Rowe who have become the faces of mental health awareness are incredibly brave . I hope they have given ordinary people like me the courage to speak up as well . Not everyone has a national audience to speak to , but whether we are in the frame of mind to believe it or not , we are surrounded by people who care about us and want us to feel better . <p> If people could talk as openly with their friends and colleagues about their mental health as they do about their physical health , perhaps they would find it easier to talk to a doctor or a psychologist and that , at least in my experience , is the first step to recovery , and a longer , happier life . <p> If you are struggling with depression or anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beyond.org.au or call 1300 22 4636 . <p> If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide , call Lifeline on 13 11 14 . <p> Kim Lester is a content maker at 666 ABC Canberra .

@@732240 <h> Alternatives to Ubuntu <p> With the release of Ubuntu 11.04 and now 11.10 Canonical 's radical new interface known as Unity has split long-time Ubuntu fans . On one hand it introduces many new and innovative concepts and on the whole helps advance Ubuntu as an operating system for desktops and tablets alike . On the other hand the rapid departure from a desktop environment that millions of users have become familiar with requires them to either learn an entirely new desktop or switch to another distribution . <p> However if you 're a fan of Ubuntu but not Unity there is an alternative . Popular as it is Ubuntu has inspired a range of spin-off distributions that are compatible with the Ubuntu base . Not only are they built upon official Ubuntu releases you can use the same repositories to keep them up to date . <p> While there are three official versions -- Desktop Server and Netbook -- there are also a range of officially recognised spin-offs . <p> Here we take a look at the options so you can decide whether they might be right for you . <p> We ca n't cover alternatives without mentioning the most popular -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canonical and simply bundles KDE 4.0 in place of GNOME 3.0 . If you 're familiar with Linux desktop interfaces KDE is the other white meat a popular and well liked interface that underwent a massive overhaul before GNOME did with GNOME 3 and thus in many ways is ahead of the curve . <p> Where GNOME keeps things simple KDE favours complexity . The interface and applications sport many more options than GNOME but like the departure that GNOME 3 and Unity is from GNOME 2 KDE 4.0 is an entirely new desktop paradigm to learn . It is undeniably pretty ? ? ? arguably more so than GNOME ? ? ? as well as boasting many features GNOME currently does n't match . Traditionally Linux users are in either the GNOME or KDE camp so if KDE is new to you and Unity has n't been to your liking Kubuntu should be your first port of call for something different . <p> Xubuntu is another officially supported distribution that uses the lightweight Xfce ( originally XForms Common Environment but no longer uses XForms at all ) interface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fast making it an ideal choice for older systems . It tended to be a bit ugly in the past and as a result does n't sport all the visual bells and whistles found in GNOME or KDE . <p> However in recent versions this has changed and Xfce now looks surprisingly slick while maintaining its lightweight persona . It still features and can run GNOME apps and comes standard with a Mac OS X-inspired dock . If you 're looking to run Ubuntu on a laptop or older desktop and you find Ubuntu or Kubuntu struggling Xubuntu is an excellent alternative that sacrifices a little eye candy for much improved performance . <p> Lubuntu is newer to the Ubuntu family and is n't technically recognised yet as an official spin-off but it should be . Like Xubuntu it 's a lightweight distribution that uses the LXDE ( Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment ) interface . Like Xubuntu it can run GNOME apps but it comes with a suite of its own lightweight alternatives like AbiWord instead of OpenOffice.org . Interestingly it claims to do even better than Xubuntu for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 100MB less after loading the desktop . It looks a little slicker too with dual menu bars and a clean well defined style . A perfect alternative if you 're missing GNOME 2.0 . <p> But wait there 's more ! While these are the core alternative desktop distributions there are three more spin-offs that are aimed at specfic market segments . These include Edubuntu which provides a range of education programs aimed at kids ; Mytbuntu which is an excellent combination of the home theatre MythTV toolkit and Ubuntu for media boxes ; and Ubuntu Studio aimed at audio and video professionals and comes pre-installed with a real-time kernel for optimal recording duties .

@@790236 <p> As regular readers of 80s Bits will know , the 1980s is a mine of rolled gold for remake material . From the wonderful TRON : Legacy , the woeful Clash of the Titans and Conan the Barbarian and the troubling The A-Team , recapturing the trends of a bygone era have served as a substitute for creating a meaningful post-1990s culture of any consequence . Certainly in terms of box office push , we are back to a place of escalating budgets and diminishing returns both creatively and financially . Which is why it is refreshing when something like 21 Jump Street comes along , taking the legacy of a bygone era and crafting something that lives in the now . <p> Schmidt ( Jonah Hill ) and Jenko ( Channing Tatum ) are from opposite ends of the social spectrum during high school , but once they go through the police academy together , they find that their friendship is mutually beneficial , with Schmidt bringing the smarts and Jenko the braun .

Ice Cube 's angry black Captain not only acknowledges his own stereotype , but the derivative nature of the plot . Referencing Jump Street as a " cancelled program from the 80s " , he ponders how they can keep dredging up " shit from the past and expect us all not to notice " . It is a small token of a line , which in and of itself does n't make the movie an instant classic , but it is part of a generous deal that asks us to overlook any familiar paths in return for a genuinely fun and funny ride through modern high school . <p> Throwing anything vaguely resembling the original show out the window , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jump Street is above all things a comedy : one where the laughs are fast and frequent , and incredibly disarming at times .

And the La Leche League 's ideological ' fatwas ' are responsible for holding women back from professional success . <p> In short , the pleasure that women might derive from their own bodies , both sexually and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; simply , they exist for the enjoyment of men rather than the nourishment of babies . <p> Badinter , who in an earlier book argued that the maternal instinct does n't exist , interprets the trend towards long-term breastfeeding and natural parenting as an unfair competition in which the mothers who discard their careers and focus instead on their children are the winners , while those who outsource childcare and climb the corporate ladder are cast as bad mothers . An inversion , in a way , of 18th and 19th century French society , except that career wet nurses did n't have feminists speaking up on their behalf . <p> Her criticism extends to legislation that gives Western European women extended maternity leave , implying it deliberately holds women back in their careers and locks them into the role of an all-hours , mobile milk bank . <p> For Badinter , the rallying call for a return to breastfeeding equals a rejection of the feminist gains she and her peers fought so hard to achieve . Mothers , she fears , are being pressured by breastfeeding activists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity . <p> But real life does n't always dovetail neatly with socio-political theories : there are mothers who have worked and breastfed , mothers who have stayed home and bottle-fed , mothers who have done any combination or pure form of the above , and women who , through circumstance or choice , have not experienced motherhood at all . <p> There are women who rejoice in the ideal of being centrally defined as mothers , and those who work as mothers-by-proxy , providing childcare services to women who wish to fulfil their career ambitions . And while they are not well-paid , these women are secretly exalted , for childcare is truly worthy when the carer is being paid for her services . <p> Perhaps this devaluation of the role of woman as mother is where the real problem lies . Ultimately , arguments such as Badinter 's are unconstructive ; they simply replace the straightjacket of domestic subservience with one of career success , rather than encouraging women to identify for themselves a lifestyle that appeals to their own ambitions and instincts . <p> But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a prompt return to work -- not because they 're radical feminists , but because inadequate maternity leave forces them out of the maternity ward and back into the office . <p> Jill Lepore , a professor of American history , laments the way in which the competing demands of family and career have increased the burden placed upon women and prematurely disjointed mothers from babies they long to feed . She says in a New York Times article that , in the US , ' Strenuous motherhood is de rigueur . Duck into the ladies ' room at a conference of , say , professors and chances are you 'll find a flock of women waiting ... for a turn with the breast pump . Behind closed doors , the nation begins to look like a giant human dairy farm .

And one ca n't help wondering what Elisabeth Badinter would make of this regression to a shameful , secretive practice so redolent of centuries past . <h> Comments <p> Comments should be short , respectful and on topic .

@@798231 <h> The full story ... <h> Education power transfer - lessons from Victoria <p> MARK COLVIN : The New South Wales Government has announced what it 's calling the most far-reaching reforms for the state 's schools in a century . The Premier , Barry O'Farrell , has transferred more power to school principals in a bid to lift student performance . <p> Victoria handed more control over staffing and budgets to its principals more than 20 years ago . Dr Ben Jensen , education director at the Grattan Institute , told Matthew Carney about the merits of the Victorian experience . <p> BEN JENSEN : Well I think it has an underlying rationale that if we give school principals the responsibility for the performance of a school , then we need to give them the same power then to take actions that will affect that performance . So they need the power to be able to determine what happens in their school if they 're going to be held accountable for the performance of the school . <p> MATTHEW CARNEY : And what have the results shown so far with the Victorian experience ? <p> BEN JENSEN : Well I think if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a huge amount of evidence that says school autonomy has a great impact on student learning because it 's really not the end game . It 's a process to improve teaching and learning in classrooms . But what is very clear is that it is favoured by school principals . <p> We see that not only in Victoria but also in Western Australia where their schemes are incredibly popular with schools trying to get more independence and more power within the school . <p> MATTHEW CARNEY : But what about - specific studies obviously must have been done on principal autonomy , what do they say ? <p> BEN JENSEN : They say - there are some studies , I think the international assessments show that there is some benefits to increasing autonomy and that has it on student learning . We see that in some of the OECD work . But overall what we see is that it 's very hard to identify the connection between autonomy and student performance . <p> MATTHEW CARNEY : So if the link is n't that clear - so why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction ? <p> BEN JENSEN : There 's no doubt in my mind that school autonomy is a good thing . That it 's important for school principals and schools to have the power to make decisions that affect learning in their school . <p> But where I do have concerns is when people take schools autonomy as the end game , as though it 's the final result , when really it 's just a stepping stone to improving teaching and learning in the classroom . <p> MATTHEW CARNEY : So what other factors have to be in place to lift performance ? <p> BEN JENSEN : Well what we would really see is that we have to consider how to improve teaching and learning in the classroom . And that 's really about how do we improve teaching . <p> So it 's getting the right push and pull in the classroom to improve learning . That 's all about increasing the development of teachers , increasing - improving the education and training they receive , and improving the constant support to improve teachers in the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these systems in place then introducing school autonomy will have little impact ? <p> BEN JENSEN : Well I think it can have a positive bounce , there 's no doubt about that . I think there 's a lot of strength in the New South Wales education system , the framework of the system ; and they will get some improvements around school autonomy . But unless they then take the next step to improve teaching in the classroom , then we 're really just pushing around the edges to be honest .

The playwright who has been dead for almost four centuries has inspired well over four-hundred feature-length film adaptations of his works . Some of these are standards that get trotted out every few years : Hamlet , Richard III , Macbeth and , of course , Romeo and Juliet . Despite this strong fascination that the world still seems to have with the Bard , there are those plays that just do n't get performed as much as the more famous works . Now the more obscure Coriolanus joins the ranks of Titus ( Andronicus ) and Love 's Labours Lost thanks to director and star Ralph Fiennes . <p> In an empire calling itself Rome , the people are restless at having stores of grain withheld from them . Most of them blame Caius Martius ( Ralph Fiennes ) , who is openly contemptuous to the masses . While Menenius ( Brian Cox ) placates the masses , Brutus ( Paul Jesson ) and Sicinius ( James Nesbitt ) privately denounced Martius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , he is soon off to combat . Caius is awarded the title of Coriolanus for his bravery in fighting Aufidius ( Gerard Butler ) , the Volscian leader , and his mother Volumnia ( Vanessa Redgrave ) urges him to parlay this recognition into a run for the office of consul . However , he soon finds himself up against a sea of populist aggression . <p> The lack of performances and adaptations of Coriolanus to date are undoubtedly due to how unsympathetic the central character is . Unlike other Shakespearean tregedies , we are offered no soliloquies or monologues to peep inside the mind of this very complex character . He is openly contemptuous to the masses , but also a fierce defender of the kingdom . He seems reluctant to accept praise , but has no issue in publically airing his negative views . He is a strong military man able to be manipulated by his mother .

Restaging the film in the battlefields of the 21st century , Logan and Fiennes ' Coriolanus is a study of modern warfare and politics , a stunning achievement given that it maintains the original text . The play has been used over the years for various purposes , actually banned in France in the 1930s for being used by a fascist element .

This may be minor Shakespeare , but there are no minor roles here . Even the ubiquitous Jessica Chastain , who only has a small amount of screen time , brings a quiet dignity to Coriolanus ' wife . Nesbitt and Cox in particular give the supporting cast an authenticity , delivering 400 year old lines as though they were everyday speech . Yet it is Fiennes and Butler who command the screen , with the former only having to utter a few lines or stroke his shaven head with Colonel Kurtz megalomania to send shivers down your spine . <p> A fresh and lively take on this little-known Shakespeare marks a thrilling debut from Fiennes as a director , commanding this huge cast like a seasoned pro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

They would involve the very reason people play games , the thing that urges people to keep playing them : the zeal to win and the way that contorts everything else in a video game . <p> The troubles Robertson encountered while trying to make a video game out of Joyce Vincent 's story threatened to etch a line dividing what games could and could not be . On one side of the line were things video games could handle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can have about a person whose dead body went undiscovered in her home for three Christmases . <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Carol Morley began working on her documentary about Joyce Vincent by posting ads on London Taxis and in the newspapers . " Did you know Joyce Vincent ? " her ads asked . The ads included her contact information . She hoped they would entice friends to emerge , friends who themselves had been undiscovered by the police and the press . <p> Morley would meet and film interviews with Joyce 's former lovers and associates , friends who remembered her bantering at a party , singing songs in a music studio , slumping through a front door asking to sleep on the couch for days that turned into weeks and months . They remembered her working a job in finance and cheerfully reporting that she 'd been in the right room at the right time and , because of that , just met Nelson Mandela . <p> As Morley pieced together stories of Joyce 's life , Hilary Perkins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , well ... she does n't call it a game . " I was quite careful not to refer to it as a game when discussing it internally , " she told me . " To me it was an interactive experience which was facilitated by a game structure . " The maybe-a-game would draw more people to the film and expose them to its ideas . It would be weightier than her standard commissions for interactive experiences tied to game shows about winning lots of money off of trapdoors or out of bank vaults . <p> Perkins hoped , if not for a game , then for something game-like , a distinction both big and small , a distinction that did n't stop Robertson and her team from trying to make ... a game . <p> Actually , the first thing Robertson tried in order to say something about Joyce Vincent 's story was Facebook . <p> " I think everybody has that immediate visceral response to the story , " Robertson said . " And we thought , ' This is about maintaining connections in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying socially active . ' <p> " I think anyone who makes digital games at this point in time turns to Facebook and goes , ' Ok , we do a Facebook thing and we scrape your friends ' data and we see what we can do in terms of looking at patterns of correspondence and we tell you things about yourself and all the rest of it . ' " <p> No . Facebook was wrong for this . It was n't true enough . <p> " The minute you start scrutinizing that at all , it kind of falls apart , " Robertson said . Facebook was n't intimate . It was n't , believe it or not , sufficiently sweeping . People 's entire lives are n't on Facebook. mum might not be on Facebook . Dad may not even know how to turn on a computer . And do people on Facebook really share their genuine feelings ? About the stuff that matters ? Hide &amp; Seek , Robertson realised , could n't turn people 's Facebook communications into anything profound . " The minute you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and not just some glib little throwaway , Cosmo personality test , you ca n't do it . " <p> Facebook was no good . But , a game ? Hide &amp; Seek had many options , many quickly discarded . <p> They barely considered any kind of interactive Whodunnit . The film was n't going to dwell on how Joyce died but on how she lived . The game would leave the death alone , too . They dismissed the idea of letting players explore Joyce 's apartment because Robertson considered the options of either including or excluding Joyce 's body from the interactive scene to be " grotesque . " <p> " That had been a long and quite difficult process in figuring out : What right do we have to be censors ? " <p> This was n't Robertson 's first challenging game-making assignment . She had faced tough issues of design and tone before . Her team 's iPhone game involving the Tate Modern 's collection had run into the problem that the museum 's collection included a photographer 's self-portraits of herself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That had been a long and quite difficult process in figuring out : What right do we have to be censors ? This stuff is art and displayed publicly . Where do we get off saying we should be protecting you from that in a game ? But , equally , you 're not expecting that in a game and to be confronted with this image . " Robertson 's team decided to include it in the game . <p> Eventually , the Hide &amp; Seek team began to think they 'd found the right kind of Joyce Vincent video game . They started designing something basic that would treat the story of Joyce Vincent in the abstract . They chose a graphical text adventure format , a throwback to early video games that told stories mostly by pulling players through a narrative while requiring them to type answers to questions and issue basic commands to advance , usually past a series of puzzles . <p> " You 're facing structures , classic lock and key puzzles , " Robertson said of the game they began to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're inflating rubber dinghies ' or ' looking for seagulls ' or whatever it is -- you 'd arrive in a room and it would say , ' this room wants you to leave something ... a memory of someone you never told you loved . ' And that becomes a token in the game . <p> " So all of this stuff is completely private and just to you , but you wind up winning the game -- rather than by opening the blue door with the blue key -- you win the game by giving your grandmother 's engagement ring to your teenage crush at your best friend 's wedding . Or whatever that thing ends up being . " <p> Robertson sketched that out on paper . It seemed promising . <p> " From the player point of view , I was hopeful there would be some sort of self-examination or self-discovery , " she said . " You would suddenly have more interesting conversations than you 'd ever had , because you were suddenly saying : how long do you think you would lie dead for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglecting ? Those are much closer-to-the-bone conversations than you 'd normally have . " <p> And then the problem revealed itself : people who would play this game would treat it as ... a game . <p> " We were confident that posing those questions would get people to think about things they 're not usually thinking about , " Robertson said . " The problem was that , the minute we enclosed them in a game structure , we tainted their answers . Even if this is a game that is n't about winning or losing or dying or enemies or anything like that , the minute you understand that your progress is being impeded and that your inputs and choices are going to free that progress , you want to free that progress . We ca n't not want that . So the minute you say : ' Who do you want to give the ring to ? ' I 'm thinking , ' Well , shit , what does the game want me to say here ? " <p> " The minute you say : ' Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking , ' Well , shit , what does the game want me to say here ? " <p> The game undermined itself . Players would not be tempted to provide an honest answer . They would be tempted to inject an efficient answer that would enable them to win . Why input some long name or hard-to-remember heartfelt fact when a short name or a clich ? would be easier to wield ? Players would n't be able to help themselves , Robertson decided . They 'd make the point of the game to win . Everything else would be secondary , including any big ideas about what Joyce Vincent 's life and death meant . They 'd focus on beating the system . It 's what gamers do . <p> Robertson was facing failure . <p> " I have a thing about ' big-piece-of-paper problems , ' " she said . " There are some projects where you get to the point where the only way you can solve them is with a massive sheet of paper and a really sharp pencil . This had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on a frontier , trying to make a video game about a difficult topic . She also knew about the doubters , the people who say games are n't art or beautiful or worthy of the respect you might give a book . She knew how sceptical some people were that games could be about anything other than violence or competition . She knew that plenty of people did n't think those things because it never occurred to them that video games would ever have anything to say . <p> She knew what it meant to decide that , as best she could tell , this topic-this life and death-could not be a video game . But that is what she concluded . Maybe someone else could figure it out . Hopefully , they could , she thought . She could not . <p> The story of Joyce Vincent would become a documentary . That story would not become a video game . <p> " That moment of failure was also a moment of kind of excitement and freedom , " Robertson said . " We get to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <p> It would be something else . Something interactive , but something she would never call a video game . <p> In the months since her so-called defeat , Robertson and the team at Hide &amp; Seek have created two companion pieces to Carol Morley 's Dreams of a Life . The first is called Dreams of Your Life . It starts on Facebook , as a quiz , and drives you to a website where you are asked more questions-the very questions you would have been asked in Robertson 's lock-and-key game-but you are asked them out of the context of a game . You are simply compelled to think : how long would it take for someone to find your body ? What would people say about you ? Who misses you right now ? <p> " We kept that conversational intensity , " Robertson says of Dreams of Your Life , " but now there is no gaming structure around it . The hope is you are now at liberty to tell the truth or as much of the truth as you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " time passing without you realising , of things changing when you 're not looking and things changing faster than you might realise . " <p> The second project from Robertson 's team is a game after all . It is called Would Anyone Miss You ? It is a simple game and not a video game , more of a **36;914;TOOLONG kind of thing . It 's being run at this years SXSW arts festival in Austin , Texas . Players are encouraged to give stickers to people they meet and ask them questions similar to those asked in Dreams of Your Life . The respondents can follow a Twitter feed and have their photos taken . It 's all quite abstract and more about memory , love and loss than it is about winning or losing . <p> These projects are , Robertson believes , about " time passing without you realising , of things changing when you 're not looking and things changing faster than you might realise . " They connect to Joyce indirectly , but importantly . <p> " I am very proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 's Perkins told me . " It is a beautiful , immersive response to the film . I think it 's absolutely right that they did n't make it a video game . " She describes both of Hide &amp; Seek 's creations as something only partially intended to sell Morley 's film . " The aim of Would Anyone Miss You and Dreams of Your Life is to draw audiences who would not normally choose to see an art-house documentary film to the film , and give them an experience that will hopefully be intriguing and compelling enough to make them want to watch it . At the same time they give audiences who may never see the film an experience which is about Joyce 's story and the meaning that the film seeks to make from it . " <p> Margaret Robertson never stepped foot in Joyce Vincent 's apartment , but she did go to Joyce 's neighbourhood to look for a window to photograph , a window that would be the main visual of Dreams of Your Life . The visit to Joyce 's neighbourhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day very clearly , " she said . " It was grey and wet and nasty . And it 's a busy but not particularly vibrant part of town . It 's a run-down shopping centre . Lots of traffic . Lots of noise . No kind of comfort or space . Mostly , you think about her last walk home and wonder what was the weather like on her last day ? " <p> Morley 's movie makes it clear that Joyce Vincent was n't a woman to pity any more than we 'd pity ourselves . She had good relationships and bad ones , good jobs and bad ones . She may have suffered domestic abuse . Her final home was subsidized to support battered women , but she was not without the connections we all have . Her family was thinned , but not in a very unusual way . Her mother had died when she was young . She was estranged from her father . But she had three sisters . She had neighbours , who would complain , after her death , about the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's emblematic of a larger issue , " Robertson said . " That 's the thing . If there was just this one particular haunted corner , where you could go , ' Oh ! The rest of the world is fine , and this is the place where we stand and feel sad about Joyce ' -- especially when it 's not somebody you know -- but it 's not that ... <p> " You walk three blocks away , and you go , ' Well now I do n't know who the person is who I should be feeling sad about . ' Somebody behind one of these doors is lost and ignored and we all just walk past . Every block I passed , particularly in those high-density-population areas of London , I thought , ' This is happening in one way or the other and we 're not seeing it . ' " <p> Beneath that bleak cloud , it seems to matter less that Robertson could n't figure out how to handle the emotions of Joyce 's story in a video game . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant ' make a game about death . Or that you ca n't make a serious game . " <p> She does n't think her design struggles with the Joyce Vincent story condemn games to being some sort of lesser art . Quite the opposite : " I think it started to reassure me that games are their own thing . It does n't make me sad that games ca n't be all those things , that games ca n't be a symphony and a sculpture and a film and all the rest of it ... The idea that we 're learning the hard edges is exciting to me , not terribly daunting . <p> There is no Joyce Vincent video game after all . Or is there ? " I know from a theory point of view that this is n't a game , " Robertson said of her creations . " I 'm perfectly comfortable if the rest of the world thinks it is . " There are more important things in life about which people should know the honest truth . <p> When Square Enix brought Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a graphical overhaul that most fans ca n't stand , complete with washed-out sprites and inconsistent tiling .

@@807239 <p> Overview:After putting the series on hiatus for four years , EA Sports decided to revive the FIFA Street franchise and having been a fan of the previous releases ( more so FIFA Street 2 than it 's successor ) , I was pretty excited to get my hands on this one . With 6 complete leagues included , in addition to 20 national teams and a whole bunch of Street teams and special " All Star " teams , FIFA Street was on it 's way to living up to the EA Sports standard . There has however been some criticism about the release of the game , in that many people feel it should just be incorporated into the FIFA games rather than existing as a separate entity , much like the 2k NBA series has done . So is FIFA Street good enough to warrant it 's own retail release ? Let 's find out . <p> Gameplay : <p> The FIFA Street match engine is heavily adapted from FIFA 12 , and given the success of the latter , that 's definitely not something to complain about . The match engine runs smoothly , and for the majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just FIFA 12 on a smaller pitch , the passing is not as precise and as a result you will need to use your dribbling skills and tricks to beat defenders and sink the ball into the back of the net . This does vary however depending on which match type you are playing , as they have included a futsal style match as well as other variants such as 6 vs. 6 . These are played on much bigger pitches and require you to change your tactics and style when compared to how you approach a 2 vs. 2 match type . It 's a really great way of spicing things up and works really well throughout the game . <p> However that being said there are a few flaws which pop up as you play . There seem to be a few glitches and collision issues that occur sometimes , similar to that which we experienced quite frequently in the FIFA 12 demo and which still occasionally appear in the full game , however these seem to be rare enough to not detriment the game much . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just a standing tackle and a pretty weak attempt at that . Obviously street football favours attacking players and the more goals the better , but it can be incredibly frustrating at times . Although logical to omit a slide tackle given the surfaces you 're playing on , it feels much tamer than the old street games . I was pretty surprised they did n't even allow the shirt pulling or bumping that you can pull off in FIFA 12 , a simple yet effective way of giving the defence a bit of power . Rushing your keeper generally seems to be an effective way of shutting down an attack as they seem to tackle much more aggressively , although obviously risking an open goal . On top of that , AI can be a bit suspect at times , especially when using the " dynamic " formation or playing in a match type without a keeper , however on the most part it 's still pretty good . <p> Do n't let these flaws deter you too much as the majority of the game plays really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mode is done pretty well , with you starting off by creating a player ( or importing one from FIFA 12 ) , and then selecting a group of pre-created players to join you as you take on some local teams . You can edit all of these players to your liking as well , although the customisation options are almost identical to that of FIFA 12 besides a few hairstyles , but there 's a pretty hefty amount of clothing choices ( which you progressively unlock ) . I would 've liked some more bold customisation options , like crazier hairstyles , tattoos and bigger variations in body types , which would 've given the game a more " street " feel , but for the most part there is still enough in there to make your players unique . <p> You then play some matches and tournaments to improve your squad and move up to the bigger stages , starting with local , national and then onto Europe and finally international . As you progress you sometimes will be able to recruit some newer players , however mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the international stage , and by then the mode is almost completed . In a way this is good because you have to really develop your squad and it allows you to build the players up exactly how you 'd like , but on the other hand I personally prefer to have real FIFA players in my squad . In the older FIFA Street games you 'd start out by recruiting lower rated real life stars , and slowly move on to the superstars , which I felt was a much better system . <p> The difficulty settings for the matches are quite good , simply just easy , medium , and hard , or even play online , with each allowing you to unlock different items . The match type variations keep things fresh , as does unlocking new tricks and improving your player 's skills . At times however World Tour Mode does feel a bit dry and repetitive and does n't have the same level of replay-ability that Career Mode in FIFA 12 does , but overall it still is quite fun and will entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with World Tour Mode there 's always online to keep you going which is a lot of fun , although you will need to get an online pass . <p> Visual : <p> This time round FIFA Street decided to take a much more realistic approach which their players as opposed to the characterised style of FIFA Street 3 , and for the most part the players are very well animated , albeit similar to their FIFA 12 counterparts . The venues are also relatively well crafted , with some aesthetically amazing locations such as right in front of the Notre Dame in Paris as well as a floating pitch in the Venetian canals , remembering that this is a sports game so you ca n't expect the architecture to compete with the Venice of Assassin 's Creed . The animations are pretty standard , and EA have n't really stretched themselves too much in terms of player personalities which is a bit disappointing . The game 's interface is easy enough to navigate through and there 's not much to complain about there . <p> Audio : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes from the likes of Fatboy Slim and the Hilltop Hoods , but it still seems to be lacking that edge that we normally get from FIFA soundtracks . What 's more is that the matches feel pretty empty in terms of audio , despite the soundtrack playing in the background . There is no commentary as such and it does n't need any , but there 's just not much going on at all . Some of the matches you 'll get a announcer getting a bit excited and making some comments or saying the score , as well as some multilingual chatter coming from the players , but it just needs something more to boost the match atmosphere and improve the overall experience . For the most part the audio is still adequate , but nothing more . <p> Overall : <p> It 's not going to keep your FIFA addiction at bay for more than a month or two but that does n't mean it 's not a great sports game . Sure it 's lacking depth and there are a few persistent issues that should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to be had with FIFA Street and it definitely brings some freshness onto the scene . The online gameplay will extend the game 's sustainability and it 's a useful game to have in your collection when you 're in the mood for some easy going entertainment . Could EA Sports have just made this an expansion pack for FIFA 12 ? There 's far too much content not to mention a lot of uniqueness about FIFA Street to not warrant it 's own release . Despite it 's flaws , it 's still a well rounded game that just needs a bit of polishing . It 's a good improvement from FIFA Street 3 and will hopefully put the series back on track .

Otherwise , it is wise to wait until you believe they have the maturity to comprehend the information . <h> 2 . Leave judgment at the door <p> This is not a time to be embarrassed -- for you or the children . Be prepared to answer your children 's questions , in an open and honest way . Let them know you 're there to bring valuable and reliable information to the table and that they should n't be embarrassed for asking the curly questions . <h> 3 . Be accurate <p> Use the correct names for the anatomy parts and give honest descriptions of sexual intercourse . Answer your children 's questions openly . They will only be secretive about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your depth , you can both log on to a reliable and informed website run by healthcare professionals and share the information together . <h> 4 . Work together <p> Talking about sex with kids should involve both parents . School counsellor and chaplain Brian Reed of the Central Coast , says that in his experience with teenagers , many of them feel as though their fathers are n't involved enough or at all . " Boys especially need to see that men are a responsible and valuable source of sexual information and role modeling , " he notes . <p> As a team , you should share your experiences and let your children know that just because you 're their parent , they can still talk to you about sex . Reaffirm that you are their best possible source of private and honest information . <h> 5 . Saying no <p> Explain to your children the importance of saying no , and that if they have the slightest doubt about how they feel about sexual activity they have to right to walk away and wait . Remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to you , and they should treat their body with respect . <h> 6 . Safety first <p> Talk about contraception and safe sex as separate issues to avoid confusion . Both conversations are equally as important . Many teenagers believe messages that being on the pill " is safe " since it prevents pregnancy . And most assume that protection is unnecessary for oral sex too . When in fact , diseases such as herpes can be contracted and spread through oral sex . <h> 7 . Keep a level head <p> Keep in mind , this should be a two-way conversation , not a time to lecture them . If your children need information on a sensitive topic , including that of other adolescent issues such as drugs and alcohol , allow for a respectful and open dialogue between the two of you . Good communication is associated with more responsible behaviour . <h> 8 . Find support <p> If your child expresses questions you ca n't answer , and you feel out of your depth , help them find someone such as a councellor or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about sex and relationships . <h> 9 . Respect <p> Teach your sons to respect and value girls and your daughters to be confident and considerate when it comes to boys . It 's the old golden rule -- teach them to treat others the way you would like your own child to be treated . <h> 10 . Do n't forget <p> As teenagers , your children are still finding out who they are . " While sex involves intimacy , pleasure and knowing yourself , an adolescent in their formative years is not generally comfortable with themselves or aware of who they are , " Dobie says . Teens need help from parents to make wise decisions about things that may change their lives . Reed suggests that parental communication is the key to solving teen sexual ignorance . " Parents are in the perfect position to change the alarming statistics . If they talk about sex openly , so will their kids . " Children who have a strong understanding of the facts and their own self worth are more likely to make wise sexual choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads ) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites .

@@818232 <h> How Fans Brought A Japan-Only Nintendo Wii Game To The West <p> When Fatal Frame 4 : Mask of the Lunar Eclipse was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show 2007 , horror fans rejoiced . When the E3 gaming expo came the following year with Fatal Frame 4 conspicuously absent , they got worried . And when Nintendo finally announced that the title would not be leaving Japanese shores , they despaired . Some ranted , some raved and some petitioned . But what could they really do other than wait and hope ? <p> Four years later , they 're still waiting . <p> Or rather they would be if it were n't for a dedicated group of fans that set about localising the game themselves . Last week , project lead Colin " Tempus " Noga and patch programmer Aaron " AerialX " Lindsay told Kotaku the story behind their fan-localisation of Fatal Frame 4 . <p> You might think that this whole project began due to Colin 's love of the Fatal Frame series or his anger at Nintendo for not bringing it west . In reality , his reason was much simpler : <p> " I started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming over . " <p> And that was all it took for a creative writing and philosophy major with no programming experience to begin the most ambitious fan-translation project to date . <p> " I opened things in a hex editor and started unravelling the file formats like a logic puzzle , " Colin continued . <p> At first he was stumbling in the dark -- but still eager to share what he found . Colin posted his preliminary results and attracted the attention of Yoshiya " Chabi " Mori , a neurology student in Osaka , Japan . Working together the two managed to decipher where the game script was stored and moreover , how to extract it . <p> While Yoshiya was the first to join Colin 's team , he certainly would n't be the last . When the two began posting their progress on Beyond the Camera Lens , a Fatal Frame fansite , they attracted another coder named Clayton " Mr Mongoose " Ramsey , who created a streamlined extractor/inserter for modifying the game 's script . <p> After extracting it from the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone could work on . It did n't work out quite as expected . " Eventually , we had to close the open translation due to too many people just pulling Google translations into it . " Colin lamented . " If you 're not aware , Google translations are really horrible . " <p> Soon Yoshiya and Colin found themselves doing copy editing in addition to their programming duties . The text was voluminous -- more than most novels . And it was n't just the sheer amount of words they were forced to deal with , but odd jargon and weird sentence fragments . Even then , programming technicalities , like getting the English text to fit the text boxes , proved troublesome . <p> " English is much more lengthy than Japanese , " Colin explained . " Japanese fonts are fixed width . You can save a good 60 per cent of space just by making the English font a variable width font . The thinner and taller you make the font , the easier it is to fit everything . So you try to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> About six months into the project the initial translation was complete -- save for archaic Japanese bits being worked on by a Japanese classical literature major at Osaka University . It was at that point that Colin and his team reached their first major road bump : The issue of piracy . <p> After examining the game 's code using a USB gecko ( a hardware device that lets you look at memory as the game is running ) Colin discovered that it was possible to patch an original copy of the game instead of being forced to make patched , pirated ISO file . <p> " The whole point of a translation patch is to play the fantastic game the developers created , " Colin told me . " So you want to support them if you can and respect them . I thought that pulling off a translation like that could bring translations and the game hacking scene in general way above board . Make them a little less shady and a little more of an homage . " <p> The decision was made and the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? It was at this point that Colin 's now business partner , Aaron Lindsay , entered the story .

He 'd gotten a proof of concept version running , but had lost interest in the project shortly thereafter . <p> " I was actually mean at first , I just kinda dumped the prototype on Colin and was n't that interested in continuing its development , " Aaron told me .

Aaron was happy to give some examples . " These days it 's primarily used for Super Smash Bros . Brawl level/texture hacks and New Super Mario Bros. levels . Oh , and Mario Kart stages too .

" The pirates messed up the ISO anyway . It has numerous issues which are not present in the original translation . " <p> " That 's the most unfortunate part , really . " Aaron was quick to add . " That the quality of the pirated copy reflected poorly on the project for some people . " <p> But what has happened to Colin and Aaron in the years since they released Fatal Frame 4 : Mask of the Lunar Eclipse ? Quite a lot actually . The two have since started their own mobile games business called Amateur Pixels . They 've released two games so far and have three more -- a Patapon style game , a strategy/management game , and a music timing game similar to Bemania -- in the pipeline . <p> " Overall , it was a great learning experience for me .

@@818238 <h> Cooking the Books - Lamb back-strap on sweet potato mash <p> You 've got to love lamb . Maybe I 'm biased because I was brought up on a sheep farm , but there is something about lamb that makes it a real winner . Since the new cuts of lamb have come out it has made it even easier to entertain with -- no more chasing a loin chop around the plate or trying to find the meat on a cutlet . This back-strap dish is great -- I 've had a number of very positive compliments for this meal ( thus its high panty drop rating ) -- presentation wise it looks great also . <p> Rub and coat the lamb with the chopped rosemary , salt /pepper and olive oil . Sit aside wrapped up in cling wrap for 15-30 minutes . <p> Next thing start the sauce . Add the chicken stock and red wine and heat in a small saucepan . Add the tsp seeded mustard and Worcester sauce and reduce gradually by keeping at a constant simmer .

Then place on a baking tray and place in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees for 10 minutes . Do n't forget it -- the lamb needs to be pink in the middle when sliced so definitely should n't be over cooked . Remove from the oven and sit under some foil . <p> Place the vegetables in a pre heated wok with oil ( use combination of olive and sesame oil ) . Stir fry harder vegetables first and then add softer vegetables . Whilst all vegetables in the wok add a sprinkle of Chinese Five Spice . They should take about 2-3 minutes all up . Ensure still little crunchy . Sit off heat till ready to serve . <p> Back to the sauce .

Slice the back-strap on an angle into 1-2cm slices and place overlapped on top of the mash .

@@818240 truth about brokers and financial advisors <p> The case against stock brokers and financial advisors is n't just all hot air . Today , I have proof that when you use a financial advisor or full-service broker , you may find yourself with lower returns than if you 'd handled your investing yourself . Read on and I 'll share the details of recent research that shows just how costly professional financial advice can be . <p> To Germany we go ! <p> I 'm referring to a paper titled " Financial Advisors : A Case of Babysitters ? " that comes to us from Andreas Hackethal and Michael Haliassos of Goethe University in Frankfurt , Germany , and Tullio Jappelli of the University of Naples Federico II in Italy . The trio of researchers got their hands on a couple of very cool datasets -- one is from a German online brokerage and includes 32,751 randomly selected customers , while the other is 4,447 clients of a large German bank . <p> In both the online brokerage and the bank , customers were offered the option to manage the accounts themselves or employ an advisor . That choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisor-assisted and individually managed accounts . <p> Let 's get right to those results . Here are the researchers summing up their findings : <p> Involvement of financial advisors is found to lower portfolio returns net of direct cost , to worsen risk-return profiles , as measured by the Sharpe ratio ; and to increase account turnover and investment in mutual funds , consistent with incentives built into the commission structure of both types of financial advisors . <p> That may be a lot to digest all at once , so let me break this down a little further . There are three very crucial points that the researchers highlighted : <p> Lower performance . Bottom line , the research showed that the accounts that used financial advisors had lower returns ( net of fees ) than the accounts that did not . How much lower ? A whopping five percentage points lower . That smarts . But just how much does that hurt ? Starting with a $100,000 portfolio , over the course of 30 years , getting 7% returns instead of 12% means a difference of a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly $3 million . <p> Lower risk-adjusted performance . A potentially reasonable explanation for No. 1 above is that advisors are serving their clients by creating safer portfolios that produce lower returns but also have lower risk . But that does n't appear to be the case with this dataset . The researchers found that advisor-assisted accounts also had lower Sharpe ratios . The Sharpe ratio is a measure of performance that adjusts for risk , so the findings suggest that investors using advisors were getting less compensated for the risk they were taking as opposed to investors who were n't using advisors . <p> Padding their bottom line . Finally , the results suggest that , on the whole , advisors in this dataset were focused on padding their own bottom lines . Accounts that used advisors had higher turnover and were more heavily invested in mutual funds -- both outcomes that would ( conveniently ! ) earn higher commissions for the advisors . <p> What have you done for me ... ever ? <p> Take a moment to think about what it means to pay a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my house , so I hired a pest professional . Evaluating that service has been simple -- I 've been happy because I 'm not seeing pests running around anymore . Which , mind you , is an outcome I was woefully unsuccessful at achieving on my own . <p> Likewise , you could hire a plumber to fix a leaky tap or a doctor to treat an infection with the expectation that either could do a better job at remedying the problem than you could . <p> With all of that in mind , consider this : What is a financial advisor worth if you end up with lower investment returns ? <p> Say it ai n't so ! I 'm sure there are holes that could be poked in this research , and I 'd be overreaching if I were to suggest that this one study of a couple of financial outlets in Germany is enough to condemn the entire financial advisory industry worldwide . <p> At the same time , if I 'm one of the many other players in this multi-trillion-dollar global business , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is coming out . For decades , brokers and financial advisors were very much like the great and powerful Oz , hiding out behind a comfortable and profitable shroud of secrecy . In the age of the Internet , it 's becoming much easier to find out the value -- or lack thereof -- that brokers and financial advisors actually offer their customers . <p> But I 'm not writing this to simply crucify the industry . There are funds , advisors and brokers that are adding real value . The key point is to make sure you 're getting value for the money that you are paying -- and if not , stop paying or find a new financial professional who charges less , or gives you value for your money . <p> If you are looking for ASX investing ideas , look no further than " The Motley Fool 's Top Stock for 2012 .

@@832239 <p> providing an opportunity for independent reviews of certain council and departmental decisions , including rezoning proposals , by a Joint Regional Planning Panel ( JRPP ) or Planning Assessment Commission ( PAC ) at certain stages in the plan-making process . <p> These proposed changes follow the NSW Government 's announcement to reform the planning system as part of the Government 's 10 year State plan ( NSW 2021 ) and address issues that have been identified as part of the planning legislation review currently being undertaken by Ron Dyer and Tim Moore . <p> If enacted , these proposed changes will provide an opportunity for increased local engagement between councils and proponents in making certain types of LEPs , and they have the potential to speed up the rezoning process . Importantly these reforms will also provide an opportunity for independent review of some plan-making decisions . <h> What are the key changes proposed ? <p> 1 . Council delegation to approve certain LEPs <p> The discussion paper proposes to delegate the Minister 's functions in relation to making LEPs ( under section 59(2) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the EP&amp;A Act ) to councils where a Gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of LEPs : <p> spot rezoning consistent with an endorsed strategy or surrounding zones or in accordance with broader Government policy ; <p> mapping alterations or corrections that do not alter strategy endorsed development standards ; <p> reclassifications of land consistent with a strategy/supported by an adopted Open Space study ; and <p> heritage LEPs supported by an Office of Environment and Heritage endorsed study . <p> The Department will generally play no further role in the process once the LEP is delegated to a council , other than routine monitoring of the process to ensure that Gateway Determination timeframes continue to be met . <p> Councils will also have obligations to report quarterly to the Department on processing times for delegated LEPs . <p> 2 . Proponents can request a Pre-Gateway Review <p> The discussion paper proposes a new review mechanism which would allow a proponent of a planning proposal to seek a review of Council 's decision by the JRPP : <p> where the council has decided to not prepare a planning proposal ; or <p> the council has not made a decision after 60 days of receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proponent will have 40 days to seek a review of the council 's decision . <p> There are , however , strict requirements that must be satisfied before a proposal will be eligible for review . The proponent will need to be able to demonstrate that the proposal meets a number of criteria , including that the proposal : <p> will utilise existing capacity in infrastructure networks or that capacity can be otherwise provided for ; <p> will be adequately integrated with existing public transport networks ; <p> is likely to be supported by key environmental agencies ; <p> will not detrimentally impact on the viability of identified centres ; and <p> is consistent with endorsed local or regional strategies . <p> Demonstrating that a proposal meets these criteria will therefore be fundamental . Responsibility for conducting the eligibility assessment will rest with the Department . <p> For proposals which are eligible for review , the discussion paper suggests that the review process will effectively be managed by the Department which will prepare a report on the proposal for the JRPP . The discussion paper suggests that there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponent to meet with the JRPP as part of the review process . <p> Following a review , the JRPP will advise the Minister on whether or not the proposed instrument should be submitted for a Gateway Determination ( and may require the council to submit such a planning proposal within 40 days ) . The JRPP 's advice will be made publicly available . <p> In cases where there is no JRPP ( such as the City of Sydney ) , the PAC will conduct the review . <p> 3 . Proponents and councils can request a Gateway Review <p> A further proposed change is that a council or proponent may request the Minister ( or delegate ) to alter a Gateway Determination concerning a planning proposal , when a Gateway Determination is made by a delegate of the Minister that : <p> a planning proposal should not proceed ( 40 days to seek a review ) ; <p> a planning proposal should be resubmitted for Gateway Determination ( 40 days to seek a review ) ; or <p> imposes requirements ( other than consultation requirements ) or makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks should be reconsidered ( 14 days to seek a review ) . <p> This type of review will not be available where the Gateway Determination is made by the Minister . <p> The Minister or Director-General may alter the Gateway Determination following receipt of advice from the PAC and decide whether the planning proposal should proceed , at which point the council and proponent will be notified of the altered determination and ( if appropriate ) post-Gateway consultation on the planning proposal can commence . <h> Conclusion <p> The proposed changes are likely to have significance for councils and proponents alike , providing an opportunity for increased local engagement in local plan-making and also providing opportunities for reviews of decisions in certain circumstances . <p> Public submissions are invited on the discussion paper .

Is Qantas actually trying to drive you away onto its quality competitors , so it can whine and bleat even more about its helpless inability to be a long haul carrier , or does it have some other ' plan ' for the future ? <p> Sorry Ben , a ' plan ' would suggest that some kind of forward thinking on strategy , combined with a SWOT analysis had been undertaken , to align Qantas ' assets , resources and values with meeting the needs of their customers . <p> On the current evidence , I feel secure in stating that no such ' plan ' exists . <p> Ad hoc muddle through leaving untold brand value damage on the other hand ... <p> Ben of the five options two are on all QF flights so the term ' far more ' seems a bit rich ( marginally more maybe ) and the two QFs have very good connection times , as do the others . Check the alternatives and they will all have plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and long waiting times except for one flight each . QF has five options with good connection times . Here is a case of a glass half full or half empty again from Ben <p> Remind us as to why if we want to support Qantas and fly-the-flag , we would even think of changing to British Airways for more than half the trip each way , receive reduced points ( for those that think them important ) and ..... be told to eat our greens if we want any sweets . <p> Further remind us to why we would tolerate this if it involves making connections at London , possibly to the most remote parts of Heathrow , if not to Gatwick , when in fact there are alternatives that will take us one stop to Manchester and other UK cities , and many more cities throughout Europe . <p> " Dreadful alternatives " and extended connection times ? None of those connections is longer than 1:25 ( and looking at the flight time , I suspect QF1 spends longer on on the ground than any connecting passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater range of departure times available with someone like Emirates . Also , I 'd hardly call BA a " dreadful alternative " , but anyone who objects as strenuously as you do to connecting to BA can book on QF1 or QF5/9 and fly Qantas metal straight through . Your point about requiring connection in Heathrow ( not Gatwick unless you 're off to the Caribbean or a very limited number of European destinations , and not the remotest parts of Heathrow either -- no one arriving from Australia is likely to be connecting to North America from T5C ) is valid , but that 's an aside and very well-trodden ground . <p> And in relation to frequent flyer points , points accrual on BA operated flights ( whether code share or on a QF flight number ) is exactly the same as Qantas on Australia-Europe routes . <p> Whilst on the " remind us why " theme . Remind me again how Qantas is compete with the ME carriers with multiple points into Europe all one stop via Dubai , or Abu Dhabi or Doha ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from multiple points and feed out to multiple points all via airports where the governments are spending not millions , but billions on airport infrastructure to support efficient hub operations of their home carriers . <p> And the ME carriers are not just impacting Qantas , they are massively impacting all European long haul carriers ( include BA in that ) . most Asian long haul carriers ( including Singapore by the way , even though they have a hub of their own ( but now inferior to ME ) and their fifth freedom rights ) , plus all Indian international carriers , virtually all African international carriers , as well as US and South and Central American international carriers . And with all the additional capacity they are buying there will be no respite . <p> They have almost unlimited funds , low cost operations . negligible tax and aircraft depreciation regime of 10 years ( they will have fully depreciated an aircraft when Qantas will still have half the aircraft value on its books ) <p> Remind me again ? <p> And here we are basically referring only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far worse competitive scenario . <p> No taxation and yet depreciation . Which fairy tale land do you inhabit ? If you do n't pay corporate tax you do n't get to depreciate to get a tax benefit , and the process of writing down the value of investments is fundamentally different . If you dig , and I ca n't do your digging for you , you will find some fairly alarming analyses as to where debt and re-financing and write downs might take Dubai that would make gripping reading on a blog about international trade and emerging economies and how western economies can come out very much on top . Group publication Businesses Spectator is a good starting point , but there are many others you can reach via Google . <p> In this real world Qantas has always been free to fly to Dubai , as do more than 120 airlines at last count , or three times as many as fly to Sydney . They make a go of it too , despite the advantages Emirates has , because there are still enough nationals prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is technically no harder for Qantas to fly to Dubai than it is to LAX from the SE capitals . Now imagine , just for a moment , getting together with BA to transfer passengers to a BA service to say Manchester . Or with Lufthansa , to exchange passengers there on a code share to Munich , or the new Berlin airport . <p> Imagine . Just a small measure of enterprise , and a bit of non-London centric thinking . I have read guidance which says Lufthansa , Virgin Atlantic and BA make money flying to the UAE . Qantas could fly there at least twice a day with full A380s now one each from Sydney and Melbourne . It could have laid the foundations for this with a fleet of 777-200ERs as long ago as 1999 to help develop the route , and deny a rising Emirates the marketing vacuum that it entered unopposed , and thus encouraged a different distribution to that it has over Changi , or better still , would keep at an appropriate level at Changi . <p> A key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful Australian flag carrier , and engage with its people . Exhibit A is Virgin Australia , which does n't bad mouth its own people , although I would caution anyone against thinking Virgin Australia will have it easy , or enjoy a default success . It is going to have work very hard for every yard . But at least it is giving it a go . <p> Perhaps you were confusing the Singapore depreciation regime with the corporate arrangements in the UAE . Or assigning to Singaporean carriers a cost advantage that on Joyce 's figures is essentially one of diverging currency values expressed in USD . <p> If our exchange rate becomes more realistic so will the cost differentials that confront Qantas in areas over which it has no control . I do agree , and have campaigned for , the need for equitable depreciation schedules for Australian flag carriers , especially now that the government sees fit to legislate for them for Australian merchant shipping . <p> Another missing ingredient at Qantas is long term planning . Qantas management is trying to run the airline without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks now , and then clear out , as it nearly did in 2007 with the private equity bid . Unfortunately it is n't making enough bucks to pay dividends and the cost of private equity capital seems in the chairman 's own words , somewhat too high . <p> But , let 's come back to ' good ideas ' . My view is that regurgitating feel good press releases from any airline without trying to look at the hows and whys does Qantas no good . The answers as to what will do good for Qantas will not come from hacks like me . The very idea that investors and employees should look to the media for some sort of salvation song sheet is absurd . The role of the media ought to be to ask questions , and create a discussion where government and business and can find a space in which to contribute to possible solutions . <p> The thing that most fills me with dismay in this country is short-term thinking . It will not bring us success in the Asia-Pacific , nor restore any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very good question , but it is asked of the wrong person if asked of a reporter . It needs to be asked of ..... Australia . By all of us . When we work hard enough , and are demanding enough , our brands and enterprises will either lift their game , or they will fail . <p> What we need to do is get Qantas to lift its game . And stop being winging losers , supported by apologists . After that happens , we will start to find the answers . <p> blockquotewhy do they both trying to sell the same service for more than half again as much ? /blockquote <p> That 's simply because reservation systems show all fare types available for sale . Lower than predicted demand means the cheap one is displaying as available , but the most expensive ones will always display . No-one expects anyone to buy them if the conditions are n't too different . Qantas is no different to anyone else in this regard . Admittedly it looks a bit funny , but ever was it thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen is that business class is not selling as well as they predicted . <p> I 'm not sure why you 're so anti the BA Bangkok connection either : it 's not much longer , and some people even prefer BA to Qantas . Flying all the way on Qantas is not quite as highly valued as you seem to assume and lots of people could n't care less about the BA change at Bangkok . Qantas left the one-stop Bangkok route because it did n't make money . They 've leased the Heathrow slots to BA and can get them back again if demand picks up . No biggie . <p> Regarding Qantas flying to Dubai and on to Europe : you 're naive if you think Emirates would allow this in practical terms . You 'd be stuck at a standoff bay for years , and would conveniently be denied a reasonable connection .

" now I , m thinking I might just get me one of those , then I opened the page ..... Fabulous cars , I 'm just a $100K short . <p> Des KSA <p> Wow , that 's such a radical departure from the previous Boxster , looks totally different . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra $50K obscene price gouging at its best <p> F1MotoGP <p> Why we pay more ... because <p> Mercedes-Benz Australia spokesman David McCarthy says there are crucial differences between the two markets and that flows onto the retail prices . <p> " Basically , we pay more tax , " he says . " There is GST , luxury-car tax and import tax on each car . <p> " That 's the starting point . Australia is a tiny market -- we have a one-million a year vehicle market , the US is about 13 million . You get a discount for buying in volume . <p> " Australia is a small market but it is geographically huge and needs similar levels of personnel and nationwide support and service as the US . <p> " Then we have specific emission and design regulations which Mercedes-Benz at the factory has to engineer and comply . We , Mercedes-Benz Australia , pays for that -- not Mercedes in Germany . So that gets passed on to the customer . <p> " Our geographical isolation means we carry cars on shipping routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The other important factor is model range . We sell everything from a Smart Fortwo to a 140-tonne truck and everything -- cars , vans , trucks -- in between . <p> " The US has a much smaller model range . For example , they have no four-cylinder engine versions available in the C-Class and E-Class and have no A-Class or B-Class models . " <p> The taxes argument is weak because if you compare cars exempt from LCT , the discrepancy is still there ( doubling of pricing ) . <p> I can see how things can get 50% more expensive but more than double is just taking the piss . <p> Rick <p> I 'm going to try real hard not to sound like a tosser here , but I could just about stretch it to buy a Boxster S ( wife would n't be impressed ) . Point is , I just ca n't get my head around the price . I know the " we pay too much " argument has been done to death but even comparing to UK prices , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most often cited , a fully optioned Boxster S comes to around GBP55K ( inc 20% VAT driveaway ) , or around AUD88K ! ! Equivalent spec here is going to be $150K plus . <p> Now i 've heard all of the " explanations " that the manufacturers have come up with to explain the difference and I say BS to most of them -- the only one that explains most of the difference is " that 's what the market will pay in Oz " . Well that 's OK , I can accept that in a free market economy , but the thing is , none of them will actually come out &amp; say that straight out . In the end , this particular punter ( and I suspect many others ) can also say " not worth it thanks " . <p> At $90K , $100K or maybe even $110K driveaway , i 'd already have my deposit down ..... <p> Also , what 's with the $3K , $4K or even $5K " dealer delivery " we pay here . The equivalent " destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of dollars/pounds tops ? Are we that chilled about being shafted over here ? <p> Golfschwein <p> Our delivery charges are offensive . Three of my cars in the last twelve years have been brand new and in each instance I instructed the dealer to ' do something ' with the delivery fee . Sure , it might be massaged onto the trade or into the finance rate or whatever ( on one occasion , it was agreed that the car will be licensed as a demo ) , and that 's fine . After all , the deal is done when everyone 's happy . <p> Imo <p> Look at it this way . The cheapest ferrari is about 5 times the price . For that you get worse build quality &amp; reliability &amp; probably no better than 15 % better acceleration ... &amp; when you go to sell it you 'll lose a whole lot more . Hope that 's put it into perspective for you . <p> Pinkieponk <p> carmy 1/5 the price , and more reliable . got you there <p> Sumpguard <p> I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a porsche to a camry is not even in the same ballpark ! <p> Butch <p> Down to earth buddy , love it . Wish others were as honest as you and had their feet on the ground . <p> Pauly <p> Hang On Porche Australia ... <p> The Aussie dollar has been above the US Dollar for over a year now . There is NO excuse to INCREASE the price of an all new model . <p> Sure with the older model you can get away with it , but this is an all new model and our dollar has been above the US Dollar for quite a long time now . <p> Rip Off for what it is . <p> Im sure it will sell regardless . Too many people in this country with too much money to spend .... wankers ... <p> Thommo <p> There 's no excuse but there are very good reasons why it costs fractionally more . How about that it 's all new with the newest tech &amp; better drive trains .... should we pay more for that or less ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> F1MotoGP <p> A strong dollar is typically great news for importers but the local subsidiaries of the German luxury car brands say currency rates are established up to a year in advance to keep prices stable . <p> " We do hedge to protect against currency movements going both ways , " says BMW Australia head of corporate communications , Piers Scott . " We do n't put prices up when the currency is weak and neither do we respond immediately by putting prices down when the currency is strong . We have to hedge against these kinds of fluctuations for the customers ' benefit so new owners do n't see their car discounted just months later . As a manufacturer , we 're not actually in a position to capitalise on a strong Aussie dollar -- at least not in the short term . " <p> Cool car at the UK or USA prices .. You have to be totally loaded or plain dopey to get one of these at those prices . Toyota 86 or Subaru BRZ at a fraction of the price without just a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than posers and money voulchers that they attract <p> http : //www.caradvice.com.au Jez Spinks <p> There 's no doubt car buyers get an extremely rough deal in Australia . The government , however , must take a chunk of the blame for singling out motor vehicles with the Luxury Car Tax that adds 33 per cent to a car maker 's list price when it costs in excess of $57,466 . Cheekily , that tax is also placed on the figure including another of its taxes -- the GST . There 's no equivalent tax for yachts , for example . As for the dollar , car makers essentially hedge with their prices so they do n't have to keep chopping and changing in times of fluctuating currencies . There 's a fair point there , though there 's no doubt the manufacturers of more expensive cars could reduce starting prices , whether that 's through less equipment or other means . The luxury brands , including Porsche , argue that Australian buyers want highly specified vehicles , while their counterparts in Europe , America and the UK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a more competitive starting price . It 's why in the UK , for example , that a BMW 3-Series has been a best-seller in the medium-size market , out-performing the likes of the Ford Mondeo . So , yes , the Boxster is more expensive than in most other countries ; but relative to all other cars sold here , it 's normal . And the Boxster S , for example , is a few grand cheaper than an Audi TT RS . Unfortunately , neither the government nor the car makers will be in a rush to change the scenario when luxury car sales in Australia continue to increase . We can only hope that common sense and fairness prevail one day . <p> Chucky <p> Just a few points Jez . <p> Firstly , luxury car tax is an annoyance , but even without it cars would still be ridiculously expensive in this country . On the base model boxter mentioned in the article , there is about $11,500 in luxury tax . By the way , this tax is not calculated on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian models are usually better specced , if you added the missing options onto a UK model it would still be far cheaper than what you pay here . <p> And finally , a new model is an opportunity to reduce the price , but I have noticed that Porsche is one of the worst offenders when it comes to setting prices . Common sense dictates that if they drop their prices then they will get more sales ( and exponentially so rather than just in proportion to the price drop ) . <p> Chucky <p> I also want to add that by manufacturers putting a ridiculous premium on cars that are sold here , they are minimising their profits in Australia and maximising the profits in their home countries . This is called transfer pricing which is an illegal practice that should be cracked down on , as it reduces the amount of tax they pay in Australia . <p> I wo n't hold my breath for the government to do anything about it though as they are more interested in protecting our local car manufacturers . <p> Pinkieponk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mistake with the 996 911. will only last one seriesI hope <p> Brett <p> get over the lights , they 're great . finally a boxster that looks different from the front than a 911 , and possibly even better . Oh and I drive a 996 911 , the only people who still go about the lights , are non Porsche drivers and old 911 owners trying to validate their slower cars . When you drive a 911 ( any vintage ) you do n't give a xxxx about the lights ! <p> O123 <p> Honda jazz is cheaper here than in the USA =p , the luxury brands have a much bigger " rip off " margin than the mainstream cars <p> Nick <p> Basicly Tax is a non issue if Boxter sold at UK Price , you would be paying more tax in UK than in Australia , its simply price gouging plain and simple , the rest is just blatant price gouging , anyone who does not believe this show me the figures . The rest of it is complete and utter bunkum . Boxters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closser to the coast in Australia , than in either UK or USA . If you believe mr McCarthy your a fool .

This is the 3rd Ultimate triathlon event and it looks like Batemans Bay could evolve in to another ' Huskisson ' triathlon weekend . Batemans Bay is perfectly suited to a big triathlon weekend . This weekend was host to an ocean swim , 5km fun run , enticer triathlon and a sprint triathlon to support the major race of the weekend . <p> The sprint triathlon was won by Per Wengel who is the current Swedish national ITU triathlon champion and fellow Swedish triathlete Linnea Holmertz who won the women 's race . Once again we had Mick Maroney right up there with a 3rd overall placing just behind Nuru Somi from the ACT . Somi had a faster swim time than Per , rode almost the same time but it was Per 's 15:49 5km run that was the difference . <p> The bike courses at Batemans Bay are not fast and the times are always slower than a Kurnell type course . <p> Linnea Holmertz was the overall female winner in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3rd respectively . Both Holmertz and Wengel used this race as a hit out before they race in the Sydney ITU elite race in two weeks . <p> The main race of the weekend was the Ultimate Triathlon . Elite Energy have launched this new distance format in Australia to give triathletes a longer and more challenging race without the recovery needed from running a 42.2km run . The 2km/120km/20km format sees triathletes extending themselves more than they would over a half iron distance race . Also these Ultimate triathlons have been placed to give triathletes a hit out before a major iron distance triathlon . <p> Sam Appleton at Huskisson in Feb after finishing 3rd in the Long Course <p> Sam Appleton and Michelle Wu won the inaugural titles and will now go in to the record books with the race records against their names .

Out on to the run and Whistler got out on to the run course ahead of Appleton with wall heading out on to the run about four minutes down . Appleton hunted Whistler down and caught and passed him well before the halfway mark .

@@837230 Defence contracts <p> In BAE Systems Australia Ltd v Cubic Defence New Zealand Ltd 2011 FCA 1434 , the Federal Court was required to consider whether a purported ' termination for convenience ' of only part of a Subcontract was valid . The Court also considered whether or not certain implied terms could be excluded by the use of an ' entire agreement ' clause . <h> Background <p> The respondent , a defence contractor , entered into a contract ( the Prime Contract ) with the Department of Defence for the supply , operation , support and maintenance of certain information and simulation systems for a training program . It subsequently entered into a contract with the applicant ( the Subcontract ) for the provision of supplies and support services in relation to the program . <p> Both contracts provided for works relating to the program to be divided into two phases : an acquisition phase , which had already been completed , and an ' operate and support/manage ' ( OSM ) phase , which was ongoing . <p> The respondent and the Commonwealth entered into discussions with a view to separating the two phases so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of an Australian Standard for Defence Contracting ( ASDENFCON ) template.The applicant and the respondent began concurrent negotiations about a new flow-down version of the Subcontract to reflect the changes . However , there was disagreement between the parties and the negotiations subsequently broke down . <p> In late October 2011 , the respondent notified the applicant that the Commonwealth had " terminated for convenience that portion of the Prime Contract ... that includes all Operations Support and Maintenance ( O/S&amp;M ) requirements " and purporting to terminate for convenience " all of the corresponding O/S&amp;M requirements " in the Subcontract . in doing so , the respondent relied on clause 12.3.1 in the Subcontract which provided that it may " terminate the contract or reduce the scope of the contract by notifying the Subcontractor in writing " in certain circumstances , including where it had " received a corresponding notice to that effect from the Commonwealth . " <p> When asked by the applicant to provide evidence of a corresponding notice by the Commonwealth , the respondent provided the applicant with a copy of a contract change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Commonwealth . The deed stated that its purpose was to " reduce the scope " of the Prime Contract and to reflect the parties ' intentions that the OSM requirements be deleted from it and " form the basis of a separate performance based ASDENFCON contract " . <p> The applicant issued proceedings in the Federal Court claiming a declaration that the respondent 's notice purporting to terminate the Subcontract for convenience was unlawful and invalid and that the respondent was therefore in breach of the Subcontract . <p> The applicant 's case relied on two arguments , one based on an alleged breach of express terms in the Subcontract and one based on a breach of certain implied terms . Under the former , it was argued that the respondent was only entitled to rely on clause 12.3.1 to terminate the Subcontract for convenience where it had received a corresponding notice to the same effect from the Commonwealth but that it had not received such a notice . Instead , the applicant claimed that the deed and the new ASDENFCON contract should be characterised as either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a varied form of the contract " . <p> The applicant further claimed that certain terms were implied into the Subcontract , which had been breached by the respondent . These included implied terms that neither party would by its own motion prevent the performance of the Subcontract , that neither party would do anything to destroy the efficacy of the bargain and that each party would do all things to enable the other to have the benefit of the Subcontract . <h> Judgment <p> With respect to the applicant 's first argument , the court considered the construction of the termination for convenience clause in the Subcontract . it found that the clause entitled the respondent to either terminate for its convenience or , alternatively , reduce the scope of the Subcontract but that this power " was conditional on the respondent receiving a corresponding notice to that effect from the Commonwealth " ( at 40 ) . The question for The Court was whether the deed between the respondent and the Commonwealth could be characterised as being a corresponding notice of termination . <p> The Court reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth giving rise to it in light of the requirements of the clause . It was held that while the clause referred to " notifying the Subcontractor in writing " , no specific form for that notification was required and , as a result , " a corresponding notice from the Commonwealth may be constituted by a deed to which the recipient of the notice is a party " ( at 39 ) . <p> In characterising the deed , the Court considered both the written provisions of the deed and the substance of what was effected by it . Importantly , Besanko J noted that : <p> " ... the Deed records in writing an act the Commonwealth considered that it was taking . Taking the words at face value , the Commonwealth considered that it was acting under Clause 12.3.1 of the Prime Contract to reduce the scope of the Prime Contract ... " ( at 44 ) . <p> Turning to the substance of what was effected by the Deed , the Court considered whether or not it could be characterised as a termination , variation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had submitted that , while couched in terms of Clause 12.3.1 , the substance of the deed was in fact to simply vary the terms of the Prime Contract which meant that it could not be relied upon by the respondent . <p> The Court referred to previous authorities in Morris v Baron &amp; Co 1918 AC 1 and Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan 's Merchandise ( Victoria ) Pty Ltd ( 1957 ) 98 CLR 93 regarding the distinction between Variation and Rescission . Applying the reasoning from these authorities , The Court held that the Deed had effected a reduction in scope of the Prime Contract rather than a variation of its terms as any new obligations between the parties were now dealt with in a " new free-standing contract " . This was so even though minimal substantive obligations remained under the Subcontract as " a reduction to nil is nevertheless a reduction in the scope of the contract " ( at 51 ) . <p> As a result , despite not receiving a formal notice from the Commonwealth and there being no " termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notice to the applicant were held to be consistent with clause 12.3.1 as the Clause also covered reductions in scope . <p> In relation to the applicant 's implied terms argument , the Court noted that the Subcontract contained an ' entire agreement ' clause , which provided that the Subcontract document was " an exclusive statement of the parties ' contractual obligations " . referring to the High Court decision of Hart v Macdonald ( 1910 ) 10 CLR 417 , which had held that an entire agreement clause did not preclude the implication of a term unless there were express words to that end , the Court found that the relevant clause did not go far enough to exclude the implied terms . <p> Ultimately , the Court held that the respondent had not breached the implied terms pleaded by the applicant because : ( 1 ) there was no evidence that the respondent had any option other than to enter into the Deed and the new ASDENFCON contract with the Commonwealth , ( 2 ) the failed negotiations meant that the benefit of the new ASDENFCON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply varying the terms of the Subcontract and ( 3 ) any terms of the Subcontract , including implied terms , were qualified by the rights and obligations under the ' termination for convenience ' clause . <h> Implications <p> The decision is of interest for government contractors who look to replicate or insert " back-to-back " provisions in their Subcontracts because it provides a good example of how Courts will interpret such provisions . interestingly , the Court appears to have taken a practical approach to the requirement for corresponding notices under flowdown ' termination for convenience ' clauses . It appears that the requirement of corresponding notification in writing will not necessarily require a formal notice unless there are express words stating this . Furthermore , it appears that even though notification provided to a Subcontractor is expressed incorrectly , for example as a termination when it is in fact simply a reduction in scope , this will not be invalid provided that the substance of what was intended in the notice is covered by the relevant clause . <p> The case is also relevant in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not preclude the implication of terms unless those terms are explicitly excluded . Contracting parties should be mindful of this fact and should ensure that if they wish to exclude implied terms such as the obligation not to undermine the efficacy of the contract or the duty of cooperation then they should do so expressly in the contract . <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter .

" He would just have been so full of ideas and who knows what things he would want to try next , " Norman tells IF Magazine . <p> Norman , now in his late-70s , says Walt would 've been just like him -- embracing the technology rather than dismissing it . <p> " Walt was enamoured with technology but looking back on it , it was really primitive in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with digital , it 's just expanded . Once you accept this technology , then instead of it being something that you feel is going to encroach on your artistic sensibility you realise , ' no , this is only going to enhance what I do and it 's actually going to open up more artistic opportunities ' . " <p> It 's been an amazing life for Norman -- the first African-American to work at the company that created such characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck . Growing up in Santa Barbara , California , he was constantly drawing as a child and loved both Disney and Warner Bros cartoons . <p> " I loved the idea of moving drawings , " the well-spoken and passionate Norman says . " When my mother and I went to the cinema we saw these drawings up on the screen -- I knew they were n't real but I did n't know what they were .

Approaching Disney when he was 17 but discovering he was a bit young , Norman attended the Art Centre College of Design before being hired by Walt two years later . <p> " It was a childhood dream come true . It was truly a wonderland , " Norman says of first seeing the massive empire . " There were very few books about Disney in those days -- hardly a thing , but whatever there was I dug up ...

He also did several comics , children 's books and story board work on shows and features including The Flintstones , Scooby Doo , The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Tigger Movie . <p> What sort of a man was the legendary Walt Disney ? <p> " He was a man who liked to control things , he was very much in charge , very much hands-on , " Norman begins . " He knew everything that was going on in his studio . The old-timers tell me that he would wander the hallways at night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night so he knew what everybody was doing at all times -- nothing escaped his eye . <p> " Some people called Walt Disney a workaholic , that he was obsessed with his studio but I would n't call him obsessive -- he loved what he did and he wanted it to be the best .

" <p> Even when in hospital towards the end , Norman explains , Walt was using the ceiling as a virtual map planning exactly where everything would be at Walt Disney World , including the animal park and rides . So it obviously came as a massive blow when the legend passed away in 1966 -- exactly 10 years after Norman joined the empire . <p> " We were in total disbelief , total shock , " Norman says of Walt 's passing after he lost his battle with lung cancer .

@@857237 <h> The pros and cons of telehealth for people in rural and remote areas <p> Canadian researchers recently investigated the use of telehealth in delivering a self management program for stroke survivors and carers . <p> The findings -- profiled below in the latest update from the Primary Health Care Research and Information Service ( PHC RIS ) -- will no doubt be of interest locally , given the increasing use of telehealth . <p> *** <p> Telehealth : the pros and cons <p> Rachel Katterl writes : <p> From the middle of last year , people in regional , rural and outer metropolitan areas were able to undertake consultations with a health care provider via live video . Known as telehealth consultations , this initiative aims to remove some of the access barriers to health care in Australia . <p> A recent Canadian study aimed to explore the question of whether telehealth consultations are comparable to face-to-face health care service delivery . <p> Canada , which has similar health challenges to Australia , also faces difficulties with delivering services to people living in rural and remote regions of the country . Telehealth services are one way of providing equitable access to health services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stroke ( MOST ) , which is a group-based self-management program for stroke survivors and their caregivers , has been shown to facilitate improved community integration and positive health behaviours after stroke . Researchers from Ontario explored the experiences of rural and remote patients undertaking this program using telehealth technology . <p> In interviews with the participants , the positives and negatives of telehealth consultations were consistent with findings in previous research projects . <p> Positives included the ability to access otherwise unavailable services , general satisfaction with the videoconference style of delivery , and decreased travel time and costs . Some individuals reported a greater feeling of connectedness with group members compared to telephone based services . <p> However , the authors noted : " ... given the opportunity , all the participants would have preferred face-to-face participation in their own community " . <p> This is due to MOST participants experiencing difficulties with subtle but important aspects of communication : body language , eye contact , gaze , gesture , and their ability to gauge and detect emotion . Audio lags also meant that some participants did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off " other participants . <p> The findings of this study are consistent with previous research on the topic of patient experience of telehealth consultations . <p> This study highlights a number of important points . <p> Firstly , the technical aspects of videoconferencing , particularly good internet connection speeds and reliable connections , are critical for telehealth consultations as this will avoid visual and auditory lags in the signal . Achieving a high level of picture resolution is important to ensure that the finer aspects of interpersonal communication , such as facial expression , are clear to participants . <p> Secondly , while telehealth consultations are an important aspect of improving access to care , they will not replace traditional face-to-face consultations . <p> The importance of rapport building and the ' therapeutic relationship ' should not be underestimated , and telehealth consultations may not always be appropriate . For example , for mental health issues , initial consultations may be undertaken face-to-face , with follow up consultations via telehealth means . <p> The eBulletin is designed to inform readers of recently published articles and reports , news items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants , scholarships and fellowships , PHC RIS products and services and relevant websites in the primary health care field .

It is widely known that the alliance tends to build over the first 5 sessions and that it develops right across the treatment period . For some people it will be enough , but for others , offering just one appointment in person will be nowhere near sufficient . My concern is for vulnerable people who are experiencing complex mental health issues , particularly in cases where that may not be obvious in a single face-to-face appointment . It would be a very difficult situation in cases where somone asks for treatment in person , is given an initial face-to-face assessment , and is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see is the notion that telehealth wont replace face-to-face treatment , but rather , is meant to expand access . That sounds fair enough in principle , but the difficulty lies with the delivery of face-to-face services in regional , rural and remote locations . If people living in such areas would prefer face-to-face treatment , then every effort should be made to make that available for their care , as is the case for their suburban counterparts . This raises the issue of PREFERENCE for treatment . When a patient is comfortable receiving treatment on-line there is no problem and one can therefore rightly say that equitable access has been expanded . However , where the patient really would prefer face-to-face treatment and has merely tolerated the fact that they had to settle on telehealth instead , we end up running the risk of selling people short on the basis that they live too far away from town . <p> People might say " it 's better than nothing " , but is that really true ?

@@857238 <h> Videogames and the Symphony : a review of the MSO 's Symphony of Legends <p> It was a joke , obviously , from Scott Kurtz , one of the three hosts for the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra 's Videogames Unplugged : Symphony of Legends concert last Thursday . Behind the joke , though , lay the sting of needing to justify this strange event , the collision of mass and niche cultures , of videogames and orchestras , of digital culture and elite musicians . <p> " Oh yeah , these instruments are photoshopped , " replied Kris Straub , another host for the evening . <p> For this brief moment early on in the programme , there was an admission of the uncertainty and interest that surrounded the idea of a symphony orchestra playing videogame music in concert . Why would a real orchestra want anything to do with games ? <p> Take for example , this curious 2010 essay in The Ageby Richard Mills , the artistic director for the West Australian Opera and consultant for Orchestra Victoria . In it , Mills places videogames and orchestras in direct opposition . For Mills , a videogame is " something ordinary , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modicum of application and training , " while " our theatres and halls deal in the currency of the extraordinary -- anybody who stands and delivers professionally on those stages has a remarkable talent , nurtured by years of training . " <p> That the MSO would chose videogame music as the subject of one of their regular Pops concerts is an encouraging sign that those in cultural institutions are more willing to look outside their closed walls , but it does not signify an end to the old suspicion between cultural forms . <p> Rather , based on the night itself -- a generally energetic and enjoyable concert -- it suggests that things are going to get weirder before they become more normal . <p> Maybe this is not a bad thing . Would you want a concert of videogame music to be unremarkable ? Perhaps not , but while the MSO event was generally enjoyable , it did contain more than a few moments of peculiarity . Chief among these was the extended series of performances from SoulCalibur V that ended the evening . <p> SoulCalibur V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inordinate amount of energy on bouncing breasts . Its fictionally-proportioned female characters are either clad in absurdist string bikinis or ' demure ' angelic costumes , both equally designed to titillate sexually immature minds . <p> It is ridiculous . It is leering . It was projected onto three enormous screens in front of 5,500 people and a world-class symphony orchestra . <p> The man in the row in front of me ( who I think was accompanying his young son , wearing a Mario hat ) burst into hysterics when SoulCalibur V came on screen . Two young women giggled uncomfortably behind me as the displayed sequences went on for five , ten , maybe fifteen minutes . I sank into my seat , furious with embarrassment . What was this ? <p> Photo credit : Lucas Dawson photography <p> This was clearly no regular MSO performance , though the professional playing and musicianship was as reliable as ever . In addition , three hosts had been flown over from the United States -- Wil Wheaton , an actor of Star Trek , Stand By Me and Toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of webcomic fame -- to introduce the pieces . " We 're really famous in America , " the hosts joked in their introduction . <p> As far as the music is concerned , it was , for the most part , a reliably good performance by the MSO and their guests , led by conductor Philip Chu . The Concordis Chamber Choir in particular performed excellently through a night of demanding choral work , coping well with the unusual vocal effects common to the music of videogames , from the faux-gregorian chant of Halo to the muscular grunts of Skyrim . The percussion section of the MSO also had an unusual responsibility for the evening , with the atypical , rhythm-heavy orchestration of scores like God of War and Uncharted lending a rarely granted spotlight to the section . <p> The programme itself was a pleasingly wide selection of videogame music , featuring many previously unperformed scores and very recent games . It is unusual in the classical world to get performances of even 15-year old pieces , so to hear excerpts from games like Uncharted 3 ( 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable . The artistic vision behind the night was , for most purposes , exemplary . <p> After interval , the MSO returned with Christopher Tin 's Grammy Award-winning " Baba Yetu " , from Civilization IV . The music was as exuberant as always , and the Concordis Chamber Choir did justice to Tin 's bouncy , energetic writing . However the somewhat slow tempo of the performance and the faint vocal soloists detracted from what could have otherwise been the standout performance of the night . <p> The venue of Plenary Hall at the Exhibition Centre was a fitting location for the concert , being a middle ground of sorts for the orchestra , as well as a regular performance spot for some of the orchestra 's more ' public ' performances . The familiarity of the orchestra with the space , however , means that the audio feedback that was an unwelcome feature for almost all of the performance was unforgivable . A low hum arrived early in the performance and gained in volume until it all but destroyed the subtlety and lightness of the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lullaby " from BioShock 2 . Sadly , it did not leave after the interval , as might be expected , and continued to be a nuisance , albeit in diminished form , for far too much of the evening . <p> Mixing issues were also a problem , with the percussion ( and for the music of Assassin 's Creed II , drum kit ) being too loud . Equally , setting the MSO to score a live battle of SoulCalibur V players was problematic -- the game 's own music blared across the MSO 's performance for part of the match , leaving the actual musicians onstage redundant in the face of amplified recordings . <p> An interesting feature of the performance , however , was the sheer number of premieres and new arrangements . As Andrew Pogson , the MSO 's assistant artistic administrator and the creative force behind the event noted in an interview before the night , videogame music is n't created to be performed in concert . Thus , entirely new suites and arrangements were created exclusively for the MSO , and the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gravity Rush , Starcraft II , Skyrim and SoulCalibur V. That the concert will surely constitute a large percentage of the MSO 's premiered works for the year ( let alone its late 20th and 21st century music ) is worth remarking on in itself . <p> The MSO has good track record of Pops concerts . But elements remain of an elite culture looking down its nose at the things it has to do in order to reach new audiences and create mainstream , tentpole events . Recall Clive James showboating around the stage at the MSO 's Cinema Paradiso night in 2006 , doing exaggerated impressions of the films the music was from to embarrassed titters from the audience . Or think of conductor Anthony Inglis ' pillorying of two youths who arrived late to the front row of the John Williams concert last year . <p> Indeed , if anyone in the audience was left wondering at what the musicians of the MSO thought of SoulCalibur and the other games on display , some gentle mocking of the music surfaced in the encore performance of Harry Gregson-Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gear Solid music is the style of Ennio Morricone without his knowing parody -- all absurd female choirs , guitars and military snare drums . In response to its bombast and earnestness , and the crowd 's enthusiasm , a Cellist theatrically spun his instrument like a double-bassist in a rockabilly band , while a violist adjacent responded by stretching in faux-bravado to match the ridiculousness of the music . <p> " Is this even a real orchestra ? " I am reminded of Kurtz 's joke from earlier in the night . Wheaton 's response to the question was telling . What better way to measure the authenticity of an orchestra in Melbourne , 2012 ? <p> " Oh , Philip , " he said , theatrically motioning to the conductor . " Would you please give us a little something from Beethoven ? " <p> It was a good night , but I agree there were some musical problems . The percussion in AC2 was definitely too loud , the vocalists in Baba Yetu underpowered and in the Skyrim theme the choir and the orchestra got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't notice the game music competing with the orchestra in the Soul Calibur match , but I 'm not particularly familiar with that score so maybe that 's why . I did like the concept of having a match played with a live orchestra accompanying it , though . <p> Always awesome to hear Ko Otani 's magnificent Shadows of the Colossus score , although it would 've been a nice contrast to have one of the less bombastic tracks . <p> Pity Journey had only just come out -- some of the themes from that would 've been lovely .

Before Casanova was around , Alessandro Stradella was one of the most notorious womanisers stirring up trouble and seducing the ladies of Venice . The lecherous Italian composer and all-round scoundrel left a path of destruction in his wake : after being caught out embezzling money from the Catholic Church , he fled the Vatican city ... But not before his numerous affairs with aristocratic women had made him some powerful enemies . <p> In 1677 he went to Venice , where Alvise Contarini , an influential nobleman , engaged Stradella as music tutor to his mistress , Agnese Van Uffele .

Ultimately , though , his indiscreet flings and licentious lifestyle got the better of him . He was stabbed again -- this time fatally -- by an unknown assailant in 1682 at the Piazza Banchi .

" Years later , in an autobiographical essay of 1947 , he admitted that he was " sex crazy " . <p> It 's most likely that the sexual satisfaction Grainger derived from punishment and pain stemmed from the harsh discipline he was subjected to as a child , at the hands of his formidable mother Rose . Theirs was an abnormally close relationship that has been the subject of speculation for decades : mother and son shared a bed until Grainger was 36 , and Rose referred to allegations of incest in her 1922 suicide note . <h> Franz Schubert ( 1797 -- 1828 ) <p> There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schubert sexuality -- musicologists just ca n't help themselves .

" Scholars have also suggested he may have contracted his syphilis from a male prostitute . <p> But evidence is scant , and with nothing conclusive one can only wonder at the chasm that might have existed between Schubert 's public and private life .

With Louis 's devout wife Madame de Maintenon breathing down his neck , he could no longer turn a blind eye to Lully 's scandals , the latest of which was so great that there was even a ditty going round : <p> " One day Cupid said to his mother , ' Why am I not wearing any clothes ?

With his young singers in tow , Gombert toured the cities of his employer 's empire .

" Certainly women of all ages seemed fascinated by him , and they attached themselves to him like ivy to a wall .

The Court did n't buy it , and found that the restraint clause was " relatively narrow " , was designed specifically to prevent employees after leaving the company from " exploiting relationships with clients in order to re-establish that client relationship in a different employment capacity " , and that this is an interest which an employer is entitled to protect . <h> Does this mean that courts are simply more willing to enforce restraints ?

@@902235 <h> 10 steps to preparing the budget that REALLY matters -- your own <p> Wednesday , 09 May 2012 23:33 <p> Leon Gettler <p> Share <p> Creating a business budget is every bit as challenging as the work that has gone into the federal budget . <p> Look over the last few federal budgets ; some have been massively inaccurate with forecasts . This year 's federal budget surplus depends on GDP growth of 3.25% for 2012-13 . That 's almost one percentage point higher than the growth rate last calendar year . <p> It also hinges on only a slight rise in the unemployment rate at a time of daily reports about companies closing down and job losses . It has also forecast a modest fall in the terms of trade , which in recent years have been near record highs . There are no guarantees . <p> The same uncertainty goes for business budgets and for good reason too . With the Australian dollar , the impact of global markets , business uncertainty and rising insolvencies in the non-resources sector of the economy , a business budget like the federal budget can be a bit of a crap shoot . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forecast . The actuals are different and there might be times when budget figures are way off target . The mark of a good budget is how close it gets to the actuals . <p> That said ; every business needs a budget . John Downes , who runs the consultancy firm Acorro , puts it bluntly . " You would be delinquent as a CEO or business owner starting the year without a budget , ' ' Downes says . <p> " It 's not negotiable . It 's not a question of whether you should or not . ' ' <p> So , in the face of all this volatility , how do you prepare a budget that matters for your business ? Here are 10 tips . <h> 1 . Have a business plan first : the budget is part of that plan <p> No small business owner can afford not to have a plan in these credit-constrained times . <p> The plan helps clarify whether the business is headed in the right direction ; whether the market is growing as fast as the business owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right staff ; and whether the margins are correct and what the competition is doing . <p> Mark Allsop , a partner at Deloitte Private , says the budget needs to be part of that process . " Budgeting should be part of an annual business planning cycle , ' ' Allsop says . <p> " Business planning considers more than just financials . Financials are an outcome . <p> " If you do a robust business plan , you are looking at your market place and how that might change and that will have some financial impact that will be reflected in the budget . <p> " You are looking at your staffing and skills profile and how that may change and that will have an outcome that is also represented financially in the budget . <p> " And you will look at all of your capital requirements , your trucks , your cars , your printers , your computers and the outcomes of that investigation will have a financial outcome that gets impacted in your budget . <p> " The financial things to my mind are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right people <p> The chief executive officer or managing director - along with the chief financial officer , financial controller , head accountant or other chief number cruncher - are the ones in charge . The buck stops with them . <p> But that 's a minimum . Consultant Joel Barolsky says a budget needs to be a team effort . If , for example , the company is looking to invest in a particular piece of equipment , it would have to call in the plant manager . And so it goes . <p> " With a variety of inputs on the revenue side , you would need to get the marketing and sales people involved to challenge the assumptions around revenue and sales , ' ' Barolsky says . <p> " You would be getting your HR people involved around resource planning . Operational people might have key capital requirements or key strategy initiatives . <p> " It is very much a team approach and should be run that way . Finance people ca n't do it in isolation . It really needs to be a collaborative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Change Factory , says things become dysfunctional when they are not done by the team . <p> " You do n't want all the department heads saying , ' What does that mean for us ? ' when you give the budget at the end of the budget session . <p> " You are starting well behind the eight ball when people are trying to work out what the budget means to them . They have to know at the end of the budget session what it means for them because they helped build it . " <p> Downes says the team needs to express their concerns freely . <p> " Sometimes you will see management without challenge try to deliver a magic number without anyone actually challenging as to whether it 's steep enough or whether it 's achievable , " he says . <p> " Being realistic and achievable is the most critical part of the budgeting process . " <h> 3 . Time frame <p> Preparing a budget takes time . Most experts , however , warn you should n't overdo it . Downes says spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . <p> " For a small to medium enterprise , if you are spending eight weeks on it , there 's an awful lot of navel gazing going on and not a lot of delivering the business , " he says . <p> " If you are spending more than four to five weeks on the process then - unless you are doing some new-fangled data analysis of every customer known to man - I think four or so weeks is more than enough to do it . It 's not rocket science . " <p> Allsop says two weeks is sufficient for SMEs : " A couple of weeks would be enough and that 's not a full-time process . " <h> 4 . Go on a retreat as part of the preparation <p> Dwyer recommends heading off for a few days with key people to talk about what needs to go in the budget . Taking it outside of work creates a space for fuller discussion . <p> " You go away for two or three days with someone who has done all the analysis on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's projected in the spread sheet , ' ' Dwyer says . <p> " So you spend the first day talking about blue sky . What can we do with our business strategy to improve our bottom line ? You allow people to have full rein . And you have someone there who can do all the number crunching and get an idea of the impact . <p> " One the second day , that 's when reality bites . That 's when you say here are all the good things we can do but here are our limitations . <p> " We can increase our staff numbers by more than this , we ca n't increase our costs by more than that , the federal budget might decrease our revenue by such an amount and so on . <p> " The idea of doing this is it gets people thinking about what 's possible and what can be achieved .

@@902236 <h> The University of Life - now open for all young Australians <p> In the last year , there has been strong bipartisan and community-wide support for a very significant upgrade in mental health services for young people in this country . While this is welcome , it begs the question : why are our young people in need of such services , and why at such unprecedented scales ? <p> One contributing factor is the impact on young people of having to increasingly stay at home and/or remain reliant on the resources of their family , often into their late twenties . New neuroscience research from Berkeley and Cornell Universities on the teenage brain is providing powerful and disturbing evidence that extended youth dependency in developed countries is causing havoc with teenage brain development , contributing to the need for increased psychological and psychiatric interventions . <p> Among the reasons for this extended dependency is that young people have to engage in tertiary education rather than paid work ; the time when formal education ceased at the end of high school is long past for most young people . While this has resulted in a generation of young people who are intellectually more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , fewer skills learned from taking risks and , consequently , lower levels of emotional resilience . <p> Advertisement <p> A further factor that affects the mental wellbeing of our young people is the shockingly poor pathways for progressing from dependence to independence . For most young Australians , the rite of passage from youth to adulthood consists of a ticket to schoolies , a slab of beer and a set of car keys . This is pathetic . The weaknesses of these rites of passage are further evidenced by the very high , extraordinarily inefficient , drop-out rates of first year university students , which can be as high as 40% . What we need are rites of passage that are meaningful , significant and respectful of young people . <p> While Australia is doing well economically from digging stuff from the ground and flogging it furiously , the resource sector will only ever be a minor employer . Australia 's future depends on having workers who can engage internationally , and especially in Asia . Yet we enter what is being dubbed the " Asian Century " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having participated in any form of Asian studies . This level of ignorance is absurd for a country that is actually located in Asia and whose economic future depends so heavily on engagement with its neighbours . <p> The picture that emerges is of a generation whose dependence is increasingly extended , who are given poor processes for transition to adulthood and who have troubling mental health concerns , all within a context of being unprepared for this " Asian Century " . And this through no fault of their own . <p> The Foundation for Young Australians ( FYA ) has just launched Young People Without Borders , a bold and ambitious initiative that seeks to enable young people to respond to these issues in a positive and proactive way . <p> Young People Without Borders has been a long time coming . For decades , political leaders of all persuasions such as Tony Abbott and Kevin Rudd ; public intellectuals such as Professor Hugh White from ANU , Dr Martin Seligman and Justice Michael Kirby in his review of CHOGM ; as well as events like the 20/20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthcorps ' type programs , in which young people are encouraged to volunteer and ' give back ' . <p> Young People Without Borders is a ' youthcorps ' that builds on existing initiatives , rather than reinventing wheels . It brings together a large number of existing social purpose organisations and volunteering programs , including The Smith Family , Life Without Barriers , Conservation Volunteers , the National Indigenous Youth Leadership Academy , Lattitude Global Volunteering and many others . Young People Without Borders is a banner and a vehicle for existing organisations to achieve collaborative impact in relation to youth volunteering and engagement in social change . <p> Advertisement <p> Until now , some young people , most from privileged backgrounds , have taken a ' gap year ' before commencing tertiary studies - Princes William and Harry being no exceptions . Young People Without Borders builds on this momentum by transforming the notion of a ' gap year ' , extending it in several ways . <p> Firstly , the ' gap year ' has been renamed a ' Start Year ' , since it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when young people can stand on their own feet and engage with the world on their own terms . It is the start of their transition from school-age dependent to contributing adult . <p> Secondly , rather than filling a ' gap ' , Young People Without Borders is about creating a profoundly meaningful and hugely significant year in the life of a young person , where they undertake organised and supported volunteer placements for up to 12 months . Placements include teaching English , teaching sport , assisting communities and environmental work . Placements are offered both within Australia and , as a priority , the Asian region . 
@@902237 Investing : How to Value a Business , Not a Stock <p> Today we take up the challenge of the art of stock valuation in a world of monetary madness . We 're already a few years into what 's probably going to be a prolonged bear market . As often happens in bear markets , the general consensus is that the ' rules have changed ' . Long term investing -- and value investing -- apparently do n't work any more . You need to be nimble and trade in and out of markets ... ride the momentum ... ride the Fed 's liquidity wave . <p> Maybe that will work for some , but for the vast majority it will end in tears . Trying to second guess the short term moves in the market is a game for pros ... and even then it reduces many of them to a nervous wreck after a few years . With increased central planning across the world 's economy , second guessing the timing of the moves of power hungry central bankers and politicians is a tough ask . <h> Investing in the Value of a Business <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic premise starts with the fact that you 're investing in a business ... not a stock price . While the stock price responds to a hundred different things -- both real and imagined -- on a daily basis , the value of a business changes far less rapidly . <p> The value investor thinks in terms of an operating business , not a stock price . <p> The Financial and the Real Economy <p> Before we move on to the art of valuing a business , we want to address the connection between the financial and the real economy . The financial part of the economy , beginning with central banks and then commercial banks , creates money and credit , which flow like tentacles out through the real economy ( operating businesses that employ people ) . <p> In a normal , functioning economy , newly created credit increases the money supply . If it flows smoothly , it increases ( in aggregate ) revenues , wages , profits , taxes etc . Companies , by offering products or services that people want , capture some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The longer a credit boom lasts , the more a company benefits . <p> This is what happened in the lead up to the 2007 credit bust . Global credit growth was out of control . Many companies were making hay , and analysts thought the boom would go on forever . They believed credit would keep increasing and company profits would keep growing at healthy rates . <p> In 2007 , the global credit bubble burst . Thanks to central banks , the supply of credit remains abundant . But demand , having been brought forward by prolonged low interest rates , is weak . No one wants more debt . Housing booms -- and subsequent busts -- all over the developed world helped to diminish demand for more household credit . And while banks still lend to the ' real economy ' they do so at high rates . <p> So the flow of credit has slowed . This means revenues , wages , profits and taxes will not grow anywhere near the rates you were accustomed to in the credit boom era . And it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That explanation is all in the ' aggregate ' . The ' aggregate ' works for economists trying to fit a complex world into a model , but it masks reality . The reality is that there are winners and losers in credit booms and busts . And obviously in a credit depression there are many more losers . <p> So what does this mean for company valuation ? In very basic terms it means you can expect the market to trade on a price to earnings ratio closer to 10 or 12 times rather than the often quoted ' normal ' level of 14 to 15 times . In other words , for a given level of earnings the market will trade 20-30% lower than ' normal ' because of low growth expectations . This is how a bear market works . <p> But when looking at individual securities , valuation is not as simple as picking stocks with low price -- to -- earnings ratios and high dividend yields ... or stocks trading at a discount to book value . Many cheap stocks deserve to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you really look into it , they might not be cheap at all . <h> Value Investing the Warren Buffet Way <p> This is where Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have probably made the greatest contribution to value investing since Ben Graham . Through the many years of writing annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders , they have provided value investors with a logical framework to calculate the intrinsic value of a business . <p> Armed with this knowledge and Ben Graham 's concepts of Mr Market ( the bloke who turns up every day and offers you a price -- completely unrelated to the value of the company -- for your shares ) and a Margin of Safety , Buffett and Munger have compounded their way to astronomical wealth . <p> So how do they go about valuing a business ? They look at just a few things . The return on equity ( ROE ) that the business generates , the equity value of the business , and the discount rate , or required rate of return . If you have these variables you can basically value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's look at each of these things in turn . The equity value of a business is the capital injected into the business by its owners . You can find the equity amount of any listed company by looking at the bottom of a balance sheet . The equity is what 's left over after you deduct liabilities from assets . This is also known as ' book value ' . <p> Importantly , the equity is what you as a shareholder buy when you purchase a company 's shares . You are buying a small portion of the company 's equity -- hence the term equity market . <p> Once you know the equity value of the business , you need to know how profitable it is . That is , you want to know what the return on that equity is . There are a few ways of calculating this , but to keep it simple it 's just net profit divided by the equity value . <p> Now the discount rate or required rate of return comes into play . This might sound a bit arcane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance and company valuation . It 's the interest rate used to ' discount ' a company 's future cashflows or profits back to a present value . <p> In practical terms , it 's the interest rate you require to invest in a company or asset . If you demand a high rate of return , you must pay a very low price to achieve that return . If you 're happy with a low rate of return you implicitly accept paying a higher price . <p> Most investors do n't understand this relationship . That 's why ' buying high ' always generates a poor long term return . Buying low implicitly says you have a high required rate of return . <p> Now let 's put it all together . If a company 's ROE is 50% and your discount rate is 10% , you can pay up to five times the company 's equity ( or book ) value to achieve your required rate of return ( 50/10 ) . <p> So in this case the company 's intrinsic value is 5x book value . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicitly accepting a return of 5% from the investment . If the market value is 2.5x book , then you 're implicitly accepting a 20% return on your investment . In the words of Ben Graham , at this price you 'd be buying with a ' margin of safety ' . <p> There are a few things to note though . This example assumes the company pays out all earnings as dividends . The calculation is a little different for companies that retain ( and therefore compound ) earnings . It also assumes the company can sustain a 50% ROE . Not many companies can do that . <p> That 's why Buffett buys stocks that have extremely reliable earnings . It means that the ROE variable wo n't change too much and his estimate of intrinsic value will be sound . Changes in a company 's ROE have a big impact on value . <p> The other thing to note is that the required rate of return has nothing to do with the stock market . It 's the return the business will generate for you over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the long term the market should deliver the same return as the business . But in the short term -- as you know -- the market can do anything . <p> Greg Canavan is the Managing Editor of The Daily Reckoning and is the foremost authority for retail investors on value investing in Australia .

" If we get our product in people 's mouths , they like it , " Creswell explains . <p> One of the best ways to get it into their mouths has been on airlines . Her research shows that 7 per cent of Carman 's customers buy the products because they 've tried it on airlines -- both Qantas and Virgin provide Carman 's products as on-board snacks . <p> But her biggest sales come from supermarkets -- Coles and Woolworths account for 75 per cent of sales .

" There are always some people who want to bag their industry . I 'm a huge backer of supermarkets . " <p> However , other food manufacturers are not as complimentary about the supermarket scene . The acting chief executive of the Australian Food and Grocery Council , Geoffrey Annison , says food manufacturers are under many of the same pressures as other industries -- rising input costs , the high dollar and concern about the carbon tax . But unique to the food manufacturing industry is the impact of supermarket discounting and the growing market share of private labels . <p> A report by the council , 2020 : Industry at a Crossroads , calls for a federal government policy blueprint including tax incentives for investment and a cap on the market dominance of the big-two supermarkets . Without such policy action , the report estimates that the number of people employed by the industry will shrink from the current 312,000 to 180,000 by 2020 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for big handouts , unlike other manufacturing sectors but we 're scratching our heads : how is it that car manufacturing is considered a strategic industry by the government but food manufacturing is n't ? " Annison says . <p> " We want a deliberate policy focus , we 're not after handouts . We 're calling on the government to provide us with the policy settings that will assist us to compete in global markets . " <p> Many food manufacturers are surprised by how quickly private label products have come to dominate the grocery market . Analyst Nielsen , in a report produced in November last year , found that shoppers were spending 73 per cent more on private label goods than they were five years earlier . <p> Supermarket private label goods have grown in value almost three times faster than branded products during the past five years , Nielsen reports , gaining a market share of 25 per cent . It predicts private label goods will exceed 40 per cent of grocery spending in Australia by 2015 . <p> Existing food manufacturers are n't happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the supermarkets ' own brands . <p> In January , United States-based food manufacturing giant HJ Heinz closed its tomato sauce manufacturing plant in Girgarre , northern Victoria , with a loss of 146 jobs . The plant has been relocated to New Zealand . The decision was announced in 2011 as part of a global review of Heinz 's manufacturing operations but in an extraordinary outburst , Heinz chief executive William Johnson placed the blame at the feet of the supermarkets . <p> But Creswell argues that manufacturers should have been more awake to the potential of private labels : in Britain , private label products have a 42 per cent share of the grocery market . <p> " Some businesses are n't being realistic about the current situation . Everyone knew the push of private labels was coming but a lot of manufacturers did nothing about it -- they presumed private labels were not going to do well , " she says . <p> Like it or not , for the $108 billion food and grocery manufacturing sector , the stark reality is that Coles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , many branded manufacturers are adjusting their models to comply with that reality -- even if it means contract manufacturing private label brands that will compete with their own . <p> Listed NSW cheesemaker Bega Cheese , for example , has struck an agreement with Coles to manufacture and package the entire range of Coles-branded cheese products . The five-year contract will add 19,000 tonnes of cheese production to the company 's annual output . <p> Fruit and vegetable processor SPC Ardmona has signalled its intention to go down the same path . The company has felt the pressure of the strong Australian dollar , cheap imported packaged fruit and vegetable products and private label competition . The high dollar has been particularly devastating , resulting in exports falling from 30 per cent to 5 per cent of its output since 2005 . <p> Last year , SPC Ardmona , which is owned by listed food and beverage giant Coca-Cola Amatil , closed one of its three manufacturing plants in Victoria 's fruit-growing hub in the Goulburn Valley . Managing director Vince Pinneri says the key to " turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new ranges of its branded fruit and vegetable snacks . However , Pinneri recognises that " house brands are a growing reality of food retailing " . <p> As part of the restructure of SPC Ardmona , the company plans to complement its portfolio of premium brands with private-label manufacturing . <p> " We currently do manufacture some retailer brands and it is our intent to work collaboratively with all retailers across multiple categories which will ensure we leverage our current manufacturing capacities and capabilities more effectively , " Pinneri says . <p> Warrnambool Cheese &amp; Butter , like Bega , has also signed a five-year manufacturing deal with Coles but unlike Bega 's private label contract , this agreement is for the development of a new brand of cheese and milk products that will be sold exclusively in Coles supermarkets . <p> A listed dairy company based in Victoria 's south-west , Warrnambool Cheese &amp; Butter will manufacture the Great Ocean Road range of products for Coles starting in May .

@@902240 <h> Birds , bats and bugs fly , but how ? We take an in-depth look at the mechanics of flight . <p> HERE 'S THE THING : the humble locust can fly hundreds of kilometres without refuelling - 500km is not an unusual jaunt . Locusts have even been known to cross the Atlantic , admittedly with the help of a storm or two . <p> Aeronautical engineer Dr John Young tosses me these tidbits as we chat in his office at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra . John , who , aside from researching insect flight , has worked on flight-test programs for F/A-18 fighters , ca n't suppress his admiration : " I 'm in awe of these animals , being able to do the things they do . It 's fiendishly clever ! " <p> " Clever " is one word for it . I prefer " miraculous " . To me , flapping flight in animals - birds , bats and insects - is nothing less than pure magic , one of nature 's most amazing tricks . Yet it happens every day and we do n't give it a second thought . Maybe this is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flap their wings and off they go . Nothing to it . <p> Do n't be fooled . When you start trying to unpick this exquisitely graceful and superficially simple act of locomotion , it turns out to be ingenious beyond imagining . Scientists have been probing flapping flight ( as opposed to gliding ) for years , but still have n't entirely worked it out . <h> How flight works <p> So how does it work ? Let 's look first at the wings . As we do with aircraft , flying creatures use wings to get them into the air and keep them there . Most wings , but not all , have a slightly curved upper surface and a less curved or flat lower surface . They are mostly rounded at the front ( the leading edge ) and taper to a sharp rear ( the trailing edge ) . The study of how air moves around a solid object like a wing is termed aerodynamics . Wings have an amazing aerodynamic property . If you propel a wing horizontally through the air , it generates an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lift on the wings must overcome the gravitational force pulling the aircraft or animal down . <p> Nearly all aircraft other than helicopters have fixed wings . Unless they 're attached to an unpowered aircraft like a glider , fixed wings are pushed through the air by engines that provide forward thrust . A flying animal lacks this separate source of thrust : its wings must support the animal 's weight and provide thrust simultaneously . <p> Although a flapping animal wing may appear to move up and down vertically , it does n't . On the downstroke , the wing actually sweeps forward as well as downward . This forward movement is one of the keys to animal flight . The other is the wing 's remarkable ability to twist along its length during the stroke and , in this way , to angle the leading edge slightly downward , especially nearer the wingtip . This causes the lift to be directed forward rather than upward . In other words , towards the outer end of the wing , some lift becomes thrust and drives the animal forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat wing 's lift and thrust . For the upstroke , the animal may partly flex , or fold , its wings . Even so , all insects and most birds and bats can generate useful aerodynamic forces on the upstroke too . A flying animal generates lift even when it 's flying without flapping , an activity we call gliding . In the case of both an animal and a gliding aircraft , the thrust that drives the wings forward is provided by loss of altitude , since the animal or aircraft must glide downward at a slight inclination in order to achieve enough forward motion to create lift . <h> Evolution of flight <p> During our planet 's history , powered animal flight has emerged in four animal groups - birds , bats , insects and extinct flying reptiles called pterosaurs . How and why these four developed wings and took to the air are matters of heated debate among scientists . There is general agreement , though , that wings did not develop specifically as flying devices but originally were appendages with other functions . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been used for display or to help with running and leaping . <p> " At some point , by coincidence or random chance , the form of a given structure allows the animal to do something new with it , " says David E. Alexander , assistant professor of entomology at the University of Kansas , in his book Nature 's Flyers . " If the new function is advantageous , natural selection will act to refine and improve it . " <p> But why fly ? Biologist Dr Bret Tobalske , director of the Flight Laboratory at the University of Montana , says , " The diversity of creatures that fly ... indicates that being able to move quickly at a low cost of transport is a terrific strategy for exploiting untapped niches through migration and otherwise making a living . " <p> Powered flight can be up to 10 times more fuel-efficient than walking or running . As for speed , flying animals can move through the air 10-20 times faster than an animal of similar size moves on the ground . Flight 's survival benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species fly , an astounding figure . Of 13,000 species , about 10,000 ( comprising some 9000 birds and 1000 bats ) are flyers . But insects outclass them all , being the most diverse animals on earth and having colonised nearly all environments . <p> " Most insects fly at some stage in their development , " says Professor Geoff Spedding , chairman of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Southern California . " Since insects comprise the vast majority of species on Earth , flight is actually the most common form of locomotion , and we humans are in a small minority in being unable to do it without the assistance of elaborate or powerful mechanical devices . " <p> Of all flying creatures , insects possess the most distinctive body structures for flight , from unique muscle systems to ridged or corrugated wings that are as far from sleek aircraft wings as you can get . In insects , aerodynamics moves into a whole new dimension . This is largely because , to small flying creatures , the air feels thick , and flying is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans became airborne in powered , fixed-wing aircraft during the 20th century , scientists proposed that powered animal flight might be explained by conventional fixed-wing aerodynamic theory , though they were aware the theory had its limitations . It was technically known as ' steady-state ' ( or ' quasi-steady-state ' ) aerodynamics because air was thought to flow steadily in a straight line from the front to the back of any wing , fixed or flapping . <p> In 1984 Professor Charlie Ellington , latterly director of the Animal Flight Group at the University of Cambridge , published a four-volume study confirming things were n't quite so straightforward , that other aerodynamic phenomena were at work during flapping . In a 1996 paper he went on to offer a solution to the ' bumblebee paradox ' , a tongue-in-cheek conundrum in which the bumblebee appears to break every rule in the flying handbook but still manages to fly with ease . <p> Dr Jim Usherwood , who studies animal locomotion at the Royal Veterinary College , in London , explains . " For most wings and propellers working efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly across the wing , keeping close to the wing surface , " he says . " In slow , vigorously flapping animal flight , however , each of these assumptions turns out to be invalid : airflow is highly unsteady ; it often shoots along the wing towards the tip and can separate from the wing surface to produce a ' leading-edge vortex ' . " <p> Welcome to the world of ' unsteady ' aerodynamics . It turns out that spiral leading-edge vortices ( LEVs ) and other associated vortex-like mechanisms are fundamental to insect flight , dramatically boosting lift by generating extra low pressure on the upper wing surface . <p> " My hunch is that there 's a blending of steady and unsteady aerodynamics for almost every flying creature , " says Bret Tobalske . Pointing to the albatross as an example , he adds : " Even if it 's not flapping it may be encountering what we typically think of as an LEV periodically that gives it a temporary , instantaneous surge of lift . " <p> LEVs are n't the only unsteady phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , which involves an insect wing gaining lift from vortices shed in the previous stroke , and ' clap-and-fling ' , in which the wings of insects , and some birds , meet ( ' clap ' ) at the limit of their strokes and then generate vortices on separating . They add up to a formidable box of aerodynamic tricks that help to boost lift enormously . <p> " All these mechanisms are the resolution of the bumblebee paradox , " says the Australian Defence Force 's John Young , who researched flapping wings for his PhD and has collaborated to study locust flight with the Animal Flight Group at the University of Oxford . " People were using quasi-steady aerodynamic principles in their studies of natural wings , but it just does n't work . With these dynamic unsteady methods a bee uses , it can generate something like four times the lift that it would be able to with conventional aerodynamics. " 
@@911231 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly criticised <p> Updated 14 May 2012 , 17:43 AEST <p> The President of the Australia PNG Business Council , Peter Taylor , has described Australia 's visa process for Papua New Guineans as intrusive and the fees they are expected to pay as excessive and unjustifiable . <p> GARRETT : Yes it was quite unusually really , usually business people are quite circumspect , but certainly many Papua New Guineans in the audience were nodding their heads in agreement because this has really been a very sore point for decades . Peter Taylor himself is a business heavy hitter , not only is he president to the Australia-PNG Business Council , but he 's also executive chairman of Bougainville Copper and a director of Riotinto . This is some of what he had to say . <p> TAYLOR : These processes not only cause cost to business , but also cause great angst within the community because of the intrusive nature of the Australian Visa Application process , including requiring extensive evidence of financial capacity and support , including for business people with a record of many years of regular visits to Australia and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some remarkable examples of senior business people being unable to travel on time for business in Australia because of these processes . There is probably no other country in which Australia visa policy processing receive so much critical scrutiny , comment , within the business community and a community at large because of the very close connections between the two countries across almost every facet of human engagement and of course our common border . Cost to business have recently been increased by introducing an additional fee to apply for a visa to Australia , a cost which in the view of business should be absorbed within the already what we consider excessive and unjustifiable visa fee of 300 Kina . <p> GARRETT : That was Peter Taylor , President of the Australian-PNG Business Council speaking here in Brisbane here this morning . <p> HILL : Well Jemima , was there any sort of a response to what Peter Taylor said from the other speakers from the conference ? <p> GARRETT : Well , the main response actually came from Australia 's deputy opposition leader and shadow foreign affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calling for change . <p> BISHOP : It should be as easy to do business as between Australia and Papua New Guinea as it is between Australia and New Zealand and while I welcome an economic cooperation treaty , we should be aiming for a high quality full blown free trade agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea . <p> If we are honoured to be the next government of this country , I most certainly commit to ensuring that we can free up the visa arrangements between Australian business people and PNG business people in particular so that we can have much easier means of doing business and investing in each other 's countries . It is simply unacceptable for there to be so many bureaucratic hurdles in the way of trade and investment and in doing business across the Coral Sea . <p> GARRETT : That 's Julie Bishop , Australia 's shadow foreign affairs minister and I guess as you hear Ms Bishop gave a fairly passionate speech and it was very wide ranging . One of the other points she made was about the mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Papua New Guineans skilled up and able to travel easily for work in the resources industry to her own state of Western Australia and also to Queensland , so I guess that gives even more impetus to this visa issue . <p> HILL : Jemima , this visa issues been around for quite awhile now . Why is nothing ever done regardless of whoever is in the Lodge in Canberra , nothing ever really seems to change ? <p> GARRETT : No , it does n't . You 're quite right Bruce and I know it 's been on the Business Council agenda ever since I 've been going to these meetings and that goes back to the mists of time , so it is really time something was done . I think you can hear in the tone of Julie Bishop that she 's really got the bit between her teeth and so possibly if there is a change of government , which the polls are suggesting will happen eventually we may well see some change . <p> HILL : They wo n't really asking for obviously just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously that when you have a developing country right next to a developed country , there obviously has to be some cheques and balances . But what they were really trying to say was for business people that go back and forth and are no risk that really should n't apply to them ? <p> GARRETT : Oh no , they 're talking about people in general , really they 're complaining the whole process for everyone is slow , expensive and when they say intrusive , they mean people have to go through sort of humiliating lengthy details checks of things like their financial where with all . Sure it 's good to be able to provide the evidence . You should n't have to go through very lengthy checks , so this is a big issue that applies to everyone , but business in particular , because when you have very senior business leaders being delayed for business meetings is a whole other order of problem that really does need to be dealt with . <p> HILL : Well obviously , Australia and PNG do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up . What other issues are they discussing at this conference ? <p> GARRETT : Well clearly the economy was a big issue and on that one PNG 's generally got a good story to tell . In fact Prime Minister Peter O'Neill was to have attended the conference . He pulled out at the last moment and he 's public enterprise minister , Sir Mekere Moratau delivered his speech . And in that speech Mr. O'Neill highlighted that despite the general slowing in economic growth around the world , PNG still expected to grow at almost eight per cent this year which is really quite extraordinary . There 's also been some debate in PNG about problems the government 's facing possibly with the budget due to a combination of losses sustained by poor management within PNG 's independent business corporation by the former minister , Arthur Somare and the fact that the government 's committed to a very expensive but well received pledge of free education . <p> In his speech , Peter O'Neill said the losses were well he did n't mention the losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10.6 billion kina and it will be balanced . He acknowledged that there are some problems in terms of rolling out the free education , but he said he expected that to be fixed soon . <p> HILL : I wonder if we can pick up on something that Julie Bishop mentioned , skills transfer training that kind of thing . PNG is a tremendously wealthy country but it 's people are n't and they 're not really able to participate in large aspects of this mining boom because they do n't have the skills and we 're getting a lot of people migrating to PNG with the necessary skills . Is there a sense that if Australia upskill people in PNG that would really unlock the fortunes of the country for the people to participate in ? <p> GARRETT : Well , that 's certainly true , but I think when you talk to business people , there 's two sides of this . One is possibly the PNG government could have put more effort in earlier , but equally businesses could have put a bit more effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big one there now has a big program , but that was n't operating in time for all the jobs that were available to begin with to be filled by Papua New Guineans . So possibly it 's something that the PNG government could look at if business wo n't do it . The government can always take action to sort of insist I guess . <p> HILL : It is creating a bit of social tension the large numbers of migrant workers are getting quite upset about it are n't they ? <p> GARRETT : Yeah , that 's true , but it 's interesting to see also the number of people say in the low level villages , particularly around Port Moresby . There all getting preference on the PNG-LNG project . The other issue of course is there 's a lot of landowner companies working for these projects now , but unless they get the support to really upskill themselves , when the project finishes , they 're left with nothing . What they need to do is get to the stage where they can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like say Misima where there 's been no development for the people there since that mine closed . If they 'd had the managed to get to the level where they were contracting in Port Moresby , they would have been able to do that and I know that 's what other landowner companies are trying to do , but that 's a big ask going from nothing to being able to deal with the world 's biggest corporations . <h> World partners : <p> This service includes material from AAP , Agence France-Presse , APTN , BBC , CNN , Getty , Pacnews , Reuters and other agencies which is copyright and can not be reproduced , broadcast , rewritten or redistributed without written consent .

A bright yellow light enveloped him and he felt himself being flung away from this cloaked character , he tried to open his mouth to yell at it , but no sound escaped . Everything was going by so fast he felt like he would be sick , he was able to turn his head just enough to see behind him , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes glued on the portal until things started to go black . <p> As he blacked out he saw this odd looking horse looking down at him . <p> The horse is actually a zebra , known to fans of My Little Pony as Zecora , a witch that reportedly , on occasion , does evil dances . She only speaks in rhymes , like " Why did you do that ? There 's no need to be a nut " . The Red Blade is also the master of rhyming . <p> We 're slowly introduced to more characters in this little morality play . There 's Twilight Sparkle , the magical unicorn ; Spike the dragon who seems to be channeling Wolverine ( " Need to watch where you 're going bub " ) , and someone named Krazeir , who seems to have been sucked into this world from ours via a video game . <p> ' Obla di Obla da , life goes on ! ' Krazeir thought , humming the tune he had heard from his old world . That song had been stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it did n't stop soon he thought he 'd go insane . <p> And he 's a fan of The Beatles . Oh , and he 's been transformed into a Pegasus . I think he 's supposed to represent the everyman . Everypony . Something . <p> Soon the barbarian meets Twilight Sparkle and her dragon companion , two best friends that have never known anything but innocent and pure G-rated goodness . During their awkward meeting , a manticore attacks . Lar'zak punches it in the face . <p> The manticore stumbled from the heavy blow , but regained it 's balance and stabbed at him with it 's tail . The human saw the attack coming so he just sidestepped it and brought his sword down onto the stinger , cutting it off , sending an electric shock up through the beast 's body . Lar'zak wasted no time , bringing his sword up swiftly right into the creature 's skull . <p> While a traumatized Twilight Sparkle seeks the advice of Princess Celestia , the Barbarian is left to slaughter hordes of undead ponies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> Celestia tried to use her magic to stop it from moving , but it had no effect . The second guard fell as a group of the little red devils jumped out of the trees and hacked away on his back . <p> It seemed as she was about to meet her end from these little demons , and she closed her eyes waiting for the pain . <p> But it never came . <p> She peeked out of one of her eyes to see all of the demons either dead on the floor , or in one 's case impaled on a sword . A crystal sword , the demon seemed to jump as if electricity was going through it 's body and it 's hair began to burn . <p> As the Barbarian continues his battles against the demon invasion of Equestria , the ponies " powers begin to react to the new threat . Suddenly friendship is indeed magic , and Twilight Sparkle 's magic is deadly . <p> For some odd reason , her magic started to act up and a large fireball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them became nothing more than ashes and blew away in the wing made by the others , the remaining two looked over at the unicorn and changed their targets starting to fly down to attack her . <p> All of this drama , tension and horror culminates in that horrible scene of pony violation , Lar'zak 's rage surely mirroring that of My Little Pony fans . <p> If only they had giggled at the ghostly . The Red Blade is n't finished yet ; perhaps there 's still time for a last-minute Pinkie Pie save . Hooves crossed ! <p> I think the ' unlikely ' in that title would be far better replaced with ' expected ' or ' guaranteed . ' From what I 've seen it 's not hard to find pony crossover stuff for pretty much any fandom without even looking for it . It 's kinda like Rule 34 really , except not necessarily NSFW o.0

Who knows what kind of craziness the unforgiving live television gauntlet could lead to . Personally we 're I 'm looking forward to seeing some special performances . Right , Delta ? <p> Let 's get into it ... <p> 7:35pm : Quick update everyone : we get to vote for the contestants after these performances . Better get my phone credit amped up . <p> 7:36pm : DARREN MCMULLEN IS WEARING VELVET . <p> 7:38pm : The four mentors ( Seal , Joel Madden , Delta Goodrem and Keith Urban ) are doing a group performance . Seal just did a slide across the front of the stage , the kind of move that would hurt most people except for those HIGH ON MARIJUANA ? <p> 7:40pm : My boyfriend just informed me that the song was " Sing " by My Chemical Romance . Relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tanning bed . Seal has spent several days on the ' getting mad stoned ' bed . Specifically , his bed . <p> 7:45pm : Velvet ensconced Darren McMullen has just announced that only Delta and Seal 's contestants are performing tonight . I hope the contestants do a great job in spite of that . <p> 7:47pm : Seal 's first singer is 16-year-old Fatai doing " Empire State Of Mind " , the version without Jay-Z . She has a smile that does n't quit and hits all the notes . Delta is saying things about her but is mainly gleaming like a bronze statuette because of her immense spray tan . Seal says that Fatai makes him look like a genius . -- <p> Come on Seal . Not even a personal copywriter could make you look like a genius , buddy . <p> 7:52pm : Sorry to go off topic , but can Tricky Business just begin already ? I 'm so over seeing those ads with Shane Bourne and adult contemp music . <p> 7:55pm : AdamMatt ( thanks commenters ) is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated her name into his blind audition . The guy 's a genius , that I wo n't deny . <p> 7:56pm : Ruh roh . He 's singing " White Noise " by the Living End . This is not a good song for anyone except probably the Living End - legends of Australian rock that features the upright bass . " He 's like a poor man 's David Campbell " my boyfriend comments . I 'm going to rely heavily on him tonight because he is so on point . <p> 7:58pm : Keith quite liked the performance and Delta loved that he " is an artist who wants to give everything to everybody in this room . " That 's among my favourite quotes of non-quantifiable bullshit that the mentors have said throughout the entire show ! <p> 8:04pm : Team Seal is on ! Be alert but not alarmed . The singer is one of my early favouritesKarise . <p> 8:08pm : Seal chose a very lacklustre song for someone with a voice like Karise 's . She has such a unique great soul tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . However , after the performance the judges are keen and Joel says " you got more soul than a sneaker shop . " How long have you been sitting on that one mate . Nicole Richie shrugs . Seal mouth kisses Karise ? ! ? <p> 8:17pm : Ben Bennett is on next . He 's an exciting contestant because he appears to be under 13 . Delta chose a One Direction song for him because , quote , they 're so hot right now , unquote . <p> 8:18pm : Ben Bennett has blond helmet hair . Yikes ! But , in his defence , what 16-year-old male choir member does n't have blond helmet hair these days ? As usual , Keith Urban sang along to every word . Is there any song that guy does n't know word for word ? Or , the better question : is Keith Urban a robot ? <p> 8:21pm : Delta is rocking some interesting hair braids and an intense tan tonight . " Delta looks like an extra on the Arnold Schwartzenegger-era Conan The Barbarian , " according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seal 's charges is up next singing " Got to Get You Into My Life " . He 's one of my favourites because he smiles when he sings and wears stupid hats . I normally hate stupid hats , but for some reason this guy makes them super endearing . <p> 9:31pm : Hmm ... I do n't think this is Michael 's best work . He seemed to get a bit lost midway through and his eyes were darting about the room like a frightened guinea pig . Seal has just made a comment about that in the post-performance criticism . But , like many times I 've momentarily agreed with Seal , again this time he has something insane to add : " I feel like you were like a doppelganger ... " so Seal clearly knows not of what he speaks . <p> 8:36pm : Next up is one of Delta 's crew , Danni . Delta has her singing a song that I 'm not sure about but it feels like a full Eighties rock ballad . FYI Keith knows every word . Robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents on Danni . Keith for starters thought she was great . Golden Monument of the Sun Gods aka Delta thought she brought the " internal womanly power " , which is such the kind of thing a person dipped in a spiritual bronze coating would say . <p> 8:59pm : Delta 's Russian renegade Viktoria performed " Bang Bang ( you shot me down ) " by Nancy Sinatra . Despite the fact I thought her version was underwhelming , the Russian is definitely a compelling performer . <p> Aw , I should n't lie : I missed most of it because I am trying to eat my dinner . Sorry y'all . <p> 9:44pm : apologies for the absence we 're working through some server issues and will be right back ! <p> 9:57pm : Sorry dudes . The server went down and so we missed the last half hour of the episode . I feel so helpless ! ? ! All I know is that Guy Sebasian 's Brother performed a song that sounded a lot like a Guy Sebastian song and someone else sang something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . We 'll talk about this later . <p> Later : Seal team representative Guy Sebastian 's brother did an extremely average version of what I initially thought was a Guy Sebastian song , but it was actually David Guetta feat . Chris Brown . Emma-Louise Birdsall performs the Aretha Franklin standard " I Never Loved A Man ( The Way I Love You ) " and does a decent job with the song and her delivery of it . She does the ' torch song ' styling well with a floor length red dress , red lips and relevant hand gestures . <p> Rachael , Delta 's legally blind contestant , sang the very poorly chosen song " Hands " by Jewel and was pretty bad . She was very out of tune . For some reason the judges were all " that was exquisite " which it seriously was n't . At the risk of making enemies and committing karmic suicide , I think the judges are going easy on Rachael because she 's blind . *Flinches while waiting for lightning/wrath of gods/case of raging Chlamydia* <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself surrounded by brimstone so I guess I 'll be back again for next week 's show where Joel and Keith 's contestants will take the stage .

Go here to find out which ones are most likely to influence the world markets in the near and long term , and discover the best ways to profit from their meteoric rise . <p> And as a strategy , it has worked well for decades . That 's because the return on assets ( shares , property , bonds etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So leverage worked . <p> Borrowing at 7 per cent to purchase an asset growing at 10 per cent -- or more -- is an easy way to make money . And as more people borrowed , the weight of money kept pushing asset prices up . This was particularly the case in residential property -- the most leveraged of asset classes . <h> Reverse Compounding and Property Investments <p> Home loan borrowing costs are around 7 per cent . Assuming you put down a 10 per cent deposit and borrow the rest , you 'll need an annual return of at least 6.3 per cent to keep your head above water . If house prices fall ( which is a likely scenario after years of increases ) reverse compounding kicks in . <p> For example , if you put a 10 per cent deposit down when buying a house , it would only take a 10 per cent decline to wipe out all your equity . Meanwhile you continue to pay 7 per cent interest on the debt . Reverse compounding . <h> Reverse Compounding and Share Investing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky . This relates to the differences in the cycles between property and shares . Share prices peaked in October 2007 . House prices peaked around midway through 2010 . In other words , shares offer better relative value than housing . <p> However , margin loans ( borrowing to buy shares ) are expensive . The interest rate charged can be as high as 10 per cent . If you buy opportunistically , I think shares have the potential to beat that 10 per cent hurdle over the long term . <h> Compounding -- Weighing Up Risk and Reward <p> In other words , it 's a bad risk/ reward trade-off . Borrowing to buy assets in the hope of making easy money is yesterday 's strategy . It wo n't work in the years ahead . <p> You can see the very nasty effects of reverse compounding in Europe . Take Spain 's economy for example . While Spanish government debt is still relatively low , the market knows the banking sector in Spain is insolvent and will require government money at some point . So Spain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These countries got to this point from years of over spending . They financed this ' dis-saving ' by borrowing more and more . Their debt compounded until the market finally decided to turn the easy money tap off . <p> Now they are at the point of bankruptcy and social upheaval . Reverse compounding is as nasty as compounding is beneficial . <h> A Look at Reverse Compounding in the US <p> Consider the US , which is on the path to taking the concept of reverse compounding to epic levels : <p> It has total outstanding federal public debt of US$15.6 trillion . <p> In 2011 , despite low interest rates , the interest expense on the debt hit a record US$454.4 billion . Given the size of the US economy is around US$15 trillion , interest expense is still manageable , representing about 3 per cent of national output . <p> But as a percentage of total Federal tax revenue the situation does n't look so benign . It 's estimated the government will extract US$2.5 trillion in taxes in 2012 . If we assume interest expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax take goes towards debt servicing . It can only get worse from here . <p> I think the US is still a few years away from a genuine debt crisis . But if it keeps compounding its debt it is a certainty to get there . And it will come quickly when it does . <p> A huge debt pile is manageable when interest rates are very low . But if interest rates all of a sudden went to 6 per cent because of a loss of confidence , US debt-servicing costs would be well over US$1 trillion per year . At that point , the option would be to raise taxes sharply or print money to pay for the interest expense . Neither of these is good . <h> Are You Safe From Reverse Compounding ? <p> Unfortunately , you can not entirely avoid the deleterious effects of reverse compounding at a national or international level . When financial ignoramuses run governments around the world there 's not a lot you can do to avoid the fallout . <p> I bring up reverse compounding because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth creation . You can avoid reverse compounding at an individual level by simply staying away from debt . Or only get into debt when you have a high level of confidence it will work for you . ( I would include debt to finance your own business in this definition . ) <p> But this strategy will not work in the coming decade . Borrowing to purchase assets will result in reverse compounding in the years ahead . <h> The Compounding Strategy For the Future <p> What will work in this coming decade is a simple compounding strategy . <p> Which brings me to the most important -- and simplest -- point when it comes to compounding . It 's called saving . If you do n't save you ca n't compound your wealth . <p> Successfully compounding your wealth in this sort of economic environment is difficult . But it can be achieved if you keep three things in mind : <p> Invest internationally -- I think the Australian index will meander in a wide range and ultimately go nowhere . I also think the Aussie dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , I think you need to look further afield for opportunities . Adding some international companies to your portfolio will add currency diversity too . <p> Be patient . Wait for opportunities . Focus on quality business rather than a cheap stock price . <p> Buy gold . It 's one investment that many people dismiss as being over . But this metal is quietly going about its business of getting rid of as many investor as it possibly can before resuming its next leg up . <p> Growing your wealth through compounding has a very high probability outcome . If you 're prepared to save and keep my three guidelines in mind , I have no doubt you will become -- and more importantly stay -- wealthy . <h> Greg Canavan <p> Greg is the Managing Editor for the Daily Reckoning Australia .

Is it a natural phenomenon do you think that everyone just has to live with , or do you think it can and should be stamped out completely ? <p> WAQAVONOVONO : The thing that we 've learned about bullying is that bullying is a learned behaviour and it can also be unlearnt . Where are these children learning all of this from ? They 're learning it from all the other different sort of social learning factors , that 's where you get this information delivered to you from your churches or from your religious leaders .

But then once you leave Suva in the rural areas there 's a lot of discrimination , not only against people of LGBT , but there 's a lot of discrimination against women , there 's a lot of limitations against young people and just when you begin to leave the urban centres you see all of this sort of disparity when it comes to human rights .

In reality , it 's nothing we have n't seen before , although until recently most of the technology has been exclusive to high-end European luxury cars . <p> The real amazing fact is that for a circa-$50,000 car , EyeSight adds some incredibly powerful safety features previously unheard of for the price ( the recently launched Mercedes-Benz B-Class does pack similar technology , albeit in a totally different segment ) . <p> We recently spent a week with a 2012 Subaru Outback 3.6R Premium model , which gets EyeSight as standard equipment ( with no price rise over the 2011 model ) . It 's easy to notice the system 's inclusion thanks to the two CIA-style monitoring cameras mounted on either side of the rear-view mirror . It takes a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cabin , but after a while you 'll hardly notice them ( although other drivers may wonder if you 're in an undercover police car ) . <p> Subaru EyeSight is the combination of seven different new-generation active safety features that will help prevent or limit the impact of a potential accident . They go far beyond what we have seen in cars for the past few decades . <p> The first and perhaps most useful in inner-city driving conditions , is the pre-collision throttle management system . It helps prevent the unnecessary and somewhat embarrassing situation of having an accident in a closed environment ( such as a car park ) due to incorrect pedal or gear selection . <p> For example , say you 're pulling into a car park and get distracted by a song on the radio or an incoming phone call , you quickly go for the brake pedal and accidently floor the accelerator pedal . This may seem unlikely , but it 's one of the most common causes of car park incidents . EyeSight 's cameras can work out if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accelerator is suddenly pushed and restrict engine output , significantly reducing the risk of damage or injury . It 's not the sort of system you 'd deliberately want to test in case it does n't kick in for whatever reason , but with a few cardboard boxes put together to form a makeshift wall , it proved effective in our tests . <p> The second system is adaptive cruise control , which can ' lock on ' to a vehicle in front and follow it at a predetermined distance and up to a predetermined speed . Essentially it takes the need for the accelerator and brake pedal out of the equation for long drives . All you have to do is steer . This is by no means a new feature as it has been around in both European and some Japanese cars for a number of years . It was notably included in the range-topping Toyota Prius i-Tech all the way back in 2009 . The Subaru system is a second-generation unit and can bring the car to a complete stop with traffic and resume when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Volvos and Mercedes-Benz vehicles , it does have some limitations . For example , it gets a little annoyed when another car merges between you and the target car , leading to sudden deceleration . It can at times not even realise there is a car merging until it 's right in front of your bumper . As a result , it 's important to not rely solely on the system for all your acceleration and deceleration inputs . In saying that , we enjoyed a drive from Brisbane to the Gold Coast without touching either pedal for almost an hour . <p> The pre-collision braking and brake assist systems are there to either prevent or limit the damage caused by a front-on accident . If the driver becomes distracted or disabled ( e.g. suffers a heart attack ) and the vehicle is driving straight into another object , the system audibly warns the driver of a potential impact and then automatically applies braking force if it detects a collision is forthcoming . In some cases this will stop the vehicle completely while in others it will simply limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crash . <p> The assist system helps bring on full braking force in case the driver is not applying full brakes . By comparison , other systems tend to apply a preset amount of braking to limit impact . Some manufacturers argue that drivers must always remains in control and insists that if the system applied full braking force it may cause an unnecessary rear-ending . Subaru has taken the approach that if an impact is imminent , maximum braking is the way to go . <p> This system can potentially save many lives and as more and more manufacturers introduce it as standard equipement . Nonetheless , it can also be rather annoying . It does tend to get a bit alarmed when you 're accelerating towards another car to , for example , make a green light or prepare for an overtaking manoeuvre , giving you audible warnings that can drive you mad . If you 're a car enthusiast ( or an aggressive driver ) , you 're likely to quickly try to turn it off . However , if you see cars more as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's likely to only come into play when needed . <p> The lane departure and vehicle sway warning systems are also part of the ' can-drive-you-mad ' category . They give audible warnings when the car is drifting across a clearly marked lane without indicating or when the system recognises that the vehicle is drifting to the other side of the road unintentionally . It 's all well and good in theory , but only after having it on for a week do you come to appreciate just how often you either cut clearly marked lines or leave your lane without indicating . It 's a great way to teach you how to drive within the lines and it does this by constantly blasting you with warnings like a high-school teacher . <p> Volvo has exactly the same issue with its lane departure system , in that it becomes really annoying , very quickly . We prefer the way in which the Germans have implemented this : a gentle vibration of the steering wheel when you drift out of your lane is a far more psychologically tolerable way of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one step further and actually pull you back into your lane , which can be extremely handy in some situations <p> Last but not least , the lead vehicle start alert system is something we have n't seen before . It essentially gives you a reminder if you 're in traffic and the car in front has started to move without you noticing . It 's rather handy and very unobtrusive . <p> Overall , it 's hard to fault Subaru 's EyeSight system for doing all that it can in the most cost-effective manner . One absent feature is the blind spot assistance system , which could only be integrated with additional hardware . The comparison to European cars in this case is largely unfair given the huge price difference , however , it 's a sign of how far Subaru has come with its safety technology . <p> On the whole , Subaru EyeSight is very effective and will undoubtedly help reduce the number of crashes on the road . It can get a little annoying at times , but we are sure if you lived with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first thing you have to do is learn to trust the system , and that can take a while ( cue the Terminator music ) . <p> This way if you have a minor accident you do n't have to replace super expensive hardware <p> Aleks <p> Good point , but I still ca n't stomach the look of them , they are just too huge , surely they could hide the system somehow . <p> Kim <p> Because they do n't use cameras . They generally use sonar for their guided cruises control and collision mitigation systems . This is totally different and more advanced than sonar . <p> Ivan Sherwood <p> Hi Alborz , since you mentioned Volvo in this article , do you know when Volvo will be inviting the media to preview the V40 . Stefan Jacoby said it would be in May and held in Italy but May is almost ending now .

Not just the cruise control ? <p> The whole system sounds like it would annoy the hell out of me . It will also just give bad drivers another excuse to not pay attention to the road . People should just learn to drive properly . <p> nugsdad <p> Really this needs to be the standard for the new Commodore etal Aussie launches . <p> Foo <p> A company that still uses 4 speed autos , dropped twin scroll turbos , has the least powerful turbo diesel in the world and some of the ugliest cars on the planet can not claim to be technologically advanced . <p> John <p> " There was a time when Honda was the leading innovator of technology among the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems .

@@924236 <h> ABC 's Election Analyst blogs on the wonderful world of Australian Elections . <h> May 22 , 2012 <h> Prospects for the NSW Redistribution : Part 2 <p> Overnight I 've put my rudimentary cartography skills to work and created two maps that show the variations from projected quota in the country and in the Sydney metropolitan areas . <p> The first map shows the country seats and reveals the vast swathe of under quota electorates in the state 's west . You can click on the map to open a window with a larger version . <p> On this map the blue colours are seats under quota , the orange colours over quota . The lightest shades of blue and orange represents electorates within 3% of quota and not requiring change . The next shading represents electorates in the 3-10% variation from quota range , and the darkest colours are seats varying by more than 10% from the projected quota . <p> The two dark blue electorates in the west of the state are Murray-Darling , projected to be 13.8% under quota by April 2015 , and to the north Barwon , predicted to be 17.3% under quota . These two electorates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower limit variation , roughly a quarter of an electorate . The problem is , as the map clearly illustrates , every electorate to the east with the exception of Wagga Wagga is already under quota . As I explained in yesterday 's post on the redistribution , western NSW has half a seat too many on projected enrolments . The result is that a seat somewhere west of Goulburn is likely to disappear , while Goulburn itself will be re-drawn running to the west . Whether the seat including Goulburn ends up being called Goulburn or Burrinjuck will no doubt be a point of contention in submissions to the Commission . <p> I 've also produced a similar map for the metropolitan area , again with the scale running from blue meaning under quota to orange over quota . Again you can click on the map for a larger version . <p> The two metropolitan hot spots of growth show up clearly as dark orange .. The dark orange seat in the north-west of Sydney is Riverstone , on my projections likely to be 25% over quota by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Windsor Road from Riverstone is projected to be 5.9% over quota , while the blue areas to the west are Londonderry , predicted to be 4.9% under quota , and Penrith predicted to be 6.7% under . <p> It has been six decades since the current boundary between Hawkesbury and Riverstone was breached by an electoral boundary . Given the growth in Sydney 's north-west , perhaps there is now an argument for an electorate that crosses this boundary . Alternatively , the western end of Riverstone around Windsor could be re-united with Richmond in Londonderry , a change that would make major changes to the newly Liberal seats of Penrith and Mulgoa . The M7 is used as the southern boundary of Riverstone and separates it from the Labor seats of Toongabbie , Blacktown and Mount Druitt . <p> So solving the Riverstone surplus either breaks new ground in crossing Windsor Road to the north , crosses the M7 and alters the Labor seats , including Labor Leader John Robertson 's seat of Blacktown , or flows through the Windsor-Richmond area and anti-clockwise around Sydney 's outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Penrith , Mulgoa and possibly as far as Camden , Campbelltown and Wollondilly . <p> The other big changes will be in inner Sydney , where the two dark orange electorates are Sydney , predicted to be 17.6% over quota , and Heffron , predicted to be 11.5% over quota . The three electorates east of these along the coast , Vaucluse , Coogee and Maroubra are all within the permitted 3% tolerance , while those to the west are predicted to be above , Balmain on 4.0% , Drummoyne 9.2% and Marrickville 4.5% . Knock on effects through the inner west will draw Bankstown inwards and probably solve the predicted shortfall of 5.8% in East Hills . <p> It will be touch and go how the shortfall in Sutherland Shire will be dealt with . Cronulla is projected to be 0.7% under quota but Miranda to the west is projected at 6.9% under quota . Menai further west is on 0.3% under projected quota and Heathcote to the south on 3.6% under quota . Both will need to change to accommodate Miranda . Heathcote can move south further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota in the Illawarra and South Coast . Between 1999 and 2007 Menai crossed the Georges River into Padstow , and depending on the population projections eventually published by the Redistribution Commission , Menai may have to follow the example of the Federal seat of Hughes and again cross the Georges River . <p> When the composition and terms of the Redistribution Commission are eventually announced , official enrolment projections will be published . I will then update these maps and accompanying commentary . <h> Comments <p> Anthony , Given the size of the Libs/Nats victory in 2011 , where they picked up so many seats they had never held before , how do you expect the major parties to factor that into their thinking when they make their submissions over the draft boundaries ? Will the Libs looks to lock up some of that conservative vote in western Sydney seats knowing that it means sacrificing others ? <p> COMMENT : No , I expect the opposite . I 'd expect the Liberal party to propose that as much of the area between St Marys and Blacktown is put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting areas from a string of marginal Liberal seats . <p> I wonder if it would work if Heathcote was abolished instead of a rural NSW seat ? That whole area down to the South Coast is mostly under quota . The Sutherland part of Heathcote could top up numbers in Miranda , and the Illawarra part could help feed the shortfall in rural NSW ? Then create a new seat in western Sydney to address the excess in Riverstone , with other seats moving closer to the city to take in the surplus there ? <p> That 's something I would be at least thinking about . <p> There would need to be some shuffling around but it might be better than making more radical changes in rural NSW . <p> COMMENT : The western NSW problem ca n't be avoided . What you suggest is possible but the number 's wo n't quite add up on 93 seats . The seats south of Heathcote are just under quota on total . Abolishing Heathcote might release enough electors to remove Robertson and its surrounds from Kiama , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutherland Shire . If you could split Menai at the Sutherland/Liverpool Council boundary , all of Chipping Norton , Moorebank and Wattle Grove into a Liverpool based seat , but I think there are too many voters in the southern and western parts of Sutherland Shire to put in one seat . <p> There just is n't anywhere to go on the south coast . The imposition of defined Central and Country Zones in the 1970s produced some very odd boundaries on the south coast caused by the fixed zonal boundary near Kiama . Under one-vote one-value rules the 1986/7 redistribution produced some very strange boundaries that ran from the south coast up and over impassable mountains to include inland areas . The criteria for drawing boundaries was subsequently changed to make " mountains and other natural boundaries " a criteria the Commissioners must take into account . That criteria basically locks the seat of Monaro into its current position , funnelling any attempt to deal with a shortfall in western NSW into the corridor north of the ACT . <p> You may have already answered this so forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darling and Barwon into one seat which would be well over quota and then adjust the electorates to the east accordingly ( into quota ) by shaping the new seat back into quota ? While it would be one big electorate , do the numbers support such a proposal ? <p> COMMENT : The difficulty is that one of the electorates has to have Broken Hill in it . They wo n't go back to pre-1968 when Broken Hill was divided between two seats . <p> If you put Broken Hill in Barwon it would be over quota but probably can be dealt with by expanding Dubbo north . Everything in the south of Murray-Darling then has to get put in other seats , which given Wagga Wagga and Albury are well defined , means Murrumbidgee , Burrinjuck and Goulburn all get shoved west . <p> The alternative is to supplement the current Murray-Darling with parts of an abolished Barwon , but that could n't extend as far as the populated east of the electorate around Moree and Narrabri , which leaves those towns with nowhere to go unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upper Hunter which mucks up the lower Hunter valley seats . <p> Assuming 93 seats are retained then expanding both seats looks the easiest option , though it is hard to find the extra voters for Barwon . But we will wait to see what the parties propose . Combining the seats looks feasible until you try to work out what to do with Moree and Narrabri . <p> Could't they just take the bottom off of Sydney , the top off of Heffron and the eastern part of Marrickville and create a new seat west of Anzac Parade , then abolish Macquarie Fields and slide the seats along the Bankstown line and south of the Georges River to the west ? In the north they could make a new seat around Pennant Hills , abolish Londonderry and move the seats around it into that area . <p> COMMENT : There are many things the Commissioners could do , but as they tend to draw Vaucluse , Maroubra and Coogee before they do Sydney and Heffron , the options are limited . <p> Londonderry is a bizzare seat , covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it goes through the federal seats of Lindsay , Chifley and Macquarie . It simply connects parts of outer Western Sydney with semi rural areas around Richmond , so theres no connection between towns of interest . <p> Id like to see- Londonderry takes up all of Windsor , and actually enlarges in area to take in some towns from over surplus Hawkesbury . That would male Londonderry well over surplus . Then to cut out that surplus , give a couple of the Blacktown LGA suburbs like Willmot or Tregear to Mt Druitt . That will then boost Mt Druitt from under quota to perfect . <p> Londonderry would still be a little over quota , so give Nth St Marys + Ropes Crossing to Mulgoa . Futhermore , take Erskine Park out of Smithfield and give it to Mulgoa as well . That makes Mulgoa change from under surplus to well over surplus . <p> So then take Glenmore Park out of Mulgoa and give it to Penrith , which makes Penrith slightly oversurplus . <p> Then finally take Lapstone and Glenbrook out of Penrith and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Blue Mountains LGA . And it means that Penrith + Blue Mountains are perfect <p> Its more complex than this because of the knock on effects from the inner city plus whats going on in Western NSW . But its an idea- <p> Londonderry would be a completely semi rural seat <p> Mulgoa would be based in the Eastern half of the Penrith LGA , and would need a name change <p> And then Penrith takes in the western half of the Penrith LGA . <p> ( Im a local ) <p> COMMENT : If you are interested , you should put in a submission once the redistribution is announced . <p> Antony in an unrelated question , is there an actual way of basing what each seat is named after . I would have thought that each seat would be named after the most populous town within the seat- E.g Seats of Penrith , Liverpool , Epping etc . But clearly thats not the case because because theres many seats which are named after one of the smaller towns within the seat , e.g Mulgoa and Londonderry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names in their reports . <p> Great work ! I note your comment that playing with Upper Hunter mucks up the lower hunter seats . How so ? Other than Maitland , Cessnock and possibly the surplus from the far north west of Lake Macquarie they would only be minor adjustments pushing them by at least one suburb or so into Wallsend or Port Stephens , even Newcastle but it seems hardly necessary as you point out . <p> Also what is your early prognosis about the population growth on the Central Coast , particularly around Wyong , Swansea , The Entrance and South Lake Macquarie . Could you comment on likely changes that are to be made to accommodate these shifts . <p> I would note the Liberals slim desire to hold onto Wyong so would take the Wyong valleys from Lake Macquare and some how push the north or Wyong which appears to be predominately ALP and put it in Swansea . Which then would mean Swansea is way over populated hence why the seat of Munmorah was created in the 70s or the suggestion of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thought . Thanks . <p> COMMENT : Morisset was n't a new seat , just an attempt to re-name Lake Macquarie as it expanded beyond the Lake Macquarie Local government area . The new boundaries were largely adopted but the old name reinstated . <p> If you try and deal with the shortfall in western NSW by removing 10-15,000 voters from Upper Hunter , you have to find 10-15,000 voters in the lower hunter valley to replace them . The dislocation that would cause in the lower hunter and central coast would be enormous . <p> Assuming 93 seats are retained , Newcastle , Charlestown and Wallsend are predicted to be under quota , Maitland 6.6% over quota . Everything else is within quota , including the entire central coast . If you take the top end of Upper Hunter out of the seat , it has implications that flow all the way to the Hawkesbury River , changes that are n't required . <p> Antony . What do you think will happen in your opinion with the seat of Goulburn how far west will it be likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Yass and all the way up to Mittagong !

For A While <p> Ever since playing a preview of the upcoming Civilization V expansion a few weeks ago I 've been , as I predicted , sucked into the game . I started with small maps and few competitors , on easy modes , and with every win I 've been ratcheting up the difficulty for the game that follows . Finally , I was playing a game I was proud of . <p> I chose the " Earth " map , and decided this time , I 'd play as George Washington . The game plopped me down in North America , near the Rockies , so I named my capital " Denver " and ran with it . The rest of the world was , likewise , populated in a reasonable way . Genghis Khan and the Mongols ruled central Asia . Nebuchadnezzar II began the Babylonian empire in the middle east , then took over Africa . Isabella ruled Spain , but after circumnavigating the globe ended up conquering the many isles of the South Pacific and settled on a spot of land more or less equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Balkans , rather than in West Africa , but he also found himself between Genghis Khan and Nebuchadnezzar . That did n't last long . <p> Civ is by its nature a slow , strategic , thoughtful game . I decided I was going to go for a cultural victory this time , so I maximized my construction for gold and for culture . I managed a small empire , that in time did stretch from Baja California all the way to Maine , but that only had 5 cities in that span . I saved for the night , thinking that the next day , I might found a city in Alaska . I was getting close to the time when I 'd discover oil , and I suspected I might well find some up north . <p> I saved . I went to bed .

Harald Bluetooth of Denmark then likewise hailed me from the Babylonian capital , and Askia was back : this time , ruling Mongolia . From a city that had n't been its capital before . <p> Nebuchadnezzar had Babylonian ships crowding my borders , but there was no Babylon any longer for them to return to . Isabella was completely gone , and a number of city-states that once had allegiance to Spain were suddenly up for grabs again . <p> My game of Civilization V had suddenly , and very startlingly , turned from a plausible if hugely simplified recreation of human history into what one friend on Twitter accurately called , " some sci-fi shit , right there . " And for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khan had been cheerful , friendly , and diplomatic ? What if the Vikings were landlocked ? What if the Inca survived and flourished ? These were the same " what ifs " that Civ always makes a player wonder , amped up a hundred times . The world was sliced and diced like a science fiction novel , putting different places , times , and rulers together in a way that even video games do not usually account for . I shrugged and settled in for a wild ride . <p> Alas , it came to an end too soon . I hit F12 to capture a screenshot , and was forcefully reminded that bugs are trouble , not fun . On that key press , my entire game vanished and I suddenly found myself staring at another one entirely : a different map , with different civilizations , in a different year , with different rulers and terrain uncovered .

I hope , tonight , the software will let me have my story back . <p> Exact same thing happened to me , I was Denmark , then after the update I was Spain . That was really f'ing annoying since I had spent countless hours and was forced to abandon my empire due to a dodgy update .

@@974236 <h> Three short stories about refugees in Australia <p> 7 CommentsTroy Pittaway 17 June 2012 <p> The first story begins in a three-bedroom Department of Housing house . Inside is a family of seven : single mother and six children aged three to 17 . The house is in terrible shape , because the father , who abused alcohol and was violent , left without paying any of the DHS payments , dumping the mother with the accumulated debt . DHS will not do any repairs until the payment has been met . <p> The house is tiny . The mother shares her bed with four children , while the two teenagers live in the other rooms . There is no privacy , no quiet area for the older boys to study or be alone , little space for the younger children to play . <p> But they are not unhappy . This is far from the worst experience of their lives . <p> The eldest boy Juba , then aged five , and his mother , Esther , had to leave their village in South Sudan . After weeks of aerial attacks , the Sudanese army from the north was approaching to burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began walking , in the general direction of a refugee camp they had been told about .

They had run out of food and water and Juba could no longer go on . Esther laid him down in the grass . Knowing he was n't far from death , she decided to run to find water . Juba recalls lying there , thinking he would die soon . <p> A few hours later Esther returned bearing milk from a cow that she had found . The milk saved Juba 's life . Not long after this they arrived at a UN refugee-processing site and reunited with their extended family .

@@974238 <h> Cultural literacy abandoned for the here and now <p> Australia 's national literacy and testing regime NAPLAN has been and gone for another year , and again critics have raised the usual complaints : standardised , high-risk tests unfairly stigmatise poorly performing schools and pressure teachers to teach to the test , and some schools exclude children who might drag down their results . <p> While such criticisms are valid , there is another more important complaint that needs to be aired . Forcing NAPLAN on schools and classrooms enforces a narrow and sterile view of the curriculum that undermines the type of broad and rich education represented by music , literature and the arts . <p> In primary school , at a time when children should be introduced to myths , fables and legends , folk and classical music and significant sculptures , paintings and other forms of art , the curriculum has been narrowed as the focus is on teaching one dimensional skills devoid of any worthwhile or lasting content . <p> Such a utilitarian view of literacy and numeracy runs counter to what the American educationalist ED Hirsch describes as cultural literacy . Cultural literacy refers to the vast reservoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and works of the imagination and science that distinguishes one culture from another and that enables each one of us to participate in public discourse and debate . <p> Each day , in the popular media , examples abound of sayings and references that constitute cultural literacy -- such as ' he met his Waterloo ' , ' it 's his Achilles heel ' , ' turn the other cheek ' and ' Pandora 's box ' . More contemporary Australian examples include statements like , ' more front than Myers ' , ' more trouble than a Werribee duck ' and ' back of Bourke ' . Not knowing what such things mean condemns one to ignorance . <p> The various subjects that make up a balanced and enriching curriculum also contribute to cultural literacy . To study art is to encounter the great masters , beginning with ancient Greece and Rome and extending to medieval and more recent times . Examples include the Elgin Marbles , Michelangelo 's David , Botticelli 's The Birth of Venus , Rodin 's The Thinker , Monet 's Water Lilies and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To understand and appreciate music there is also a corpus of works and composers that constitute essential learning -- whether the music of Bach , Mozart , Beethoven , Vivaldi , Tchaikovsky , Benjamin Britten or Australian composers like Percy Grainger . While not immediately utilitarian or able to be measured by a test like NAPLAN , enjoying and appreciating music enlivens the soul and speaks to the imagination in a moving and profound way . <p> Defining literacy in a reductionist and superficial way also ignores the vital importance of literature . Primary school children need to encounter the myths , fables and legends that constitute the Western tradition , such as the Iliad and the Odyssey , Norse fables , stories by the Brothers Grimm , and traditional fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk , Cinderella and the Ant and the Grasshopper . <p> Such stories and fables teach children about overcoming adversity and dealing with the emotional and psychological problems we all encounter and have to deal with . Many traditional fables also provide moral lessons and help children develop a much needed moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are bombarded by electronic media and the internet . Mobile phones , e-readers , lap-tops , computers are all conspiring to ensnare children in the here and now and to reduce learning to edutainment -- a form of education based on what can be easily digested and that avoids any form of strenuous concentration or application . <p> By ignoring the need for cultural literacy , children are also denied the knowledge , values and skills so necessary for understanding oneself and for learning how to deal with and relate to other people . No wonder bullying , self-doubt and feelings of insecurity and isolation are on the increase . <p> Politicians like Prime Minister Julia Gillard and School Education Minister Peter Garrett defend NAPLAN on the basis that such tests will lead to higher standards , improved productivity , and a more competitive economy .

But I suspect that your sponsorship deal ends with your business name on their kit . <p> I 'm well aware of the financial advantages of getting sponsorship , especially in kids ' sport .

And it 's sooo true : why do we , in Australia , insist on mentioning sponsors all the time ? ? ? Your line about ' the Qantas Wallabies v Wales Castrol Edge international at Etihad Stadium ' says it all . How about the Keno replay ( thats league ) and all the other names that polute sport ?

@@983238 <h> The Case For Video Games As Music <p> If you 're a regular Kotaku Melodic reader , you 're no stranger to the idea that despite their cinematic aspirations , video games have more in common with music than they do with film . <p> It 's an idea that I 've been pushing at Kotaku for a while now , starting with my first article as a Kotaku columnist last year . " The rhythm of play , " the musical quality of even the most basic video games . Video games practically are music . It feels even truer now then it did then . <p> I 've been happy to see more and more writers and critics talking not just about video game music , but about video games as music . And I 've been just as happy to see an increasing number of game developers thinking along the same lines , creating games that do n't just have good music ; they are good music . <p> In the forward to The Sound Issue of Kill Screen magazine , then-Editor-in-Chief Chris Dahlen eloquently states the case for games as music : <p> All apologies to those who think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no matter how cinematic they become , the with which they have the most in common is music . Both forms marry performance and production , gut and theory , and repetition and spontaneity . Neither one is complete until the work gets a player , and a classic will endure a million renditions , as the performers move from practice , to mastery , to reinvention . Music , like games , is also one of the most soul-cleansing , body-rocking , and mind-blowing creations of man . Life without either is unthinkable . <p> " Most importantly , in practice , both music and games are played- and can be played in very similar ways . " <p> Man , I could n't have put it better myself . ( And I 've tried ! ) The whole magazine issue is a fantastic collection of writing about games and music , and I swear I 'm not just saying that because I wrote an article for it . If you 're into this stuff at all , I recommend ordering a copy . <p> Over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has written a lengthy , fascinating post about finding the spiritual meaning in both games and music . Kanaga is a thoughtful musician and is also something of a philosopher -- he 's responsible for the soundtrack to the overstimulation freakout PS3 game Dyad as well as the music for the supremely cool , chilled-out Proteus . <p> Kanaga 's essay covers a vast amount of territory ; it 's well worth a read , though for this article I 'll focus on his second section discussing the relationship between music and games . <p> The relationship between music and videogames is not a rhetorical one , it 's not just an analogy -- the language describing it may be , but the various identities are a fact . Structurally , there 's little the two forms do n't have in common . This has design implications -- rhythmically , formally , texturally , etc . Most importantly , in practice , both music and games are played -- and can be played in very similar ways . <p> Musical instruments are games , as are compositions . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of play . <p> Videogames are not competitions by necessity , they are play-spaces . Play is the subject and the source of meaning . How do we play ? The kinds of meanings that exist in music are the same kinds of meanings that exist , fundamentally , ( but lying latent ) , in games -- they do n't point at anything but the experience itself , at the materials and interrelationships that form the binding structures of that process . <p> Well said . The relationship between games and music is n't just a metaphorical one . Games are music , they have a real musical aspect to them . Leaving harmony aside , even the simplest games have a rhythm , as I outlined last year , and rhythm is a vital , often-misunderstood element of every video game .

Rhythm is n't something that can easily be put into words , but it is often the thing that makes a good game truly wonderful-and a mediocre game unplayable . <p> Rhythm felt like a good starting place , but in truth it goes beyond rhythm . Harmony , or more simply " notes " , also have a place in the games-as-music conversation . I got a kick out of Julian Benson 's recent article at Rock , Paper Shotgun in which he " transcribes " Jon Blow 's intricate time-bending platformer Braid . <p> At first blush , the article looks similar to the kinds of cool musical analyses that Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But keep reading , and you 'll see that Benson is actually transcribing the game like it 's music , drawing on the work of minimalist composer Steve Reich to put Braid 's shifting , backtracking flow into context , building a modified type of music notation in order to express the events on the screen . <p> He then pushes beyond Braid to other platformers , wondering if we could form a universal form of music-notation ... for all games . ( Granted , this seems like a stretch , but hey , it 's fun . ) Benson describes speed runners -- players who blast through levels in the most efficient way possible -- as concert pianists , describing how notation would allow them to maximise their performances : <p> Notation gives speed runners two things : an ability to view an entire level with all its interlocking movements and a language with which they can share their routes . Much like a conductor is able to lay out an entire concert score , with all its different parts , and comprehend the whole , a speed runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its parts . With that information they can see and devise a route through all the obstacles , all on paper : they can show it to people , other speed runners : it can be consumed faster than video , it can be tweaked an altered by the speed runner community . <p> This all starts to dig a little bit too deep for me ( and that 's saying something ! ) but who cares ? The important thing is that no matter how hard Benson pushes it , the " analogy " holds up . In fact , as Kanaga says , it 's not an analogy at all -- Benson is literally talking about a game while also talking about music . For all intents and purposes , they 're the same thing . <p> Want more ? YOU DO ? OK , let 's keep going . Breaking games down along musical lines makes it much easier to look at them critically . I had been weary of the " Gameplay vs . Story " debate for a long while , until I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lyrics . <p> Music is the foundation of any composition , just like " gameplay " is the foundation of any game . And there will always be games without stories just like there will always be music without lyrics . Lyrics , on their own , are n't music -- they 're just poetry . Story , on its own , is n't a game -- it 's just a novel , or a screenplay . But when you combine them , amazing things can happen -- a piece of music becomes a song . <p> Of course , music has a significant head start over video games in terms of artistic evolution . But because of that , music can also give us a sense of some of the ways that games might mature . Back to Dahlen 's Kill Screen forward : <p> If you 're a fan of both , you may sense a certain sibling rivalry . Music is the older , hormonal one that breaks in through the window after a party ; video games are still sitting on the couch in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embraced by all of our ancestors when they had to get down . video games give us fun , revelation , and satisfaction ; music is rebellious , joyous , and sad , and it 's sexy , often very sexy , something that games have yet to learn to be . <p> But as we 're seeing , games are spending more and more time up off the couch , wearing real pants . More games are out at parties , meeting new people , maybe talking to their friends about joining a battle of the bands . ( Have we pushed the personification thing far enough here ? Heh . ) <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Enough of this criticism junk ! Let 's talk about the games themselves . Specifically , the " New Music Games " that I 've written about before . This year has seen so many games that deliberately use musical sensibilities and concepts to explore new territory . Beat Sneak Bandit was a rhythm game with a unique puzzle-bent -- much like the upcoming Orgarhythm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy . The enjoyably strange Theatrhythm looks to merge Final Fantasy 's now-famous music into a fighting game ( ? ? ) while Dyad , as I mentioned , merges music , visuals and momentum into an unforgettable psychedelic experience . Pippin Barr 's hilarious and surprisingly affecting " Epic Sax Guy " game was a remarkable simulation of musical rehearsal and performance while at the same time acting as a humorous exploration of a weird musical meme . <p> Harmonix , past purveyors of Rock Band 's brand of guitar-controller music simulation , have begun to branch out by reaching back . Their superfun Dance Central games are still more or less what people think of when they think of " Music Games , " ( not that this is a bad thing ) but Rock Band Blitz looks to return to the studio 's Audiosurf roots , making each instrument in a band available to a single game controller . <p> It feels as though we 're just getting started . As more game designers cotton to the innate musical qualities of games , we 'll start seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual music , and merge the ebb and flow of musical composition with the push and pull of game design . <p> In other words : It 's a good time to be into music and video games . Let 's rock . <h> Trending Stories Right Now <p> You can judge a first person shooter almost entirely on the strengths of its shotguns . A good video game shotgun is a bold and challenging weapon ; a bad shotgun is a feather duster at a distance of more than a few feet .

@@1003235 <h> Key Petroleum Turns In A Big Way <p> Tuesday , July 03 , 2012 <p> From bust to boom , Key Petroleum ( ASX:KEY ) has been a quintessential reflection of the economic turnaround in WA 's mining sector . Only last October it was looking down the barrel of financial disaster and forced to cut staff numbers and its own 100% onshore oil production interest in the UK to raise money or lose some of their interests entirely . <p> Like so many mining success stories , Key Petroleum has rallied from its A$0.01 share price , undergoing radical changes within only four months . Already expanding its staff and restructuring its board , Key Petroleum has moved from a dwindling international player with production interests to an Australasia-based explorer . <p> By any stretch it 's a remarkable turnaround yet according to Kane Marshall , who was recently appointed as managing director , this is not a backwards move . He said the key to success was to " keep things lean and mean " , moving away from scattered global assets and instead focusing locally . This also meant its shareholders could keep track of deals and stop wondering where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seismic event within the company for this change to happen . Marshall said that the A$0.01 share price was just the tip of the iceberg of a company that was unfocused . He surmised that industry veteran and Key founder Ken Russell 's exit and a subsequent board reshuffle was due to unhappy shareholders . <p> " There was some shareholder dissent and no apparent light at the end of the tunnel . Share prices were A$0.01 and shareholders wanted to know where the money was being spent . I think it was a combination of everything - the company needed new blood , a new direction and what was in place obviously was n't working . I think it got to a point where unless something changed the company was not going to go anywhere " , Marshall said . <p> The company is now in the extremely prospective Canning Basin through a deal with Empire Oil &amp; Gas ( ASX : EGO ) and is currently reviewing all its international interests while seeking more deals elsewhere in Australasia . <p> The deal with Empire saw Key acquire Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration permits , a production license and a retention license in the Canning Basin , whilst Empire gained 22.25% of the northern Perth Basin permit EP-437 , which the Warren Buffett-backed CalEnergy operates . <p> " We understood the Canning 's great potential but it 's still a distraction . The Perth Basin is so much easier , so much lower-risk and there 's all the infrastructure . We feel that the shale gas stuff is fairly long-term and we 've got so much to do in the Perth Basin . That 's where our management time will be spent " , Dr Warris said . <p> " Ultimately , the West Kora oilfield ( in one of Gulliver 's permits ) is a nice bit of cash flow but it 's not a ' company maker ' . It 's not a huge field and its reserves are minuscule compared to Red Gully , and what we 're hoping to find additional oil and gas fields in the Perth Basin " . <p> The deal with Empire was no coincidence , as the company will be instrumental in Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now chairman at Key , which relocated its office from West Perth to Nedlands to share Empire 's office late last year . Dr Warris , who also has extensive Canning Basin experience , will provide technical advice to Key . <p> While the Perth Basin EP-437 permit is in the process of being reviewed , the interest for Key -- and the eyes of much of the industry -- are on the Canning Basin , especially after Buru Energy 's ( ASX : BRU ) historic oil discovery at Ungani-1 in October last year . Through Gulliver , Key is now involved in three Buru-operated permits : L15 ( West Kora ) and EP 104/R1 ( Stokes Bay-1 ) and EP-438 ( Buru 5% , earning 75% ) . <p> No commercial hydrocarbons were found when two wells were drilled in EP-437 early last year and they were plugged and abandoned -- though Key said that one of them , Dunnart-1 , had " good oil shows " . The joint venture is now reviewing the remaining prospectivity in the block . <p> Key also operates EP-448 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hopeful that ConocoPhillips ' farm-in with New Standard Energy ( ASX : NSE ) in the Canning -- whereby the US unconventional specialist provides 100% of exploration funding of up to $109.5 million -- will be replicated with another company . <p> " The EP-448 permit is particularly prospective as it includes rich oil source rocks of the Goldwyer formation , which are considered some of the richest source rocks in Australia " , Marshall said . <p> Additionally , industry sources say ConocoPhillips likens the Goldwyer play to the " red-hot " Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota , USA , which is one of the most highly productive shale formations in the world . <p> Meanwhile , the prospectivity of the Broome Arch area in EP-438 has been identified as containing potential mid to large size oil and gas prospects . As a result , Key and its joint venture partners plan to drill a commitment well at Cyrene-1 in late 2012 . Previous wells in the area have encountered significant oil and gas shows . The drilling location already has easy access points due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued work into the early part of the wet season and provides for the cost effective transport of oil and access to gas pipeline infrastructure in the event of a discovery . <p> In the near future the joint venture intends to test the Stokes Bay-1 well in Retention Lease R1 , drilled in October/November 2007 . This was to test the Anderson formation , which Key believes has potential recoverable gas of up to 100 Bcf . <p> The primary change in focus for Key has meant that its two production licences in the UK are being reviewed as part of its future restructuring . These licenses include the Lidsey and Brockham oilfields that are producing 100 bpd . Although last year Key was considering drilling another well to improve production , it is being reviewed in addition to South America , Italy and Tanzania interests . <p> " It looks like in the UK the production is relatively low -- 100 barrels per day ( bpd ) from both fields . If we drill another well and get another 50bpd which costs $2 million , will that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders , and the image of the company ? I 'd say not , speaking on behalf of all the people who have invested in our company " , Kane Marshall said . " We 're better off spending the money on technical work in the Canning and trying to farm-out a block which can unlock a resource . " <p> The company 's West Sardinia offshore asset has been a costly exercise . Russell said prior to his departure that Key was working towards an exit . Marshall said this position did n't appear to have changed with the new management . <p> Evidently , shortly after the permit was awarded in April 2010 , the Italian Government temporarily halted offshore drilling in its territorial waters following BP 's Macondo tragedy . It then proposed the enactment of drilling exclusion zones close to environmentally sensitive areas and suspended the awarding of new acreage , including Key 's long-standing other applications . This has meant a complete halt in any potential drilling and any financial viability in the asset . <p> Similarly , viability in its offshore Tanzania interest ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled with the company unable to reach settlement on a reasonable gas sales contract . <p> In Suriname , South America , Key has been participating in a drilling program in two areas adjacent to the sovereign state 's main producing oil fields Tambaredjo and Calcutta . Yet this is also under review , especially with more favourable conditions on a number of fronts in Australia . <p> " We will be focusing on conventional opportunities , probably in mature basins in Australia . We 'll look at a bit of frontier stuff and maybe the Asian arena offshore in Commonwealth waters " , he said . <p> " It only makes sense to do business in Australia where we can get the joint venture partners in through the people we know who we can work with , including the state and federal regulatory bodies . This is preferred rather than going to uncharted waters , which has not favoured the company historically . <p> " It 's all well and good to drill a discovery well in Tanzania for gas , but unless you can actually make money out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're there for the longer haul and you have a big acreage position , then it 's worth it . But we 're not going to be there in the longer term for gas . We do n't have the resources and funds to do it . <p> " You 've got to learn a lesson from what 's happened in Africa with Key and look after your shareholders and say ' this is where we see value : in Australia ' . That 's what we know , that 's what our management team knows , and we should keep it nice and simple rather than having all these minor global interests incurring huge overheads , which do n't really generate anything for our shareholders . There 's no breadwinner in that . " <p> It appears that the sporadic nature of its overseas projects potentially contributed to its December 2011 Half Yearly Report , which painted a grim picture . The data showed that $2 million was lost from general business activities for the half-year , including the write-off of just over $1 million in exploration expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 . With a net capital position of $1,447,434 and a half-year net decrease in cash of $746,037 , Key was faced with losing assets if it could not raise the necessary money and was unable to pay for its work commitments . <p> " Should the group not be successful in its planned capital raisings , it may be necessary to sell further assets and reduce exploration expenditure by various methods including surrendering or withdrawing from less prospective tenements " , the report stated . <p> Marshall , who was brought in to help the company move in a new direction , said it 's all changed now . <p> " Those words about Key do n't reflect where we are now " , he said of the 2011 Half Yearly Report .

A few weeks later I saw the specs for series II and was shocked , vti l had missing features and to get those I had to order the sports , which is out of my budget . Luckily the dealership realised their mistake and managed to get me a series 1 vti l : ) , so I 've got the pedal shifters and side mirror indicators . <p> Tell It As It Is <p> Why get the made in Thailand Civic VTi-LN for $26,990 when you can get the made in Japan Accord Euro for $26,000 ( $29,990 drive away no more to pay ) . It just does n't make sense . <p> guest <p> $29,990 is manual though , auto comes to about 32k . The civic interior is very appealing though and feels great . <p> Turbo123 <p> The $26,990 ( on road costs not included ) Civic is manual as well , a 5spd manual vs the 6spd manual in the Accord Euro . <p> PS <p> Nope , all models above VTI are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic sedans look awesome on the roads , far better than any of its competitots IMHO <p> totallyrouchted <p> the rouched leather says it all .... honda is stuck in 1985 . <p> K20A <p> Haha .. was going to comment on that . If you ca n't do perforation or funky tyre pattern a la Focus ST / GTI .. should have just leave it plain .. <p> Amused <p> Wait .... what ? They have dramatically decreased the level of equipment on the base model saving of only $500 , it this is the result of our Free-Trade-Agreement with Thailand , bring me tariffs and Japan production anyday . <p> MisterZed <p> So production moves to Thailand and prices go up -- makes sense . Looks like they 've also discontinued " Dyno Blue " . <p> John <p> Wow . The Honda marketing people are running rogue , it seems . The Civic range is now almost indecipherable , with a weird split between the sedan and the hatch , with the manual transmission seemingly on the verge of disappearing . <p> Then there 's the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought cheaper prices and/or more equipment . I ca n't see that here . The new VTi level sedan is cheaper than the Series 1 VTi-L , yes , but not enough to compensate for the missing equipment . This is obviously some sort of marketing strategy , but will it work for Honda ? I do n't know -- and I no longer care . Honda do n't make a small car with the combination of body shape/price/features that I want . A lot of other manufacturers do ... <p> PS <p> Though I 'm disappointed in the lack of Manual option in VTI-L and above , I think Honda really is reacting to their previous sales statistics of Manual Vs Automatic . The real Marketing dud is to call the top Model Sports ... how can a Sports model be 5-speed auto ? ? ? It should have been VTI-S or something ... VTI-LN should really be VTI-L Navi .... <p> In terms of pricing , cut them some slack . They already did a lot of price cut for the Series I model and the Hatch ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They obviously made some adjustment with the Series II to fix their bottom line , but at the end of the day , comparison with other small car in the market should still stack up . <p> John <p> Yes , they moved on price . But the price cut for the hatch only looks good when you compare it to what they used to charge for it . The best you can about the price for the hatch now is that it is acceptable , but do n't forget they also cut out a lot of content in the new hatch . <p> The pricing for the sedan has n't moved all that much . <p> I reckon you 're wrong about the Civic stacking up on its objective merits against the other small cars in the market . The Mazda 3 has more equipment and is cheaper . The Hyundai i30 has more equipment and pricing is similar . I could go on . <p> The Civic is still commanding a " Honda premium " only now it really is n't justifiable when you look at the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hyundai too ) , they do have a compelling argument . But buying a car is subjective , some may like one over the other though on paper you 'd wonder why . <p> I owned a Civic Type R and an S2000 before that . I drive a Golf GTI these days because upon end of lease , it seems like it 's the car to go for . " Honda character " ( I would n't go as much as premium " is real . It 's something that you could only appreciate after you 've driven one for sometime and feel rather than just reading magazines and internet forum . <p> To me Honda 's build quality is still better . Gaps between plastics are less obvious , lines are cleaner and they do n't have shiny plastics that would scratch and discolour after one year ( reads : Mini Cooper ) . <p> Other things such as electronics , for example . Auto rain sensing wiper reacts better in the Civic , the audio system is more responsive , etc . Just a few things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with me , some may not . Those who do will buy the Civic . Is n't choice a wonderful thing . <p> John <p> I agree -- buying a car is partly a subjective thing . I just love the look of the new Civic hatch and would probably pay the extra over and above something like a Mazda 3 -- except I want a manual and I want cruise control and the Civic hatch does not provide that combo . <p> Shakeel-ali <p> There is no way they can justify ANY price rises , even if they added that additional equipment . The move to Thailand should have cut prices pretty nicely but as we 've seen so often from Honda of late , they seem to be joining all other marques and jacking up prices even though the car is cheaper to make . <p> Don <p> Based on history , people will buy other bands and Honda will drop price or will offer RRP as Driveaway price . Honda has never learnt from their mistake .

Must say i panicked when I saw they were bringing out new model already but then after finally getting information about the specs glad I bought the series ! . as do not ever want to be stuck in an automatic car . Even though I do n't like the coupe style shape it is lovely to drive spacious inside and have covered the plastic dash with a dash mat rest of interior is fine nice and light as dislike black interiors and would not buy car with full leather interior on moral grounds although stuck with leather steering wheel on vti l. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1052240 and fear - about a rising China <p> In an opinion piece in the state-owned People 's Daily newspaper last month , president of China 's Foreign Affairs University Wu Jianmin argued that Western countries still hold deep prejudices against the country 's political system and the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . <p> According to Wu , there would be much less fear and prejudice if the West made greater efforts to understand the ' real ' China . <p> It makes sense to make more effort to understand such a great , large and enduring country in our region . But deeper understanding will not always lead to greater agreement , and nor should it . <p> There is much to admire and also fear if China is to emerge as the most powerful country in the region . <p> First things first : we should reject the false argument that only Western countries - inflicted with their prejudices - fear a powerful China . It is well known that China has emerged as the largest trading partner of every major country in the region , including Japan , South Korea , Vietnam , Singapore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia . <p> Even so , all of these countries have deepened their strategic and military relations with America and each other as an insurance against China 's rise . Indeed , China has no genuine allies to speak of , with the possible exception of North Korea . <p> For a country of such enormous economic importance to its neighbours , there is a case to be made that China is emerging as the loneliest rising power in world history . <p> We should also address another prevailing myth : that it is only prejudiced Western minds that fear the rise of an authoritarian China . In fact , China is rising in an environment within which every regional great power - Japan , South Korea , India , Indonesia and Australia - is also a liberal democracy . <p> In other words , while democracy can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks , the contemporary embrace of democracy is hardly just a Western obsession . <p> This leads to the question of why we should fear the rise of a powerful and still authoritarian China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Asia 's great liberal democracies have a comparatively free press . Debates on foreign policy are carried out in the open . And when democratic governments are suspected of deceiving the population or concealing important information from them , they are roundly criticized or even removed from office during periodic elections . <p> In contrast , Chinese politics and policy is still largely conducted behind closed doors - with a largely compliant state-owned media serving as a mouthpiece for the government . <p> The Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) is not asked to explain or justify their policies before implementation . Outsiders and many even many Chinese officials remain unsure as to who actually makes the key decisions in the country , and how these are decided . In other words , how Beijing thinks and what it will do is opaque and perhaps even inherently unknowable . <p> The second reason is one of political character . Although China is very different to the place that was ruled by Mao Zedong from 1949-1976 , the CCP still largely stands above the law . <p> All political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by party officials from the top down . Judicial officers are also appointed by the CCP and must swear allegiance to the party . All court decisions must be approved by committees staffed by CCP officials . The CCP 's Central Organization Department even directly appoints senior executives of state-owned-enterprises ( SOEs ) , which considerably enhances the CCP 's influence in China 's state-dominated economy . <p> The upshot is that in such a set-up , rule-of-party will ultimately triumph rule-of-law in any conflict . These are hardly the conditions within which habits of compromise , tolerance and negotiation become learned behaviours . <p> These points have to be understood alongside the reality that China is the only genuinely dissatisfied great power in Asia . It has border disputes with India over a Switzerland-sized land mass in the Indian-held territory of Aranuchal Pradesh . Chinese claims over 80 per cent of the South China Sea put these at odds with counter claims by Vietnam , the Philippines , Brunei and Malaysia . <p> And unlike every other significant power in Asia , China feels deeply unsatisfied with relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce through Asia 's sea-lanes . Even if the latter is understandable , the point remains that China is emerging as the only challenger to the regional status quo welcomed by every other Asian sea-trading nation . <p> In international affairs , there is a prudent assumption that the strong do what they can and the weak(er) countries suffer what they must . Governments in powerful democratic countries , like America , can also behave selfishly , ruthlessly and destructively . But when they do , they must answer to domestic and international critics , and can be periodically removed from office swiftly and without the spilling of blood . <p> In other words , democratically elected governments tend to pay for their mistakes , or must at least explain or defend them .

@@1054235 <p> Watching anime with an society of anime enthusiasts leads to two things , people shouting funny things at the screen and realizations based on those things being shouted at the screen . The audience will establish nicknames for characters that will sum up the character pretty well , such as the main character of Darker than Black basically being Chinese Electric Batman and Hokuto no Ken ( Fist of the North Star ) basically starring Kung Fu Action Jesus . It was then that it occurred to me that there really only three different male leads in a show ; Jesus , Batman , and the Dolt . <p> What entails the Jesus male lead ? First off , the title is n't to aggravate , but most easily get the point across . This male lead is basically there to save the world or a specific group of people , they also tend to have some supernatural or unbelievable power that they wield . As stated before Kenshiro of Hokuto no Ken is pretty much this , though he is n't the pacifist type , so the preceding " Kung Fu Action " classes him better . Other examples are Adam Blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takuto of Stardriver . It 's also pretty common to see these leads will to sacrifice themselves to save everyone , but not all Jesus leads do this nor all characters who do this are Jesus leads . <p> What about that Batman lead ? Batmans do n't have over and beyond powers , simply being better trained or practiced . More often than not , Batmans fight for a better cause or have some ideals though not always or right away like Hei from Darker than Black . Batmans are generally more martial arts , but they can be an intellectual better too . Other examples of a Batman lead are Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop , Kino from Kino 's Journey , and Kaito from Phi Brain : Puzzle of God , who listeners of the podcast may have already heard me refer to as Puzzle Batman . Another common theme may be the Batman lead being an orphan , or losing family members at a young age , like say parents being killed by a puzzle ( no , seriously ) . <p> If you really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching enough anime . The Dolt exists for almost no reason other than maybe advancing plot a little or just to have a male lead .

The male leads from both Deadman Wonderland and The Future Diary exist as Dolts to further the more bad-ass female leads . This is even almost on a whole different level with Italy from Hetalia . These are more or less are there for the audience to relate to I suppose , as well as comic relief . <p> Do n't think that is simply the end of it either . Even though there are only three different male leads in anime , there are some variation with either a male lead having more than one lead type , like Vash the Stampede being Desert Dolt Jesus in Trigun or Lupin being Thief Dolt Batman in any Lupin the 3rd .

@@1054236 <p> If the success of the Transformers cartoon series has taught us anything , it 's that a successful TV show can massively change the fate of a toy brand . An idea that begins as a simple marketing gimmick can quickly spread into a cultural phenomenon . When Hasbro first conceived the idea for ' My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic ' , they probably did n't quite grasp how dramatically the show would change the face of a toy line designed for young girls . It 's no secret that the internet has developed something of an obsession with this particular cartoon series . Now , recently released to DVD , viewers of all ages and genders can take home the very first DVD volume : ' Friendship Changes Everything ' to see where the series first kicked off . <p> STORY <p> For what most would expect to be a relatively simple children 's show , the Friendship is Magic ( FiM ) series features a setting that is surprisingly well thought out , with many memorable fleshed out characters and plot lines . The story of My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic begins with a studious unicorn named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown to be a social recluse , often spending much of her time locked inside Canterlot Castle with few friends to speak of besides her teacher Princess Celestia and her pet dragon Spike . <p> To change the attitude of her student , the Princess sends Twilight and Spike out into the land of Equestria , to stay and make friends in a town called Ponyville . ( And this is just the beginning of the horse based puns . ) It is here where viewers are introduced to the other five lead characters of the series , each with different jobs , talents and personalities : Apple Jack , a hard working farmer girl with a southern drawl ; Rarity , a stylist with a mind for fashion ; Pinkie Pie , the upbeat , giggling and often random minded party lover ; Fluttershy , a timid soft spoken Pegasus who cares for animals ( and my personal favourite ) ; and Rainbow Dash , a fan favourite due to her bravery , speed and self confidence . Our protagonist Twilight eventually makes friends with all five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the series . Throughout the course of this first collection , the girls will uncover a plot to shroud the world in darkness , settle a competitive dispute , learn that some things in life ca n't be done alone , and teach a particularly mean spirited Griffon a little humility . <p> With the exception of the first two episodes , the series features little in the way of a continuative plot , where each episode tells an individual story . Each episode generally focuses on one of the lead six learning some form of life lesson which is reflected and expressed as a letter towards Princess Celestia at the end of each story . Unlike the PSA type messages that were often dropped into the ending of an episode of Superman or Captain Planet , the show creators have done a particularly good job at themeing each of the episodes around particular personal issues that many children will grow up having to deal with . And as for the adults watching the show , it does n't hurt to be reminded of these lessons sometimes too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a show that was supposed to be oriented towards a demographic of young girls , the episode plots are mature and sensible . Viewers will take the show seriously because the show takes their audience seriously , a fact that few shows can honestly claim . The writing staff in particular should be applauded for being able to create dialogue and situations that caters towards all ages and demographics . In doing so , the show never feels like it 's excluding anyone , regardless of age and gender . Even the episodes that involved signing a life lesson , which I would usually abhor , were made interesting and appealing with a little clever writing , and a big dosage of Pinkie Pie 's particular brand of crazy . <p> VISUALS <p> One of the shows strongest selling points , besides the writing , is the animation style and visuals . All of the environments and places that are visited in Ponyville and Equestria are very lively and full of colour . Even the darker settings have well drawn and coloured backgrounds and objects . Movement animations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to be . Viewers would be able to look for hours and not find an ounce of lazy or poorly drawn animation . <p> The characters themselves are drawn with remarkable detail . Each character is coloured remarkably simply , usually in a singular colour with darker shaded outlines , with the exception of haircuts and unique cutie marks ( the symbols that appear on each ponies back legs ) . This simple colouring and design scheme makes each of the characters uniquely individual in appearance , without going over the top in terms of design extras . Overall , the visuals are very well developed for this day and age of animation . And despite being drawn for a style of a children 's cartoon , the show 's visual simplicity gives the series an inherent cuteness without being " too cutesy " . <p> AUDIO <p> The soundtrack applied to the series is well appropriated , and many of the tracks stand out as quite memorable , depending on the character or situation they 're applied to . For instance , Rainbow Dash 's flight theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reimagining of the original ' My Little Pony ' song for the theme song is unfortunately catchy , and particularly hard to get out the your head . But in all honesty , it 's the only part of the show that does seem a bit " kiddy cutesy " . <p> On the other hand , the voice acting talent is very well performed . The personalities of each of the lead cast and well and truly captured in their voices . For example , Rarity 's refined vocal style , Fluttershy 's soft stuttering and Apple Jack 's southern accent . Again , although the original purpose of the show was to support the girls toy line , the voice acting portrays the characters as mature and almost adult . As an added bonus , the writing compliments many of the voices very well in creating genuine moments of laugh out loud humour . The fact that the characters use words that seem far more mature for the intended audience age is yet another indication of the show taking its audience seriously . <p> OVERALL <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show for little girls " are most likely judging based on face value alone . As someone who was initially dubious about the series going in to watch , I can say that I was honestly impressed . What may have started out as a mere kids show has certainly earned its notoriety online for being a well animated and well written series . Despite the small misgivings that appear childish on the outside , they 're redeemed by the strengths of a truly unique story and setting , well developed characters and a genuinely unique sense of humour . And although it 's only 5 episodes long , this volume is a must have for any devoted Brony or Pegasister. 
@@1054238 <p> Robinson , after helping Geelong to its 2007 flag , moved to the Bombers from the Gold Coast during the off-season and said in the same interview that his philosophy was a simple one . <p> " The least-fatigued side , at the end of the day and the end of the season , is going to win . Being fit and strong and having a body that can handle collisions is going to allow you to carry less fatigue and perform at a higher level . <p> " It 's not fitness . Fitness is probably the same , or very similar , across the league if we were to VO2 max every side . It 's the ability to recover and reduce fatigue and having a bigger body will do that in my opinion . That 's why I believe Essendon wanted me to come here . <p> Coach James Hird announced at the weekend that the club had launched a review of its soft tissue woes . <p> It has scaled back its mid-week training to help stem the flow of injuries . <p> THE FEAR FACTOR <p> GEELONG players felt some deja vu last Friday night when watching Essendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinging rebuke at quarter time .

That is alarming given the Bombers compete in an environment that includes some of the least competitive AFL teams . <p> Between rounds 9-18 they kicked at an extremely healthy 68.2 per cent , a figure that has dropped to 63 per cent in the past nine rounds . <p> So who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73.2 per cent to 62.2 per cent and as the team 's best midfield ball carrier , that hurts . <p> But he is n't on his own . Dustin Fletcher ( 84.5 per cent to 75.9 per cent ) has found himself under siege in defence so his drop can be explained in part . <p> Others to have recorded worrying drop-offs include Ricky Dyson ( 67 per cent to 58.8 per cent ) Ben Howlett ( 64.9 to 52.1 ) Angus Monfries ( 65.5 to 51.4 ) and Ryder , when fit , ( 70.4 to 58.3 ) . <p> LACK OF EFFORT <p> HAWTHORN probably would have beaten anyone last Friday night , but even they were surprised at the lack of applied pressure from their opponents . <p> The Hawks were given unexpected space to set up with their precision kicking as Essendon 's intensity , so evident in April-May , hit sub-standard levels . <p> Take their tackling as an example , a figure that sometimes rises when you lose given the other side has more of the ball . The Bombers ranked ninth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 14th at 60.2 in rounds 10-18 . <p> Champion Data pressure stats placed Essendon sixth in rounds 1-9 , but they have dropped to 14th . <p> Stanton was averaging 130.1 points a game in rounds 1-9 , but in the eight rounds since has averaged just 83.9 .

Karmichael Hunt , the match-winner in the club 's only win this season , was cleared for his heavy knock on Swan Ben McGlynn . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Hunt has had a good year in the middle and continues to improve , but he certainly needs a breather . Andrew Hamilton , our esteemed AFL expert at The Courier-Mail , believes he has hit the wall . We agree with Hammo -- K needs a rest and no one will think any less of him for doing so . <p> ON THE CUSP : Some good news for the Suns with midfielder Michael Rischitelli tipped to return from his week off after succumbing to an ankle and knee injury . It will be a timely boost to the midfield if Hunt goes out . The ex-Lion has had a great year and needs to perform if the Suns are to score a second win this season . Big forward Sam Day will also come back in after having a one-week breather . <p> NICK SMART 'S FORECAST : Very winnable game this week for the Suns up against Melbourne at the MCG . Bluey McKenna likes to set his team up for the games where they are a red-hot chance and this one would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshened up Day are good inclusions and it will all depend on their attitude . If they put some scoreboard pressure on the mentally fragile Dees early , they are every chance . It would be their first win at the home of the football and that will serve nicely as motivation for them . <p> ON THE BLOCK : Jonathan Patton is likely to miss after being subbed out of a match he was having very little impact on . Patton spent the last quarter on the bench icing his left knee -- the same one he had surgery on in Sweden during the preseason . Throw a blanket over Haynes , Townsend , Bruce and Hoskin-Elliott as others in the mix to miss . <p> ON THE CUSP : Chad Cornes ( virus ) will be doing everything he can to come up against his old team . Adam Kennedy was the Giants ' best in the NEAFL along with Jack Hombsch , Mark Whiley and Steve Clifton . Nathan Wilson kicked three goals . <p> GILBERT GARDINER 'S FORECAST : The figures are staggering and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was saying GWS is better-placed than Gold Coast in year one . The Suns had three wins on the board after Round 18 last year while the Giants have one , albeit against the Coasters . To be fair , the Giants were competitive early doors , with the likes of Coniglio , Cameron , Greene , Smith and Shiel doing their bit for the cause . But all of a sudden the wheels have fallen off and a dream debut has turned into a nightmare for all concerned at Blacktown . There is an injury cloud over the No.1 pick , the NRL convert is struggling and the club has had 99 goals kicked against it in the past four weeks for losses of 162 , 119 , 95 and 120 points . Where to from now ? Can a club in an NRL heartland afford to be getting punished each week ? I think not . On a positive note , the Giants can look forward to ' winnable ' at the very least competitive hit outs against Port Adelaide , Gold Coast and Melbourne before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the young , tired and weary Giants are concerned , Mad Monday ca n't come quick enough ! <p> ON THE BLOCK : Good luck finding players to come out of this side . Are the Hawks playing the sexiest footy we 've ever seen ? They are a mile ahead of the pack and have the comp 's best player sitting in the stands . Max Bailey could be the unlucky omission while Shane Savage is on the edge after starting as the sub . Other than that Clarko 's mob is looking very settled . Even Jack Gunston now looks safe -- he 's clunked grabs and booted goals like another No. 19 the past two weeks . Oh , the joys of a hunger to keep your place in a strong side . <p> ON THE CUSP : L. Franklin . Does n't get much bigger than that . Hawks assistant coach Leon Cameron said he expected Buddy to be fit to face the Cats but the superstar must get through training this week . Hale is also ripe to come back after taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposals in the VFL on return ) are doing all they can in Box Hill threads . <p> SAM LANDSBERGER 'S FORECAST : This mob has n't missed a beat since falling to the Tigers by 11 goals back in Round 9 . How ridiculous does that result seem now ? Surged to second place at the weekend , meaning a home final is now theirs to lose . The Cats , Sydney ( away ) and Eagles ( home ) in the run home will determine if the Hawks can book an MCG qualifying final . <p> ON THE BLOCK : The revolving door will snare a few more this week as the Dees are seemingly out to try every single permutation of team selection before Mark Neeld 's testing first year is out . Strauss , Dunn and Blease will all be feeling uncertain after quiet outputs against the Roos . While Jetts cops a week for front-on contact on Lindsay Thomas . <p> ON THE CUSP : Another win for top-of-the-table VFL affiliate Casey . Hard to go past onballer Jordan Gysberts who was supreme with 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand up for a recall with 32 disposals , 10 of which were used to pump the ball inside 50 . Liam Jurrah will also line up this week -- mail is he 'll get a run at Casey and potentially at reserve grade . <p> SAM LANDSBERGER 'S FORECAST : This is the one . Gold Coast at the MCG on Sunday . Surely a win is on the horizon and with GWS to follow in Round 21 Melbourne has the chance to end the season with a winning feeling . Expect them to gobble that up with the added luxury of being able to clinch two victories and maintain picks three and four in the draft . <p> ON THE BLOCK : Big blow for the Roos with small forward Lindsay Thomas to miss two weeks for his high bump on Demon Dan Nicholson . Adams could also miss after spending the second half on the bench nursing a shoulder injury . Fortunately for the Roos , he will not require surgery and ( if fit ) could play this week . <p> ON THE CUSP : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruckman Hamish McIntosh played in the VFL on the weekend and got through with " flying colours " according to the Kangaroos website . McIntosh teamed up with rookie Majak Daw in the Werribee 's three-goal win over Box Hill . Ayden Kennedy put his hand up for a recall along with swingman Cameron Pedersen . Meanwhile , suspended star Jack Ziebell returns to Melbourne on Saturday after attending a high altitude training camp in Utah . <p> GILBERT GARDINER 'S FORECAST : Did n't think I 'd be saying this after mid-season losses to the Western Bulldogs , Port Adelaide and Hawthorn but the Kangaroos are flying . Coach Brad Scott has his charges playing a high-risk high-reward brand of football which has resulted in six wins from seven matches and a spot in the top eight . Spearhead Drew Petrie has been the star of the renaissance bagging a staggering 22.1 in his last five matches . North should dispose of the hapless Dogs on Saturday before games against Essendon and Collingwood . Two wins from the next three will all but shore up the Roos ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , both at Etihad Stadium , to round out the season . <p> ON THE BLOCK : Jackson Trengove ( 12 disposals ) had a torrid day , operating at 50 per cent efficiency before being subbed off in the final quarter . Daniel Stewart provided a spark early in the third quarter but it was short-lived . It was a case of chocolates to boiled lollies for Paul Stewart who backed up a five-goal haul last week ( just days after re-signing with the club ) with 10 disposals and no shots on goal . <p> ON THE CUSP : Emerging Port star Hamish Hartlett must prove his fitness during the week to make the trip to western Sydney . Jacob Surjan was given a light hit out in the SANFL on his way back from a hip injury . Surjan collected 13 disposals including two rebound 50s . Cam Hitchcock slotted two goals while David Rodan will most likely return through the SANFL . <p> GILBERT GARDINER 'S FORECAST : There 's not a lot to play for at Alberton these days but not even Port 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spearhead Jay Schulz is not far away while Hartlett will be handy to have back in the midfield . It 's hard to see Port doing a Hawthorn or Collingwood on the hapless Giants but it should still be a comfortable win at Skoda Stadium . <p> ON THE BLOCK : Oh boy . Where do you start ? A seething Damien Hardwick would probably have half his side on the block this week but the reality is many will be safe because there just is n't the cattle to replace them . The Tigers worst enemy right now is their depth -- or lack of it . Many players went missing in patches against the Blues -- especially in the frenetic final five minutes . Addam Maric had no impact when he was substituted on , Kelvin Moore battled , Reece Conca has n't come on this year like a glossy draft choice should and the likes of Matt Dea and Jayden Post are fringe players at best . <p> ON THE CUSP : Not a whole lot . VFL affiliate Coburg , fielding 10 AFL-listed players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a round . Hopefully Batchelor and Griffiths will be fit but Todd Elton was the only AFL-listed talent to show any promise Coburg 's 99-point loss . He and Brad Miller could be considered this week . And while he 's a little while off AFL action , great to see Brad Helbig back playing footy after a long layoff . Jeromey Webberley did have 26 touches for Coburg while Angus Graham recorded 47 hitouts , largely helped by Robbie Warnock 's withdrawal . <p> SAM LANDSBERGER 'S FORECAST : The mental demons are now the worry at Punt Rd . When it gets tight the Tigers do n't go into their shells -- they wilt . One expert yesterday lamented they gift-wrapped Carlton the four points on Saturday night . With finals gone its imperative Richmond finishes the year strongly to provide a platform for 2013 . Trips to face Freo and the Lions as well as a clash with Essendon shape as stern tests . It 's immeasurable but would love to know how much scarring the Gold Coast loss inflicted on Richmond . <p> ON THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamstring went ping again against the Dogs forcing the Saints to activate their substitution . Beau Wilkes was cleared by the MRP for the tackle which ended Daniel Cross 's season . Regardless , Wilkes is still borderline at the Saints . He failed to kick a goal despite clunking a few big grabs , finishing with 0.3 . Sam Dunell again started as the sub in a sign he is also on the periphery , but other than that it is happy days at the Saints , which probably should 've won by more than 76 points after chalking up 16 more shots on goal . <p> ON THE CUSP : Sandringham had the bye but Farren Ray must surely be in contention . He 's had a horror run by Saints match committee this year , playing well when included but failing to cement a senior place . Tom Ledger also close while kids Seb Ross and Daniel Markworth progressing nicely in the VFL . Arryn Siposs will also be in the mix to face the Pies if deemed fit . <p> SAM LANDSBERGER 'S FORECAST : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet sit 10th on the ladder . It tells you they 're stiff , it 's a ridiculously even season and they 've got no margin for error in the run home . Must win three if not four games out of five to play finals . With Melbourne and GWS in there they can lock two away and then it boils down to crunch games against last year 's grand finalists -- the Pies and Cats . Their season could hinge on the final-round bout with Carlton . An exciting finish is ahead.SYDNEY <p> GILBERT GARDINER 'S FORECAST : Sydney is good , really good in fact , but Carlton is on the up and can taste a late-season run at the eight . The narrow confines of Etihad Stadium should suit the Swans over the MCG and with the form of emerging stars Jack , Hannebery , Jetta and Kennedy it 's hard to go past Longmire 's charges . The Swans are also getting plenty out of their experienced heads in O'Keefe , Goodes , Bolton , McVeigh and All Australian full back Ted Richards . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLOCK : Darren Glass will miss one week for a reckless bump on Jonathan Brown late yesterday . The other concern for the Eagles is the fitness of Daniel Kerr , who was subbed off against Brisbane with what appeared to be a lower hamstring strain . Ruckman Dean Cox was troubled with a knock to the knee before half time but played on and had an impact -- will play . Sam Butler went missing in the second half while Brad Sheppard had a patchy afternoon . <p> ON THE CUSP : Key defender Mitch Brown and the hard-running Jacob Brennan are most likely to replace Glass in West Coast 's defence . Andrew Embley collected 16 disposals , seven marks and four inside 50s in his first game since dislocating his shoulder in Round 2 . Embley patrolled along the wing and across half forward in Swan Districts win over Subiaco . Wingman Bradd Dalziel , returning from a knee injury , gathered 27 possessions and six marks put his hand up for a recall along with Tom Swift ( 28 touches ) , Andrew Strijk ( 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Newman ( two goals ) . <p> GILBERT GARDINER 'S FORECAST : The Western Derby is a fiery affair at the best of times , let alone when it has finals ' ramifications . West Coast needs to win to keep its top-four hopes alive while Fremantle ( currently ninth ) must win to stay in the top-eight race . If there is any doubt on Kerr , he will miss . It 's as simple as that as the Eagles ca n't afford to lose the silky ball winner so close to the finals . Embley could be another week away but expect Dalziell to slot back into the team . Eagles , but only just . <p> ON THE BLOCK : Out comes warrior Daniel Cross after undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery . But do n't expect the omissions to stop there after yet another woeful performance -- perhaps the worst of an already bad bunch . What to do with Liam Jones ? The key forward has gone backwards on the strong-marking target with unbridled potential he looked last year . He had one kick against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second term yet was quiet , young kid Daniel Pearce is n't quite ready , compiling just three kicks and while he 's no chance to face the axe , Brian Lake 's endeavour just was n't there at times against the Saints . <p> ON THE CUSP : The Dogs affiliate Williamstown enjoyed a spirited win , so there were a few rays of hope on an otherwise ugly weekend . Surely Justin Sherman comes in to face the Roos . The former Lion was phenomenal -- 28 touches and three goals including match-winner kicked 45m from the boundary and with a heavy ball . If he can reproduce that each week the Dogs will be proud to have him . Dyl Addison returned from a broken jaw and booted two in the last quarter for Williamstown while Tommy Campbell rucked well and gathered 17 touches around the ground . Elevated rookie Jason Johannisen was held over and remains in the mix to debut , while Michael Talia is progressing nicely . The key defender -- who was snaffled with a bargain pick -- held Port Melbourne star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round 7 this year . Expect him to debut before the season is dusted . <p> SAM LANDSBERGER 'S FORECAST : The positives ? Draft choices five and six are headed to Whitten Oval . And boy , do the Dogs need a couple of good drafts . They 've hit the wall this year and would be long odds to sing the song again . Mitch Wallis remains one of the brightest points of 2012 and is a chance to snare the Rising Star award , Dickson looks a player and turned it on early yesterday while at least new coach Brendan McCartney has injected serious game time into the likes of Roughead , Cordy , Dahlhaus and Smith this year . <p> A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING : We collect information about the content ( including ads ) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites .

@@1064234 <p> Geelong snatched the win from Hawthorn at the brink of the horn , winning a very close 118-116 at the MCG . <p> GEELONG ace Steve Johnson revealed yesterday he had to survive two concussion tests to play a starring role in Friday night 's amazing victory . <p> Johnson said club doctors called for a second test as late as the morning of the game before clearing him fit to tackle Hawthorn at the MCG . <p> Despite not " feeling great " and still sporting a swollen mouth from last weekend 's heavy hit by Adelaide 's Scott Thompson , Johnson kicked two goals in an inspiring 10-possession opening quarter as a midfielder . <p> And he was part of the Cats ' crucial last act of play that landed the ball to Tom Hawkins who booted that 55m winning goal after the final siren . <p> " I had n't been concussed before .

Source : Getty Images <p> THEY say a week is a long time in footy and Fremantle demonstrated 10 weeks is an eternity as the Dockers consigned their Round 9 derby debacle to history with a vengeance . <p> While the day belonged to the imperious Matthew Pavlich , who finished with eight goals in the biggest derby bag from a Docker , the skipper had to share top billing for a quarter with the tempestuous Hayden Ballantyne in Fremantle 's 65-point victory over a shell-shocked West Coast . <p> The pair added three goals each for the third term , as if in competition as the degree of difficulty rose on each occasion in the triumph . <p> Pavlich might have been the matchwinner and a rightful recipient of the Ross Glendinning Medal , but it was Ballantyne 's third term cameo that warmed the hearts of a raucous purple army . <p> They cried with him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their bitter rival , and they celebrated with him on Saturday as he buried the demons of his after-the-siren poster and buried the Eagles in the process . <p> While Pavlich and Ballantyne were the headline acts , it was the Freo midfield that deserved equal plaudits as David Mundy , Michael Barlow and Nat Fyfe and company gave their counterparts a bath . <p> Despite a brilliant lone hand played by a gutsy Daniel Kerr ( 36 disposals and 11 clearances ) , the Eagles were again badly beaten up at the stoppages in a worrying sign ahead of the contested cauldron that is the finals series . <p> The Dockers laid the platform in the first half , restricting the Eagles to their lowest halftime derby score of 1.10 ( 16 ) as they opened up a 32-point lead . <p> Kerr shrugged off his hamstring complaint to take his place and had his wish to be spared the No.1 tag when Dockers shut-down man Ryan Crowley went to Luke Shuey and held him to six first-half touches . <p> Jack Darling had his status as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , while Eagles tagger Scott Selwood went to Fyfe as some traditional derby match-ups were given a shake up by the coaches . <p> Darling had West Coast 's first major from a free kick after McPharlin was placed on report , with the long set shot conversion the Eagles ' only goal of the first half . <p> Replays showed McPharlin has little to worry about , with his forceful bump collecting a hunched over Darling in the shoulder rather than the head . <p> The younger Selwood did well against Fyfe early but was looking for a place to hide nearing quarter-time as his shocking pass at half-back floated into the arms of a gleeful Ballantyne , before the play ended with Michael Walters booting the Dockers ' fourth goal from the goalsquare . <p> It enabled Freo to take a 15-point lead to the first change , built on the back of centre square control despite an energetic Kerr having 10 touches for the quarter and 20 by the major break . <p> It was a relaxed John Worsfold who gave a quarter-time interview to premiership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side was well in the match but had just missed opportunities in front of goal . <p> Worsfold 's pulse would have jumped in the second stanza , as Clancee Pearce extended the Dockers ' advantage and the Eagles continued to spray shots . <p> He would have been in a lather when Pavlich shrugged off Eric Mackenzie to bag his third , as the sellout crowd began to dance in the rain . <p> The Dockers dominated the second term , winning the inside-50 count 18-6 and dominating the Coasters in the clearance and contested-ball counts . <p> If the Eagles were to make a stand it had to come immediately in the third term . While Nic Naitanui and Kerr combined for a classy opening clearance , it was the Dockers who sensed victory and rammed home their advantage with goals to Ballantyne and Tendai Mzungu . <p> Darling ended the decisive run of seven consecutive goals when he booted West Coast 's second goal seven minutes into the third quarter , Pavlich became the outright leader in the Coleman Medal when he slotted his sixth goal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More importantly , it restored a 44-point lead for Fremantle . <p> Goals to Quinten Lynch and Ashton Hams brought the Eagles back to within 32 points , but the Dockers piled on the last four goals of the term to extend the lead to an unassailable 58 points by the final change . <p> News.com.au 's Privacy Policy includes important information about our collection , use and disclosure of your personal information ( including to provide you with targeted content and advertising based on your online activities ) .

@@1086234 <p> Still aching to scratch that FPS itch at school , work , on the bus , or anywhere that is n't home ? And not with virtual controls ? Sony 's handheld Vita , with its twin analogue sticks , should have been the device to scratch that itch . Sadly , though , the handheld has been light on first person shooters even after six months on the market . Activision aims to change that with Call of Duty : Black Ops Declassified , a Vita-only version of the most popular FPS around , Call of Duty . The game was unveiled with a gameplay trailer yesterday at Sony 's Gamescom press conference , and I got to see more of it at the show afterward . <p> Declassified is a traditional FPS in the truest sense-it 's fast , with full FPS controls and functions ( plus a few not possible on traditional consoles ) . Declassified has everything to make COD players feel right at home , from Create-A-Class to perks to Prestige levelling . While Activision did n't allow any hands-on time with the game here at Gamescom , the company did show gameplay of a live 2v2 match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- still slower than other Call of Duty titles , but the almost frantic run-and-gun gameplay is n't lost in translation . It does look more like Call of Duty 3 graphically than more recent COD titles , which is to be expected considering the Vita 's hardware . <p> Declassified tells a tale set between the first and second Black Ops titles , which Activision is n't revealing just yet . The publisher claims that the solo campaign will be objective-based so users can easily jump into and out of a game without feeling lost . Multiplayer will feature up to 8-player competitive play over Wi-Fi across six different multiplayer maps . The major multiplayer modes , including Free for All , Team Deathmatch , and Kill Confirmed will all return , along with online matchmaking . <p> On top of that , Declassified improves on the traditional FPS gameplay using Vita 's front and rear touch panels . Sure , the Vita does n't have bumpers , but the touch screen controls grenade throws ( for throwing , aiming , and cooking ) , melee attacks , sniping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activation of kill streaks . And for the first time in a Call of Duty title grenades can be lobbed in any way the player chooses . Using finger swipes , players can completely control the throw , to the extent that it can be thrown backwards without turning around . <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops : Declassified looks like a promising FPS on the Vita , which is something that the console desperately needs . Developer Nihilistic Studios ( best known for the roundly disappointingResistance : Burning Skies ) might not have the skills needed to make a game that will satisfy Call of Duty fans . Then again , this the first time a game developer has been put to the test with a major franchise on a new platform . <p> For the sake of the Vita , and mobile shooters in general , I hope Nhilistic delivers . <p> I saw a recoloured car mofel from the resistance campaign in that trailer .

Sadly there are no repulsor rays ! <p> On top of the boring battle system , Shengdao also offered a weird take on the Pokemon dynamic with monster catching . Certain monsters in the game appear with a collar icon ; after weakening said monster , there is the chance to capture it and make it into a pet . So far the only thing that pets can do , apart from being eye candy , is help attack monsters . <p> The only thing that I found slightly in Shengdao was the perhaps its most underrated and under publicized feature , the dual worlds . Within the world of Shengdao , there are basically two worlds that the player can jump in and out of at certain points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them A and B. <p> In world A , everything is pretty much normal . The monsters in world A are creatures such as spiders , lions , and mountain bandits . But a quick jump to world B , the monsters are now grotesque creatures , things out of a sci-fi novel . This element of the dual worlds sort of livened up the game for me . I was mostly interested in seeing what kind of monster was the counterpart to the one that I had just killed . Plus the " dimensional " shift animation made it look like my Iron Man was imploding on itself . <p> The teleporting worlds aside , I was very disappointed by Shengdao . Looking at it on paper and in its advertising material it looked like something different , but take away the shiny Iron Man suit , Kratos skin , and what have you and in the end Shengdao is like every other Chinese online martial arts fantasy game . <p> Rare continues to roll out behind-the-scenes videos , and they have now given us a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how close this game was to being another Bond game , or how the Game Boy Camera was almost used to let players map their faces onto characters !

@@1104234 <p> It 's like a verbal tic - it 's what you say when you 're not sure what to say . WorkChoices is for Labor Party strategy what " umms " and " errs " are for impromptu speeches . <p> One day in February 2010 the ACTU said it would campaign against Kevin Rudd 's industrial changes -- they did not believe Fair Work was fair enough for workers . The next day Julia Gillard put out a press release : " Abbott must come clean on WorkChoices " . <p> " Australians ca n't trust Tony Abbott on WorkChoices " , the ALP told Australia citizens during the 2010 election . The next day Abbott promised that WorkChoices is dead , buried , and cremated . Undeterred , two days later Simon Crean sent out a press release : WorkChoices " has been dug up , dusted off , and is ready to be rolled out should the Coalition be elected . " Labor 's divining rod finds WorkChoices everywhere . <p> So no wonder the Labor Party went into convulsions when this week the Australian Financial Review reported that John Howard wants revive the industrial relations debate . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the policy they campaigned to destroy . Wayne Swan rushed out a press conference . **32;272;TOOLONG was again the message of the day . <p> But Howard was n't even talking about WorkChoices . The former prime minister wanted Abbott to adopt the Peter Reith model , which predated WorkChoices by nearly a decade . As he said , " There is no reason why this country should not go back to the workplace system we had between 1996 and 2005 where you had individual contracts . " This line was widely cited in articles which nonetheless claimed Howard was calling for the return his post-2005 policy . <p> At most -- at most -- Howard suggested the Fair Work Act 's loose unfair dismissal provisions be tightened . His words : " you have got to do something about unfair dismissals . " <p> This is a reasonable view , even if you do n't agree with it . Under WorkChoices , one exception to an unfair dismissal finding was if an employee was made redundant for ' genuine operational reasons ' . That exception has been replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for instance ) only allows dismissals if workers can not be given another job elsewhere . This new standard turns industrial judges into human resource managers . Questioning the new standard is n't revolutionary . Howard 's view is modest ; almost shy . <p> Anyway , Howard 's views are moot . He 's no longer prime minister . There is no reason to believe Abbott is thinking about touching this hot potato . Dead , buried , and cremated , remember ? Given his campaign against the carbon tax , there 's nothing a first term Abbott government will be more sensitive to than charges that the Coalition has broken an election promise , or did n't tell the voters about its plans . The firmest guarantee an Abbott government will do what it says is how brutally they 've attacked Labor for doing the opposite . <p> WorkChoices is an apparition .

Four years after it was abolished , WorkChoices is now less a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Labor base . That is , anything that might bring back the old magic of the 2007 election campaign . In those happy days , Labor campaigned as if WorkChoices was the culmination of a century of Tory attacks on the Australian settlement . <p> But for the right , WorkChoices is an emblem as well : emblematic of an aging government willing to trample Australia 's institutions to get what it wanted . The right was n't much more sympathetic to Howard 's last industrial relations reform than the left . <p> WorkChoices took industrial relations forever out of state hands , eliminating any principle of federalism in workplace policy . And it was an extraordinarily complicated piece of law . It increased , rather than decreased , government involvement over labour markets . <p> It is mostly forgotten that the great workplace bogeyman , the HR Nicholls Society -- the fortress of managers ' rights , the unions ' b ? te noire -- was opposed to WorkChoices .

The point of talking about WorkChoices is n't to warn Australian workers . It is to find anything that might restore Labor 's support . WorkChoices is a scare campaign , sure .

@@1104237 <h> 27 August 2012 <h> Grocon 's Daniel Grollo faces big union test <p> It has been a big year for Daniel Grollo , son of Melbourne Rich Lister Bruno Grollo . <p> In May , he formally took ownership of the family 's construction business Grocon . Although he had been running the business for a number of years , a formal split of Bruno 's assets saw Daniel finally take complete control . <p> In June , he finally signed an enterprise bargaining agreement with the Construction , Forestry , Mining , and Energy Union , after a long period of negotiating . With billions of dollars ' worth of projects under construction or in the pipeline , getting an agreement done with Australia 's biggest and most militant building union made this an important milestone . <p> But just a few months after making this agreement , Grollo finds himself at war with the CFMEU . Today he has taken the extraordinary step of penning a newspaper piece on the dispute and asking the CFMEU to end the dispute . Indeed , there 's a note of pleading in Grollo 's tone that underlines how serious this has become . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Melbourne 's biggest building sites , the $1.2 billion Myer Emporium project in the heart of the CBD . <p> Last week , according to Grollo , the CFMEU had about 200 members -- most of who do not work for Grocon -- block access to the site over a dispute about whether Grocon should pay for union stewards to work on site . <p> Grollo , as you would expect , does n't believe he should pay . " This would amount to paying millions to people whose lines of control are external to Grocon and whose productivity would be open to question . " <p> The union claims that its actions are related to occupational health and safety concerns on the site , a claim Grollo refutes , pointing to the company 's good OHS record . <p> What 's really riled Grollo though is the union 's handing out of leaflets which include the names and photographs of six Grocon employees and cartoon image of a " scab hunter " with a double-barrelled shotgun . The flyer says : " Get rid of these scabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Grollo writes that CFMEU leaders should stop the threats against Grocon employees . <p> " If , as CFMEU leaders claim , it does n't mean to condone the level of threat associated with being on the wrong end of a double-barrelled shotgun , then ? they should work to prevent circulation of leaflets adopting that imagery towards respected Grocon employees . Instead , they go to ground . <p> " We know the blockaders best by what they do each day and what they allow to be done in their names . Individually and collectively , they choose to infringe the rights and peace of mind of others and to prevent legitimate work on some of the country 's safest sites . " <p> Grocon returned to the Victorian Supreme Court yesterday to try and end the blockade , although how much luck the company will have is n't clear -- the CFMEU ignored a previous court order to end the blockade . <p> Workplace Minister Bill Shorten has intervened in the dispute , forcing both sides to a mediation session at Fair Work Australia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fair Work Building and Construction , is investigating the matter . <p> However , FWBC chief Leigh Johns says it is unlikely to intervene and Shorten himself has admitted the Fair Work regime does not cover blockades . <p> Exactly where that leaves this dispute is not clear . This morning when I passed the site , union members were still in place at both entrances , with the CFMEU 's black colours highly visible . <p> This is shaping up as a big test -- for Grollo , for the federal government 's IR system , for its new building regulator and for the courts .

Now it 's come down to earth with a thud . It still has more than 600 stores globally , but it 's going to close another 82 stores this financial year . <p> Launa Inman says Billabong has come up with a four-year transformation plan to turn the company around , including fewer brands and styles and better supply chains . <p> LAUNA INMAN : We are going to have a totally integrated retailing proposition for the consumer that encompasses both bricks and mortar and e-commerce . <p> ELIO D'AMATO : When you 're removing stores that are n't profitable and you 're staying that you 're introducing an e-platform , that does n't sounds like it 's something that 's all that enthralling and exciting ; enough that 's it 's no magic silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders .

Characters : the crippled manacled outlaw himself ( Steven Rooke ) , an unsympathetic guard who taunts him with details of his fate ( Hugh Parker ) ; and a priest who has seemingly come to hear Ned 's confession and give him the last rites , good Roman Catholic boy that he is ( Leon Cain ) .

The demonstration was to protest against a short , amateurish film made by a few insignificant individuals in the United States that satirises the Prophet Muhammad . <p> A powerful social norm in Australia is that migrants do not bring their homeland conflicts with them or replay their religious and national aggression here . That norm , along with simple law and order , was violated in Sydney . Such episodes invariably provoke debate about Australian multiculturalism . Yet both its critics and supporters invest the philosophy and policy of Australian multiculturalism with far too much significance and capacity on these and other occasions . <p> Critics tend to see multiculturalism as causing or helping to promote episodes like the Sydney protest .

Instead suppose we had just good , old-fashioned Anglo-Australian institutions , culture and privilege . <p> Would there still be self-identifying and practicing Muslims , Hindus , Jews and other minorities around today ? Of course . Would some Australian Muslims still be extremely agitated by provocative depictions of their prophet ? You bet . Why ? Because such provocations are typically internationalised .

It seeks to protect liberal democratic values by checking the tendency of the majority culture to define individual liberty and equality solely in terms of how it chooses to live , work and play . You may choose to wear a beach hat and sunglasses ; I may choose to wear a hijab . It is the same entitlement to freedom of cultural expression . <p> Australian multiculturalism , in other words , aims to extend liberty and equality to all Australians within the same liberal democratic limits and so allow all Australians the same opportunities and a sense of belonging . <p> It has become fashionable in recent years to assert that Australian multiculturalism has erred in emphasising the right to cultural difference at the expense of shared values and what unites us . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasised the need to respect the differences between diverse cultures , with too little attention paid to integration and patriotism .

There are risks to equating them .

And one can abide and respect the laws and institutions without necessarily welling up with patriotic sentiment . <p> If Australian multiculturalism is to be liberal and democratic , then it is enough that we ask citizens to respect the laws and institutions of the country .

He caught exactly the reciprocity at the heart of Australia 's liberal multiculturalism : <p> You are welcome ; you are free to worship ; you are free to honour your heritage ; and , we will respect the differences between us . And in return , you should agree to live by the standards and values of this society , the one you have chosen to be a part of . <p> Pointing to the example of the United States , Lowy suggested that greater attention be placed on civics education and the concept of citizenship . " They seem to have a way of projecting their national values through institutions like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than just their lifestyle . " Policymakers in Australia would do well to heed his advice . <p> However , Lowy is also wise enough to know , as he put it , that " Australia is not America . " In thinking about civics education , we would do well to bear in mind some key differences between the two countries . The United States is a " creedal nation " in that its national identity is defined mainly in terms of its founding political principles . The emphasis on " civics " in the United States thus comes easily and " naturally . " <p> In contrast , Australian national identity and culture traditionally have been construed as extending beyond liberal democratic values , even beyond a famed actual or imagined egalitarianism , to include also cultural mores , attitudes and habits - an " Australian way of life . " Attempts at civics education in Australia thus have usually had to deal with deeply felt cultural-nationalist impulses . <p> For example , when he was Chairman of the Commonwealth Government 's civics and citizenship program in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a " civic identity , " arguing that the latter would only be appropriate if " we were truly a very diverse society , with a number of distinct ethnic groups each maintaining its own culture .

And so his school curriculum included such material as Aboriginal Dreamtime stories , Henry Lawson 's tales , Fred McCubbin and Sidney Nolan paintings , Weary Dunlop 's wartime courage and Paul Keating 's speech on the burial of the Unknown Soldier . <p> It is this focus on cultural nationalist motifs that Lowy says needs to be complemented - not necessarily replaced - by a more direct instruction in the ways and means of democratic life . <p> Though many people are surprised by the fact , the United States does not have a policy of state multiculturalism .

But in Australia there was no long or vibrant tradition of social pluralism . In the wake of post-war immigration , the policy of multiculturalism was and still is Australia 's attempt to carve out a place for such pluralism in the name of liberty and equality .

Rodney Charles Collins is not one of them . <p> At a time when many gangsters have become household names Collins remains nearly anonymous , partially because for decades he has kept a low profile and partially due to a raft of court suppression orders ( finally lifted yesterday ) that have forbidden his name to even be whispered in public . <p> But there is not a heavyweight crook in Victoria who does n't know of Collins - reputed to be one of Australia 's most prolific hitmen . <p> So it was with some alarm that word started to filter through the underworld that the man they call The Duke had been moved into protection in Barwon 's maximum-security division . <p> Advertisement <p> This led to speculation that Collins , a notorious hardhead , had cracked and was talking to police about several unsolved murders . <p> Because if Collins ( also known as Rodney Earle ) decided to talk it would come from first-hand knowledge because in most cases he pulled the trigger . <p> He is alleged to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of another man and rumoured to be part of an armed robbery team that killed a security guard . <p> However , the reason for his shift to 23-hour-a-day lockdown was less spectacular and much more logical . <p> As a prisoner Collins , 68 , is difficult and fellow inmates find him a pain in the neck . In years gone by the fear of meeting him on the outside meant any crook with a brain ( who wanted to make sure they were n't blown out ) always wanted to keep on The Duke 's good side . <p> But now that Collins is destined to die in jail they no longer need to treat him with caution . So the man who killed for a living now needs to be protected from those who once feared him . <p> Last year he was bashed in the shower block , although he told authorities his black eye was the result of a simple slip involving soap and a wet floor . <p> CCTV footage suggested otherwise . <p> Inside prison it is the little things that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front of the class when it comes to interpersonal skills . <p> In an environment where personal space is at a premium , Collins tends to get into people 's faces in a most obnoxious way , to the point where he was allegedly found using someone 's still damp toothbrush . <p> The reason he is in prison and the reason he wo n't be released is that Collins is a man who kills without hesitation , without conscience and sometimes without reason . <p> How many times he has ended a life only he really knows for sure , but police say he has killed three women , just because they may have been able to identify him . <p> In 2009 he was sentenced to life with a minimum of 32 years for the 1987 murder of Ramon Abbey and his wife Dorothy . It was a vicious , vindictive and pointless double murder that would have stayed in his past , if he was n't greedy enough to commit a near identical crime for a payment of $150,000 . <p> There was a gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on the night of July 27 , 1987 but it was Collins who was after blood . <p> One stayed in the car as the other three , dressed in police uniforms rumoured to have been stolen from a dry-cleaners , entered the house . <p> Collins suspected Abbey was a police informer , had failed to return a police badge and had pulled out of a planned armed robbery . This , plus the fact he owed Collins money over the sale of a second-hand car , created a spectacular falling out . <p> He also believed his victim had cash and drugs hidden in the house . In fact Abbey was broke and had tried to borrow money earlier that day . <p> Collins took him to a shed at the back and shot him three times in the head . Just before he died Abbey yelled out his killer 's name . That shriek doomed his wife to the same fate . <p> Collins calmly walked back into the house and shot Dorothy Abbey twice in the head and cut her throat while she sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the bedroom next door . <p> When asked why he had killed her , he replied : ' ' Dead men tell no tales . ' ' <p> And there it would have remained but for the remarkably similar murders of police informer Terence Hodson and his wife Christine , who were shot dead in their Kew home in May 2004 . <p> It was part of that investigation that led police to re-open the Abbey file . <p> When Collins was arrested in June 2008 for the 1987 double murder police found a loaded handgun , a balaclava , a burglary kit and surveillance equipment in his Northcote home . They also found the 58-page confidential police report on a major drug dealer . <p> Collins refused to say why he had the document and claimed he found it at a bus stop . <p> The similarities between the Abbey killings and the murders of the Hodsons were striking . <p> Again the male was the target , again the wife was killed because she could identify the killer and again the gunman was Collins . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court because the star witness for the prosecution , Carl Williams , is not alive to testify . <p> Williams , who was serving a minimum of 35 years for four murders and other offences , was desperate to cut a deal with police and made a series of statements over the Hodson killings . <p> In his first statement , Williams said he was asked to help organise a hitman but another team carried out the murder . <p> In this first version Williams claims he was offered $150,000 for the job but writes himself out of the actual murder . Williams made that statement in April 2007 just a few weeks before he was to be sentenced in the hope it would reduce his sentence . He was wrong . <p> Nearly two years later and at a low ebb , Williams decided to have another go . This time he said he had taken the contract and organised the eager Collins to do the hit . <p> ' ' Rod Collins was always asking for work and I thought he might do it . Rod was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a job like this . ' ' <p> He said he had previously asked Collins to kill Williams ' enemy Jason Moran but the older man did n't take up the offer . " I thought that maybe he was a bit past it . " <p> This time he took the contract to kill Terry Hodson . There was no mention of killing his wife . <p> A few days after the murders Williams said he met Collins at the Marriott Hotel to deliver the $150,000 . <p> " Rod said , ' Quick hey ? ' and smiled and chuckled . I said to him , ' What happened with the sheila ? ' He said ' That 's not for you to worry about ' . " <p> The Williams secret statements were seen as a massive breakthrough in the murders police desperately wanted to solve . <p> As a result of " Carl 's Confessions " Collins and the man alleged to have paid the money were charged with the murders . <p> But only Collins was charged with the double murder as the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry to be killed . <p> But when Williams was bashed to death in Barwon Prison in April 2010 the case against the two collapsed . <p> He remains on the shortest of short lists as a suspect in the murders of Mike ' ' Lucky ' ' Schievella , and de facto wife Heather McDonald , who were murdered in their St Andrews home on September 16 , 1990 . <p> The couple was tortured and their throats slashed in what appeared to be a drug ripoff . The killers have never been found . <p> At a February 1983 party in a Reservoir home , Collins turned on a young Irishman too drunk to sense danger . <p> He shot and killed Patrick Brendon Coghlan before shooting the party 's host , Ronald Longmuir , in the leg . <p> At first witnesses were too frightened to talk but months later some of the party-goers made statements , including one who said he had seen Collins with a gun some time earlier . <p> It was enough to arrest the suspect . The special operations group later smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The window had been covered with a plastic film , which delayed the arrest team for several seconds . <p> Later police found a loaded revolver near the window with bullets in the cylinder dented by the firing pin . Tests showed the gun was faulty and that the suspect had tried to fire rounds at the police through the window before throwing the weapon to the other side of the room and giving up . <p> When asked by homicide squad detectives if he had fired at police , all he would say was " I did n't know it was you " . <p> Collins was committed for trial but the case collapsed after Longmuir died from complications from his gunshot wound . <p> Collins is under investigation over the murder of Melbourne standover man Brian Kane , who was shot dead in the Quarry Hotel in Brunswick in 1982 . <p> Police say Collins and his partner Russell ' ' Mad Dog ' ' Cox , burst in and fired .38 snub-nosed revolvers in the ambush . <p> Cox , who spent 11 years on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly in Queensland and has refused to help police . <p> Just three months after the Quarry Hotel hit , police received intelligence that Collins was " believed running with Russell Cox " . <p> Certainly the gunman and Cox were seen chatting over coffee in Hawthorn just months before the Kane hit . <p> Cox and Collins were part of a notorious armed robbery crew in the 1980s . It was Cox , using inside information , who organised one of those jobs , a raid on a Brunswick Coles supermarket in July 1988 . A security guard was confronted . When Dominik Hefti refused to give up the cash tin he was shot in the chest and leg but managed to return fire , shooting one of the robbers through the hand . <p> It would be years before police would find the names of the team and use DNA technology to establish Hefti 's killer was Santo Mecuri - a sausage maker turned gunman . <p> Mecuri was a known associate of both Collins and Cox . <p> There is one further murder linked to The Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an enemy of Carl Williams and Tony Mokbel , was shot dead by a lone gunman as he returned to his Brighton home in February 2006 .

@@1163240 <h> Changchun Tuesday - Full moon weddings in the Chung ! <p> 02/10/2012 , 6:19 PM by NickGerber <p> This week it 's all about weddings - spring always means lots of weddings in Australia , and here in China , we also had a National long weekend , and yesterday was a HUGE day to get married as it was considered a very auspicious day on the lunar calendar . ( there was a full moon on Sunday night ) <p> There was reportedly 5,000 weddings in Changchun yesterday , and amongst them was our very own little Changchun Tuesday Singing star , Lucy Peng . <p> 1 . How the day unfolds <p> For your first marriage in China , it 's considered tradition and good luck to get married in the morning ( if you get married a second time , you get married in the afternoon ) , so the day starts pretty early , with the bride and her attendants at the hairdresser at around 4am , and back home ready for the make up artist by sunrise - which here now is about 6am . So apart from the very very early start , everything so far is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that the bride and groom have actually been legally married for some time now , having secured their marriage license ages ago , sometimes up to 6 months earlier . <p> Lucy has been an integral part of the Panda 's work life here and we have done a lot of things with her socially , and helped where we could to open her eyes to some new experiences ( like learning how to swim ) so she very much wanted us to be part of her special day . <p> So we arrived at her house at 7:30am , and amongst what was a cast of several of her family and friends , Lucy was found to be sitting on her bed at her parents place , all dressed and ready in her wedding dress , taking visitors and good wishes from everyone who crowded into the room to see her . As the minutes ticked by the crowd number swelled , and the lookouts at the front door alerted Lucy and her attendants to the arrival of Stephen , her groom . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and bribe ! ! ) his way past Lucy 's dad at the front door - and once he 's cleared that obstacle , he has to bang on Lucy 's bedroom door and ask to be let in - several minutes of hilarious theatrics ensue with her attendants and mother telling him to go away . Eventually after much cajoling , some help from his mates and a few more red envelopes slid under the door , the door opens and he and Lucy sit in front of all and sundry to discuss the terms and rules of their marriage ( in front of everyone ) - all in good fun of course . <p> He gives her a bouquet and asks her to come with him to the Church so they can make it all official - she says she 'd like to but she ca n't find her shoes - more theatrics follow with everyone looking for the shoes , which are quickly found , and in true Cinderella style , are sparkling high heel numbers , which Stephen slipped onto Lucy 's feet and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting car that is adorned with several floral arrangements . <p> All the manholes on the way to the wedding car have been covered with a red mat to stop the evil spirits creeping through and in addition to the bride and groom car , there is about 10 other cars - all red for Lucy 's wedding , and a bus adorned with pink and red ribbons to get a number of people to the church . <p> Getting to the church <p> It is considered good luck that if two brides pass each other on their way to the church or to their wedding that they should release a red silk kerchief or red tissue into the sky to capture each others charms and love . <p> We passed a bride in a soft top car and she let a red tissue fly into the sky in traffic as she passed Lucy 's car . <p> The reception <p> Here 's where you notice how different the Chinese wedding receptions are to what we have in western countries . <p> To start with , there are no set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or think to be appropriate . And most people do n't make that much of an effort to get dressed up - there were a few people there yesterday in their tracksuits and runners .... <p> There 's also not a lot of drinking , so once the speeches are over , and people have eaten what they want from the overloaded Lazy Susan of food that is piled up at each table and handed over their red envelope to Lucy - they just get up and leave ! ! ! ! <p> Those who are there until the Bride and groom leave then make short work of the leftovers - going from table to table with plastic bags and emptying the un-eaten food into the bags to take home ! <p> There are aspects of the ceremony at the reception that feel like a kooky game show - complete with a tuxedo clad , smiling MC - who , together with a sounding and lighting dude , are hired as a package for the day to " produce and coordinate " the official speeches and traditional ceremony activities at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is English born , but has a Chinese mother - so he can speak very good Chinese and was able to both communicate and understand a lot of the ceremony - but for some other people we know who have married Chinese nationals , they must spend the entire day slightly bewildered . <p> The red hand bag - carrying the red envelopes <p> In the same way that many weddings are in Australia now , there 's no such thing as giving gifts , and at the Chinese wedding it 's all about the red envelopes . <p> The bride carries a red handbag that , as the day progresses , gets fatter and fatter with the envelopes that guests hand to her . <p> Two outfits <p> The official ceremony activity takes place in a traditional wedding dress , and then for the toasting and general mingling , the bride gets changed into a more traditional Chinese red dress . <p> And the whole thing is over and done with in under 2 hours . <p> 2 . Another wee incident <p> Anything goes in China , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeing into a plastic bag so his mum did n't lose her place in the line at the department store sales . <p> On the weekend , it went one step further - at Lucy 's wedding , one of the little boys there was standing on a chair at one of the guest tables ( of ten people ) and I had a double take look before I truly believed what i was seeing - his mum had whipped out an empty plastic bottle and he was peeing into that - at the table ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> And no-one batted an eyelid ... <p> 3 . Huge Chinese Government run company plays a role in marrying people <p> And still on the subject of weddings ... <p> As you know , there is a huge train manufacturing business in China , one of the key locations for which is in Changchun - called China Northern Rail , part of China Rail Company . <p> There are 3 enormous work sites in this north eastern China location where we live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 13,000 single Chinese men and women . <p> So the company plays a role in actively encouraging people to intermingle and find a partner - and on Chinese Valentines Day every year , ( which was a few weeks ago ) - there is a mass wedding celebration , with the company putting on a banquet and wedding ceremony for 150 couples . They then put them all onto one of the high speed trains and they go for a short trip somewhere for the day . They apparently do this every year . <p> It 's not really the Chinese tradition to go away on a honeymoon , so they are all back at work a day later . The brides do however have marriage leave that they can take - which is 15 days . <p> 4 . Subtle signs of an anti-Japanese sentiment in Changchun <p> We spoke a few weeks ago about the trouble brewing in the East China Sea between China and Japan over who owns a particular group of islands - and the anti Japanese sentiment it 's causing in mainland China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend - a Toyota Rav 4 , which are produced in huge numbers in China at the various car manufacturing cities , including here in Changchun , was alongside us in traffic and I noticed that the Toyota badge on the back of the car has been taped over with a small Chinese flag . And since the un-rest first started , the displays of patriotism have become much greater around town , with every large building , and lots of smaller businesses as well all displaying 1 or several Chinese flags on their roof tops or from the street facade of their building . <p> 5 . The Exit Series <p> What we 'll miss <p> The random kookiness of every day life in China does mean that there is never a dull moment , and we will miss the funny little things we see in our daily lives here . <p> I love being able to walk home from yoga every day and do my vegetable shopping on the way - there are several streets where farmers set up for the day either with their produce on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the cart attached to their ever patient donkey . The fresh quality of the vegetables is great , and really cheap . <p> We 've made some nice friends here , both ex-pat and Chinese , and whilst we might see the ex-pats somewhere else around the world , it 's highly unlikely we would get the chance to see many or any of the Chinese nationals again - travelling to Australia is a very expensive trip for them , and it 's also highly unlikely that we would come back to the Chun for any reason ..... <p> What we wo n't miss <p> Whilst the temperatures here are still very much in the pluses here during the day , the mornings and evenings are definitely getting much cooler and the days are shorter . All going to plan with our current schedule , we will be back in Oz by Christmas , so we will miss the nasty end of the Chinese winter and the L O N G spring . Those minus 25 days and slippery icy streets , we will definitely not miss one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in 2 years , which will be great - the Panda is definitely looking forward to making up for many lost surfing opportunities .

Whereas prior to the attacks the suggestion that Indonesia - long regarded as not only the world 's most populous Muslim nation but also as one of its most tolerant and easy-going - could be home to a Middle-Eastern-style terrorist network was widely regarded as fanciful . Within Indonesia many refused to believe that the carnage unleashed that Saturday night on Jalan Legian and could have possibly been the work of local extremists . It was only after painstaking police work identified the bombers and laid bare the network behind them that the reality of Indonesia 's problem was finally accepted . <p> As those directly responsible for the bombings were arrested and their colleagues tracked down a picture emerged of a network stretching across Southeast Asia involving several thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the origins of this violent extremist network predated Al Qaeda itself , having grown out of Indonesia 's Darul Islam separatist movement of the 1950s .

How confident can we be that Indonesia now has the problem in hand ?

When we were n't looking Indonesia made a successful democratic transition and achieved economic growth second only to that of China and India .

We have already covered this in our earlier article at Renew Economy . <p> Talking biogas , using coal-seam gas <p> Building the trigeneration network would result in greater demand for gas in NSW . This is because it would displace grid electricity that is currently largely drawn from non-gas sources ( ie coal ) . <p> The future of gas supply in NSW is clouded with doubt . As reported in the Sydney Morning Herald in April , the NSW state government has warned that " Bass Strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the gas export industry is growing at an extraordinary rate . " <p> This means that , for the foreseeable future , the demand for extra gas will stimulate growth in the dirty , unconventional gas sector -- shale gas in SA , and coal-seam gas in QLD and NSW . <p> This will reduce or even negate any hoped-for environmental benefits of the trigeneration plan . Coal-seam gas and shale gas have been linked to high rates of fugitive methane emissions in gasfields in the US and there are fears that the same problems may be occurring here . <p> When campaigners pointed out that the rollout of gas generation would support the development of the coal-seam gas industry , the City of Sydney 's response was confused . <p> At first , the City 's chief development officer of Energy and Climate Change , Allan Jones , said " trigeneration can not run off coal-seam methane as this contains damaging trace elements which would destroy the trigeneration engines ... the effect would be similar to filling up a petrol car with diesel fuel " . <p> Addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian Energy Market Operator , in the 2011 GSOO Gas Statement , notes that : <p> " The major chemical constituent of both conventional and unconventional gas is methane . Although unprocessed gas from either source contains various minor components and contaminants , gas from conventional and unconventional sources can be mixed before or after processing to industry quality standards and used interchangeably in gas transmission and distribution networks . " <p> The Australian Energy Market Operator predicts that 84-85 per cent of the nation 's future gas will come from unconventional ( read coal seam or shale gas ) fields . Clearly , this gas is quite able to fuel trigeneration . <p> The live depiction of the gas market here shows a significant amount of gas flowing from Queensland , predominately Roma ( CSG collection area ) into Adelaide and Sydney via Moomba . <p> The City of Sydney obviously does n't want to be seen supporting coal seam gas . Its next position was to argue that renewable biogas could at some time in the future be substituted for the fossil gas currently in the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will arrive and the trigen system will be fine . But we have to ask : how many years would Cogent , Origin Energy 's subsidiary , contract existing conventional fossil gas supplies ? Origin is the biggest name in CSG . <p> Denmark does not prove biogas is the way forward <p> Prendergast cited biogas developments in Denmark to support his case . But biogas is not the booming renewable sector there . <p> Denmark plans to source half its electricity from wind power by 2020 . This means Denmark will have about 5000 wind turbines ( the majority of which , similarly to Australia , will be onshore ) . <p> Denmark does not have an explicit biogas target but it does have a renewable heating target , which can include things like heat pumps ( geothermal and reverse cycle airconditioning ) as well as biomass and biogas for providing domestic , commercial and industrial heat .

The entire nation has less than 200 biogas plants , which produce the equivalent net electricity of 16 E-126 turbines , or roughly the same as Tasmania 's Woolnorth wind farm . <p> To supply enough gas for the City of Sydney 's projected trigeneration precinct would require four times as much biogas as Denmark produced in 2011 . Remember , this is a sector Denmark has been developing for two decades . <p> Use biogas where it is needed <p> The 17PJ of gas that would be required annually would require a larger amount of biomass feedstock to convert to biogas , probably in the order of 25-30PJ primary energy . <p> CSIRO ( Farine et al 2012 ) estimates of biomass availability include roughly 240-280PJ/year of what BZE might consider sustainably harvested biomass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up more than 10% of this limited resource , when the conversion factor to biogas is considered . <p> This would be competing against not just electricity demand in other centres but all other possible uses , including transport and industrial feedstocks , and biochar production to draw excess carbon out of the atmosphere . <p> Chemical and industrial processes that rely on gas as a feedstock are considerable . Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics 's figure for chemical processes in Australia is 115 PJ . <p> If we aim to clean up Sydney CBD buildings ' emissions , it makes no sense to do so at the cost of our ability to clean up other sectors of the economy . <p> Very convincingly explained Matthew , thank you .

Picture : Justin Lloyd Source : The Australian <p> AS the connections of tomorrow 's Melbourne Cup winner show off their gold trophy and bank the $3.6 million prizemoney , the lure for the rest of us to join them can be enticing . <p> The glamour , the thrills , the cash . Watching them , it 's hard not to wonder whether you too could join the winner 's circle . <p> But how much of it is luck and how much of it is a large amount of well-directed money invested in the right bloodlines ? <p> The answer is a bit of both . And maybe " invested " is n't really the right word.An investment is putting money into something with the expectation of gain and some security that you will have a great chance of recouping the initial outlay . <p> On this basis , buying into a racehorse is probably more akin to punting than investing . <p> We often focus on the headline-grabbing winners and not the thousands of other horses that continually lose . <p> However , even with punting there are ways to tilt the odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , that begins with being well informed . <p> While some horses are plucked from relative obscurity and trained to greatness , most winners come from good pedigree , with a champion somewhere along their bloodline . <p> Even the semen of champion stallions attracts a hefty price and the foals of great mares a healthy sum too . For casual investors , grabbing a bargain will probably lead to obscurity and a financial black hole . <p> But there are exceptions . Take heart from the story of Takeover Target ( pictured ) , the great Aussie thoroughbred that won more than $6 million in prize money after being bought for just $1250 by former taxi driver Joe Janiak . <p> About $1000 is about what you 're looking at as the bottom end of thoroughbred prices .

But the purchase price is just the first of the costs associated with being part of the sport of kings . <p> Owning a horse for racing can cost about $3000 a month in training and maintenance fees , and about $600 a month when it 's " spelling " on a farm . <p> Getting a proven trainer will cost more but will also improve the chances of success . <p> There 's a reason the likes of Gai Waterhouse and Bart Cummings consistently feature in the winner 's circle . Trainers play a big hand in a horse 's fortunes . They charge a fee and can keep part of the winnings . <p> Spreading the risk by being part of a syndicate is a popular option . You can form your own syndicate with friends but there are also professional outfits that offer syndicate shares to the public . Either way , you 'll need to be registered and licensed . The experts say syndication is definitely the best way to get involved , as it spreads the costs and risks of ownership among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business deal , make sure any syndication is drawn up correctly . <p> A less common way to get involved is to lease a racehorse . This way there is no up-front purchase cost . You cover the costs while the owner is entitled to a fee and a share of the prize money . At the end of the lease , the horse is returned to the owner . <p> It 's still normal procedure that prize money be split with the jockey and trainer too . As a guide , the jockey might expect 5 per cent , the trainer 10 per cent , and the owners ( and bills ) share the balance . <p> And then there 's the big win that every racehorse owner has , the main motivation for getting in on the action , the social return on your investment . <p> There are certainly some big players in the racing business , which some people see as a great networking opportunity . <p> A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING : We collect information about the content ( including ads ) you use across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content more relevant to you on our network and other sites .

@@1256232 <h> Business property in a SMSF - the advantages and disadvantages <p> David Glen discusses the advantages and disadvantages of holding business property in SMSFs , and outlines some factors for planners to consider when advising their clients on the topic . <p> In conversations with advisers around the country , I 'm hearing that small business clients are increasingly looking to fund the purchase of illiquid assets , such as property , through their self-managed super fund ( SMSF ) . <p> This can have some distinct advantages . <p> Capital appreciation of the property is taxed at an effective rate of 10 per cent , with a reduction to zero if the realisation occurs during the pension phase , and the progressive relaxation of borrowing restrictions inside SMSFs that we have seen over recent years also means that SMSF investments can be geared in certain circumstances -- an attractive prospect for many business owners . <p> However , in situations where there is more than one business partner ( and hence more than one member of the SMSF holding the business property ) , members -- and their advisers -- should be aware of the potentially serious consequences on the business ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled or die . <p> As the popularity of holding business property in SMSFs grows , so does the need for awareness and understanding of this issue . <h> Potential liquidity risk -- and solution <p> The fallout from holding illiquid business assets , such as business property , in an SMSF can be severe should a member die or become totally and permanently disabled . <p> This is because , in many cases , the business property assets may need to be liquidated in order to pay the required benefit to the member or their family from the fund -- which not only could take time to resolve , leaving the member and their family in limbo , but a ' fire sale ' could result in a lower than market price for the property . <p> Meanwhile , the sale of the business property could have serious consequences for the viability of the business . <p> Given this potential scenario , it 's not surprising that liquidity protection insurance for SMSFs holding business property is increasingly on the radar for advisers looking after small business clients . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member or their beneficiary in the case of death , while enabling the other SMSF members to keep the business property assets intact . <p> Many advisers have asked me why conventional life insurance products would not be appropriate in this situation . <p> The fact is , conventional life insurance payouts are simply provided to the policy-holder or their estate -- no provision is made for other members of the SMSF . Therefore , they would not be compensated for the loss of their business partner . <h> Thinking about compliance <p> While liquidity protection insurance may seem like an attractive option for some SMSFs holding business property , we are seeing uncertainty among some advisers on how best to advise their clients on this relatively new area -- particularly around the compliance and tax requirements . <p> It 's important to understand how liquidity protection insurance is seen under the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act ( 1993 ) , best known as SISA . <p> When considering recommending liquidity protection insurance to clients , the following compliance issues should be considered : <p> Does it meet the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the parameters of both the core and ancillary purposes , and therefore passes the sole purpose test . <p> Does it meet SISA regulation 5.02 , which stipulates that premium expense must be allocated on a ' fair and reasonable ' basis and all members benefit equally from cover ? <p> This can be more of a grey area for the adviser and the fund trustees , but I would suggest that age and health issues of the members need to be discussed openly and objectively up-front , with premium cost allocated pro rata . <p> Equally , in the event of a claim , payments must be allocated on a fair and reasonable basis ( SISA regulation 5.03 ) . To avoid possible dispute , agree how this will be done with the trustees at the outset . <h> Tax considerations <p> When turning their attention to the tax treatment of liquidity protection insurance in super , advisers should bear in mind that it is no different from the treatment of any life insurance within superannuation . <p> It is submitted that premiums are tax deductible under section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite ' superannuation death benefit ' or ' disability superannuation ' benefit required by law . <p> In case of claim due to the death of a member , claims proceeds are tax free if paid to a dependant for tax purposes . Otherwise , a portion of the claim proceeds may be assessable in the hands of the recipient . <p> Total and permanent disability claims proceeds are tax free if the member is over 60 but is otherwise paid on a formula basis . <p> However , I would always argue that the allocation of claims benefits should be made directly to member accounts rather than to the fund reserve , as this could have adverse tax implications . <p> Allocation from reserves can count towards members ' concessional contribution caps in certain circumstances , which could particularly pose issues for those approaching retirement . <h> Action plan <p> Liquidity protection insurance can be a worthwhile safeguard for SMSF clients but , as we have seen , a number of factors need to be taken into account in deciding the most appropriate way to administer it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking out such a policy , this 10-step guide may help ease the process : <h> The 10-step guide <p> Carry out an asset and liability review with the client <p> Consider liquidity insurance along with other strategies -- eg , payment of benefits in pension form only -- to ensure it is the most appropriate option . <p> Identify the cover required and select the methodology for allocating premiums and claims proceeds . <p> Review the SMSF trust deed to ensure that insurance in the proposed format is permitted . <p> Brief the SMSF auditor on your proposal . <p> Ensure the statement of advice ( SOA ) is consistent with other fund documentation . <p> Ensure that the proposal is reviewed by the trustee 's tax adviser . <p> Hold a trustee meeting and provide minutes . <p> Once agreed , ensure that the insurance is properly disclosed in annual member statements . 
@@1256233 <h> On established authors and the weight of expectation : J.K. Rowling 's The Casual Vacancy <p> One of the great pleasures / responsibilities of being a lit critic is that you are asked to review countless debut novels . When I first began reviewing , I remember this feeling unusual to me -- coming as I did from a background in academia , where you generally do n't read anything without an almost infuriating knowledge of every critical perspective , every last theoretical interpretation , every minute biographical detail . <p> What struck me about latest release debuts is how pure , almost virginal the experience of reading them is . How free I am from anything that might sway me one way or another in my interpretation of the text . <p> With established authors , however , it appears that any new novel is judged though the prism of their previous works . It 's the Faustian contract writers enter into when they publish their first novel : if granted any level of success , you 'll never be free of your earlier works , and everything you do will be inescapably judged against it . <p> And so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consigned in almost every review I read to a comparison with the Harry Potter books -- Pagford is said to be populated with Muggles , one of the principal families described as pale imitations of the Dursleys , the book retitled ( admittedly rather brilliantly ) Mugglemarch . <p> However inevitable it was , it all seemed slightly unfair -- not only to the author but to the text itself . <p> I came to The Casual Vacancy as no great Rowling fan . I 've never lined up for any of the films , have never once scrawled a lightning-shaped scar on my forehead or donned a black wizard 's cape . I 've read the novels , of course , and I remember enjoying them in a diversionary way , but I was slightly older than their intended audience once Potter-mania had taken hold , too busy with schoolwork and parties to worry much about Harry and his friends . <p> There are , then , readers far more susceptible , far more tied to the Potterverse than myself . And yet , I too could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Harry Potter books out of my head . <p> So with all the publicity upon the release of The Casual Vacancy , the question I kept coming back to was this : To what extent is it the fault of the reader for being unable to forget the author 's past works and read the text on its own merits ? To shed the weight of their own expectation ? <p> Rowling 's debut onto the Not For Children scene begins with the death of a councilor , Barry Fairbrother . His death results in an opening on the council ( a ' casual vacancy ' ) and the ensuing battle about who should occupy the seat , and therefore win the wider factional war over the town of Pagford 's wish to remove The Fields from its borders -- a housing commission where " graffiti blossoms on the bridges , " the locals throw rocks at street lamps , " and worse . " <p> Of a topic that sounds admittedly rather dull on paper , Rowling manages to weave the threads of her story into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances , lusts and fears . The news of Barry Fairbrother 's death ripples out through the township , seeming " to effervesce in the atmosphere , like bubbling champagne , " and the casual vacancy glimmers with possibility . <p> But there are those in the town who are disgusted by the campaigning , seeking to sabotage the efforts of the potential candidates . And so the formerly stagnant message board of the parish council website becomes the lively and salacious centre of the storm when it begins to display messages from The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother , who appears to know the deepest darkest secrets of those who wish to occupy his seat . <p> Rowling has a particular knack for creating intricate , believable worlds . It 's set in a picturesque and quintessentially ' English ' town , " the pretty little town of Pagford , " so quaint I almost expected there to be a drawing of a map on the inside cover . But besides all this surface English loveliness of stone cottages and green countryside is the violence , addiction , teenage sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern . <p> By page three , Barry Fairbrother is dead , " in a pool of his own vomit , " and is later described as becoming , in the imagination of his townsfolk , " no more than an eruption of vomit and piss , a twitching pile of catastrophe . " In the Fields , " a used condom glistens in the grass ... like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub . " There are gynecologically detailed descriptions of online porn " shaven vulvas ; pink labia pulled wide to show darkly gaping slits , " and children and wives are beaten , " he ran at her and hit her in the face , exactly as he had wanted to when he had first seen her silly frightened expression . " <p> There are times when the explicitness and vulgarity is comical , such as Rowling 's almost Dickensian description of Howard : <p> He was an extravagantly obese man of sixty-four . A great apron of stomach fell so far down in front of his thighs that most people thought instantly of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had last seen it , how he washed it , how he managed to perform any of the acts for which a penis is designed . <p> But the majority of the work is n't so lighthearted . A young girl is raped , " fuckin ' shout and I 'll cut yer , " there is child abuse and incest , " the bedroom door flying open in the night ... her father with his hand on his fly , approaching the bed where she begged him not to , " and the lure of addiction is described to its awful final consequence , " without methadone ... she would again start opening her broken-toothed mouth for strangers ' dicks , so she could feed her veins . " <p> The book seems to wallow in its own grittiness . <p> It is a novel that deals with ' social issues ' -- and you can almost feel the quotation marks around that description . A young girl cuts herself , " the blade drew the pain away from her screaming thoughts ... relief and release in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming , " in search of cigarettes , but really craving the spoon , the flame and the needle . " <p> Many reviewers objected to the author of children 's books writing such explicitly sexual and violent material , and the potential for their own children to be exposed to it . I do n't agree that Rowling has a responsibility to children any more than Bret Easton Ellis has a responsibility to serial killers . And yet it is shocking , and I did wince , and it infuriated me that I could n't dispel from my mind the knowledge that this novel was from the author of Harry Potter . <p> The essential problem is the discord between Rowling 's style of writing -- a manner virtually unaltered from that of the Potter books -- and the newly violent and graphic material . She does her best to paint over it , but the brightness only gleams through underneath . No matter how many times she writes four letter words , or describes the misery and sadness , the resentments and pettiness of adult life , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget who the author is , or it 's a writing style Rowling is so used to that she ca n't forget it herself , and her prose remains unchanged . <p> It must be said that The Casual Vacancy is , once it finds its own rhythm , a highly enjoyable book . The story moves along at a rollicking pace -- the book is almost entirely action and dialogue -- and we never stay with any one character for more than a chapter , as though Rowling felt scared to stay too long in any one place . <p> Like all fantasy writers , Rowling transposed familiar emotions and situations into the realm of the imaginary . Her readers could never wield a wand against evil , or attend Hogwarts , but they could know what it 's like to feel fear , to be bullied . It is these emotions she writes exceptionally well in the new novel , able to convey the dread of the bullied for their tormentor , <p> She spotted Fats Wall at a distance , loping along with Andrew Price . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way something primal inside you helped you recognize a spider moving across a shadowy floor . <p> If we create monsters to make sense of the darkness in the world , here Rowling writes the awfulness of the everyday . You can almost feel Rowling 's mirth in her addition of an element of the supernatural into her story midway . But of course , the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother is really no ghost at all , and the magic is simply that of technically efficient kids able to hack into a poorly run parish council website . <p> We were told very specifically in the announcement of The Casual Vacancy that this was to be J.K. Rowling 's First Book For Adults . But the Harry Potter books were for adults anyway , you could see their colourful spines on trains everywhere , brightening the commute to work ( and what a naive time that seems now , compared to our current train rides coloured in Shades of Grey ) . <p> Rowling did n't treat her young readers as mindless children . She understood that her audience grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives too became darker , dealing with increasingly more frightening themes along the seven Harry Potter texts . Perhaps this is why the premise of the announcement itself seemed so strange . <p> I guess , all in all , there are worse fates than to be cursed with endless references to your wildly successful back catalogue . There are many more authors who failed on their first attempt at a novel and are not read at all . The book will sell on the strength of her name alone , and is already on the bestseller lists . But I 'm still not sure whether it 's a failing of myself as a reader , or of Rowling to properly distance herself . <p> In an extended interview with the New Yorker , Rowling said , ' There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children 's babysitter or their teacher . I was always , I think , completely honest . I 'm a writer , and I will write what I want to write . ' With time , Rowling will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we all will too . <p> -- J.K.

@@1256234 scientists originally calculated that the major impact of global warming would happen towards the end of this century , so geoengineering was considered to be something far off in the distant and really science fiction for most people . Why the urgency now ? Why has the debate changed ? <p> DAVID KEITH : I think the debate 's changed really because the sort of taboo that we would n't talk about it has been broken . So , people have actually known you could do these things for better or for worse for decades , actually since the ' 60s , but people were sort of afraid to talk about them in polite company for fear that just talking about it would let people off the hook so they would n't cut emissions . <p> And that fear was broke a few years ago and so now kind of all the research is pouring out really because effectively had been suppressed , not by some terrible suppressor , but by a fear of talking about it . <p> TONY JONES : So what do you think would actually drive the world 's superpowers or a collective of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin the process of planning and preparing for a geoengineering project ? <p> DAVID KEITH : Very , very hard to guess . I mean , essential thing to say about this is that technology is the easy part ; the hard part is the politics . Really deeply hard and almost unguessable . At this point we have no regulatory structure whatsoever and no treaty structure , so it 's really unclear what would - how such a thing would be controlled . <p> TONY JONES : Do you have any sort of idea at all what kind of timescale there might be before governments are forced to seriously consider this ? Is it 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 years ? <p> DAVID KEITH : Well , forced is a very fuzzy word , so a popular thing to say in this business is to say that we would do it in the case of a climate emergency . But that 's kind of easy to say . In a case of emergency we should do all sorts of wild things , but it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sticky with the word forced . But I think it could happen any time from a decade from now to many , many decades hence . <p> The big question right now really is : should we do research in the open atmosphere ? Should we go outside of the laboratory and begin to actually tinker with the system and learn more about whether this will work or not . And I 'm somebody who advocates that we do do such research . <p> And one thing that research may show is that this does n't work as well as we think . And my view is : whether you 're somebody who hopes this will work or hopes it does n't , more knowledge is a good thing . <p> TONY JONES : So if you were given the go-ahead to do research and the funds to do it , because I imagine it would be very expensive , what would you actually do ? <p> DAVID KEITH : It 's not very expensive actually to begin to do little in-situ experiments . So I am working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do - the experiment that I 'm most involved with would look at a certain aspect of stratospheric chemistry , of the way that the ozone layer is damaged and we 'd be looking at whether or not and how much increase of water vapour in the stratosphere , which may happen naturally , and also the increase of sulphate aerosols if we geoengineered might damage the ozone layer . <p> Basically , how much damage there would be and how we could fix it . And that experiment would be done in a very , very small amount of material ; we 're talking , like , a tonne of material , so small compared to what an aircraft does travelling across the Pacific . And the cost of it would be a few millions to 5 million kind of money , which on the scale of big atmospheric research projects is actually not that much . I mean , the total climate research budget is billion class . <p> TONY JONES : Is it clear now or is it becoming clearer that the best strategy if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding the stratosphere with sulphate particles ? <p> DAVID KEITH : I think the honest answer has to be that we do n't know , that you need to do the research in order to have strong opinions about what 's the right answer . I would say , you know , if you really put a gun to my head and said , " What 's the very most likely thing to work right now ? " that 's probably it . And the reason is because it mimics what nature has done . <p> So we have big volcanoes that put sulphur in the stratosphere and we know something about the bad impacts of that and we know something about what it does to cool the planet . And so it seems pretty likely that since we 'd be putting in much less than nature puts in , at least for the first half century or more , that we could actually do something and control the risks . <p> TONY JONES : Yes , I guess you mentioned volcanic activity and that 's what scientists are basing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've seen from volcanic activity is - and you can go back to ' 91 and Mount Pinatubo , which actually caused a fairly sudden drop in global temperatures because it blanketed the atmosphere in that way , but it also had , evidently , climate change effects itself , so there are clearly dangers here . <p> DAVID KEITH : For sure . There are a bunch of dangers . There are both the dangers of kind of side effects like ozone loss or interfering with atmospheric chemistry in other ways . There 's the basic fact that this is not a perfect compensation for CO2 . <p> So for example , carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic and doing these things to cool the planet will do nothing to correct that . So in the end we will have to cut emissions no matter what , but the fact that we have to cut emissions in the long run does n't mean that we might not want to do things in the short run that actually provide real protection , if in fact they do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting . <p> So I think we need to get out of the kind of extreme either/or that says you only do this if you ca n't cut emissions . That 's nonsense . Cutting emissions we need to do in order to reduce the risks over the next century or two , but we still might want to do some of this in order to reduce the risks over the next half century and those are really quite distinct things . <p> TONY JONES : Let 's talk about the risks of actually doing it on a global scale because you 've been pretty frank about that . You 've actually said you could easily imagine a chain of events that would extinguish life on Earth . Now what would be that potential chain of events from using this kind of technology ? <p> DAVID KEITH : Yes , I probably got quoted a little out of context there . I think there are sort of theoretically possible ways that could happen , but I do n't think there 's socially plausible way it could happen . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflective aerosols - probably not sulphates , actually ; I think it wo n't work with sulphates - but some other engineered aerosol . <p> And if you did that for 100 years and reflected away sort of 8 per cent of the sunlight , whereas the amount people are talking about doing is more like 1 per cent , then in principle you could actually freeze the oceans over , as happened some good chunk of a billion years ago , and that would be devastating . But I think that the chance of people doing that would sort of be a global suicide is so remote as not to be a serious worry . <p> I think the reason I 've occasionally said that is that it illustrates the kind of power that this technology grants us . And I think for better , for worse , what this technology gives us is this enormous kind of leverage and power to alter the climate and to do it with a very small amount of money or material and that power should frighten us , I think , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike the problem of CO2 emissions , which is changing the climate , but which is a product of human actions all over the planet . Every individual person flying or driving a car or using electricity around the planet contributes to carbon dioxide . <p> If you talk about putting sulphates or some other engineered particle in the stratosphere , the issue is that a very small number of people in principle could do it and have this kind of huge leverage to affect the whole climate in this profound way . And that 's what raises the very hard challenge of governance . <p> TONY JONES : Yes , is there a fear raised by what you 're saying that some country , a superpower , China , for example , has been suggested , could actually do something like this unilaterally and thereby create conflict over the whole idea of geo-engineering ? <p> DAVID KEITH : Yes , it 's certainly possible . So , there 's no question it 's technically possible to do it unilaterally . So , the actual materials you need , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be in reach easily of any of the G20 states . It 's not hard to do . You could buy the equipment from many aeronautical contractors . <p> So in that sense it could be done unilaterally . I think that there are scenarios under which it would happen in the real world unilaterally , but I do n't think we should - I mean , I think you can exaggerate that possibility . <p> But , you know - so , for example , I think if nothing was done to manage emissions and if climate impacts really fell strongly on , say , India - which might actually happen from heat stress on crops - you could imagine India doing it unilaterally . But there 's a kind of a hard and an easy unilateralism . <p> So if a country in a really kind of wanton way just starts it with no consultation , that would be clearly ugly , bad , could create conflict , but I think there are also kinds of unilateralism where you 're not formally doing it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of consultation . And in that situation what might happen is a small number of countries might do it and many other countries might publicly say , " We wish we were involved in the decision , " and privately say , " We 're pretty happy somebody 's doing this because actually it will reduce climate risk and then this other group will take the liability . " <p> TONY JONES : And final question , because you probably - if someone decided to do this , even if a group of nations decided to do this , there 'd be tremendous scepticism in the public and you would , I imagine , get widespread protests , particularly when people realise that with sulphate particles in the atmosphere you 'd actually change the colour of the sky , which has a really big psychological effect on people , you would imagine . <p> How serious first of all would that change of colour be if you really were able to do it on a global scale and would you expect protests ? <p> DAVID KEITH : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would n't happen . So people have published papers where they get that , but only where they assume a quite large amount of geoengineering . They assume that geoengineering compensates all of the effect of climate change , which I think is a kind of nonsense policy . <p> So in a more plausible policy where you gradually wrap this up , compensating only part of the global warming ( inaudible ) , to kind of balance risks and benefits and where you gradually use more advanced particles , maybe starting in 50 years , I think you never see a change in colour . <p> So I think that 's a bit of a unlikely circumstance . But I do think it 's clear that people will protest because there are going to be winners and losers , just as there are under climate change . So it 's important to say that putting CO2 in the atmosphere , which we 're doing , creates winners and losers and this will again . <p> TONY JONES : David Keith , we 'll have to leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much for taking the time to come and talk to us . <p> DAVID KEITH : Thanks very much . <p> Do you have a comment or a story idea ?

@@1267232 <p> The irony of Australia saying that it will be difficult to meet is proposed Kyoto target because companies are building lots of coal and oil projects has not been lost on delegates . From a climate change point of view this is clearly an argument that is on a hiding to nothing . The entire point of these talks is to provide incentives for countries to do the opposite . <p> At times , Australia bases its entire justification for its target on projections that suggest that emissions in 2020 would be 22 per cent above where they would have been if the nation had not committed to , as a minimum , reducing emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels . Using projected emissions -- which no one here really believes anyway -- is unnecessary and puts the government in a defensive position . <p> Let us look , for example , at the 22 per cent below business as usual ( BAU ) figure . South Korea committed to reduce emissions by 30 per cent reductions below BAU by 2020 . Much poorer South Africa has committed to a 34 per cent below BAU and Brazil a 36-39 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute 's Global Climate Action Map for details on national targets and actions ) . <p> Perhaps a better approach by Australia would be to focus on the fact that from 2015 the nation will have a hard pollution limit on major emitting industries and this will allow the nation to meet any 2020 commitment it makes when it finalises its 2020 targets in 2014 . <p> If Australia moves to a stronger and more equitable target the emission cap under the domestic scheme can just be strengthened to reflect this new commitment . <p> The chart ( Figure 1 ) below illustrates this point . It compares Australia 's proposed Kyoto target with what Australia 's domestic policies will achieve by default . ( If the Parliament disallows the Governments proposed domestic emission limit in 2014 a ' default ' cap is triggered . This achieves at least a 12 million tonne per year reduction ) . <p> The chart also includes the effect of Australia 's Kyoto bonus generated from overachieving its first Kyoto target and the benefits Australia can receive from reducing emissions from managed forests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can release to 2020 . Yesterday , the government said it would use the bonus to offset the projected increase in emissions over the next few years of the next commitment period and until the emission limit kicks in from 2015 . <p> Figure 1 : Australia 's 2013-2020 Kyoto target and Australia 's current policy settings . Note : This graph does not use the most recent AR4 global warming potentials to be used in the Kyoto second commitment period as Australia 's emission projections do not currently include these values . As such Australia Kyoto targets and Kyoto bonus has been adjusted to reflect pre-AR4 values . <p> While Australia should have used this bonus to increase its global ambition , it is important to note that the existence of this bonus is unlikely to materially affect domestic emission reductions in Australia . This largely will be determined by the level of the carbon price and other policies like the Renewable Energy Target . The Kyoto bonus is , based on current forecasts , unlikely to materially impact these incentives and is more likely to impact the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere to meet its national target . <p> What this chart shows is that under current policy settings Australia is on track to meet its proposed Kyoto commitment without any additional policy intervention . In fact if emissions remain depressed due to ongoing low electricity demand Australia may even over achieve its proposed target ( illustrated by the dash line , Policy -- recent ) . This is consistent with the behaviour of other countries at these meetings where many commit to less than they feel their domestic policies will achieve to avoid international embarrassment around failing to meet a promised target . <p> Australia has been through a bitter political battle and implemented a set of flexible limits on pollution that can achieve any international commitment we commit to at least cost . Use of projections to justify a position is counterproductive and not really credible in the negotiations . Better to focus on what Australia can and will achieve over the coming years in driving clean energy and low carbon investment .

That puts it well ahead of other major world cities , like Paris , Shanghai , Beijing , Vienna , Amsterdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business 's demand for greater density in the centre it ought to be Sydney . <p> Melbourne tells a very different story to Sydney , though . Jobs grew by a spectacular 21% between 2006 and 2011 in the municipality of Melbourne . <p> Thus the centre clearly out-paced the rest of the metro area . That level of jobs growth in the centre was expected by most informed observers . <p> It 's consistent with the view that the rapid growth in public transport patronage in Melbourne in recent years -- faster than in Sydney -- is largely due to job growth . <p> While Melbourne is an important financial centre in its own right , even in world terms , it 's not in the same league as Sydney . Melbourne 's markedly higher growth suggests there might be a prosaic explanation for the difference between the two cities . <p> Perhaps much of it is down to the greater " elasticity " of Melbourne 's CBD . The ability of businesses to expand into large areas like Docklands and Southbank has moderated CBD prices and permitted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that large firms like NAB were able to integrate " backoffice " functions with headquarters functions in Docklands . In most other large cities , those sorts of routine functions are packed-off to lower cost locations like the suburbs or regional centres . <p> Sydney 's potential equivalent of Docklands is Barangaroo . It 's expected to accommodate around 15,000 jobs when built out , equivalent to three quarters of the jobs growth in the CBD over the last five years . <p> I 've thought for some time that Barangaroo might be on course to emulate some of the mistakes of Docklands . There 's a miraculous opportunity for Australia 's global city to create something really great by the harbour , but the visions articulated so far are mundane . <p> But now I also wonder if the city mothers and fathers are getting as much value from Barangaroo -- in terms of space for Sydney 's commercial heart to grow -- as they should . That sort of opportunity does n't come along all that often in a water-locked CBD . <p> Of course there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might simply be that redevelopment is more difficult in Sydney 's CBD -- there could be more planning obstacles , for good reasons or poor ones . <p> Maybe the more highly developed network of suburban activity centres in Sydney gives firms a viable alternative to the CBD . Or perhaps it 's simply that the GFC hit the finance sector and hence Sydney 's CBD especially hard . <p> On the other hand , perhaps the net value that theorists attribute to density in increasing productivity ( it 's increasingly incorporated in BCAs for new transport projects ) is over-stated , at least for some sectors . <p> When firms consider the benefits of agglomeration , they also have to consider the costs . Melbourne 's centre appears to offer its firms a more attractive option at the moment than Sydney 's . <p> Sydney might think further about the scope to increase economic activity in the centre . Melbourne might think about whether its centre is under-mining its suburban job centres strategy . <p> The growth that the report talks about is value of economic activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing rapid growth as a proportion of the economy are located in city centres and rely on increasingly on job densities to drive their productivity . The growth in the number of jobs in outer areas may still be strong but they are increasingly losing relative value to those in the inner city . I think this is the key point the report makes in trying to understand the restructuring forces at work in our major cities . On the productivity theme another nice little nugget was the fact that female participation in paid workforce has increased by nearly 10 percent since 1988 and that female human capital is increasing at a faster rate than that of males . In Melbourne , the estimated value of human capital for males with a higher degree in the city increased by 108 per cent between 1996 and 2006 , whereas for females it increased by 248 per cent .... interesting food for thought ! Cheers Syrah <p> The higher productivity of firms in the CBD has been known for many decades but the link to density has only been fully recognised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban literature ahead of the value of output . That 's partly no doubt because of data availability but primarily because employment has a direct physical relationship to key variables like density and infrastructure demand . <p> Do the figures for Sydney 's CBD include North Sydney , which is in many ways almost an extension of the main CBD ? It is also almost as accessible to most by public transport , more so for those living North of the Harbour . Then we have a growing secondary CBD at Parramatta , close to the geographical centre of the Sydney Metropolitan area . Then we have other CBDs in Chatswood , Bondi Junction and other centres and concentrations of Knowledge / Technology industries around Ryde . <p> Whether Sydney would function more effectively with a single gianormous CBD growing out from the place on the Southern shore of Port Jackson where Captain Philip found fresh water is a moot point . The current CBD is choking now and Sydney 's geography is against it . I 'd guess it would take tens ( hundreds ? ) of billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the city fathers in the early 19th century persisted with the idea of moving the capital and main city to Parramatta , with the area around Sydney Cove probably becoming a raucous and probably disreputable seaport ( a sort of combination of Kings Cross and Fremantle ) , it might have worked . <p> " It 's consistent with the view that the rapid growth in public transport patronage in Melbourne in recent years -- faster than in Sydney -- is largely due to job growth . " <p> Bit of chicken and egg here is n't there ? Is n't it that the rapid growth in economic output in the Melb CBD was possible because the transport capacity was there ? Any if so , is n't continued growth at risk as capacity is constrained ? <p> Good to know that the jobs growth of 21% in melbourne 's CBD is actually job value -- I was wondering where all these new workers could be , since the only major office buildings built since 2006 are the ANZ and NAB ' back offices'in Docklands . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in the State of Cities report on value at any scale lower than the entire metro area . Also , the 21% refers to Melbourne LGA , not the CBD , hence it includes Docklands , Southbank , and more . <p> The final statement , " Melbourne might think about whether its centre is under-mining its suburban job centres strategy . " Makes us ask whether Melbourne thinks at all ? Who is " Melbourne " ? Does " Melbourne " have a suburban jobs strategy ? ... or has Cabinet made a decision quantifying the the targets for a suburban jobs strategy ?

This latest debacle with Anthony Stuart / Bayliss / Gilbert is simply putting out there some ( and only some ) of the player concerns of just what CNSW is really about .

Without any disrespect to those kids named reality is , these are based on a " fair " distribution basis across Statewide Junior development areas ( to appease respective Junior Associations ) and not on ability / potential of the kids themselves . ( CNSW will argue " team balance " to in some way validate ) . So what happens , the better kids miss out to less talented players ( the joke is the kids themselves know themselves who are the better players ) and they in turn look elsewhere , maybe not there and then but in time they remember how CNSW do things , and move on .

These include : <p> The two main federal tax statutes are the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ( Cth ) and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ( Cth ) . The Australian tax system is administered by the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) . <p> Tax Registrations <p> Among the tax considerations that should be taken into account when investing or setting up business in Australia is whether any double taxation agreements are in place between Australia and the country of origin and whether the business would be considered an Australian resident for tax purposes . Whether a foreign-registered company is a ' resident ' for Australian tax purposes will depend on whether the central management and control of the company is located in Australia . Specialist tax advice should be obtained in determining whether a business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is considered to be an Australian resident for tax purposes , the business will typically need to obtain the following tax registrations : <p> an Australian Business Number ( ABN ) ; <p> a Tax File Number ( TFN ) from the ATO , which identifies the business as a taxpayer .

@@1979239 <p> A lacerated kidney , back fracture and groin complaint restricted his availability for the struggling Roosters , who are an infinitely more potent proposition when their Kiwi strike weapon is fit and firing . <p> Now that he has almost regained peak condition after off-season surgery , Kenny-Dowall is loathe to miss a beat as the Roosters prepare for redemption under new coach Trent Robinson . <p> That 's why he and teammates Mitchell Pearce , Aiden Guerra and Tom Symonds spent the first half of New Year 's Eve working their legs instead of elbows yesterday . <p> Under the command of sprint coach Roger Fabri , the foursome were run ragged through a sharp series of footwork and sprint drills designed to ignite the strength they have accumulated in eastern suburbs gyms over the past three months . <p> " We 're doing this during the break to maintain what we 've built over the pre-season , " Kenny-Dowall said . <p> " As athletes , you do n't want to lose what you 've worked so hard to build . <p> " If you do n't have your mind on the job all the time it can be easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go back to training . " <p> Their official return is a mere 48 hours away because the Roosters are one of a handful of clubs summoned back this week rather than next Monday . <p> Fabri , who was part of the coaching staff two years ago , has already noticed an improved work ethic . <p> " Their enthusiasm and application has certainly gone up a notch , " Fabri said . <p> With BJ Leilua released to join Newcastle and Tautau Moga sidelined until midway through this year with an ACL tear , Kenny-Dowall shapes as a crucial backline cog . <p> " The season is getting closer and closer and we all ca n't wait , " he said . <p> News.com.au 's Privacy Policy includes important information about our collection , use and disclosure of your personal information ( including to provide you with targeted content and advertising based on your online activities ) .
