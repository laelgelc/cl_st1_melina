Do you recognise anyone ? You can hardly be expected to . After all , it was 51 years ago . <p> In the front row , at left , is Father James Murray , former rector of St Dorothy 's Cure in Old Harbour , St Catherine . Also in the front , at right , is Canon Weeville Gordon , former rector of St Matthew 's Church in Allman Town , Kingston . Now , take a look at the person at the extreme rear . The tall gentleman in glasses who is looking away from the camera . Can you guess who that is ? That is journalist and talk-show host Wilmot ' Motty ' Perkins . <p> No , it is not a joke , that is indeed the sometimes acerbic , humorous , combative , critical , iconoclastic , perceptive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located on Caledonia Avenue in Cross Roads , St Andrew , at the spot now occupied by Church House , the headquarters of the Anglican Diocese of Jamaica . St Peter 's College was destroyed by fire . However , the arch , before which the picture was taken , is still standing . St Peter 's was first known as Jamaica Church Theological College and was established in 1877 . It underwent a name change in 1918 to St Peter 's College , after the Apostle Peter - its patron saint . <p> Reminiscences <p> Last week , Father Murray , Canon Gordon and Mr Perkins shared their reminiscences of the ace talk-show host 's life in the early 1950s . <p> Father Murray and Mr Perkins both grew up as children and lived close to each other in Buff Bay , Portland . <p> " From the early days , he was known as ' Motty ' . His father was an overseer of a property at Spring Garden , a little district a mile from Buff Bay . Motty used to come down to Buff Bay almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay . So we saw quite a lot of each other - almost daily in Buff Bay . Then I left for Kingston to attend Southermere Prep School in Half-Way Tree and Motty eventually went to Calabar , " Father Murray recalled . <p> " I went to St Peter 's College in 1949 , myself and Canon Gordon entered on the same day . Motty entered sometime later . How he got there , I do n't know . Motty was there for just one academic year . What happened was that Motty was a man who held strongly to his views even if they were opposite to the warden 's . <p> Canon D.S. Curry was the warden ( the headmaster ) of the college . If Canon Curry said " A " , Motty would say no - it had to be " C " . And Canon Curry would become quite vexed and have a tussle sometimes . <p> Motty was perceived to be a rather disputatious kind of person who was not happy unless he disagreed with you . In other words , he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even when he realised he was talking nonsense , he did not like to be seen as somebody who was an underdog - even if he were going up against a person ( like Canon Curry ) with a Master of Arts in theology from Oxford . Canon Curry was a brilliant theologian . He and Motty were always at loggerheads in lectures , " Father Murray said . <p> According to Canon Gordon , " If Canon Curry was giving a lecture and made a point that did n't stick with Motty , he would knock his finger on the desk - and have a long argument about that particular point . Sometimes the lecture would be finished and we would not have got anywhere in the lesson . <p> " People might have had an impression of him then as one who was always trying to oppose . But I did not find him that way . I found him to be a person who was always trying to fully understand . And if he did not fully understand , then he would possibly try to oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a great oppositionist , " said Canon Gordon . <p> Said Father Murray : " Canon Curry and Motty were always at loggerheads in lectures . It reached the stage where the warden felt this man ca n't stay here . He is the fly in the ointment - sort of . <p> Gleaner : He would be bringing down the name of the school ? <p> Father Murray : Yes . <p> Gleaner : And the school could not graduate somebody like that ? <p> Father Murray : Right . <p> " The point is , all this is perception . Sometimes perception is not the same thing as reality . But if you give a perception strong enough and long enough , people begin to label you as an obstructionist . I think that was Motty 's problem . He was a very astute thinker , but on the negative side as you hear him now . Because of his disputatious approach , he did not fit in very well with the rest of us . It tended to discolour relationships . People did n't tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of trouble in the place and giving the college a bad name , " Father Murray said . <p> PERKINS ' SIDE <p> Mr Perkins tells a different story . By his recollection , he did two full academic years at St Peter 's before he withdrew from that institution . <p> Gleaner : Is it true you did not get along with Canon Curry ? <p> Perkins : That is not true . I ca n't remember ever having problems with Canon Curry . Canon Curry and I , as far as I can remember , got along very well . To the best of my recollection , I had no big quarrel that I can remember while I was at St Peter 's . <p> Gleaner : Did you have any problems with the other lecturers ? <p> Perkins : I ca n't remember any great problems . <p> Gleaner : Did you enjoy your time while you were there at St Peter 's College ? <p> Perkins : Yes , I think so . <p> Gleaner : What subjects did you enjoy most ? <p> Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you do well in your subjects ; were you a good student ? <p> Perkins : Well , that is for someone else to judge . <p> Gleaner : You did two full years of theology , I mean , you should open your monologue in the mornings with a word of prayer , do n't you think ? <p> Perkins : Well , Deacon ( Thwaites ) does that - enough to cover us all . If it can cover Deacon , I do n't know what it wo n't cover . <p> Perkins in no man 's land <p> Father Murray related his version of the circumstances behind Mr Perkins ' failure to complete his theological education . <p> " During the summer vacation , everybody would have to leave the college . The academic year began in October and ended in June . The college would be closed from July to September . During that period , the matron is gone . The cooks are gone . Probably the groundsman is still there . Nobody was allowed to stay there because nobody would be there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did not have anywhere to go or he just wanted to be alone - I do n't know . Next door to St Peter 's was Bishop 's Lodge where the bishop lived - a Bishop Dale . When he heard that Motty was over there , he said to him : <p> Bishop Dale : " Perkins , you ca n't stay here . " <p> Perkins said : " Why not ? " <p> Bishop Dale : " Because there is nobody to look after you . " <p> Perkins : " I do n't see why I ca n't stay here . " <p> " And so they literally had to run him out . How would he get meals ? ! He could n't buy meals . Who would wash his clothes . I mean he was in no man 's land , " said Father Murray . <p> " I do n't know where Motty finally wound up . But I think that episode turned him off from the church . He felt in some way that the church did not want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided now to let the church have it . Anything regarding church , he would knock down . Swat it down like a fly . And he transferred that to his general philosophy of life , " Father Murray said . <p> " I was personally very sad when I went back to college after the break and found that he was not coming back . He was a very , very good friend of mine and we got along in an excellent manner , " said Canon Gordon . <p> But the ace talk-show host remembers differently . He was fuzzy about his reason for entering this quiet seminary whose student population never exceeded 12 . He recalls , however , being sick with typhoid as a four-year-old boy and was not far away from death . Children around him were dying of the disease . He survived . He wondered why he had lived when others had died . Somehow that experience became a contributing factor that caused him to enter the seminary . <p> Disconcerting theology <p> Nobody chased him out of St Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prefacing his explanation of his departure , he asked : " Have you ever been doing anything and then got the impression that this is n't where you want to be ? " <p> He explained that he found aspects of the history of the Church , Christian theology and denominationalism to be at best disconcerting . <p> He explained that the following were the general direction of this thoughts while at St Peter 's , though they might have been in embryonic form while he was there : <p> That aspect of Christian theology which states that God holds humanity accountable for the sins of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden . <p> Increasingly , he was seeing people through denominational labels . <p> Denominational leaders showed too much regard to denominational distinctives which , if these distinctives were important to salvation , most of the ordinary churchgoers within these denominations would be going to Hell .

@@4547240 <h> We need truancy officers <p> Recently , my mother , a retired teacher who migrated to the United States many years ago , and I were driving along Waterloo Road . As soon as we approached the traffic light by Devon House , she exclaimed , " Do n't they have truancy officers anymore ? " <p> She was appalled at something we have had to accept as the norm in our modern-day Jamaican urban society - the sight of a diminutive waif of a boy armed with a worn and broken sham of a windshield squeegee , approaching the driver 's side of the vehicle on a mission of mendicancy . <p> It was impossible for the little fellow to reach the windshield of any vehicle , let alone that of the 4x4 pickup ( a Toyota Hilux Vigo ) , so he was obviously risking life and limb and dangerously snaking his way between moving vehicles on a very busy thoroughfare on a school day for the sole purpose of begging for money . <p> My mother went on to recall that truancy officers would check at schools for a list of absentee children and scour the streets for them ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era when order and discipline consistently governed society and demanded responsibility and accountability from parents and guardians . <p> Unheard-of concept <p> We no longer have truancy officers .

@@4553231 <h> Columns <h> Give Rasta official religious rights for Jamaica 50 <p> TWO items have prompted me to write on the subject of Rasta this week . <p> The first was an April 12 letter to The Gleaner , ' Free the Rastafarian Religion ' by Linton P Gordon , and the second was an article in a US publication questioning Mitt Romney 's reluctance to answer questions on his Mormon faith . As readers will already know , unless the heavens fall , Romney is certain to be the Republican choice as presidential candidate to face President Obama in the presidential election this November . <p> As stated in the well-penned Linton P Gordon letter , " In 1971 , in the now famous case The Queen v Hines and King , the Court of Appeal of Jamaica upheld the rights of the accused man , Hines , who sought to swear using the name of his God , ' King Rastafari ' . Hines , at his trial in the Supreme Court , declined to swear on the Bible and instead sought to swear by ' Almighty God , King Rastafari ' . <p> " The judge at the trial refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Court of Appeal held that Hines should have been permitted to swear according to his religion . <p> " In so doing , the Court of Appeal of Jamaica recognised that the Rastafarian faith was sufficiently established , structured and existing at a level that it ought to be properly recognised as a religion . " <p> All an indication that we have come a long way since political independence in 1962 . <p> The fact that the Mormons , foreigners from the USA , have been given the right to practise their religion in Jamaica while Rasta has been accorded no such status is nothing short of scandalous . <p> In 2005 , I did some research on the Mormons , met with the then country president , Leroy Turner , and had a brief and somewhat edgy interview with him . In September of that year I wrote a column , ' The embarrassing Truth about Mormonism ' and as a result the Jamaican church took out a full-page newspaper ad in an attempt to distance itself from what I had written . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil rights movement , Black Power and the Black Panther Party were the pressure groups leading the charge against ' apartheid ' America . <p> It seems that it is no accident that the Mormons , who prefer to be called the Church of Latter Day Saints ( LDS ) , came to Jamaica in 1968 . At that time , a very dunce , racially backward and politically infantile JLP Government , four years before it was rejected by the people , was in the process of nullifying the teachings of , and expelling black Guyanese UWI lecturer Dr Walter Rodney ( a PhD at age 24 ! ) , declaring that he was " a most dangerous " man , presumably for expounding too much on blackness , Garveyism and the class/colour arrangements in Jamaica at that time . The irony was , we were doing that even as we were heaping condemnation on racist South Africa and Ian Smith 's Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) . <p> What was the ' embarrassing truth ' in my article ? In an extract from Journal of Discourses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mormon Church , 1844-1877 wrote , " You see some classes of the human family that are black , uncouth , uncomely , disagreeable and low in their habits , wild , and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind . <p> " The first man that committed the odious crime of killing one of his brethren will be cursed the longest of any one of the children of Adam . Cain slew his brother . Cain might have been killed , and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings . <p> " This was not to be , and the Lord put a mark upon him , which is the flat nose and black skin . Trace mankind down to after the flood , and then another curse is pronounced upon the same race -- that they should be the ' servant of servants ' ; and they will be , until that curse is removed .

The first is , the majority of people in the world who subscribe to some religious faith and religion , accept it or not , is here to stay . The second factor is , Rasta in year 50 of our political Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level playingfield . <p> It seems to me that there had to have been other considerations apart from religious freedom in granting the Mormons religious status . Was it geopolitical or purely political ? Or something else which can not be stated ? <p> A reading of the Book of Mormon would shock any normal Jamaican . Here are just two examples from their ' bible ' . <p> Example 1 : 2 Nephi 5 : 21 -- ' And he had caused the cursing to come upon them , yea , even a sore cursing , because of their iniquity . For behold , they had hardened their hearts against him , that they had become like unto a flint ; wherefore , as they were white , and exceedingly fair and delightsome , that they might not be enticing unto my people , the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them .

' <p> Natty must ride on and be a hero <p> Since the church arrived in Jamaica , there has been no doctrinal change or adjustment to the Book of Mormon . <p> The words still stand and that seems to be what elements in the US press recognise -- that Mitt Romney will at some stage be asked to explain this ' biblical ' derision of black skin in a country where even though the GOP is not expected to snatch any significant percentage of the black vote , that vote still represents a healthy 12 per cent of the US population and there are a few black-skinned people in leadership positions in the GOP . <p> We have come a far way since the days when the most traumatic happening to befall a household was the realisation that a son or daughter was growing dreadlocks and feasting on black literature .

Surely , Rasta is saddled with many charlatans , but the reality of Bob Marley and other high achievers in various sectors has allowed us to live with the pretenders . <p> We now have Rasta in politics , but of course we know where the epitome of Babylon is placed . Has Rasta joined up with Babylon or is it simply the smart thing to do to infiltrate the ' enemy ' , the better to beat him at his own game ? <p> Many adherents to Rasta have tempered the ultimate objective of the faith -- repatriation to the motherland Africa -- with the consideration that the real , if not spiritual , trip to the Abyssinia of their dreams includes the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too many hours of air travel .

Oftentimes social change is easier when the charge is led from outside . With Crawford on the inside there are those who will want to say that the country has other more important matters to worry about than Rasta being made an official religion . <p> Young Crawford will realise that many of our young men are finding themselves lost in the chase to attain economic viability .

Bent on realising the original intent of the group , the men restarted their programme in January this year with about 25 members . <p> Ensuring participation means having a structure that works for all . And so each week sees the men gathering in the streets at a central spot and occupying the corner to have a reasoning session to discuss issues affecting them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dominant in the household -- male or female ? We talk about crime and violence , and how we can make a ghetto crime and violence free , and what is the input we can make to change it , " said Troy Robinson , who chairs the group . <p> There is no sense of formality as the men stand in the streets in front of zinc fences emblazoned with graffiti . A few blocks away , a man showers under a standpipe in full view of everyone and a woman breastfeeds her baby while watching the group . Children of various ages run wild under the steady gaze of the men as they reason . Not long before , a military vehicle pulled up with about five soldiers armed with rifles and serious faces partly masked by handkerchiefs . One of the men is asked to open his bag for a search , but this is a common occurrence , and so not much attention is paid to this mild disturbance . <p> Robinson said their main aim is to teach the youths that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to see their own children become role models one day for themselves and others in the area . <p> " We have organised a group with a body and a structure , but we want a club now where we can carry out the little youths them here and show them like various experiences -- like take them to the country and show them some nice scenes and say , ' look here , life is here , not because we live in the ghetto you must think that life is not out there ' , " he said . <p> He said men like himself in inner-city communities are challenged to be good fathers .

Despite leaving school with four CXCs he was unable to get a job , so he provided a job for himself by becoming a sound system operator . <p> " It is very challenging at times because you know nothing comes easy , and this is another responsibility .

His organisation first started working with the Hannah Town community in 2009 as part of a UN Women-funded programme called ' Tek it to dem , rise up wi community ' . <p> The programme was multi-layered , with a focus on uplifting women and children while changing the mindset of the men , and addressing the psycho-social needs of different groups .

But we saw evidence that the men were actually looking at the situation differently , " he said . <p> It was out of this awareness that the group of men came together to start FFWE . The men are still learning to be better fathers , but Moore believes finances are often seen as a stumbling block to fulfilling that role . <p> " One of the ideals or one of the principles of manhood throughout the island is that being a provider is one of the critical elements of being a father and being a man per say , " said Moore . " There is a confusion with the whole notion of being a man or being a father . Because of that confusion , it plays out that if a man ca n't provide , then he is not a father . So what we try to do with a redefinition of manhood , is to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about nurturing , being there in other ways , helping the child with homework , changing a diaper ; just overall helping the child in every aspect . " <p> Robinson said that based on the bond formed within the group , they have taken on the responsibility of guiding other youths in the area . Robinson , who was 13 when he lost his father to gun violence , knows how crucial a father figure is to a child . He is particularly pleased with the impact the group has already been making with the children so far . <p> " The youth them would have talked back to any elder as they feel like , but now they are using the words ' good morning ' , ' excuse me ' , ' please ' and ' Miss ' or ' Mr ' .

The UWI Sports Department began in the late 1960s with the vision geared towards recreational sporting disciplines . This included hall-by-hall rivalry , which was extended to inter-campus competitions . <p> However , the UWI now envisions that its students should not only be leaders in academia , but also out of the classroom , for example , in the area of sports , by offering internationally competitive athletic facilities and programmes . <p> " We still pride ourselves as the place for academics . But globalisation is taking place , so academics alone wo n't cut it , " said Dalton Myers , sports director at the UWI . He said the major changes came about when Olympian Grace Jackson was at the helm of the department . Myers said , with Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary changes . <p> The environment , Myers said , has now been set for UWI students to show their sporting prowess , having now been exposed to the highest level of competition within and outside of the region . <p> " We host competitions and invite overseas teams .

Participation at this level presents students with greater challenges and provides opportunities for individual excellence as well as for marketing the institution . To make the process easier , the UWI has instituted a scholarship programme to encourage and assist students with the highest potential to excel in the broad areas of sports and sports development . <p> Scholarship opportunities <p> Based on an evaluation , prospective athletes are awarded full or part-time scholarships .

This is the fifth year of the scholarship programme that initially started with track and field as well as football as the two main disciplines . However , the offerings have expanded , with 30 new persons receiving scholarships in different disciplines .

@@4569237 <h> Columns <h> Rape and the poorly socialised male <h> WIGNALL 'S WORLD <p> THE walk on foot from the narrow parochial road to the hillside farm and ganja field was about two miles . Were we not in our thirties and fit , we would not have made it . <p> It was sometime in the late 1980s , and the midday sun was unforgiving as we manoeuvred a few streams , thick undergrowth and then a dirt path up an incline to the little thatched-roof ' tatu ' that the Rastaman called home when he was in the hills tending his ' herbs crop ' , some place in St Catherine . <p> It did n't take him long to light up a ' big head ' ganja spliff . The more adventurous among the small group of three accepted a few puffs and after about 10 minutes we were less tired , more relaxed and chatting our heads off . <p> The Rastaman was the ' overseer ' for the crop for a ' big man ' , and in his cramped but strangely comfortable space , he had flour , rice and other foodstuff stored . Plus , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a container of drinking water . <p> One of the young men who lived in a nearby community began telling me about one of his close friends . According to him , he was trudging through the bushes one late afternoon when he heard sounds which told him that two people were in the brush having sex . He froze at first , then stealthily crept up to where the sounds of urgency were coming from . <p> As he silently drew away some bushes he saw that it was a friend of his and a girl from the community . " Mi jus ' wait until dem done and when him come out mi show myself . " <p> He suggested to his friend that he wanted ' some ' too . Apparently the friend had total disdain for himself , the young woman and the very act of sex because he turned to the woman and asked her if she could " help out mi friend " . <p> The woman refused , and an argument developed . According to the young man , " Di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mi get mine " . <p> Somehow in the mirth of the moment and the haze of the ganja smoking , the young man expected that I would have taken sides with him . I was far from impressed . " You raped her , " I said . " Both of you did ! " <p> " No , man , shame a yu . Wi would n't do a ting like dat , " he said , feeling genuinely sad that I had seen a wrong where he saw none . <p> " My brother , " I said . " She did not consent ! If she did n't give you permission , that is called rape . You do n't understand that ? " <p> The Rastaman laughed , and so did two others . I was apparently from a different world . To them , once the young woman had had sex and it was seen that she had sex , she was pretty much fair game and could not rightfully claim that her sexual unavailability was hers to make . I was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eked out an education , but all came from families of multiple mothers and a stream of endless , absent fathers . <p> To them , any idea I had that a woman 's body had a sacred space , and her right to determine who shared it was hers and hers alone , was fit only for a world far divorced from theirs where sex was little more than rutting behind a screen or , as a child , being shunted out of the room to the nearest doorstep when the latest ' uncle ' arrived with rum on his breath to huff and puff in a crude rhythm with his hungry mother . <p> That said , it is my belief that even the most well-adjusted male is not far from being an animal when it relates to sex . Where he saves himself , though , is in that moment where all of his upbringing springs at him all at once , and though he does not recognise it as such , he holds back and allows the beast its passage from his system . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to her , " It 's OK , I understand . May I see you tomorrow ? " <p> Jamaica is <p> skating on slime <p> Jamaica presently lacks political leadership , but it did n't begin yesterday or last year . <p> What makes the present situation so stark is that the present leadership is not even pretending that the country is in crisis mode . Once political leadership takes its extended vacation , all other areas of leadership in the country take their cue and the domino theory falls true to form . <p> Ferocious murders and rapes of nightmarish proportions are signals that the society is slipping downhill fast and we are ardently seeking a date with the gods of chaos . As a nation of people colonised into believing in the power of prayer , that politically correct response to human inadequacies , I expect that soon our clergymen will be leading a prayer march to heal the nation 's pain . <p> This country needs laws with teeth , not useless prayer , designed purely to placate the politically foolish and the religiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those already there must be constantly exposed to the latest , cutting-edge techniques in crime solving . <p> Recently I saw on Facebook a question being posed by CVM TV on whether people believe that Jamaica 's football side will make qualification to the next World Cup . Most of the first responses were along the lines of , ' We will be praying that it does , ' or ' the side needs all of our prayers . ' <p> No wonder this country is so backward . <p> One wonders if Steve Jobs or Bill Gates had prayed instead of working their brains into many nights whether we would have had Apple or Microsoft . <p> In a country with 19 per cent Internet penetration , we are definitely in the backwoods . <p> Getting back to crime solving . It is no secret that over the last 40 years a wedge has been driven between the police force ( the JCF ) and the people of this country , and organised criminality has taken full opportunity to abuse that fact . <p> The rapist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in instances where policemen commit the most heinous of crimes , in court cases they are made out to be paragons of virtue .

By my ' guesstimates ' rapes are under-reported by about 75 per cent . <p> Let me give you an example . In 1997 , I met three young women , two from rural parishes and one from a semi-rural St Andrew community . <p> Of the two from rural parishes , one had been raped at 14 by a taximan who was known to her mother . In fact , due to dire poverty and the more depressing fact that the mother had seven children by five men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . <p> The first night he did he drove her to a marl pit , pulled out a knife and raped her in the bushes . It was weeks after , when he drove her down while she was walking on a lonely stretch of road and she escaped ( into the path of another car ) , that she reported it to her mother . <p> The mother suggested that she keep it to herself . <p> The other rural parish young woman was held down at her home by her brother 's friend . Luckily an electric iron was on a night table nearby and she eventually grabbed it and slammed it into one side of his head . An alarm was made and her brother and his friends arrived to apply a sound beating . All were agreed that no report should be made . <p> The home where the young woman from the semi-rural St Andrew community lived with two sisters and her mother was raided one night by gunmen . All were raped , but the sisters were unaware that the mother was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother began to experience severe mental problems , it took the intervention of an analyst to determine that she was raped and trying desperately to keep it a secret . Again , no report was made to the police . <p> The courts are hard on women who are raped and there is always the presence of a mercenary lawyer , trained not to possess a heart , who would be willing to rip the reputation of that damaged and aggrieved woman to shreds . <p> Impossible mission to <p> stop vigilante justice <p> In an action movie I saw recently -- Punisher I think it was -- there is a quote along the lines of , " Sometimes the law is inadequate . In order to shame its inadequacy , it is often necessary to operate outside of the law . " <p> Vigilante justice has been around ever since I was a child , and I am certain it existed before that . A man steals another man 's prized ram and slaughters it for its meat . <p> The man retaliates by getting his friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within an inch of his life . <p> In comparison with 50 years ago when murders and rapes were extremely rare occurrences , today criminality of all stripes is rampant and very few of us feel safe to venture out at night . In the daytime we are stressed out until our children and other loved ones arrive at home . <p> A society can not operate in that manner , and something has to give . <p> It is accepted that the JCF can not solve the crime problem in this country . Making appeals to the citizenry to co-operate with the police is an uphill task . Citizens will not give the police information unless they can be assured of their own safety . I know of one person who said she would only give the police information if she could be assured that the police would kill the person she labelled as the perpetrator of the crime . <p> In this scenario , mob killings will increase because the people feel helpless . Ironically , ' the people ' are , too many times , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed . That is a whole other problem -- the bloodlust ! <p> People are not prepared to sit by while their communities are overrun with rapists and murderers . The ordinary man at street level has little chance of securing a licence to own a firearm . And even then , while that may offer him some protection in his household , he must at some stage venture out . <p> What then ? <p> The impotence of this PNP Administration has caught even the most ardent PNP supporter off guard . But I am not too sure that Jamaicans are too anxious to engage in a tit-for-tat political swap when the people are generally convinced that the PNP is the better package of sliced bread . <p> I believe the people will simply hunker down for the rough times , both economically and socially . Mob justice will increase and certain police factions will turn a blind eye to it . <p> In general , criminality will increase because the criminals sense the lack of direction and absence of leadership in the political sphere . <p> I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there is a silver lining , it is having one hell of a time in showing itself to me . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@4569239 <h> Why are they leaving traditional churches ? The Exodus explained <p> The Gleaner has done an excellent job in reporting on the decline in membership of traditional churches and the rise of the Adventists and **25;309;TOOLONG , drawing on statistics from the latest Jamaican census . <p> Beginning with its lead story in last week 's Sunday Gleaner ( ' Exodus ; J'cans Flee Traditional Churches ; said to be flocking newer denominations ' ) and continuing with Monday 's front-page story , ' Jamaicans turn away from ' ritual , boring worship ' , as well as several others , the paper has tracked the malaise which has overtaken orthodox Christianity in Jamaica . <p> In the 1960 census , the Pentecostals accounted for a mere one per cent of the population count , numbering 14,739 . By the 2001 census that figure had accelerated to 247,452 . But in this latest census , Pentecostals have grown to 295,195 - a growth of approximately 20 per cent , the highest growth rate of any denomination over 10 years . People identified as " Church of God " in the census , which has a style of worship and theological framework similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations like the Church of God of Prophecy and the New Testament Church of God . <p> But the largest denomination in Jamaica does not even meet on the traditional day of worship , Sunday , as that denomination is the Seventh-day Adventist Church . The Adventist Church has grown from 281,353 in 2001 to 322,228 in 2011 , a growth of nearly 15 per cent . <p> The decline in the membership of the traditional churches has been dramatic . Take the Moravians , for example , who played such a critical role in Jamaica 's history . In the 1960 census , 52,467 persons identified themselves as Moravians . ( Bear in mind that Jamaica 's population then was approximately 1.61 million , compared to 2.7 million today . ) Yet in the latest census only 18,351 persons identified themselves as Moravians . <p> In the 1960 census , 115,291 persons were identified as Catholic . The number slid to 67,204 in the 2001 census and in the 2011 census only 57,946 persons identified themselves with the Roman Catholic Church . A nearly 14 per cent decline over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1960 census . But in this latest census , membership has tumbled to 43,000 . Not only are traditional churches declining but there is no indication that they will ever see any significant rise in their membership . There are certain factors propelling the decline of traditional churches and the growth of newer churches . <p> The Gleaner sought answers as to why the drift away from traditional churches . One Pentecostal pastor was not diplomatic : " Boring , predictable and a ritualistic style of worship " , were among the main reasons Jamaicans were fleeing traditional churches like Roman Catholicism , Anglicanism , United Church , Moravians and Methodism , he felt . Said he : " Persons are no longer interested in ritual , boring worship that does not connect with them . They want a church where they can connect with themselves on a spiritual level and feel alive and vibrant " . But many of the congregations of traditional churches have adopted a more expressive , lively and charismatic style of worship , incorporating musical instruments and contemporary worship in their services to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday quoted a Moravian minister as saying that , " we are shifting in that direction more in terms of lively singing , choruses and music . This is a response to the fact that people are saying we need more out of worship " . But a charismatic-type worship with a lot of shouting , gospel deejay music and band music is not all that 's pulling people , for how do you explain the fact that the Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest denomination in the island and that denomination , while not dull , is certainly not among the liveliest . That 's a denomination where the pull would be more with doctrine , particularly the emphasis on the Seventh-day Sabbath . <p> deeper reasons <p> The reasons for the decline in traditional Christianity in Jamaica and for the rise in the newer churches are deeper than have been captured by the Gleaner reports so far . First , the decline in traditional churches is a global phenomenon , particularly pronounced in North America and Europe . This decline has been evident for decades . In 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churches Are Growing . He showed that people were generally more attracted to groups which demanded more of them , which established clear boundaries and which eschewed moral ambiguities . The more established denominations tended to be more liberal socially and politically and , of course , were not fundamentalist and literalist . Especially in a country where citing Scripture and being able to memorise it are glorified , churches which are more fundamentalist in their approach to the Bible will have a greater pull . Your average Anglican or Roman Catholic priest or Moravian or Methodist pastor is not likely to beat a Seventh-day Adventist or a Pentecostal pastor in a ' tracing Scripture ' match , pitting proof-text against proof-text . <p> In Jamaica we love a ' clash ' , not just in the dancehall or on the political platform , or in the bar , but in the religious arena as well . We are an argumentative , cantankerous and contentious people . We are , culturally , a factious , divisive people and religious groups which emphasise distinctives , like the Adventists with the wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mark of the Beast , who is the Antichrist , will carry the swing . <p> generates excitement <p> The Moravian , Methodist or United Church reverend talking about the love of Christ and the Social Gospel is not likely to generate as much excitement as the Pentecostal preacher ' proving ' from Scripture that you must speak in tongues to be saved , that you must baptise in Jesus ' name and that you can get your healing and material blessings right now if you show faith . That 's more adrenaline-raising than Father Ho Lung 's talking about helping dying AIDS patients or the elderly poor . <p> A statement attributed to Charles Dufour , Archbishop of Kingston , tells precisely why the Catholic Church is likely to continue its downslide in membership : " We do n't believe in sheep stealing ... . We do n't go after other churches ' members and we do n't criticise other churches . We are not into that " . Well , Archbishop , the newer churches are into that and that 's why so many Catholics have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention , no doubt , pure and Godly . But in the real marketplace of religion , where the Catholic Church is being beaten down as representing the Beast and the Antichrist ; where in Adventist eschatology the Papacy will again plunge the world into religious oppression and will force " the final crisis " upon the world , there has to be a polemical response or others will steal your sheep . Our clash culture facilitates people 's trekking from one church to the next because of better lyrics , better rhythms and more wheel-and-come-again doctrines . <p> The traditional churches take a more intellectual , high-ground approach to evangelism and mission and generally concentrate less on correct doctrine . The Seventh-day Adventists emphasise doctrine , Biblical teaching and is characterised as a " movement of destiny " ; a movement with a unique perspective on history and prophecy , one proclaiming the Third Angel 's Message of Revelation 14 . Sociologists of religion have demonstrated over and over that groups that are exclusivist and which emphasise distinctive doctrines and features attract more people than those which are ecumenical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to believe in a complex , confusing and critical age . Religious groups that have pat answers , packaged solutions and panaceas generally do far better than those which invite people to mystery and self-discovery and which emphasise process over product . People want black and white , not shades of grey . <p> That is what the newer churches are offering . Plus , the churches which are growing fastest are not Pentecostal in the old-fashioned sense . You must understand this important shift which has taken place . <p> It 's not just that people want livelier , more rousing worship . Pentecostal and Church of God churches were always offering that while the traditional churches had more members . What has changed ? Old-style Pentecostals were largely uneducated peasants and working class people ; the kinds of people studied by Ashley Smith and Barry Chevannes . The Pentecostals who are growing today are of a different kind . Enter the Charismatics who are more middle-class , more lettered , more moneyed , more upwardly mobile . <p> People see successful professionals , business people and celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Kingston 's church-going elite ) . So it is no longer your helpers and gardeners who are ' getting in spirit ' , but big , brown , uptown people . The Holy Spirit has gone uptown , so people finally have the validation they were looking for in this highly stratified society . Besides , while the old-style Pentecostals frightened you with hellfire and brimstone , new-style Pentecostals induce you with blessings of health and wealth . The prosperity Gospel is what is driving many people , including the young , to newer churches . The churches which are growing rapidly , apart from the Adventists , are the prosperity gospel churches . <p> It 's a gospel which is very much in tandem with the materialistic , consumerist ethos of American culture , which is our primary influence . It 's the religious version of capitalism . So you have a religion that is not really counter-cultural but fundamentally in line with the spirit of the age . <p> Jamaicans are highly ambitious , materialistic and acquisitive . Come to Jesus and He will bless you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a good amount of money . Whatever you need , as long as you have faith and have Jesus , you 'll get it . In fact , you can get it easier than having to work hard as is the gospel in secular society . It 's an easier road to the same wealth worship in bourgeois society . <p> In an excellent book released this year chronicling the shift from traditional churches and titled , Bad Religion : How We Became a Nation of Heretics , New York Times columnist Ross Douthat says celebrity prosperity preacher Joel Osteen " embodies a shift of a very different sort - the refashioning of Christianity to suit an age of abundance , in which the old war between monotheism and money seems to have ended , for many believers , in the marriage of God and Mammon " . <p> The Humpty Dumpty of traditional Christianity can never be put back together again in Jamaica .
