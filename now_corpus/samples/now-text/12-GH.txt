The 54 countries in Africa together have a population of about one billion or about 14% of the population of the world . Close to 1000 different languages are spoken on the continent . Africa 's contribution to world trade is 1% and 25 of the world 's bottom poor countries are in Africa . <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that 300 to 500 million Africans are infected with malaria each year causing 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths . More than 90% of these deaths occur in children under 5 years of age . This means that in Africa a child dies every 45 seconds of malaria . The estimated annual direct and indirect costs of malaria to Africa were US$800 million in 1987 and about US$1.8 billion in 1995 . <p> Sub-Saharan Africa is more heavily affected by HIV and AIDS than any other region of the world . An estimated 22.4 million people are living with HIV in the region - around two thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people died from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and 1.9 million people became infected with HIV . Since the beginning of the epidemic , more than 14 million African children have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS . <p> Globally , tuberculosis is second only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of illness and death of adults , accounting for nearly nine million cases of active disease and two million deaths every year . Although it has only 14% of the world 's population , Africa accounts for more than a quarter of this global burden with an estimated 2.4 million TB cases and 540,000 TB deaths annually . <p> Africa has a triple burden of disease . Firstly , non communicable diseases ( NCDs ) such as heart disease , hypertension and stroke that are affected by lifestyle are increasing on the continent . The World Heart Federation ( WHF ) estimates that 17.1 million people die every year from heart disease and stroke and 80% of these deaths occur in developing countries . The total projected deaths due to chronic NCDs in Africa in 2005 were about 2.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 million will die from chronic diseases . <p> Secondly , the continent has not been able to deal with many of the infections and communicable diseases , including childhood diseases that are no longer prevalent in the developed world . <p> Thirdly , the increasing onslaught of cancer in Africa has been largely overlooked and ignored . <p> In 2002 , there were 6.7 million cancer deaths worldwide with less than 5% of these in sub-Saharan Africa . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , by 2020 , African states will account for more than a million new cancer cases per year out of a total of 16-million cases worldwide and that should present trends continue Africa is expected to have the highest incidence of cancer by 2030 . <p> We are leaders in " bad things " . <p> The contradiction of our situation is that despite the fact that our contribution to world trade is minimal we as Africans spend about four billion US dollars annually to recruit and pay 100,000 expatriates to work in Africa but we fail to spend a proportional amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most African countries depend on their so-called development partners for 100% financing of development projects . It is estimated that 80% of inputs into agriculture , education and health are from foreign sources . <p> These figures tell us that there are problems on the continent and the biggest one is that of crisis of leadership . Our leaders have not been able to leads us to provide ourselves the basic necessities for survival . These basic needs are food , shelter , clothing , health and security . In nature any population that is not able to feed , shelter , clothe , heal and defend itself has very little chance of long term survival . We continue to depend on others for even basic needs . <p> Other signs of leadership crisis are alarming and persuasive . There is a widespread loss of faith in our major institutions such as the judiciary and law enforcement agencies generally . There is an alarming breakdown of traditional values and discipline ; corruption is more or less institutionalized and no serious attempts are being made to fight it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the day . Africans do not seem to have the confidence to lift themselves out of their misery and are looking to foreigners to solve their problems for them . Our pride as a people capable of playing our role on the international scene has been totally eroded . <p> Why do n't we as Africans have leaders be they prime ministers , presidents , scientists , farmers , politicians or teachers who inspire and motivate or even excite us to greater heights ? Where , for God 's sake , have all our leaders gone ? <p> The quality and life of the society depends on the quality of the leaders . As a person can not function without a brain , so a society can not function without leaders . <p> A nation that can not provide its citizens with clean water , construct toilets and dispose of its wastes safely can not by any stretch of imagination come out with measures that will ensure a significant economic growth to lift the nation out of disease , ignorance and squalor . What can we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few problems with our leaders : <p> 1 . It really beats my understanding that African leaders do not seem to realize that the real difference between the developed countries of America , Europe , Asia and the Far East and the underdeveloped countries of Africa lies in their technological capability . This capability has been defined as the extent to which countries , access , utilize , and create science and technology for the solution of socio - economic problems . Our leaders do not seem to realize that our world is essentially driven by technology . Energy , agriculture , medicine and health , clean air and water , transportation , sanitation , management use and conservation of natural resources -- all are based ultimately in science and technology . So it is obvious that to be a part of that world , there must be science and technology elements in the development process . Unfortunately most African Countries have refused to be part of the modern world . <p> 2 . Because of the apparent refusal to adopt science and technology development most African countries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since political independence and still rely on the export of raw materials such cocoa , gold , timber , bauxite , diamond , manganese and oil , all in the raw form . There is absolutely no value addition . This is what I term Adam and Eve Economy . Noah did better than Africa is doing now ; at least he manufactured a ship that was absolutely seas worthy . <p> 3 . Our leaders do seem to know that human beings are the only animals that are born without any intrinsic knowledge of technology and culture . All animals and other lower forms of life come to the world with instinctive technology for survival . Thus birds do not have to go to any architecture school to learn how to build their homes . They do so instinctively . Bees do not learn chemistry or biochemistry bit they produce honey . We as humans are not animals of instinct so to be able to conceptualize , design , test and manufacture something we have to learn to do that thing . If we in Africa import toothpicks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all industrial goods from abroad it means that we do not know how to produce these things . <p> 4 . Only education can prepare us to acquire the knowledge and skills to manufacture things . It follows that the education we have in Africa has not been able to help us produce anything . It is therefore for the most part not focussed , irrelevant and probably outright useless . Most African countries spend almost next to nothing on Research and Development . It appears we do not seem to know the importance of R&amp;D in development . <p> 5 . Our leaders do not seem to know the developmental history of countries that have made it in the last 50 years . <p> 6 . Korea has transformed itself from a stagnant agrarian society into one of the most dynamic industrial economies of the world within 40 years . In the early 1960s when Korea first launched its industrialization efforts , it was a typical poor developing country with poor resource and production base and small domestic market . Korea 's GNP in 1961 was only $ 2.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came mainly from the primary sectors . The manufacturing sector 's share in GNP remained at a mere 15% . International trade was also at a very infant stage : in 1961 , Korea 's export volume was only $55 million and imports $390 million . As late as 1970 , the three top exports were textiles , plywood and wigs . But it is now 13th largest economy and one of the major trading countries of the world . It has also established world prominence in such technology areas as semi-conductors , LCD , telecommunication equipment , automobiles , shipbuilding , and so on . Indeed , it has emerged from nowhere as one of the key international players in the global economy . <p> 7 . Singapore provides another example . When the government of Lee Kuan Yew took office in 1959 it set out to have a clean administration . The Prime Minister said that " we were sickened by the greed , corruption , and decadence of many Asian leaders " and " We had the deep sense of mission to establish a clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to scientific and technological development , Lee Kuan Yew and his team were able to live up to their good intentions and Singapore , which in 1819 was a village with 120 fishermen without any natural resources and hinterland , propelled itself from third world squalor to first world affluence in just 35 years . <p> 8 . The economic development taking place in China is the result of an initiative taken by four scientists . On the 3rd of March , 1986 , four of China 's top weapons scientists : WANG Daheng , WANG Ganchang , YANG Jiachi , and CHEN Fangyun , jointly sent a private letter to Deng Xiaoping , the leader of the country with a warning that decades of relentless focus on militarization had crippled the country 's civilian scientific establishment . They recommended that China must join the world 's " new technological revolution , " or it would be left behind . They called for an ? lite project devoted to technology ranging from biotech to space research . Deng agreed , and scribbled on the letter , " Action must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Sputnik moment , " and the project was code-named the 863 Program , for the year and month of its birth . In the years that followed , the government pumped billions of dollars into labs and universities and enterprises , on projects ranging from cloning to underwater robots . The program initially focused on seven key technological fields : <p> * Biotechnology <p> * Space technology <p> * Information technology <p> * Laser technology <p> * Automation <p> * Energy <p> * Advanced Material Sciences <p> Since 1986 , two more fields have been brought under the umbrella of the program : <p> * Telecommunications ( 1992 ) <p> * Marine Technology ( 1996 ) <p> In 2006 , Chinese leaders redoubled their commitment to new energy technology ; they boosted funding for research and set targets for installing wind turbines , solar panels , hydroelectric dams , and other renewable sources of energy that were higher than goals in the United States . China doubled its wind-power capacity that year , and then doubled it again the next year , and the year after . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , it was manufacturing more solar cells than any other country , winning customers from foreign companies that had invented the technology in the first place . <p> 9 . Our leaders have devalued themselves to the extent that they think only foreigners can help us out of our misery . How can someone tell us that he is waiting for a loan from some other country before roads , schools and other infrastructural projects can be executed ? <p> 10 . Our leaders seem to know it all and can develop the continent without Africans . After all they do not need us to travel around looking for loans , grants and handouts . They do not need us to build the infrastructural projects . After all those who give out the loans will also provide workers from their country to get the work done . <p> 11 . Our leaders understanding of development seem to be only the provision of infrastructure . No country ever developed by borrowing to build infrastructure . ' Something ' else must be built on the infrastructure . That something is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major problems that we face are the lack of technology , " institutionalized " corruption and the fact that leadership over the years has taken the greatest asset of the nation , its people , for granted . <p> The greatest asset of Africa to me is the trust and confidence of its people . In Africa this asset has been squandered over the years through misgovernment and corruption to the extent that leaders are not trusted and citizens do not see that they have a stake in their country and its future . <p> Most Africans do not see any virtue in working for the future of their countries . Our leaders have not been able to invoke in the citizens the spirit of nation building . An antagonistic spirit has possessed political opponents who continuously knock the heads of unsuspecting Africans together while the population continues to wallow in poverty and despair . Nobody appears to be in a position to sacrifice anymore for our communal good and welfare . <p> Most Africans feel that they have sacrificed enough without any improvements in their lives . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives got worse off because governments always took them and their sacrifices for granted . <p> When leaders fail to achieve any appreciable success they give up any hope of improving the lives of the generality of the population and result to amassing wealth for themselves , their families and friends . In the final analysis stealing becomes widespread . <p> The foreign assistance Africa receives is usually not in the form of industries that provide jobs and ensure transfer of technology but are the ones that make the citizens dependent on the perpetual injections of aid . Africa benefits just marginally from its enormous natural resources . <p> Tanzania , for example , is the only country in the world where Tanzanite gemstones are mined . The annual revenue from this precious stone , discovered in 1967 , that goes to the people of Tanzania is just about US$14m , while dealers in the developed world that are major importer of the raw Tanzanite earn about US$300m . At the same time Tanzania is ranked by the World Bank as one of the poorest countries in the world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one US dollar per day and also depending on external financing for almost the entire development budget . It is on record that donors finance 50% of Tanzania 's annual budget . <p> The high-tech economies of the present would not exist without coltan from DR Congo , so essential to making computer chips " . ( Coltan is columbite-tantalite a metallic ore comprising niobium and tantalum . When refined it becomes metallic tantalum , a heat resistant powder that can hold high electrical charge -- used to create CAPACITORS ) . <p> I have every reason to believe that the situation is the same in my Ghana with its numerous mineral resources . If so much gold , bauxite , manganese and diamonds are mined and sold why should we be begging all these years ? <p> All nations that have made it did so by confronting the problems facing them . I sincerely believe that the fight ahead of us today is greater than the fight for political independence and it can not be won by undisciplined people who still depend on outdated strategies . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves and to utilize our enormous resources for our own development . <p> For far too long , African leaders have concentrated on providing infrastructure such as roads , schools and hospital for their people . This is not bad in itself but as far as I am concerned the many roads , schools , hospitals , wells , electricity and other infrastructural projects erroneously called development projects that it can provide , do not alone determine the measure of the success of a Government . Not even the quantum of foreign investment is a measure of this success . Rather the success of true leadership is measured by what extent the people can be mobilized to lead independent lives : to feed , shelter , clothe , heal and defend themselves , and also produce tools , implements , spare parts and machines they require for daily living , so that if for one reason or the other ships and airplanes are unable to come to the country the citizens can stand on their own and survive . <p> What about the role of African intellectuals in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class education in Africa and abroad , notably in Europe and America . It appears that educated Africans do better outside Africa than in Africa . There are a number of Africans who are contributing to the development of the United States in various fields . They are successful here because the systems are in place to absorb them . Most African countries do not have meaningful development strategies and so are not able to identify specialists they need to absorb for the development of the nations . <p> I believe that most African students in the United States , including Ohio University are sponsored by their parents , guardians or themselves . They are here studying in area they think will benefit them first and not so much what will assist in the overall development of their individual countries . After all , the countries do seem to care about them . <p> Worse still , a lot of African intellectuals are unable to get together to offer solutions to national problems . Rather they align themselves according to their individual tribal , political , religious and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be in national interest . <p> In many respects therefore the African intellectual is no different from his uneducated counterpart . Both of them will support their tribes ' people or religious colleagues who have political power because their personal interests will be served . <p> Summary <p> 1 . There is need for attitudinal change in Africa . We should realize that the overall development of the continent , including the economic , social , cultural and technological development is the responsibility of the Africans . <p> 2 . The task of political leadership is to unearth the actors needed to transform the nation . <p> 3 . We as African should exorcise the ' beggar mentality ' from our lives and accept that our poverty is self-inflicted . It is absolutely unnecessary . <p> 4 . We need to understand that Science , Engineering and Technology will give us the capacity to manufacture machines , develop processes and materials and exploit our abundant natural resources for national development . If we do not develop the capacity to manufacture machines that will work for us we should as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No country ever developed without the capacity to manufacture machines . If we characterize the economies of most African countries as agricultural based , we do so by default because we can not do anything else . As stated earlier we are like Adam and Eve , Cain and Abel and Methuselah . Even Noah could build a ship . 2200 years ago the Chinese built the over 6300km Great Wall of China , without any assistance from the World Bank but we in the 21st Century have closed our minds to technology and need assistance to construct everything . <p> 5 . African leaders need to constantly remind themselves that the POVERTY GAP is a TECHNOLOGY GAP . <p> 6 . African leaders should do whatever they can to minimize corruption of all shapes and sizes . <p> 7 . African politicians have so far failed the continent . African intellectuals should get out of their comfort zones and fight for the socio-economic emancipation of Africans who have contributed to their education . The fight will not be against any foreign powers but rather against corrupt politicians so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1806238 educational system ! <p> In today 's fast developing world , one has to be strategic to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and the needs of the society . Education is key to the development of any nation . Unfortunately , the current educational system in Ghana ( from Primary-Tertiary ) , in my opinion , is in serious jeopardy . Education has become a tool for campaigning by politicians , and when they are voted into power they alter the already existing system to score cheap political points . Much as changes need to be made to advance in technology , there is also the need to be consistent in our educational system for its success and effectiveness . Our politicians seem to be playing games with our Senior and Junior High school systems . Over the years we have experienced changes to the duration of the SHS system under different political parties . Have these changes ever been justified ? What is the rationale behind these changes ? It is unclear whether these unnecessary changes are made to enhance the effectiveness of the system or just to gain cheap political popularity . The computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to replace the inefficient and corrupt method of placing Junior high school students into senior secondary schools . Sadly , the new computerized system is riddled with the same inefficiencies and corruption and causing nightmares for students and their parents . In my opinion , the educational system should be an autonomous system which does not allow any political party in power to easily amend it for the purpose of gaining political popularity . It should be independent of all political associations . <p> Another area worthy of mention is our university system , what amazes me most is the way public universities in their own power literally make the choice of courses of which prospective students should offer rather than making the students pursue courses of their own interest . Employers always complain about relative incompetence of our university graduates and their inability to perform on the jobs . I however believe the blame should not be put squarely on the graduates but rather the prevailing university systems . Especially our public universities . Time and resources are wasted in training students in areas that are of negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately equip them for the job market . In the University of Ghana for instance , majority of the students are reading the Arts , offering courses such as theatre arts , dance , religion , languages , and many more , these courses have little practical relevance to business and technology , which are the main drivers of development in today 's modern society . Most of these students graduate and seek to work in the business environment but lack the necessary training . Considerable number of these students did not apply for the courses they are offering and do not have interest in reading them but have to do so anyway since they have no choice if they want to be in a public university . Little attention is paid to the fact that every student has a unique field of interest thus it would be much more appropriate if students are allowed to read courses of their own interest . Considering that the university is an intellectual society manned by academicians , It is indeed surprising that Universities are not accommodative to the choice of students when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Students with interest in other disciplines like business or medicine are forced to undertake courses like drama , dance , languages etc . After graduation , some of these students may be fortunate to secure employment with financial institutions , insurance firms , and other business establishments .. Obviously due to the fact that those graduates do not have the theoretical knowledge in their current field of work , it would take a longer time for them to be more efficient and competent on the job as compared to those with the initial theoretical background . This makes their career path much longer for them than would have been necessary . The question is , why not invest in training students to meet the growing business environment in Ghana ? Is it not possible for stakeholders to invest and expand the business , the sciences and technical schools to accommodate the demand rather than invest in areas that students and the job market have no interest in . Students have different preference with regards to courses and should therefore be allowed to make their choice regarding the course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is fascinating sometimes the amounts of money students are willing to pay just to study their field of interest but yet they do not gain admission into our public universities even though they have excellent grades . In the University of Ghana Business School for instance , the cut -- off point for the 2011 admissions were 7A 's for males and 6A'sfor females . Do we call it fair when a student who had 5 A 's , which is an excellent grade by all standards is not allowed to read administration but is rather given a combination of Art courses that he has no interest in ? Not all parents can afford private schools thus majority of students are left with no choice but to take up courses where they have no interest thereby compromising the future careers of many . The job market for arts courses are limited in our country and in my opinion , the arts , should be reserved for students who are interested in pursuing them . Gaining admission into our public universities for a Master 's program is also another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country after their first degrees to pay huge sums of money to undertake masters programs in their various fields of interest . This would definitely not be the case if they could have the same or a comparable quality of education right here in the country , Ghana as a nation can do better than the current status quo . Ghana 's economy and development could experience substantive growth if the necessary steps are taken to solve the systematic problems plaguing our educational system . And perhaps more Ghanaian students will pursue graduate studies right at home as well attract more foreign students like other developed nations . Ghana can do better ! Irrespective of political , ethical and religious affiliations let us rise as Ghanaians and demand better policies that will strategically position our country for the better . .

And , even as I write this from my sick bed , recovering in America , after suffering a potentially fatal illness in December , I do pray to God that He shall , in his infinite wisdom and mercy , grant me a future so that I can apply the rest of the days of my life to make meaningful contribution to building our nation , support my family and do this all to Honour He that gave me more than a second chance . <p> Yes , I do have a past .

So much so that I , eventually , turned around to become a ' friend ' to the police , helping them to apprehend suspected criminals , which , inspired me as a young adult to shift fully to the right side of the law , studying to become a lawyer . But , my bad boys days are no " best known hidden secrets " , which I have " done well to keep away from Ghanaians all this while " , as the author wants readers to believe .

In fact , in addressing students of Abusco in 2010 , I told them about my bad boy days and warned them not to be like me then . I mentioned the names of my best friends in school , who did not make it in life . But , by the Grace of God , I made it . May be because , besides all my shenanigans , I took my studies seriously .

@@1816237 Ghana <p> For some time now , sporadic shortages of Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) has posed various challenges to the consuming public . This has created considerable anxiety for users , be it domestic , commercial or industrial . <p> The high demand and consumption of LPG by Industry and commercial vehicles has been identified as the major cause of the shortage of the commodity on the market . For example , most of the Industrial companies who use heavy duty machines for their operations have converted their machines from diesel to LPG . A chunk of general purpose vehicles including saloon cars have also resorted to the use of LPG instead of diesel or petrol which is more expensive as compared to LPG . <p> Most of them have done this because of the economic benefit they are deriving from using LPG rather than diesel or petrol . <p> LPG usage in a growing tourism industry has also contributed to the shortage of the product on the market . Hotels , restaurants and most of the chop bars which cater for the tourism industry have converted their kitchens to the use of the cleaner LPG fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly patronized by tourists , have also converted to the use of LPG . <p> As a result of the increased consumption in the industrial , domestic , and commercial sectors of the economy including tourism , the regular daily supply of 800 tonnes has been increased to 1,000 yet consumption appears to supersede supply . <p> Another major cause of the shortage of LPG on the market is the inadequate infrastructure to store LPG to meet the increasing market demand . The challenge of storage facilities has been a major headache for industry players . This has limited the quantity of LPG that Tema Oil Refinery ( TOR ) and LPG importers can store in the country . <p> At peak production , the TOR produces about 25 percent of the total market demand . Even though the National Petroleum Authority , ( NPA ) is capable of working with bulk suppliers and distributors to deliver up to six weeks stocks , it is unable to do so due to limited storage capacity of about one week national consumption . <p> The promotion of the usage of LPG as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion . Since the inception of this policy , there has been a consistent effort by Government to subsidize the commodity so as to make it affordable for use in the homes . <p> For instance , between January and June this year , Government has subsidized LPG price up by Ninety one million , six hundred and forty three thousand , three hundred and eighty two cedis ( GH ? 91 , 643,382 million ) , which represent about 36 per cent of the import cost . The high subsidy on the LPG must be managed in order to make it attractive for investors to venture into it . <p> The main issue for investors is the uncertainty around change in policy to subsidize -- which could dampen demand and render any investment unfinanceable . <p> In spite of this intervention , the country 's energy needs still rely on three main sources , namely wood fuel , crude oil and hydro energy . Wood fuel accounts for 73 percent of the country 's energy needs , crude oil 20 percent and 7 percent for hydro energy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of a gas cylinder manufacturing company in the country , Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company , to manufacture gas cylinders locally and make them available to the public at affordable prices . <p> Another measure to encourage private sector participation is by way of investment in the storage and distribution network of petroleum products including LPG throughout the country . This led to the springing up of over 362 private gas Refilling Plants nationwide and offering employments to tens of thousands of people . This was also in line with government 's programme of employment generation and poverty reduction across the country especially in the rural areas . <p> The programme to encourage people to switch from the use of wood fuel to LPG has yielded positive results . Urban dwellers in particular have responded favourably , however the challenge remains with the rural dwellers who still use wood fuel . More and more citizens have started using LPG , this indeed call for a greater efficiency in the supply chain of the product , an issue that is being tackled vigorously by the National Petroleum Authority ( NPA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to draw attention to the following constraints with the delivery of LPG in Ghana . These constraints are mainly in the supply chain and are as follows : <p> 1 . Berthing Constraint Ghana 's only oil jetty located in Tema is ' a single multi-user ' ; this means that the , same oil jetty serves all Ghana 's petro-chemical needs . For instance , the jetty is used by TOR for the discharge of LPG and export of Naphtha and Residual Cracked Fuel Oil ; Tema Lube Oil also uses the same jetty for the import of Base Oil , whereas some Bulk Distribution Companies ( BDCs ) use it for the import of all ATK and some other petroleum products which are also in high demand . These factors result in a tight schedule with very little or no-room for slips in laycan- ( exact dates of arrival for vessels ) . <p> 2 . Pumping Constraint : <p> The single LPG pipeline from the Jetty to TOR is approximately 5km in distance and 6inch in diameter . This small diameter pipeline only allows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four to five days to deliver an average parcel of 5000mt of LPG . <p> 3 . Storage : <p> TOR can store almost 6,500MT and this is currently the whole capacity of the entire country . <p> 4 . Delivery Constraints : Under normal circumstance , TOR can discharge about 800mt of LPG to the market per day . However in times of shortages , it stretches to about 1000MT per day , by working extra hours such as weekends to meet the high demand . It must be noted that this must be done with all the safety concerns in mind . <p> The Way Forward : <p> The peculiar nature of Ghana 's LPG supply cycle as enumerated above is such that a disruption of two ( 2 ) days in the cycles causes shortages of five to seven days . This is the reason why even though products are being supplied to the market currently , pockets of shortages still exist in some parts of the country <p> The Ministry has equally asked BOST to advice on how to accelerate the project to have a Barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense LPG to the Oil Marketing Companies ( OMCs ) . This strategy will be independent of the jetty and free from delays arising from queues . <p> NPA is also liaising with the Association of Oil Marketing Companies ( AOMCs ) to ensure that LPG companies encourage supply of LPG to the Northern , Upper East and West regions and Brong Ahafo-which records the most acute shortage of the commodity . The Authority is also working with TOR to ensure that vessels with LPG berth weekly to deliver the product . <p> As part of the remedial measures taken by the NPA to mitigate the shortages and its effects on consumers , NPA has given out licenses to Private firms to resolve the LPG problem . <p> This includes a Barge System ( a floating storage unit ) at Takoradi Port which will directly dispense LPG to the OMCs . This strategy will be independent of the jetty and free from delays arising from queues and should commence by October this year . <p> The Ministry of Energy has tasked TOR to submit cost proposal for expanding the pipelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a number of medium to long term measures in the pipe line . Currently under construction is a 5000mt capacity tank farm and Gantry that can supply 1000mt a day in Tema by Fuel Trade ; this is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2013 . <p> The Ghana Gas Company 's Processing Plant is also expected to come on stream by the third quarter of 2013 . When all these initiatives are completed , incidents of LPG shortages could be only a chapter in the history books . 
@@1816238 Education and the shocking BECE results <p> A few days ago ( September 6th ) there was an article in the news reporting the dismal performance of BECE students in the Sissala West District of the Northern Region . The news article reported that 70.9% of the students who took the BECE this year failed ! This both shocked and dismayed me so I decided to investigate further to ascertain whether this was an isolated case or not . <p> It did not take long for me to pull out another shocking result , this time at the Bamease Local Authority Basic School . The news article entitled " OMG ! Bamease L/A scores 0% in BECE " started off saying , " Bamease Local Authority ( L/A ) Basic School scored zero per cent in the recent Basic Education Certificate Examination ( BECE ) . Another disturbing fact is that since the inception of the school in 1985 , no girl had ever passed through the school to the Senior High School level . Reports indicate this has being going on over the years and little has been done to curb it . " If this is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . <p> Only days after these two reports emerged , we learned in a GNA report that thirteen schools in Agona West scored zero percent in the BECE ! To top that up , the news report stated that the " percentage scored in this year 's BECE by the district was 34.1 as against 43.8 last year . " <p> At this point I became very worried and questions kept ringing at the back of my mind . Do these three results a signal a much wider problem ? Will more dismal results surface in the news ? What is going on ? <p> The logical course of action for me to take after this , I thought , was to go onto the Ministry of Education ( MOE ) website to find out more . Guess what ? Ghana 's Ministry of Education does not have its own dedicated website ! In this day and age when digital information is almost indispensable , a Ministry as important as the MOE has no dedicated website . At first I did not believe it . I kept searching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept and there I found out that the last website for the Ministry of Education was put up by the previous administration , as www.moess.gov.gh , which stood for Ministry of Education , Science and Sports ) . This administration seems not to have put one up ! <p> How embarrassing ! Ghana is not just any African country . By African standards we are well known and our country commands a fair amount of respect . Even internationally we are well known . How can the MOE of Ghana not have its own website ? Websites are not difficult to make but they are important for such a government body . A functioning and fairly decent website can be made in a week . A very good website can be made in less than a month . There is no excuse for the MOE of Ghana not to have its own website . Mr. Lee Ocran , this must be remedied . I call on the MOE to act in this regard . It is inexcusable . <p> To underscore how important the MOE is , let me bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Development Index published by the UN consists of education , GDP and life expectancy indices . In our case , these translate into the Ministries of Education , Finance and Health . As one would expect , the Ministry of Finance has its own website ( www.mofep.gov.gh ) , the Ministry of Health has its own website ( www.moh.gov.gh ) however within this crucial triad the equally important Ministry of Education is left out without its own website throughout the tenure of this administration . Where then , can someone like me -- a conscientious Ghanaian citizen eager to learn more about what is being done by the MOE , where can I go to find authoritative information ? Someone correct me if I am wrong , the MOE does not have its own dedicated website . What it seems to have is a space on www.ghana.gov.gh ( most if not all of the other Ministries have one like this ) . In addition the MOE has a Facebook page which has very little on it . All of this is not acceptable , in my opinion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the website of the Ministry of Health , I saw this following quote : <p> " As a critical Sector of the economy , the Ministry of Health seeks to improve the health status of all people living in Ghana thereby contributing to Government 's vision of transforming Ghana into a middle income country by 2015 . " <p> This is the kind of statement I was hoping to see on the ( nonexistent ) website of the MOE , because in my view education definitely impacts the economy in a critical way . <p> I then thought , " Okay , they do n't have their own website but maybe they are actually doing things to remedy the situation . If that is the case then these will somehow find their way into the news " . That was my thought and my hope . So I resumed researching possible leads into what the government has published on remedying the poor BECE results situation . Unfortunately I did not come up with much , except some articles by Anis Haffar of the government-leaning Daily Graphic newspaper . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior results in 2013 " . This was published in April 2012 . The article claims to give " A Game Plan " meant to improve next year 's BECE results . <p> Reading it felt like reading a policy document : lots of theory , lots of suggestions with no concrete implementation strategies . I did not find any concrete " Game Plan " throughout the article that translated policy language into an actual Action Plan . The author of the article places the responsibility of improving the BECE results primarily on the districts and on individual schools . The article talks about formative and summative assessment , about teaching and learning materials , methodologies , schemes of work but nothing about a concrete , grassroots national strategy to actually support teachers with training and to support schools with guidance from district and national levels , especially those in dire need . It is all well and good to talk about theory but what use is this to a teacher who has no idea what summative and formative assessment are ? There is talk about schemes of work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departmental level within each school . But what is the use of suggesting a good idea without providing training to actually make that idea become reality ? In truth , the responsibility to educate our youth lies both with the individual districts and with the government at the national level . <p> I also read an earlier dated article by the same author in the same paper ( Daily Graphic ) entitled " How to Improve BECE results , District-by-District " . In this one I also found a lot of theory but more suggestions on what schools can do . I found some nice suggestions here but again there is zero indication of what concrete role the government at the district and national levels can play in making things better . It was all about saying " schools should do this , do that and the other ! " How will government provide necessary and immediate infrastructure for children studying under trees ? Which government body will inspect failed or failing schools to make sure that what is suggested to improve them actually happens , and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest what schools should do , the MOE must also be proactive , must be on the ground to supervise and to lend a helping hand where needed . <p> The government , in fact all of us have to realize that we have a crisis on our hands . Children around the country are failing the BECE . It is now a national crisis that requires immediate attention . Are we going to see infrastructure being set up for children studying under trees ? Are we going to see crisis intervention teams being set up between now and the next BECE to offer support to districts with very low to nonexistent BECE results ? Are we going to see successful schools within districts team up with and share good practices with those schools that failed ? Are we going to see government-sponsored consultants employed by the MOE inspecting failed or failing schools and failed or failing districts as well as providing training opportunities for those schools and districts who need it most ? These were some of the real action pointers I was hoping to see in Anis Haffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course Anis Haffer did not speak officially for the ministry in those articles , which is why the MOE itself needs to make schools and the general population across the country aware of its short term and its medium-to-long term plans for improving basic education in our country . <p> The government better sit up and act now ! As a nation , we have a problem on our hands ! Doing some more research , I found that the opposition NPP has been talking about education now for some time so I decided to have a look at what this side was also saying . Again the information I came across was nothing short of depressing . One article dating back to October 26th 2011 had the title " BECE results worst in 13 years , DI calls for urgent action " . Here there were some interesting numbers , " In sum , out of the total number of 1,121,817 students who sat for the BECE in the past three years , 574,688 failed to achieve the pass mark . " If this is true then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country , as far as education is concerned . The article provides more numbers : <p> " The 2011 results of BECE students have been the worst in 13 years , using 1998 as the base year , with 46.93% of students achieving a pass rate and thus being eligible for placement into Senior High Schools . Out of the 375,280 students who sat for the 2011 examination , only 176,128 passed their examinations with the fate of 199,152 students now doomed to a grim future of uncertainties . In 2010 , 350,888 students sat for the examination . 172,359 of them , representing 49.12% , achieved a pass rate . That was worse than the 2009 pass rate of 50.21% , confirming the worrying trend of worsening results . The 2008 batch of BECE students performed comparatively better than 2007 and 2009 , with 210,282 students out of the 338,292 who sat the examination scoring between aggregates six and 30 , thus meeting the requirements for placement into second-cycle schools under the Computerised Schools Selection and Placement System . This represents a percentage pass rate of 62.16% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the 2007 BECE examination . While the average pass rate in the last 3 years , under the National Democratic Congress , has fallen by more than 12 percentage points to 48.75% the New Patriotic Party , in its 8 years , achieved an average pass rate of 61.25% for students who sat the BECE examination . " <p> These were the kind of numbers and trends I was looking for on the ( nonexistent ) MOE website(s) instead I found them on the DI 's website . If these numbers are true then it will appear that the BECE results have worsened over the past few years . That is if the numbers are accurate -- one ca n't argue with accurate numbers and accurate statistics . Now if that 's the case then why is this so ? There must be a reason ! It will be great for the MOE to make a statement to the Ghanaian public about why this has been the case . Not making such a statement could indicate apathy or complacency , both of which are untenable positions in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and consider that the actual problem we have on our hands : too many Ghanaian children are FAILING their basic education ! What does this tell us ? There is something wrong somewhere . Less than 50% pass rate in a national examination at the basic level is not acceptable . Even the 61.25% pass rate that the NPP say they averaged during their tenure is shamefully low in my opinion . <p> Why is it that the children are failing ? ! ? We should be able to educate our children and we do not need to be a rich and powerful country to do this ! Cuba is currently higher than Canada , Norway and South Korea on the 2012 education index , while on the same index Slovenia is higher than the US and even Kazakhstan is higher than Germany ! <p> So we do not need to be rich and powerful as a nation to have a highly educated population . We just need to prioritise education ! And we do not have to be communist to do this . We need an education system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has access to adequate opportunities for learning but also that these children have access to an education that is in line with our economic , scientific , moral and socio-cultural aspirations as a nation and as a people . It is no mean task but it is not impossible . During a trip to Kenya last December , I had the chance to speak informally with a head teacher of one of their secondary schools and I found out how modern their educational system is . And Kenya is not that much more affluent or more powerful than Ghana . It all comes down to prioritizing education and implementing strategies to achieve those higher levels . <p> Let me also just point out that it is my suspicion that there is a key structural fault with our current education system leading up to the BECE . Hanis Affar 's above article " How schools can achieve superior results in 2013 " says that , " The BECE ( or the Common Entrance Examination , as called in the past ) ... " Wait a minute ! The BECE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two distinct differences between them : the first is that students who sat the Common Entrance Examinations were proceeding from primary school to secondary school . They were primary school Students ! Second , the Common Entrance Examination had Quantitative and Verbal Aptitude portions which tested students on their basic Literacy and Numeracy skills and based on these results , they went to respective secondary institutions . <p> Herein lies the flaw : with the education system we have in Ghana today , there is no nationally administered summative assessment or cognitive aptitude test ( that I am aware of at least ) meant to gauge the learning skills , abilities and weaknesses that students have as they proceed from primary school to secondary school . It is presumed that they will be tested at the BECE level , at a time which I think is a little too late for the appropriate intervention to be put in place . <p> I wonder whether readers realize how monumental this is ! ! Our young children are literally sailing through the system on their way to failure at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether or not they are literate ! This is not acceptable , in my opinion . <p> Let me state this again for emphasis ! At the moment , there is no nationally administered means ( that I am aware of ) of measuring how literate ( or illiterate ) children proceeding from primary school to secondary school are . The natural result of this is that the JHS systems get filled with some students who are adept at basic reading and writing and many who are not . No trend analyses are done to determine which districts and which schools are in urgent need of assistance to raise their literacy and numeracy levels . Now without basic literacy , none of the other BECE subjects are even accessible so even with the absence of teachers , studious and willing but illiterate children can not engage in self study in preparation for their BECE examinations ! Without basic literacy it is difficult to talk about other essential personal learning and thinking skills . <p> So this is a major problem ! I wonder if the folks at the MOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar ways and if there have been any studies about it or efforts to remedy the situation . I strongly believe that basic literacy even precedes numeracy in importance ; however both of literacy and numeracy skills are prerequisites for the 9 or 10 subjects that teenagers sit exams for at the BECE level . So please , put politics aside . I would like ask all stakeholders to seriously consider how to possibly plan to introduce a basic skills test for primary school students who are about to enter the JHS . This will serve the purpose of flagging those weak students for intervention before they are led to fail at the BECE level . It will help with the work of crisis intervention teams who should ideally start working with students and with schools long before their actual BECE examinations . <p> One final aspect I would like to talk about as far as improving BECE results is concerned is introducing at the JHS level in particular a strong notion of healthy competition and national recognition for high achievement as well as great improvement in individuals and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech where he outlines his party 's Education vision ( since they seem to be the only ones not in government that are publishing stuff ) and I think he made many interesting points in regard to education , beyond just the free SHS scheme . Certainly it is a good idea to have a policy focusing on teachers , definitely at both the JHS and SHS levels , but what about the children who are going to be taught ? What about them ? A crucial ingredient I think I found missing from all stakeholders is this notion of introducing and encouraging healthy competition with nice rewards for individual students and for their schools , especially at the BECE level where we are hoping to improve upon those dismal results shown above . <p> I believe the entire educational sector will benefit from massive incentives not only for teachers but also and especially for students . Here is one concrete example/possibility of what I envision : Top 50 BECE results within each region - students get a laptop and meet the Regional Minister , possibly with names in local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top 50 results , top 10 BECE results within each region not only get laptop but also get to meet the Minister of Education , get onto national television and get all expenses paid trip to another African country ( for instance to the pyramids in Egypt or to Victoria falls ) or even to a place like CERN or NASA with some national TV coverage . These teenagers will love something like this . There could be two kinds of school awards for each region : one for the best 3 schools ( i.e. overall statistics including exam results ) and another for the 3 most improved schools . The head teachers of these schools could meet with the President of the Republic for lunch and speeches in the presence of the Minister of Education , clergy , traditional leaders and other dignitaries . This can also be televised and the names of these schools can be in the papers . Possible bonus ( financial and/or training/travel ) packages for teachers across regions who perform exceptionally well in class and who produce exceptional results in their subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be receiving for their jobs . Teaching should be one of the most sought after jobs in the country because of possible incentives such as these . <p> Allowing our young children to fail because of inadequate help from us the adults is not an option we should consider . No child should be failing at the BECE level . We should be aiming to double that 48.75% pass rate mentioned earlier to 97.5% As I mentioned earlier , Cuba is currently higher on the 2012 education index than Canada , Norway and South Korea . If we fail our children by failing to provide them not only with adequate education but also with learning support , they will end up out of school and on the streets . We do not want to have aimless and unemployable children on the street or even worse - angry teenagers disillusioned by their educational system and who want to get back at " the system " . This happened in Soweto South Africa on June 16th 1976 when about 20,000 High School children went on riot and where as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured . This was in response to aspects of the scheme known as " Bantu Education " , a mentally debilitating curriculum introduced by Apartheid era president ( Dr ) Verwoerd only for black children . At one point these children were forced to take up Afrikaans when other subjects were lacking . That was the trigger event , causing already heightened frustrations to erupt to dangerous levels . Last year the world witnessed London turn to flames when disenchanted youth aided by mobile phones and facebook took to the street , many of whom were school dropouts . Already here in Ghana there was a report in the news on September 13th this year entitled " Failed Students burn textbooks at St Martins JHS " . This is not a good sign . We definitely want to prevent this kind of behaviour from manifesting , especially if it is caused by frustrated teenagers who have been failed by the system . Otherwise we will wake up one day to find out that the disturbing trends we are seeing today left unaddressed have mushroomed into an ugly nightmare that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . 
@@1816239 Constituencies : Matters Arising ( Part 3 ) <p> A frequent complaint made by critics of the Electoral Commission 's ( EC ) decision to create new constituencies this year can be summed up as follows : WHY THE RUSH ? However , the simple truth of the matter is that were the EC to proceed in any other way than it has set out to do ( i.e. , review and create the constituencies in 2012 ) , the EC will not only spark a constitutional crisis , but also could be found to have failed to comply with its constitutional obligations , and thereby violated provisions of the Constitution . <p> Examined below are the constitutional implications of two scenarios commonly suggested as alternatives for the EC to pursue : ( a ) create new constituencies in 2012 but which will be used in the 2016 general elections ; or ( b ) create new constituencies in 2013 which will be used in general elections after that date . It is also noted that even if the EC had decided not to increase the total number of constituencies to 275 , but to leave the number at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundaries of some of constituencies in the country , with potential increases in the number of constituencies in some regions and corresponding decreases in the numbers in other regions . <p> In an article posted on the Ghanaweb on September 12 , 2012 , and titled " Open Letter to Afari-Gyan and Electoral Commission " , Hon. Yaw Osafo-Maafo proposed that the EC " create the 45 new constituencies as he is about to do but use the same for the National Elections for the year 2016 . " However , as explained below , the proposal will not work due to the provision in article 47(6) of the Constitution that the new boundaries " come into effect upon the next dissolution of Parliament . " <p> Unlike other commentators , Hon. Osafo-Maafo recognizes , quite correctly , that when Constitutional Instrument 78 ( CI-78 ) matures on October 3 , 2012 , the 45 new constituencies will be created as of that date and so it will be impossible to have a scenario where CI-78 would become law in October and the new constituencies are created at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies " should not to be confused with when the boundaries of the newly created constituencies will " become effective " . For , while the two concepts are linked to CI-78 , they occur at different times . The new constituencies will be created in October 2012 , but become effective in January 2013 upon the dissolution of Parliament . <p> Nonetheless , the Constitution does not provide the EC or the nation the type of flexibility Hon. Osafo-Maafo assumes exists . Indeed , from the explanation that follows , the EC has no choice but to conduct the elections on the basis of the new division of 275 constituencies and not 230 constituencies as proposed by Hon. Osafo-Maafo . <p> Conditioning the effectiveness of the alteration of constituencies in Article 47(6) on the dissolution of Parliament means the new division of 275 constituencies will replace the old division of 230 when the current Parliament is dissolved in January 2013 . Thus , when the next Parliament is summoned ( after the dissolution of the current one ) , the new Parliament will be meeting at a time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional prescription in Article 47(1) that " each constituency shall be represented by one member of Parliament " , it should follow that there must be seating for 275 members of Parliament to reflect the now effective division of 275 constituencies when the new Parliament meets . <p> But how can one ensure that there will be 275 members of Parliament when the next Parliament meets in January 2013 ? The obvious and only method is for the EC to conduct the 2012 general elections on the basis of the 275 constituencies that would be created in October upon the maturity of CI-78 . Thus , for the new division of 275 constituencies to be effective for purposes of Parliament under Article 47(6) , the 275 persons must have been duly elected as members of Parliament in the general elections that would precede the dissolution of the current Parliament . <p> It will therefore , be a violation of the Constitution for the EC to use 230 constituencies in conducting the 2012 general elections and to seat 230 members of Parliament ( and not 275 ) after the new division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EC to operate on the basis of the 230 constituencies after the dissolution of Parliament , the EC will be using a division of constituencies that will no longer be valid or legal under the Constitution regardless of what any citizen of Ghana will say , do or prefer . Short of an amendment of the Constitution , the EC can not do what Hon. Osafo-Maafo has proposed and proceed to conduct national elections up to 2016 on the basis of the old division of constituencies . <p> First , if the general elections in December are held on the basis of the existing 230 constituencies after the maturity of CI-78 , it means only 230 members of Parliament will be duly elected and not the 275 members of Parliament expected to be in the new Parliament . Membership in the new Parliament will therefore be incomplete . <p> Second , because the current division of 230 constituencies will no longer be effective in January 2013 , many of the 230 members of Parliament who will be elected in constituencies affected by the alteration of the boundaries of constituencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can not legally represent on the basis of the new division of constituencies . <p> Third , where an existing constituency has been split into two or more new constituencies , at least one of the new constituencies will not have a representative in Parliament . This is unacceptable because of the directive in Article 47(1) of the Constitution that " each constituency shall be represented by one member of Parliament . " A related problem arises under the same constitutional provision because the elected member of Parliament will be claiming to represent what will legally be two or more constituencies in the new division of constituencies . <p> To move away from the abstract and situate the above issues in more concrete terms , let 's consider the following example . Suppose Hon. Indomitable Super One-Touch was elected during the last general elections in 2008 to represent a constituency in the current Parliament known as Oseikrom constituency that is actually comprised of three areas , Oseikrom , Kwasikrom and Abenakrom . Based on the census data that showed tremendous population growth in the constituency , the EC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are now among the 275 constituencies listed in CI-78 . The implications of the EC 's decision are as follows . <p> For purposes of the 2016 elections , the EC must conduct elections in the 3 constituencies , Oseikrom , Kwasikrom and Abenakrom , and not in the single and relatively large constituency which was referred to as Oseikrom for purposes of the 2008 elections . In addition , should Hon. Indomitable Super One-Touch choose to stand as a candidate in the 2016 elections in the Oseikrom constituency , if elected , he can only represent the population in the newly demarcated constituency of Oseikrom but not Kwasikrom and Abenakrom . Furthermore , the other two constituencies , Kwasikrom and Abenakrom , must elect their own members of Parliament in the 2016 elections , otherwise they will not be represented when the new Parliament is convened in January 2013 . <p> While Hon. Osafo-Maafo 's proposal seeks to assuage concerns raised by some sections of the public about the pending creation of new constituencies , the proposal ignores the implications of various constitutional provisions that the EC simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct the 2012 general elections on the basis of 230 constituencies , it will not be able to ensure that the country will have 275 members in the next Parliament as will be required after the maturity CI-78 . <p> Article 47(5) provides that " the Electoral Commission shall review the division of Ghana into Constituencies ... within twelve months after the publication of the enumeration figures after the holding of the census of the population of Ghana , and may , as a result alter the constituencies . " Read in isolation , this provision appears to offer the EC the flexibility to comply with its constitutional obligations by first conducting the review in June 2012 ( as it has done ) and waiting until after the dissolution of Parliament but not later than May 2013 to create the new constituencies . <p> However , a difficulty emerges when Article 47(5) is read in conjunction with Article 47(3) which provides that " the boundaries of each constituency shall be such that the number of inhabitants in the constituency is , as nearly as possible , equal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined as the number obtained by dividing the number of inhabitants of Ghana by the number of constituencies in which Ghana is divided . <p> The obvious risk for the EC is that it could be found to be in breach of Article 47(3) by conducting general elections on the basis of constituencies which objective data from the national census indicated no longer met the population quota as of 2012 . This will most certainly be the case where clear evidence from the census reveals that some constituencies exceeded by far the population quota , while others fell very far behind the quota . Although one is not privy to the EC 's deliberations , it can be surmised that the constitutional quagmire posed by Article 47(3) in the context of the EC 's review of the results of the national census probably played a major role in the EC 's decision to go ahead with the creation of constituencies this year instead of 2013 . <p> To appreciate more fully the important considerations that informed the EC 's decision , some background information on the population quota system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC the power to review and alter the boundaries of constituencies to address any changes in population concentration caused by various factors including migration , birth , death , etc . Maintaining the same boundaries for a long time can lead to vast inequalities in the populations of constituencies . Some constituencies will come to have very large populations while others will have very low populations . This creates inequality in the political process because the votes of people living in the very populous constituencies will be " worth less " than the votes of people living in less populated constituencies . To correct this anomaly , it is imperative that constituencies contain about the same number of people so that votes are " worth " about the same amount , similar to the one , person , one vote requirement . This is achieved if the population in a constituency approximates the population quota . <p> If the EC chooses to conduct the 2012 general elections on the basis of the 230 constituencies , it will be working with constituencies first created and used during the 2004 general elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new division of 275 constituencies will not be used to elect members of Parliament until the general elections in December 2016 . This means a total of 12 years ( 2016-2004 ) will have gone by when the 230 constituencies would be used for elections . Twelve years is an inordinately long period to go about conducting elections without adjusting the boundaries of constituencies to " equalize " populations in the different constituencies , especially when it is considered that there is a mandatory constitutional obligation to review constituencies every 7 years except for times when a census is conducted , in which case the time for the review is even shorter . <p> Under these circumstances , it easy to understand why the EC will have profound difficulty fending off a constitutional challenge that it had failed to guarantee the equality of all voters , and therefore violated the constitutional guarantee of equality enshrined in Article 17 . It would appear from the perspective of the EC , that creating the 45 new constituencies this year was unavoidably necessary to comply with its fundamental constitutional obligations to guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EC had decided after its review in June not to increase the number of constituencies , but to let the number remain at 230 , it will still have been necessary to redistribute the existing 230 constituencies on the basis of the census figures announced this year so as to " equalize " the populations in the constituencies . Such a redistribution inevitably , will have resulted in an increase in the total number of constituencies in some regions while decreasing the numbers in other regions . Perhaps , the EC increased the number to 275 to give effect to the equality of voters on the basis of the population quota , without having to reduce the number of constituencies in some regions - a development that would have provoked greater outrage from regions that would feel marginalized by the reduction of their voting strength in Parliament . 
@@1816240 Constituencies : Matters Arising ( Part 2 ) <p> This article responds to issues raised since the posting of my previous work titled " Creation of 45 New Constituencies : Matters Arising " on the Ghanaweb on September 7 , 2012 . <p> I. CI-78 AS LAW OF GHANA <p> Individuals who may be overly excited about moving to restrain Parliament in relation to Constitutional Instrument 78 ( CI-78 ) which seeks to create 45 new constituencies in Ghana should understand that in dealing with CI-78 , Parliament is not exercising a power to make law in the usual sense of debating , amending , and adopting bills initiated independently by the members of Parliament . Under the Constitution , certain authorities other than Parliament are also given exclusive power to make rules which can become law , such as the Electoral Commission ( EC ) which has the power to review and create constituencies in Ghana under Article 47(5) . However , before such rules can be enforced as law in Ghana it is necessary for the rules to be first introduced in Parliament as a constitutional instrument , and for the instrument to be published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the instrument is laid for 21 days before Parliament , it would automatically come into force as law in Ghana unless two-thirds of the members of Parliament vote to annul it . Article 11(7) . Therefore , CI-78 which was laid before Parliament on September 4 , 2012 is now in the process to become law on October 3 , 2012 . Given that the majority of the members of Parliament appear to favour the passage of CI-78 , it is highly unlikely that members of Parliament who may be so motivated can muster enough support to annul the instrument before then , and so it can be concluded with virtual certainty that CI-78 would become law in Ghana . <p> From this background , it is readily apparent that it is not realistic for individuals or groups outside Parliament to try to stop the maturity of CI-78 by seeking to restrain Parliament after the instrument has been laid before Parliament . As explained above , other than the parliamentarians themselves , no one else can stop the process after the 21 day count has begun . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of the members of Parliament to support them will simply have to wait patiently till the instrument becomes law before they can seek appropriate remedies , if valid legal grounds exist for doing so . <p> Although CI-78 will come into force as law on October 3 , 2012 , the boundaries of the new constituencies will be not be effective until the dissolution of the current Parliament . For , as provided in the Constitution , where as a result of the review of the division of Ghana into constituencies by the EC , " the boundaries of a constituency ... are altered ... , the alteration shall come into effect upon the next dissolution of Parliament . " Because Parliament is due to be dissolved on January 6 , 2013 , the new constituencies will become effective on that date . <p> The practical legal implication of this is that the existing division of 230 constituencies will be maintained until January 6 , 2013 when it will be replaced by the division of 275 constituencies . It also means that when the next Parliament convenes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be seats available for 275 duly elected members of Parliament to reflect the number of recognized constituencies . Therefore , it is erroneous to think in this context ( as some have ) that it is only after the dissolution of Parliament on January 6 , 2013 can political parties be expected to begin selecting candidates in the new constituencies for subsequent elections . Quite to the contrary , as elaborated upon in the next section , immediately after the announcement of the EC 's decision to create new constituencies , political parties should embark on a mission to identify candidates to contest the next general elections . This will ensure that if the candidates are successful , they will be sworn in as members of Parliament the very first day the next Parliament meets in January 2013 . <p> III . LEGALITY OF ACTIVITIES IN THE NEW CONSTITUENCIES <p> With regard to activities by political parties in the new constituencies , the Constitution does not impose a duty on political parties to take any action whatsoever after the creation of the new constituencies . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Parliament will find it expedient to take the necessary steps to qualify and present themselves as candidates at the general elections that will precede the dissolution of the current Parliament . In this context , political parties are free to sponsor candidates but they are not compelled to do so . Therefore , any political party that wishes to do so can organize its campaigns to select candidates from the party to compete in the elections in those constituencies . <p> To say that the boundaries of the constituencies are not yet effective does not mean political parties could not use for their own purposes , the information provided by the EC about the new boundary demarcations . There is no legal requirement that the new constituencies be effective before they can be used for organising political activities . To the extent no law prohibits the political parties from using the boundaries drawn by the EC , they should be free to use those boundaries as the basis of selecting their candidates in the primaries . Therefore , the legality of the conduct of primaries by the NDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of any laws prohibiting political parties from organising their political activities on the basis of the newly drawn boundaries . Seen from this perspective , the NDC acted properly and did not break any laws by organising primaries in the new constituencies . <p> The maturity of CI-78 should not be regarded as an event without the happening of which political parties could not legally organize in the new constituencies . Nothing therefore prevents political parties from selecting their candidates for the new constituencies while awaiting the maturity of CI-78 . Indeed , to omit to do so would amount to an intentional infliction of injury by a political party on itself - just like shooting oneself in the foot ! Furthermore , the political party would be denying its supporters in those constituencies the opportunity to select persons from the party to represent them in Parliament . <p> Therefore , it is quite understandable why even before CI-78 has entered into force as law , some political parties ( mainly the NDC and a few parliamentary candidates of the NPP as reported in the media ) have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective parties in the new constituencies . <p> The EC has been accused of committing illegal acts by conducting and supervising the NDC primaries in the new constituencies . However , such criticism reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the EC 's functions . Under Article 45(c) of the Constitution , the EC has power " to conduct and supervise ALL PUBLIC ELECTIONS ... " ( emphasis added ) . The EC 's power here is quite broad and is not qualified in any way other than by the requirement that the elections be public . The EC routinely supervises political party primaries essentially because they meet the definition of public elections . For the same reason , the NDC primaries in the new constituencies that the EC supervised should also be considered to be public elections and it makes no difference whatsoever that the EC 's decision to create the constituencies had not yet received legal backing from Parliament at the time the NDC primaries were conducted . In other words , the main reason the EC covered the NDC primaries was due to their nature as very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conformed strictly to specific geographical configurations used at the time by the government for administrative and other purposes . <p> Because the NDC primaries satisfied the constitutional requirement that the elections be public , the EC acted properly when it conducted and supervised those primaries . It can not be over-emphasized that in this case , the only critical issue to consider is whether the elections were public . Those who contend that the EC must conduct elections only in constituencies legally recognized as such either lack a basic understanding of the law or are being disingenuous . <p> The Constitution does not address the relationship between the alteration of the boundaries of constituencies by the EC and the general elections that precede the dissolution of Parliament . Thus , no time period is stated within which the law giving legal backing to the decision of the EC must be passed prior to the general elections . In part , this may be due to the recognition that the timing of the decision could be affected by matters beyond the control of the EC , and therefore will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the Constitution requires that the review on the basis of which the EC 's decision to alter boundaries is made should be conducted within 12 months after the publication of the results of the national census , alleged difficulties faced by the country 's Statistical Authority delayed the release of the results of the 2010 population census until May 31 , 2012 , with a corresponding dilatory effect on the EC 's review of the division of constituencies and decision on June 18 , 2012 to create 45 constituencies . In this case , the EC did not have control over the release of the census results and when they came , the EC had to act quickly to avoid violating its constitutional obligations concerning review and alteration of the boundaries . <p> The EC has assured the general public of its ability and capacity to discharge in an efficient manner , its duties regarding the conduct and supervision of elections in 275 constituencies in December 2012 . From the EC 's satisfactory record in supervising previous elections , there is no reason to doubt the EC in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC , it would appear that the time period between the EC 's decision to create new constituencies and the general elections is adequate for the EC to prepare for and supervise those elections . Therefore , concerns that organising and conducting elections in the 45 constituencies in December will pose logistical and other challenges for the EC are not well-founded . <p> Significantly , the Constitution does not mandate that the EC provide formal notice directly to political parties when it alters the boundaries of constituencies , let alone regulate the amount of notice the EC should be required to give to such political parties prior to the conduct of elections . Rather , the Constitution is concerned in this context only with the circumstances under which the decision to alter boundaries is to be made and when the alteration would become effective . Notwithstanding the omission , however , the Constitution presumably relies on the political parties to act quickly in a self-interested manner when credible information is available to the general public regarding the creation of new constituencies , including pertinent public announcements by the EC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If a political party on becoming aware of the creation of constituencies by the EC decides not to sponsor candidates for any or all of the newly created constituencies , that is its choice , and the decision will be respected . However , should it change its mind later on and decide to field candidates as the general elections approach , it can not in good faith complain that it had become shortchanged because not much time was now left for it to select candidates . Under these circumstances , that political party will be considered to have had sufficient advanced information and the fact that it may not agree with the decision to create constituencies should not excuse it from acting in the meantime to promote its interests in the new constituencies . Were it to wait until the clock virtually run out , the political party would be barred under the equitable doctrine of estoppel from claiming there was insufficient time left before the elections for it to organize and compete in the new constituencies . <p> Furthermore , in assessing the reasonableness of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections following the creation of new constituencies by the EC , it should be kept in mind that the minimum notice period under the Constitution for the conduct of elections to select a member of Parliament is 30 ( THIRTY ) days as provided in Article 112(5) with respect to the conduct of by-elections . Because the decision of the EC to create new constituencies was first announced on June 18 , 2012 , the political parties effectively had about 172 ( ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO ) days notice to select and present candidates for the general elections scheduled for December 7 , 2012 . It is submitted that the notice period of nearly 6 months in this case to select candidates for the new constituencies exceeds by far the mandatory constitutional notice period for elections and can not therefore be challenged as unreasonable as contended by others . <p> V. INDEPENDENCE OF THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION <p> Critics of the EC tend to forget that it is a body whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution and in the performance of its functions , the EC " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . " ( Article 46 ) . As noted above , the EC has exclusive power to alter the constituencies of Ghana . Thus , the proposal of the Trade Union Congress ( TUC ) to compel the EC to sit down with political parties to agree on criteria for the alteration of constituencies on the basis of a consensus before the alteration is made would encroach on such independence , and for that reason , is misguided . While others may be frustrated by the " persistence " of the EC to create 45 new constituencies barely a few months to the 2012 general election , the manner in which the EC has proceeded with its review and decision to alter constituencies not only complies with the applicable constitutional obligations but also reflects the EC 's independence which must be respected . For this reason , the reported death threats and other acts of intimidation against the Electoral Commissioner and staff of the EC are unacceptable and should be condemned in no uncertain terms . <p> Finally , the call by the TUC and other groups for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 constituencies until 2013 is utter nonsense and should be dismissed with the contempt it deserves . Their suggestion will provoke constitutional crises in the country and pose significant procedural challenges for Parliament . A fundamental constitutional issue with the call is that the votes of people in the 45 constituencies will not be counted in choosing the next President , a clear violation of their constitutional right in Article 42 to vote for that purpose . Moreover , recalling the closeness of the results in the 2008 elections and the heightened national significance assumed by the runoff elections in just a single constituency ( the Tain constituency ) , it is apparent that in a close December 2012 election , the votes in the omitted 45 constituencies will be extremely important as they could easily determine not only who will become the next President but which political party will control Parliament . It will be absurd to expect the entire country to wait in limbo for answers to these issues until elections were held in the new constituencies at some indeterminate time in 2013. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1817236 <p> On Monday , October 1 , 2012 , the Graphic Business reported , that the new Pensions Scheme is under threat , not because of a viral attack , but purely due to administrative inertia . Perhaps , it was coincidental that on the same day Graphic Business Published its story and editorial , Pensioners across the country were lamenting the dwindling power their miserly monthly payments could muster in the face of prevailing economic conditions and called on politicians to speak to the issue of Pensions , at least in this electoral . <p> After three years of reforming Pensions in Ghana , the National Pensions Regulatory Authority ( NPRA ) , itself a creation of the reforms is yet to fulfil its major mandate of licensing occupational pension schemes that are ready to work directly with contributors . <p> Graphic Business reports that in September 2009 , the Board of the National Pensions Regulatory Authority ( NPRA ) was set up to oversee the implementation of the National Pensions Act , 2008 ( Act 766 ) . <p> The Act seeks to create a unified pension system under a three tiered pension structure , with SSNIT as the operator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as operators of the mandatory Tier 2 and Voluntary Tier 3 schemes . To begin the implementation , the NPRA set up a Temporary Pension Fund ( TPF ) in January 2010 to provisionally administer Tier 2 contributions pending the licensing of Trustees . Employers have , since January 2010 , been remitting 5% ( Tier 2 contributions ) of their employees ? salaries to the TPF . <p> An in-depth investigation reveals that the administrative sludge is purely the making of the Board Chairman of the NPRA under whose unclear tenure three Acting CEOs had had to resign within a year and a half . <p> From outright usurpation of powers to direct threats of removal , all Acting CEOs have been or nearly cowed into slavish submission except those who escaped . And there are allegations of colossal financial impropriety ( for instance , per the account of the last Acting CEO , as a non-executive Chairman , he signs cheques and makes unapproved withdrawals ) from the money that hard working pensioners contribute . <p> The administrative behemoth , albeit retrogressive , was aptly described by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a huge challenge for the National Pensions Regulatory Authority and the earlier the issue is addressed the better it would help the Authority to deliver on its mandate. ? Perhaps if there is one major undeserving feat the Board has chalked , it is that the board chairman has licensed third party Service Providers in March 2012 to handle data management as part of the transitional arrangement in the setting up of The Temporary Pension Fund , which was to receive the 5% second tiered contributions . That in itself is nothing , compared with what the 5% contributions should have been used for in the last three years for which no information exists . <p> With no clear guidelines as to which ministry it must report to , it is in the NPRA ? s interest to be resourceful by releasing contributors ? funds that must duly go to private and state schemes now so ordinary back-breaking workers can determine how to invest their money for old age .

In fact people who have retired since 2011 but have made the 5% Tier 2 contributions still can not access their lump sum benefits based on the contributions made since January 2010 . This is a potential crisis . <p> 2 . There may be no accountability as to what the contributions have used for . The longer the status quo remains , the direr the accountability question becomes . In the words of the Acting CEO , ? It is important that serious efforts are made to reconcile contributors data to ensure that cash and investment holdings that are under the custody of NPRA in aggregate is equal to the total liability due to the contributors before statements are sent out to them .

Participating in Voluntary Tier 3 enhances the retirement incomes of workers . <p> 5 . From an economic perspective , very important source of revenue needed for national and private sector development is still being held by the NPRA because all they can do is to invest the funds in Government treasures . This is assuming that the funds have been invested at all . What ? s the proof that the funds are available anyway ?

Nii Larkai representing the University whilst Nancy Twumasi-Mensah , holding the brief of Grace Ewool , Senior State Attorney , represented the A-G , NAB and the Ministry of Education . <p> Moving the Motion for Interlocutory Injunction , Mr. Nimako Marfo of Puozuing and Associates , Lead Counsel for the Applicants , said relying on the School 's brochure and subsequent publications , the affected students applied for and duly gained admission to the Pentecost University for the 2011/2012 academic year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cards and going through a Ceremony of Matriculation , the University wrote them letters withdrawing them , after a year of Study in various Courses . <p> According to Mr. Marfo , the action of the university was in response to claims by the National Accreditation Board that there were ' defects ' in the entry grades of the affected students and a threat by NAB that it would withdraw its recognition of the University as a duly-accredited institution if the students were not withdrawn . <p> Continuing , Mr Marfo said the university did not indicate the nature of the said defects , did not give the students any notice or invite any of them to hear their side as required by the rule of Natural Justice . <p> He said the University College , which is affiliated to the University of Ghana , Legon , refused to listen to the students despite the fact that they , at all material times , acted in good faith and in reliance on the university 's representations to them . <p> He , therefore , prayed the Court to restrain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and grant consequential reliefs to ensure that their Constitutional right to Education was not unduly curtailed . <p> Responding , Mr. JH Nii Larkai , Counsel for the First Respondent , did not directly oppose the application but sought clarity from opposite Counsel on the full effect of the Motion . Papa Kow Acquaye , Co-Counsel for the Applicants , pointed out that the Respondents ' Affidavit in Opposition admitted almost all the averments of the Student-Applicants and therefore , being a Prayer , any consequential reliefs from the Court would give proper effect to the Motion . <p> The Presiding Judge of the Human Rights Fast Track Court , Justice Paul Dery , therefore granted the Applicants Prayer , ordering the Respondents to re-instate the Students and organize extra classes for them so as to enable them write their First Semester Exam , which they were unable to do due to the Withdrawal Letters . <p> Hearing and subsequent closing arguments in the substantive are scheduled to come off when the courts return from the Christmas break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
