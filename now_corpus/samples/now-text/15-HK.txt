Both figures were a bit above expectations -- economists had thought imports would do even worse . But the combination of a strong export sector with weak imports meant China 's huge trade surplus stayed intact , at $49.6 billion for the month . Part of the reason is falling commodity prices .

They are pledging to keep promoting collective bargaining in a way that calms labor tensions without derailing growth in the country 's already-slowing economy . <p> " Collective wage bargaining is something we will continue to promote , " said Li Shouzhen , a senior official at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , or ACFTU .

Fintech Innovation spoke to Chrisol Correia , Director of Global AML at LexisNexis Risk Solutions . <p> Fintech Innovation : How big is money laundering in Asia ? <p> Chrisol Correia : The estimates can range by quite a margin . That is sometimes to do with definition , but the fundamental problem is that this is a criminal activity , and criminals like to hide their stuff - so the question is how can you find something that is meant to be off the radar ? <p> It is really quite difficult to quantify , so it always ends up being a model based on what 's known , and then extrapolated outwards , but of course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , there are a number of surveys which give global estimates that reveal that AML issues are moving back up the agenda for senior management , with many stating that money laundering is considered a high risk area within their business risk assessment . <p> Fintech Innovation : Please provide an update on existing regulations and best practices around AML in Asia . <p> Often , to combat money laundering , you need a multi-lateral approach and cross border collaboration because the threat itself is international . These are the sorts of organizations that are often very fluid and operate across borders , and likewise , all organized crime is multinational and very often involved in contraband and smuggling , which involves moving assets or funds from one country to another , so regional corporation is key . <p> We 're seeing more focus on tax , and tax seems to be a growing issue and I predict it is going to be one of the trends for 2015 . FATF has also specified serious tax crime as a predicate offence of money laundering , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what that means is any serious offence as defined by Singaporean could potentially be determined as a predicate office of money laundering . That is pretty interesting because it significantly broadens the scope of money laundering . <p> When money laundering was first criminalized it may have been narrowly focused on targeting the proceeds of drugs crime , and then expanded notably in response to the terrorist attacks in 2001 . However it has continued to evolve with a much broader definition now , and includes bribery for example , as well as fraud , and a very broad range of serious crimes . That means the amount of work obligated institutions need to undertake in order to comply with the regulations have also increased . In order to effect best practice in an institution means a couple of things : continued investment in training people , technology and data , and the establishment of a broad culture of compliance across an organization . It involves more internal reporting , particularly to the board for these sorts of issues , and ongoing risk assessments . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context so they are becoming more assertive and perhaps more aggressive in their regulatory expectations , and banks are responding .

No Business for You , Shanghai Says <p> Shanghai Municipality Communist Party Secretary Han Zheng applauds at the Shanghai delegation 's group discussion during the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing March 6 , 2015 . <p> Reuters <p> Business and politics no longer mix in Shanghai -- at least according to new anti-corruption rules introduced to China 's commercial capital that require top local officials to limit moneymaking by immediate family members . <p> In a pilot program that authorities describe as a model for the whole nation , Shanghai 's Communist Party chief , Han Zheng , said Monday that top local officials will be required to keep their spouses and children out of local businesses , or step down themselves . " If you choose to be an official , then do n't go into business to make a fortune , " Mr. Han said . <p> The measure , which applies to direct family members of vice bureau director officials or above from the party , government , courts and state-owned companies , aims at sustaining public trust in officialdom , Mr. Han said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a common feature of official corruption allegations against those who get into trouble -- as well as some who do n't . <p> Advertisement <p> But like a bevy of other anti-corruption rules meant to keep cadres honest -- including a requirement that party members to report their assets internally rather than publicly -- the new measures appears to contain loopholes that may undermine the deterrent effect . <p> Shanghai has been repeatedly singled out for scrutiny during China 's anti-corruption drive , and among the findings of party anti-graft inspectors who have probed the city is that the family members of " a small number of leading cadres " are doing business that is " quite conspicuous , " Mr. Han told the meeting where he announced the new rules . He cited orders from Chinese President Xi Jinping for Shanghai to take the lead in formulating such rules as the vanguard for economic reform in the country . <p> Under the rules , officials are responsible for ensuring their spouses and children , plus people who marry into their families , adhere to the new policy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spot checks on 20% of claims by officials about their family 's businesses will be performed annually for signs of abuse and authorities will welcome public input on compliance , the Shanghai Daily reported . <p> But the rules appear to stop short of declaring Shanghai out of bounds for profits . <p> For example , the rules appear to do little to bar well-connected folks from taking the often-quickest route to riches in Shanghai : property ownership . <p> Also not mentioned is any limit on local business activity undertaken by family members of officials representing other parts of the leadership in China , in particular relatives of the most powerful cadres who run the central government and military . As China 's leading commercial metropolis and the locus of creature comforts for the wealthy , Shanghai is a magnet for the families of officials from around the country . <p> The measure 's tight focus on officials ' spouses and children also appears not to threaten the business activity of other immediate relatives , such as parents and siblings . Indeed , Shanghai 's biggest corruption scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party chief Chen Liangyu -- turned substantially on allegations he enriched a brother . <p> Among the Chinese state prosecutor 's strongest allegations that Mr. Chen had grown corrupt while leading Shanghai -- and deserved his conviction and subsequent 18 year prison sentence -- was that the local party boss created conditions for a brother to earn tens of millions of dollars redeveloping land despite how Mr. Chen " clearly knew ....

It just means the People 's Bank of China has moved the goalposts . <p> Shadow banking -- a catch-all term for nonbank financing -- is crucial to the workings of the Chinese economy . In a country where the big banks are controlled by the government and famously cater to the biggest companies , shadow banking is a necessity for just about everybody else . <p> An entrusted loan is a loan from one company to another . Chinese law requires that it be routed through a bank , securities companies or some other sanctioned financial firm , which performs the role of entrusting the loan but does n't take on any of the risk . <p> In 2014 , the net increase in entrusted loans was equivalent to 25.6% of new loans issued by banks , down slightly from 28.6% in 2013 .

Not necessarily . <p> According to a footnote , the PBOC now divides entrusted loans into two categories : those that are used for cash-management purposes and those that add credit to the real economy . Only the latter category will be included in the total social-financing data , the central bank 's proxy for total credit in the economy . <p> It 's a change that has been a long time coming . In China , companies use entrusted loans to manage cash-flow between their various units , a practice that is n't common elsewhere .

In other words , it is impossible to tell whether the 8.9% figure is a slowdown from previous periods without an apples-to-apples comparison from back then . <p> At first blush , the fall in new entrusted loan issuance appeared to be part of a broader retreat in non-bank lending . Moreover , growth in entrusted loans slowed for most of the second half of last year , despite a surge in December . <p> However , without knowing how significant cash management transactions were to the old data , it 's impossible to say for sure whether this year 's entrusted loan figures reflect a slowdown in credit -- or potentially an expansion . <p> The PBOC 's move is a welcome change than better reflects the creation of new credit in China 's economy .

@@3581233 <p> Currently on display this month at PMQ , Hong Kong 's newest design hub along Hollywood Road , is a comprehensive showcase devoted to one of Britain 's most representative architectural thinkers : Thomas Heatherwick . <p> Co-presented by the British Council and ongoing until September 23 , " New British Inventors : Inside Heatherwick Studio " is a timely exploration of the versatility and dynamism of one of the UK 's most groundbreaking and innovative architectural studios . The exhibition , curated by Kate Goodwin , Head of Architecture and Drue Heinz Curator at the Royal Academy of Arts in London , is a panoramic cross-section of Thomas Heatherwick 's most representative work over the past two decades . <p> Some of the projects featured include Hong Kong 's Pacific Place ( 2011 ) , a collaboration between Heatherwick Studio and Swire Properties ; the UK Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo , constructed out of 60,000 clear acrylic rods that contained a quarter of a million seed samples from the Millenium Seed Bank ; the Rolling Bridge in London 's Paddington ; and the Spun Chair ( 2007 ) , an ingenious piece of ergonomic engineering that is also rotationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwin to discuss the finer points of Heatherwick Studio 's prolific and varied output , comparative perspectives on the British and Hong Kong design scenes , and the explosive growth in Asia 's emerging metropolises . <p> What do you think distinguishes the creative process of Thomas Heatherwick and his studio ? What is it that allows the studio to tackle such a wide range of project briefs and challenges both efficiently and innovatively ? <p> The studio is not restricted by conventions or traditional boundaries : indeed , in many cases , it actively seeks to challenge them and offer new alternatives . They work across many disciplines and approach projects in a similar way , regardless of scale or typology . They critically analyze a brief , questioning the assumptions , and in some cases , initiated projects themselves . <p> They seek to find an essential idea or problem to solve , and do so in an inventive and original way , uniting the idea with a sculptural and sensual form . They also constantly question and re-evaluate the key idea behind a project , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- an approach that assures they are constantly innovating . <p> Tell us a bit more about the " contemporization " of Pacific Place . How has Heatherwick Studio been able to reconcile its creative processes with the demands and scale of a large corporate property developer like Swire Properties ? Did the project , with its mixed-use mega-structure typology , offer the studio certain " Asian " parameters that might have been more difficult to come by in the UK ? <p> The upgrading of Pacific Place has been an ongoing project for the studio since 2005 , with a very intense five-year period during which the majority of the work for the upgrade of the podium level and mall was completed . The studio worked closely with Swire Properties to understand what they wanted to achieve , and then used their creative ingenuity to realize it . <p> They rationalized what was and was n't working effectively , particularly in terms of resolving the visual and physical flow of the spaces . They then focused on the details , putting a huge amount of care into how things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . They created a very cohesive project where sensual curves unite all aspects of the project , and create a family of details . <p> It was logistically difficult , as the project had to be phased to assure minimum disruption to the operation of the place . The project was a valuable learning process for the studio and important in their development , particularly in the context of working at a large scale . It was a special project , but I would think there are other comparable projects in the UK . <p> " New British Inventors : Inside Heatherwick Studio " seeks to promote British design and creativity , and is backed by the British Council . In your experience working with the Hong Kong equivalents , what have been your impressions of the Hong Kong design ecosystem as compared with its British counterpart ? <p> I think the Hong Kong design scene is very strong , and there have been some great things coming out of it , particularly in recent years . However , on the whole , what is produced is potentially more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK . <p> That being said , there is a huge amount of energy and enthusiasm for design , and I was very impressed by what I saw in PMQ where the exhibition is being hosted . In particular , they seem to understand the market , and produce things that are commercially viable . Many of the designers I have met or become aware of in Hong Kong traverse the fields of art and design , blurring the boundaries between disciplines , often working at different scales , like Heatherwick . <p> Hong Kong is often derided as a profit-driven city where pragmatic concerns take priority over all else , leading to an urban landscape that does n't allow much room for individualization and creativity . Do you agree ? Conversely , what are some of the lessons that British designers might do well to learn from their Asian counterparts ? <p> Pragmatism is n't always bad , but you do need clients and patrons who are willing to push boundaries and take risks . An architecturally and spatially diverse city is important . Hong Kong has huge potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography , and a dense and alive urban center . <p> Architecture that continues to enhance physical and social conditions is vital , as it represents and drives the aspirations of a city . Asia is changing rapidly , and people are looking at things with new eyes . There is the ability to shape change on a major scale . <p> You authored a book about Thomas Heatherwick 's UK pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo entitled " Dandelion : the making of the UK pavilion . " In your opinion , what do Asian metropolises like Shanghai and Hong Kong offer Western observers and architects in terms of exciting , future-oriented design possibilities ? <p> The book was a comprehensive story about how the remarkable UK Pavilion came into being : covering the government and commissioning aspects , the design and engineering , and the complicated construction process . The level of ambition from all involved was connected to how important it was for the UK to be a part of what was the largest World Expo to date . <p> The Shanghai Expo was almost 5.3 square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expo , drawing world attention to a city that is culturally and architecturally rich . Many Asian cities are rapidly growing -- particularly in China , where government policy is driving urbanization . <p> In some cases , entirely new cities are being built . Accordingly , there is the ability -- should there be the foresight -- to integrate design at the highest level of thinking and development . There are instances where urban research ideas that would not be possible in Europe are actually being attempted and built in China . <p> The way change is being addressed , and the strategies for overcoming some of the urban and social issues that arise from such rapid and huge change , is of interest to Western observers and architects .
