@@2951235 <p> The slaughter in and around Paris has raised that question yet again , as has each case of hyper-terrorism committed by Islamists in recent decades , and particularly since 9/11 . The answer , thankfully , is that however barbaric these crimes , they are the desperate acts of a very small minority from a once-great civilisation which is suffering a protracted period of weakness and self-doubt . By contrast , western civilisation and its values are infinitely stronger and well capable of standing up to such acts of intimidation , provocation and depravity . <p> Start with France , one of the great nations not just of the West but of the world . Despite fears of a backlash against Muslims and justified concerns that the reactionary National Front would foment hatred , the spontaneous demonstrations that have taken place the length and breadth of France have had no whiff of the mob . Mercifully few marched on mosques or hurled rocks . Instead , people held pens and pencils aloft showing their solidarity with the murdered cartoonists . Nor was there anti-Muslim chanting . Rather , there was a dignified , mournful silence . <p> In short , the reaction exemplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . None of this should be cause for surprise . A PEW Research poll taken before last week 's atrocity found that 72pc of French people had a positive view of Muslims , the largest proportion of the seven European nations surveyed . <p> While a small minority of French actively dislike the way their country has become more ethnically and religiously diverse in recent decades , most people 's views range from warmly welcoming that change to being merely tolerant of it . <p> And all of that despite the change being great . Today , one in 12 people resident in France is Muslim , a share that is a third greater than that of Britain and Germany , two other countries with large Muslim communities . <p> But it is not only France that has remained true to its democratic values in the face of Islamist barbarity . The British , in the aftermath of the bombings 10 years ago which killed 77 people in London , also remained true to democratic values . In contrast to the anti-Muslim reaction that many commentators warned of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed was of calm defiance and the feared rush to tar all of the murderers ' co-religionists with the same brush never materialised . <p> Nor have other western countries which have suffered Islamist atrocities turned on their own Muslim communities ; the US after 9/11 , or Spain after the Madrid train bombings . <p> One reason the public reaction in the West has been so calm is the infrequency of the attacks , however barbarous they may be . One 's chances of being killed by a fanatic are a fraction of the probability of , for instance , dying in car crash . This does not amount to anything close to the existential threat that some alarmists have claimed , never mind the grand " clash of civilisations " that others talk of . <p> But why has Islamist terrorism become more common and more extreme in recent decades ? Some , such as the journalist Robert Fisk , blame the West itself . On Newstalk on Friday morning he predictably attributed the attacks to French and western involvement in the Muslim world . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also blame the West , but in their case it is because we are supposedly too weak in asserting our interests and values . Authors such as Bat Ye'or ( aka Giselle Littman ) claim Europe is colluding with a powerful and ruthless Islamic world to turn the continent into " Eurabia " . That nonsense is even further from the truth than the wicked West thesis peddled by Fisk and his ilk . <p> What happened in France in recent days is an expression of extreme weakness , - not great strength - by the perpetrators . <p> Islam has had its ups and downs - culturally , politically , economically and militarily - since it was founded in the 7th Century . But for the past 300 years it has all been downhill . <p> Since the height of the Ottoman Empire in the 1600s no part of the Muslim world has modernised with great success , and that was the case both before and after European colonialism ended and statehood was achieved by many Muslim countries in the middle of the 20th Century . In the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emancipation and self-government all too quickly descended into dictatorship and economic failure as the 1960s and 70s progressed . Even the resource-rich states of the Persian Gulf remain politically repressive and economically retarded . <p> By the 1970s , the failures of Muslim states across the world came to be blamed by many on the importation of alien western ideas , including democracy , capitalism and socialism . The ideas of political Islam first articulated by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1920s increasingly came into vogue . <p> The 1979 revolution which led to the creation of the purist form of Islamist state in Iran was the earliest and most striking manifestation of this rejection of perceived westernisation . But the abject failure of revolutionary Iran - by any measure over more than a third of a century - shows that the problems of modernisation and existing in a modernising world will never be solved by attempting to recreate an imaginary 7th -Century caliphate . <p> Feelings of anger , frustration and dis-empowerment are common across North Africa and the Middle East at the failures to progress . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilisation has fallen ever further behind others . <p> For a small minority across the Muslim world , doubling down on an ever-more extreme version of political Islam is the response , and almost any means is acceptable in the pursuit of that end . Lashing out at those who they perceive to offend their religion , from Salman Rushdie to Charlie Hebdo cartoonists , gives a sense of empowerment to people who in reality have little ability to shape or control their destinies . <p> And while they may manage to carry out occasional acts of mass murder in the West ( and more frequent atrocities in Muslim countries ) , the notion that these groupings of fanatics , who number in the thousands , could impose their will on Europe is little short of laughable . <p> The extremists are small in number and limited in resources . And even if the West may be in relative decline globally and Europe 's economic woes chronic , the resources available to fight extremism are enormous and infinitely greater than those at the disposal of the rabble of obscurantist losers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To downplay the extent of the threat posed by Islamists is not to be complacent . Security services may need even more resources to combat the threat and we may all have to give up a little of the freedoms and privacy we cherish to enjoy more freedom from fear . <p> There is , for instance , a case for the European Parliament to stop blocking proposed laws that give security services access to air passenger details so that Europeans who travel to the Middle East to participate in that region 's blood letting can be better monitored . <p> But over-reaction is to be avoided . Proportionality in the response must be front and centre . The terrorists do not represent the Muslim world any more than the IRA ever represented Irish people . They should be dealt with as criminal gangs are dealt with . <p> The past few days have been a great tragedy for those involved and a shock to France and the rest of Europe . But it does not amount to a " clash of civilisations " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Zombies , Run ! is a running app that convinces you that a hoard of zombies are chasing you on your run and encourages you to keep moving to stay alive . It 's gearing up to launch the fourth instalment of its best-selling running game and plans to keep us firmly immersed in its world . You play as Runner 5 , an unnamed ( and silent ) runner for Abel , an isolated township and one of the few Zombie-free outposts . As a runner , your job is to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find supplies while avoiding and outrunning zombie attacks . <p> This may sound like your typical zombie game , but unusually Zombies , Run ! is played almost entirely in your head . In reality you are listening to the game on headphones as you follow your local running route , using it as an alternative to your traditional music playlist . Through a series of radio broadcasts and recordings , you become part of this zombie-infested world and the characters and dramas of the Abel township . <p> First launched by SixToStart in 2012 , Zombies , Run ! is now entering its fourth series , and shows no signs of slowing down . Adrian Hon , co-founder of the company thinks the game 's simplicity is one its key strengths . " Conceptually I think Zombies Run is quite a simple game , it 's quite a simple experience because you do n't want to overdo things , " he says . <p> " You can imagine a Zombies , Run ! where you have to run to a location and that 's what you see on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kind of constrained .

" <p> Taking the form of a radio play , it is the game 's writing which has ensured its popularity with fans . Another creator of the game is writer and novelist Naomi Alderman , who came up with the idea while at a running class . Sharing what had inspired them to learn to run , a class member joked that she wanted to outrun the zombie hoards . After years of making games for other companies , this became SixToStart 's first independent project . <p> " For the first few years we were making games for other people .

" With other games , they make the game and then they go get a writer and say , ' can you try and make this make sense ? ' " he says . " We had the writers and designers and developers all in the same room , which made it easier because there were only four or five of us , it 's the advantage of having a small , focused team " <p> " Regardless of whether we had a big game or a small game , it 's a kind of clarity of vision that matters and it 's probably hard to do that with big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make Uncharted 5 or whatever , you go ' oh we 're going to do what we did before but in a different place ' and I do n't think people would understand if they did something very different than that .

The new series will bring the number of running missions up to 200 , increasing the worry that slower runners will be left behind in the story . <p> " It is tricky , like I just binge-watched this thing on Amazon Prime and watched about ten episodes in two days , and you obviously ca n't run ten missions in two days .

Fixing them presumably involves writing new and more intelligent software to do the job and that , in turn , means the whole process moves farther away from human hands . <p> I suppose this process began , and then accelerated , from the 1970s onwards . Gradually , labouring jobs that could be done by men without a secondary education disappeared and were taken over by technology . A ride-on mower , for example , could get the job done faster and with fewer men than before . <p> We neither noticed nor cared about the loss of those jobs .

We all know how that worked out . <p> More importantly , perhaps , we entered an era of educational apartheid . <p> In this system , your chances of putting together a decent income without a degree are pretty bleak . And if you have a degree you had better go on to get a masters . <p> It used to be said that you needed a degree to work as a petrol-pump attendant . That 's no longer true : there are no petrol-pump attendants . <p> Inequality appears to be increasing in the US . Poverty appears to be increasing in Britain .

No meaningful data breach had occurred , and no sensitive documents had been hacked , it was stated . <p> But such claims ring hollow . <p> Yes , it appears to be the case that nothing of serious import was accessed -- " just " the Twitter and YouTube accounts for US Central Command ( CentCom ) , a regional command base within the Pentagon that has oversight of military activities in the Middle East and other regions . <p> " We are viewing this purely as a case of cybervandalism , " CentCom said in a statement issued on Monday , after the accounts and been deactivated and an investigation was underway .

Some will be thinking , if an arm of the Pentagon ca n't even effectively password protect a Twitter account , how much confidence does it inspire that more sensitive information is better secured ? <p> Most people would expect a military and defence organisation to be an exemplar of meticulous cybersecurity . For the general public , a hacked Twitter account is as much a sign of general operational sloppiness as a soldier going on parade in a dirty uniform .

The military , above all , should know the smallest detail amplifies to reflect an entire organisation . <p> That 's why any kind of hack or data breach is known to be deadly to any organisation .

Customers lose confidence in the organisation and will take their business elsewhere . <p> Organisations that had been hacked said it took a year to restore a brand 's reputation after an incident . <p> So for CentCom , looking foolish is n't a trivial issue .

" They 're not losing anything and that was n't the case few months ago . " <p> Declining currencies in European countries whose citizens are among the leading buyers of Dubai homes are combining with falling oil prices and a tax on foreign property held by Indians to push down home prices in the emirate . <p> A year ago , Dubai regulators took steps to cool a market where home values had been climbing at the fastest pace in the world . <p> Investor sentiment " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of corporate ratings at Standard &amp; Poor 's . " Buyers will hold off on any kind of activity and wait for prices to fall . That can exacerbate the decline . " <p> S&amp;P predicts a price drop of 10pc to 20pc this year , according to Franck Delage , associate director of corporate ratings for Europe , the Middle East and Africa . Chicago-based broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. says selling prices will decline 10pc and rents slump as 25,000 new homes are added to the market in 2015 . <p> There was little sign that steps to slow the market would lead to declines after home values surged 56pc in the two years through 2013 . <p> The United Arab Emirates ' central bank limited mortgage lending and required larger down payments , and the Land Department doubled transaction taxes early last year as policymakers tried to avoid a repeat of a property bubble in 2008 that caused values to slump by about 65pc . <p> " They did the right thing and it had the desired effect because 2013 was pretty ridiculous in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UAE residential valuations at Cluttons in Dubai . <p> " Landlords need to lower prices and buyers need to save for deposits . That can easily take 18 months to three years and we may see a subdued market .

Brent crude , the benchmark product that has averaged $101 a barrel since the end of 2009 , plunged to about $62 as of Feb. 18 . <p> India 's implementation of a tax on overseas investments may be another drag on the market , Colliers International said in a December 21 report .

British buyers are a distant second with purchases totalling 9.3bn dirhams last year and 10.4bn in 2013 . <p> At the same time , Dubai 's dollar-pegged dirham is making its property more expensive for investors from the Indian subcontinent , the UK , Russia and the euro zone . <p> In the past six months , the British pound lost 8pc against the dollar , the euro declined 15pc and the Russian rouble slumped 42pc . <p> " Currency issues are much harder to deal with than other factors , " said Craig Plumb , head of Middle East research at Jones Lang . " There is n't much the government can do to fix that problem short of removing the currency peg or imposing restrictions on capital . " <p> Most analysts do n't expect Dubai 's home-price slump to resemble the 2008 collapse . Dubai 's property market is more regulated than it was five years ago with restrictions on speculative development and how advance payments can be spent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 , " S&amp;P 's Delage said . " There has been some discipline to the market and industry and there are offsetting factors . " <p> Not everyone agrees that prices will fall this year .

It does more in 50 minutes to engage the audience in an understanding of the reality of the tortured events of 100 years ago than most academic tomes . <p> Pals achieves so much because it manages not just to underline the importance of doing justice to historical narratives so long submerged , but to anchor those stories in the voices of the participants . This is an exercise in history from below and is a reminder of what can be achieved by being creative and imaginative with archival material to give meaning to what is a relatively new approach to the history of this era ; giving a sense , not just of what happened , but what it felt like for those involved . The placing of the cast and audience in the actual building where the men did their training gives this production an added authenticity and atmosphere . <h> ' I can not unremember ' <p> This is a play about smashed bodies and minds ; mental and physical trauma on a harrowing scale .

The result is arresting and unsettling , just as it should be , given the consequences of the journey that took them , not to France as they expected , but to Gallipoli . This was part of the military strategy to counteract the stalemate of France and Flanders by attempting to take the Turks out of the war .

In the words of historian Philip Orr , " today the graveyards in this part of Turkey are filled with tombstones that read like entries from an Irish street directory " . <h> Challenging jingoism <p> Pals is not about celebrating or eulogising or playing politics , but amounts to an accurate and moving portrayal of the reality of war and underlines how some British historians were correct last year to challenge a jingoistic reading of the first World War being promoted by some British politicians , including the education secretary Michael Gove . In criticising historian Richard Evans , Gove asked : " Why does the Left insist on belittling true British heroes ? " Evans had taken Gove to task for insisting it was a " just war " and a " noble cause " . Gove 's stance disingenuously camouflaged the documented reality by trumpeting a simplistic narrative of glorious sacrifice .

Some things have changed , others remain the same , but there is a feeling of destiny surrounding this team again . Maybe now is the time to begin the run of All-Irelands that most felt they were capable of in 2012 . <p> Before any of that can happen , Sunday must come first . Mullagh of Galway are the opponents , surprise opposition for some . While they were building , they were n't exactly expected to emerge from a very tough county championship . <p> Killimor , who won the 2010- ' 11 All-Ireland and lost the final two years later , were their opponents in the county semi-final .

Mullagh again found the net twice and those majors proved vital as they overturned an 0-8 to 1-2 half-time deficit to win by 2-5 to 0-9 . <p> The side is rippled with talent . The spine of the team contains three Galway regulars with Sarah Dervan at full-back , Sin ? ad Cahalan at centre-back and Therese Manton in midfield . They also have two county Minors from last year in Patricia Manning and Erica Coen and they bolster their attacking options with the experienced Cathy Bowes . <p> However , more powerful is a full-forward line that has helped Mullagh to eight goals in the last three games . It contains Rachel Monaghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-8 in that final , Karen Kennedy , another Intermediate , as well as Senior Galway attacker Aoife Donohoe . <p> While Oulart-The Ballagh wo n't take their challenge lightly , they have every reason to be confident . <p> The season did n't really start to get going until after they beat St. Martin 's in the county semi-final at Wexford Park ( 5-12 to 1-12 ) . <p> Rathnure were again expected to put up a big challenge in the final but Oulart-The Ballagh were ready for the clash and battered the Blackstairs girls into submission in a stunning performance , eventually coming out on top by 3-16 to 2-4 . <p> Ballyboden St. Enda 's were the next side put to the sword ( 8-12 to 0-6 ) in the Leinster semi-final , and Thomastown followed two weeks later as Oulart-The Ballagh raced into 2-4 to nil lead before eventually winning comfortably ( 3-9 to 1-5 ) . <p> Loughgiel did n't put up much of a fight in 2012 but played a lot better this time around as they only conceded one point in the second-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 minutes and Oulart-The Ballagh eventually wrapped up a 1-15 to 0-8 win to secure a place in Sunday 's final . <p> The defensive statistics are pretty good .

Mary Leacy still anchors the team at centre-back and is flanked by Stacey Redmond and Aoife O'Connor . <p> Shauna Sinnott 's loss in defence has bolstered a problem position in midfield where she works superbly with Shelley Kehoe . Diane Ryan , goalscorer in the semi-final , will play one side of Ursula Jacob and Louise Sinnott is expected to retain the other wing-forward position , although the likes of Sharon Kehoe and Aishling Moran are pushing hard for a starting spot . <p> Inside Una Leacy is the focal point at full-forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kehoe either side in a potentially devastating attack . Oulart-The Ballagh will expect to win but will need a big performance from that trio against a strong full-back line from Mullagh . <p> This is likely to be Oulart-The Ballagh 's toughest game for some time . Mullagh have potential and momentum on their side but the Wexford champions are a powerhouse team . Expect Oulart-The Ballagh , who have no injury worries , to come out on top by five or six points and claim a second All-Ireland title .

@@3065231 <h> State finally coming of age with transparency for board appointments <h> Eddie Molloy <p> Last year 's ham-fisted attempt to appoint John McNulty to the Board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art ( IMMA ) brought to a head long-standing public disapproval of the political cronyism that all parties have casually practised for generations . <p> The Oxford Dictionary defines cronyism as " the practice of appointing friends and associates to positions of authority , especially when they are not suitably qualified " . <p> The boards of State bodies are packed with cronies , most of whom are probably well qualified for the job , but there remain several problems with the practice , even when the appointees are well qualified . <p> Quite apart from being unfair - and the probability that boards are being deprived of even more highly qualified members - crucially , cronyism damages the reputation of the organisation by creating the reasonable suspicion that , whenever political interests are at stake , board decisions will be unduly influenced by political considerations rather than the wider public interest . <p> The McNulty affair was the last straw for the public , not only because it was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn promise of a " political revolution " ... a new way of doing politics " had once again been betrayed . <p> But , on February 5 , in the offices of the Public Appointments Service ( PAS ) , the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform ( DPER ) , Brendan Howlin , launched a new system for making appointments to State boards that should end this particular form of political patronage . <p> Credit where it is due : this is the ' real deal ' . It is as watertight as possible and in the hands of the PAS , which has established a reputation for objectivity and integrity in all its recruitment and promotions competitions right across the public service , there is the prospect of an end to stuffing of State boards with buddies , especially as ministers are about to leave office . <p> In future , anyone - including political friends and associates , such as Mr Lowry 's former press adviser - who wants to serve on a State board will first have to apply with their CV on the PAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular expertise and skills they require to fill vacancies and PAS will then initiate an assessment process that is " consistent with the values of independence , impartiality , fairness and integrity underlying the exercise of PAS 's statutory roles and responsibilities " . <p> Details of this sophisticated process are on the PAS website , www.stateboards.ie . <p> As the public becomes more aware of this system , many able people who would have refrained from expressing an interest in serving on boards , because they were too politicised , are likely to come forward . This will widen the pool of talent available to boards . <p> This genuine reform sets the standard for tackling a range of other political indulgences . <p> The distribution of Lottery funds is a case in point . When Michael Ring was Junior sport minister , his constituency , particularly his bailiwick of Westport , received a disproportionate share of Lottery sports money ; his implausible explanation was that in Mayo they had more " shovel-ready projects " . <p> Likewise , Kerry arts projects got the lion 's share when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the application of " logistical logarithmic progressions " by Dr James Reilly to justify favouring his own constituency in locating new primary care centres . <p> Clientelism has bedevilled the health service , so it was refreshing to hear Minister for Health Leo Varadkar say he will refuse requests to bump people up the waiting list for treatments , for the good reason that this would be unfair to a person in greater need . <p> The key to eroding clientelism and cronyism is to publish and rigorously apply clear , relevant criteria for the distribution of public goods , be that a place in a queue , a seat on a board , a sports grant or , a more serious matter , a judicial appointment . The Chief Justice , the Hon Ms Susan Denham , has called for judicial appointments to be de-politicised . <p> Noel Dempsey adopted this approach when , as Minister for Education , he established a criteria-based process for allocating funds for school buildings to replace a system that was riddled with politics . <p> Although the people who gain from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , the progressive stripping away of political patronage and what the late Peter Mair called " amoral localism " , will ultimately help to restore trust in politics and , importantly , divert politicians towards their primary task of making laws and policies that serve the common good . <p> Once done , even those who hanker after the good old days of a nod and a wink will come to prefer a culture of fairness and transparency . It 's all part of growing up as a State . <p> Dr Eddie Molloy is a management consultant . He is a member of the board of the Public Appointments Service .

The pilot reported for duty anyway after hearing of the explosion in Oslo and was told he was n't needed . In fact , numerous requests had been made for helicopter back-up .

Photograph : Feng Li/Getty Images <p> Getting a foreign journalist visa in China was easier last year than in previous years , according to a survey by the Foreign Correspondents ' Club of China ( FCCC ) , but authorities continue to punish reporters and media organisations by withholding visas if they do n't like their coverage . <p> " In general , the visa renewal process went more smoothly this year than last , when New York Times and Bloomberg reporters were made to wait until the last moment for their visas , " said the FCCC in the executive summary of the annual report . <p> " We are disturbed , however , to find that the Chinese authorities are continuing to abuse the press card and visa renewal process in a political manner , treating journalistic accreditation as a privilege rather than a professional right , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous coverage if it has displeased the government , " it said . <p> Since coming to power in late 2012 , President Xi Jinping has come down hard on press freedom , and the Chinese government is particularly annoyed about coverage of the fortunes earned by the families of the senior leaders . <p> Every year , foreign correspondents in China have to renew their journalist visas .

@@3081240 <h> The Grit Doctor : Reduce the rubbish , bit by biscuit <p> Q Dear Grit Doctor , tell me you are joking that you do n't have a box overflowing with biscuits , bars and crisps at home for the kids . Mine would go on strike if I removed them , and I would run out of ideas and patience . They get awfully grumpy without a biscuit . I have teenagers and they just would n't put up with it . Jen <p> A I really do n't have that sugary gunk at home anymore : I still have the biscuit tin , but it has only healthy treats in it : gingerbread men sweetened with apple juice and packets of raisins for the twins and whatever we may have -- very occasionally -- baked together ( flapjacks , dark chocolate chip cookies , that kind of thing ) . But gone are the Breakaways , custard creams , mini cheddars , crisps and standard chocolate Digestive fare . <p> Do I miss them ? A little , yes , especially right now typing this and thinking how well a chocolate Hobnob would marry with my cup of tea . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a self-confessed crapoholic who needs to keep temptation at bay so is eternally grateful for my treat-tin cull . <p> But , interestingly enough , I think the kids miss them the least . Their expectations lowered so quickly it genuinely surprised me how easy it was to turn them on to the less sugary stuff such as raisins and gingerbread biscuits see note 1 . <p> The key is to delude them into believing it is still a treat -- the treat being given permission to climb up , open the tin and discover something edible within . And not having all that sugary rubbish at home does n't mean we never eat it at all . But it does ensure that we are not eating it every day , or even every week . <p> I accept teenagers are infinitely more complex creatures and far harder to delude . So I suggest you begin your treat-tin cull with this little experiment using their favourite packet of crisps : Cook up one crisp on a silver spoon and watch how it burns . Be sure to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , and note that it takes ages to burn away , leaving a pool of dark acrid fat on the spoon . Dare one of the little darlings to drink it . They wo n't be tempted , and with luck this little exercise will deter them crisps long enough for you to introduce some healthier alternatives into that tin without the risk of an almighty strop . Plus , you will not be tempted to buy them again . Ever . <p> Back to that tin . Custard cream , anyone ? There is a good reason why biscuits are so cheap , made up as they are in factory vats , chock full of HFCs -- an insanely cheap sugar manufactured from corn but artificially engineered to be even sweeter than the white stuff and trans fats see note 2 . Just a cursory glance at the ingredients list of a bog-standard packet of custard creams will read more like a chemistry lab experiment , so indecipherable is the language from words we ordinarily associate with real food . <p> Because they are layered up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are rendered incapable of just eating the one and moving on . Bear in mind that we get more than enough sugar from pasta , milk , bread , cereals , fruit and vegetables to take us to the World Health Organisation maximum daily limit way before we add in cakes , muffins , puddings , pies , cookies , yogurts , drinks and so on see note 3 . Just one solitary fruit juice has us teetering on the daily maximum amount before we 've even sat down to eat breakfast . So you see now where that tin is taking your family : way , way beyond sugar saturation point . <h> Stiffen your resolve <p> Do n't bother telling your teenage kids about all this : they wo n't listen to a word of it , I am writing it so that you have it ringing in your ears on your next supermarket shop , to help you steer clear of the crap aisle and to stiffen your resolve in the face of any teenage objection . But do n't go nuts and empty the tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I recommend a slow weaning process for the whole family . Swap one type of crappy treat for another healthy one and/or phase them out gradually so it does n't become a huge bone of contention for you all to choke on . So , for example , once you 've fired those crisps from the tin , in their place you might have homemade popcorn , or bake slivers of their favourite vegetables : courgette , butternut squash , or carrots to create vegetable crisps . And eat them with a homemade veggie dip . Or , for grit fiends , ricecakes . <p> Ultimately , you have to be gritty about it and stick to your guns . Remind yourself that you , and not your teenagers , are in charge . If you are footing the bill for all this crap and choose no longer to do so , they will just have to suck it up . You are not under any obligation to feed their sugar/junk/processed food addiction and are doing them no favours whatsoever in allowing them to eat all this crap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet enough when there are no digestives on offer . Note 1 . Note " less sugary " rather than " sugar-free " : a misnomer of the highest order when you consider that all carbohydrate breaks down into sugar . To have a sugar-free diet would be to eat only fat and meat . Which is utterly daft . <p> Note 2 : HFCs are widely agreed to be the worst type of sugar , manufactured in factory vats , designed to give food a longer shelf life while effortlessly raising the risk of heart disease in consumers. * <p> Note 3 : The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends no more than 10 teaspoons of sugar a day for an adult . More recent draft guidelines from WHO suggest that a reduction to below 5 per cent of total energy intake per day would have additional benefits .

@@3100230 <h> So what 's an ' I heart consent ' university workshop actually like ? <p> Tuesday , March 10 , 2015 <p> University of Sussex student Jessica Pitocchi went along to find out . <p> I Heart Consent workshops are being rolled out in students ' unions across the UK as part of a wider National Union of Students campaign . While Oxford and Cambridge have scheduled them into freshers ' introductory timetable , other universities have started running them voluntarily in line with the NUS syllabus . <p> Jessica Pitocchi attended a University of Sussex students ' union workshop to find out what it could teach students about consent . <p> The workshop starts with an ice breaker . The students -- an even gender split of four men and four women -- are asked a classic hypothetical question about what song/book/animal we 'd take to a desert island with us . <p> There are suggestions of Backstreet Boys , The Tiger Who Came To Tea and the benefits of taking a tiger , despite the risk of a significantly different ending from the one in the book . <p> Up until this point , if someone had walked into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was a light-hearted team bonding session , between the laughter , the lollipops and the preppy badges on the table . <p> But taking a closer look at those badges reveals the very serious , very real message behind this meeting : consent . And soon we would be writing the words " slut " , " sexuality " and " rape " onto large pieces of paper . And that mistaken person would probably try to discreetly step back out . <p> Because sexual assault is not something we talk about enough . And even less so do we talk about consent . <p> The university 's welfare officer Rianna Gargulio , who is leading the I Heart Consent Sussex campaign and running this session alongside the uni 's education officer Bethan Hunt , lays down some ground rules . <p> Listen to each other , be respectful , no judgement , she says . Be mindful of using someone 's preferred pronoun -- a subtle but powerful rule which could only really be expected from the first students ' union in the UK to introduce gender neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their triggering nature -- though many of the students throughout the session find themselves recounting a few old stories from nights out in a new light . <p> These workshops are trying to enable students to think differently about stuff they 've heard from their friends or even what 's happened to them in the past in order to help them recognise what consent is , particularly in a clubbing environment . <p> Students are split into two groups and told to scribble down the first words that come to mind when they think of terms to do with consent . In among the synonyms for comfort , choice and checking , is the clear binary of " drunk " and " sober " -- a prominent grey area in the understanding of consent , and an issue that 's been discussed a lot since the high profile case of Ched Evans . <p> Ched Evans was convicted of raping a woman who was too drunk to consent ( Eamonn and James Clarke/EMPICS ) <p> Further areas of a similar colour are brought up when discussing portrayals of consent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves a vulnerable young woman being pressured to sign a sexual contract which entitles her lover -- or predator , depending on which way you look at it -- to never have to ask for consent again , and thereby completely contradicting the basis that consent needs to be given every time . <p> Rianna tells us there should be 0 Shades of Grey . " Rape is rape " she says . <p> Jennifer Aniston and her co-stars in the Horrible Bosses sequel ( Nick Ansell/PA ) <p> The film Horrible Bosses is brought up next . A few students chuckle at the memory of watching it , but then we 're asked to look at Jennifer Aniston 's character . She plays a dentist who sexually assaults both clients and staff for her own sexual satisfaction . She is n't given consent from either of her victims so in one case she uses anaesthesia to get around this . <p> But this is juuuust fine . This assault is funny because it 's a woman , and an attractive one at that , right ? <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one student , shaking her head . <p> absolutely DISGUSTED with #horriblebosses mockery of rape and sexual assault ! man or woman , sexual harassment is not " awesome " or " hot " . <p> Horrible Bosses was clearly popular with audiences , enough so for a sequel to be commissioned . But this popularity is part of the problem that contributes to the rape of men being reduced to nothing more than a bit of comedy . <p> " There is implied consent from just being a man , " Rianna explains . <p> The talk takes a darker turn when addressing some of the myths and stereotypes surrounding rape . <p> These range from the widely held belief that rape takes place in dark alleyways by strangers , to more specialist scenarios surrounding sex workers and gay people . The difference between rape to assert power rather than obtain pleasure were also examined . <p> Students hear the hard facts that the majority of rapes happen by people the victims know , often in the place they call home and sometimes by their own partner . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who experienced some form of sexual assault did not report it to services , the highest reason being out of fear of disbelief for women and out of embarrassment for men . But students also hear indications of progression in the law including the Court of Appeal 's ruling in 2008 that a late complainant does not make a false complainant . <p> Someone asks Rianna whether she thinks Sussex will begin to make the workshops compulsory . Surprisingly she says she does n't think so , saying they 're a " PR nightmare " . There seems to be a feeling that universities might fear prospective students and their families would interpret sessions as necessary to combat a problem specific to that university . <p> In Fifty Shades the issue of consent is pretty grey too ( Universal Studios/PA ) <p> But Rianna knows Oxford and Cambridge have a point in targeting first year students . The group of students are united in agreeing that Freshers week is all about first impressions . They agree if attitudes on a night out were addressed early on by these workshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek approval from new friends . <p> Another male student poses a much more blunt question : how can you begin to change lad culture ? <p> The workshop facilitators say there are three types of men : the few who actively promote lad culture , the few who actively object to it , and the majority who might laugh but keep quiet -- these are the ones to be targeted . <p> You can see why . Is it realistic for sole student representatives to expect to tackle a societal problem , one 90 minute workshop at a time ? <p> An International Women 's Day March ( R.Jeanette Martin / Demotix/Demotix/PA ) <p> But with a bold manifesto objective to " single handedly smash the patriarchy , " there is evidence of a deep rooted drive and determination to kick up enough of a fuss that others will actually begin to listen and pause and think and ask . <p> The session concluded with one final question from a student who said she had been contemplating it throughout the session : " Is drunk consent always not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rianna said that everyone 's drinking limits are different , so everyone 's understanding of " drunk " is different . Just as there is no straightforward definition for consent , there is no blanket circumstance that can be applied to all . Students are guided to understand the right answer lies entirely in the context of a situation and on the people in that situation making that judgement . <p> Prior to the session , some students scoffed at the concept and doubted what they could possibly be taught about consent . " It 's just asking , is n't it ? " said one student before we entered . <p> But as they left and mused about the final question , they epitomised the working principle of this campaign without even realising it . <p> Campaigners believe creating a space for open conversations about consent will lead to people knowing , using and becoming familiar with that language . Their hope is that once students are equipped with this language they can use it to create their own safe spaces to have tough but necessary conversations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The majority of students left this session surprised but aware of the complexities surrounding consent and I watched as they debated to the bus stop and beyond . <p> Consent appears to have been given a voice at Sussex and the reality of its spectrum is being projected through the busy mouths of students .

Want to celebrate a major client win or milestone ? Need to vent about how demanding , controlling , unreasonable or awful the boss is ? That 's what friends are for . <p> And there are proven benefits to such relationships . Research from Gallup has shown that people who have best friends at work are more engaged , and that their organisations show higher profitability and customer loyalty than those in which close friendships between colleagues are less common . <p> But if you 've recently been promoted into your first managerial role , you understand that having close friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends complained about the boss behind his or her back . <p> Now you 're the boss , and they 're complaining about you behind your back .

Be clear <p> Yes , you can still be friends with your subordinates . But everyone needs to realize that your work relationship has changed . Set clear expectations and boundaries . <p> For example , talk with your friends about the new responsibilities you face . Explain that you are accountable for the development and performance of your friends and that of their co-workers . To be an effective leader for the entire group , the amount of time you spend with them and the tenor of your interaction will probably have to change . <p> 2 . Be fair <p> When it comes to bonuses , raises , promotions , support and resources , leave your personal biases aside . If your friends deserve them , and it 's documented , great .

Be prepared <p> My psychology professor at Emory University , Steve Nowicki , taught me that relationships have a four-stage life cycle : choice - beginning - deepening - ending . When you go from friend to boss , the friendship as you 've known it has ended . You and your friend must choose whether it will begin again in this new phase .

Mary Tyler Moore from the galaxy Almod ? var ? <p> Donald Clarke <p> Donald <p> Tue , Mar 10 , 2015 , 18:36 <p> " I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold , " Keats writes of his first encounter with that writer 's Homer . " Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken . " Okay . That 's not really how I felt after sucking down the first six episodes of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt in one suffocating draught . But this does play like a very special situation comedy . Created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock , the energetic series , now available on Netflix , does have some of the quip-heavy energy of the same writers ' 30 Rock , but it feels altogether stranger , creepier and less easy to parse . If I must reduce it to a bite I will do so as follows : Mary Tyler Moore from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The show works from an impressively dark premise . The titular Kimmy ( Ellie Kemper ) is one of a small group of women recently released from a Doomsday cult . In the breathless pilot , the ingenue decides to make her way to New York City with a mind to soak up all the cultural wash that has flowed over her head for the past decade and a half . Working to formal sit-com templates , the writers billet her with an eccentric gay actor ( Tituss Burgess ) in an apartment owned by the indestructible , exhaustingly funny Carol Kane . She then secures a job working as a gopher for Jane Krakowski 's ghastly uptown snoot . <p> Some unhappy smoke signals preceded the series ' appearance on the streaming site . Fey and Carlock were originally developing the show for NBC before it was shifted off to Netflix . Did this make it a " troubled production " ? A fitful trailer emphasised life-affirming flash over the darker elements that make the show so worthy of careful analysis . Happily , the beast itself manages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing : the need to quip and desire to construct comic circumstances . Too many mainstream US comedies -- yes , we mean you , Two and a Half Men -- err towards the former and settle for putting supposedly funny sentences in their characters ' mouths . We are watching people being funny to one another , rather than enjoying characters in absurd or farcical situations . Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt does abound with funny lines , but it also works hard at setting up properly constructed comic scenarios . I particularly like the recurring gag that has Kane vocally answering questions on Jeopardy and having her responses taken for contributions to nearby conversations . ( That 's the closest I can come to explaining the joke . Watch it yourself . ) <p> What really sets Kimmy Schmidt aside , however , is the hugely original tone . Kemper 's magnificent performance may gesture towards perky post-war heroines such as Samantha in Bewitched or Jeannie in I Dream of Jeannie , but , despite the eye-busting day-glo sets , she exists in a universe infested with potential disaster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hideous captivity . " Would you excuse me , Logan ? I have to use the filth bucket , erm ... the powder room , " she says at one point . It took me a while , but I eventually twigged what was nagging at my critical sensibilities . There really is something of early Pedro Almod ? var about this combination of camp larks with more worrying energies . <p> There are some potential concerns . The mid-series gags at the expense of an Asian character seem jaw-droppingly outdated and unreconstructed . It is also open to question quite how long the writers can maintain Kimmy 's fish-out-of-water status . By the time we reach series three , she will surely understand how to work a cellphone and will realise that Friends is no longer a cultural reference point . <p> Never mind all that .

@@3123230 <h> MSM Blood Ban is Outdated and Discriminatory <h> A proposed one-year waiting period is still stigmatising , but at least public thinking has changed <p> In his epitaph to his son Damon , April Fool 's Day , the late South African-Australian novelist Bryce Courtenay wrote of his son Damon 's life as a haemophiliac , and eventual death as a result of having contracted HIV through blood transfusion . The text is a thorough reflection by Courtenay on his son 's humility , charm , and stoicism in the face of an incredibly difficult set of challenges : haemophilia and AIDS . In April Fool 's Day , there is a passage I vividly remember concerning the MSM ( men who have sex with men ) blood donation ban which was implemented in Australia in response to the AIDS epidemic . He lambasts the members of the gay community at the time who objected to this blood donation ban . His comments came from a place where he viewed one person 's freedom from something as being greater than a person 's freedom to do something , and , in cases of life or death , one can see why . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , but rather supportive of a measure which , with the limited information available at the time , was seen as a reasonable safety measure . <p> HIV/AIDS is a phenomenon on which there is still a significant deficit in public understanding . Matthew Mulligan of Trinity News wrote an editorial recently in which he urged the MSM Blood Donation Ban to be abolished , and urged greater awareness of sexual health and STI prevention -- a sentiment which has the potential to save lives . <p> The text reveals , to a young person who never saw it themselves , the environment of fear and uncertainty which existed , and the tragedy that this epidemic was . <p> In the late Timothy Conigrave 's autobiography Holding the Man , he wrote of his acquisition of AIDS and the death of his beloved John to the disease . This is another text which warms the heart , and is revealing and hilarious , yet is absolutely tragic in the most profound way . Conigrave details his life growing up as gay in Melbourne , attending the Jesuit secondary school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family 's hostile attitude to the relationship . He details the experience of the two of them succumbing to AIDS -- with John dying first , only a year or so before Tim himself died -- leaving the book to be published posthumously . It is an incredibly important text , in that it charts the emergence of AIDS in the public consciousness , first as GRID , or Gay-related Immune Deficiency , and discusses the fears of a " gay cancer " and the attached social stigma . The text reveals , to a young person who never saw it themselves , the environment of fear and uncertainty which existed , and the tragedy that this epidemic was . <p> It is in this environment , in 1985 , in which the ban on men who have sex with men , even only once in their lives , donating blood was introduced in Ireland . At the time , when there was a clear observation that the group most likely to attract HIV was gay men , and little else was known about the condition , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater awareness exists surrounding the riskiness of particular sexual behaviours , it seems that the maintenance of a life ban is nothing but discrimination . Most people tend not to leap at the opportunity to have a needle inserted into their arm to draw blood , but when one does n't have the opportunity to even consider this , it is an affront to dignity . <p> Every year the Phil , the society in College which is my home , organises a blood drive among its active members . Every year , there is a substantial portion of willing donors who ca n't participate in the drive by virtue of the fact that they are gay , British , or too thin . There was one memorable hat-trick , manifested in one member who met all three of these characteristics . We joke about how so few of us are eligible to donate , and there are clear reasons why there are specific restrictions on donation . A few years ago some individuals on this blood drive wrote a letter to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service objecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The service have always provided reasoned responses to such questions , and note that MSM are still a very high risk group for HIV , hence the need for some restrictions simply for safety of the blood supply . This is understandable . However , the current policy of a life ban leaves resources of blood entirely inaccessible . Even if , as is contended , the impact of the ban on supply is fairly minimal , the notion that these resources can never be called upon in times of need is discomforting . <p> Though maintaining a year-long ban is still discrimination , and does n't remove the notion that gay blood is " dirty " and that gay people are contaminated , it is at least a pragmatic response . <p> Recently , Minister for Health Leo Varadkar called for the ban to be reduced from a lifelong ban to a 12-month deferral period , whereby a man who had not had sex with a man for a year would be permitted to donate . This is a practice adopted in numerous countries , from Finland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no threat to the safety of the blood supply , especially as all blood which is taken is tested . I posted another letter on the Facebook event page of this year 's Phil blood drive to be forwarded to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service , and have received dozens of messages from my peers adding their names as counter-signatories . <p> Though maintaining a year-long ban is still discrimination , and does n't remove the notion that gay blood is " dirty " and that gay people are contaminated , it is at least a pragmatic response . One can acknowledge the concerns of the IBTS , and this alleviates those concerns , while simultaneously removing some level of discrimination . A healthy , plentiful blood supply is essential , and structural inequalities should n't prevent us from achieving one .

I 'm surprised at how well the book has been received so far ; after working on anything for a good length of time , you begin to wonder if it 's any good at all !

The exhibit allows visitors to see how the original Series I Land Rovers were built back then -- made of war surplus aluminium and square in shape because it was both easy to press the panels like that and because you could stack them in crates more easily for those vital export dollars . <p> Presumably , then , the current Defender is looking across at this exhibit from its modern-day production line , thinking " crikey , they must be expecting me to pop off any day now ...

But for us , the Defender will die , seven decades on from when it was first built . <p> Can you really trace the current Defender right the way back to that 1948 original ? Yes , just about . True -- the Defender as it is today really dates from the late 1970s , when Land Rover gave the Series III a massive update to bring it roaring into the eighties .

It clatters , rattles and roars all to little avail when it comes to performance . The Defender 's relatively trim kerb weight ( all those aluminium panels keep it down to just over two-tonnes ) means that step-off performance is actually quite brisk but it 's leisurely after that and at motorway speeds , it 's very , very noisy .

Same damp , musty smell after you 've been down the fields with it too . <p> And that 's the real catch . Rattly and noisy it may be but the Defender took my brood and I from one end of this country to the other in at least tolerable discomfort .

Eventually my head clears , I remember that I 'm a decent and law-abiding -- even rather boring -- citizen , and the world all seems alright again . Phew . <p> So when I was thinking about the plot of a novel I wanted to write , I forced myself to consider what it would be like to have been involved in a murder many years before , and then what it would be like to live with that dreadful knowledge over decades . <p> At the same time that I was turning over these ( frankly weird ) thoughts in my head , I was also writing a factual book about the Falklands War . It 's called Secrets of the Conqueror , and the story involved a series of real incidents which took place shortly after the war , in some of which I had been tangentially involved . Carrying out the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events and meetings I had attended as long ago as 1984 , and I had to look up and interview some of the other people who had been present at the time . What I found alarming was that , in quite a number of cases , my memory of what had happened was completely at odds with what the other people remembered . Not only did we have a different recall of the main events , but we also had different versions of the order in which things had taken place and of who else was present . Most often I found that people had revised what happened in order to put themselves at the centre of the action ; no doubt doing so had turned the story into a better anecdote over the years . <p> However , my own recall was so bad that on one occasion I asked my main witness about something which had taken place at his wedding , when he replied : " you should know , you were there " . I would have sworn on a stack of Bibles that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph which showed me sitting alongside him at the head table , complete with an unspeakable mullet haircut . Needless to say , I was shocked . <p> I mean , it 's probably not surprising that you ca n't remember an individual meeting or a phone call or even going to dinner with someone 30 years ago . But if you go to a wedding , it 's usually going to take up most of the day and evening , you have to put on your best suit , you have to buy a present . It 's a big thing to have forgotten all about . <p> So anyway , armed with all that , I started to put together a plot about a murder which had taken place three decades earlier , recounted by a narrator whose memory of who did what , when and how , is blurred and distorted by the passage of time . What would happen if you discovered late in life that something you thought you had known and understood for your whole adult life , turned out to be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to say any more , because one of the most gratifying things about the early reaction to The Insect Farm is that few if anybody has managed to guess the end .

The circle was then cast and consecrated by water and fire by some of the druids present . <p> The main part of the ceremony consisted of poems , most of which were written and chosen by Howard himself and a series of blessings . Those present were then invited to offer their own blessings . <p> His wife , Eimear in her eulogy remarked that the only regret that Howard had in life was that he did not get involved in the arts earlier in his life .

Howard worked as a GP in Scotland for 17 years and when he was in his mid-forties he studied psychiatry and came to Kilkenny in 1994 as a consultant to set up the Child and Family Consultation Service .

Tipperary expected a stern , physical test from the Shannonsiders and those in attendance were treated to an exciting game played in near perfect conditions with the result in the balance until the final whistle . Continuing on from her great performance last week , Kate Davey opened the scoring with a point from a free . The next name on the score board was Lara O'Dwyer who gave an outstanding display as she showed exactly why she is one of the most promising underage players in Tipperary . She would finish the game with a personal tally of 1-5 , all of which came from play .

In the tenth minute of the half , Jean Kelly scored a wonderful goal and following the Limerick kick-out , Tipperary gained possession and Lara O'Dwyer scored a point . These two scores proved to be pivotal in deciding the overall result of the game as Limerick were always trying to claw back this deficit . A further two points from Lara O'Dwyer would keep Tipperary ahead going into the closing stages . Tipperary had to play the final minutes with 14 players as they had a player sin-binned but the defence showed great resilience to keep out the Limerick girls . Kirsty Crotty Ryan , who replaced the injured Kate Davey , kicked the insurance point as Tipperary recorded their second victory in this year 's championship .

But it 's not the Guitar Hero you knew from five years ago ; Activision and developer FreeStyle Games have taken the concept and turned it around -- specifically , to face an audience rather than cartoon bandmates . And the stage , this time , is real . <p> Guitar Hero Live is an ambitious project . A real crowd and a real band makes it a very different experience to Guitar Hero of old . <p> FreeStyle Games ' creative director Jamie Jackson says the decision to resurrect the game was a considered one . <p> " When Activision put the game on ice , they always wanted to bring it back , as long as there was true real innovation in the game , " he says .

" Not many people pay that much attention to it . So we thought we could use that to draw you in even more , putting you on stage with screaming fans in front of you . That 's how it started and it just snowballed . " <p> The live action was shot with robot cameras that could be programmed to capture the same shots with both positive and negative reactions .

" The most important mark to hit was those of your other band mates . The crowd ... they do n't tend to move around much anyway , the drummer was relatively straightforward .

But that poster and others like it came within half of 1pc of defeating the divorce proposal a second time . <p> Yes , the poster was primitive - it whispered to women : " Vote No or he 'll leave you .

But it reflected something in the underlying economic and social relations between women and men at that time - and it stirred fears , and it worked . <p> Twenty years later , people are comfortable with divorce - we know it does n't break up marriages , it 's a means of formally ending a relationship that is irretrievably broken . <p> Today , the anti-equality posters are more sophisticated .

Tommy O'Reilly was found tight to the corner of the pitch , but the livewire forward spotted Gareth Dunne breaking at pace and Dunne met O'Reilly 's inch perfect pass with his fist and drove it to the net .

Breaffy were forced into a change when cornerback Darragh Morrin was shown a black card and then they also lost Liam Irwin within minutes of his introduction from the bench to a leg injury . Ray O'Malley cut the gap to four points with a well taken score , then Aidan Walsh reeled it back into just three points with six minutes left on the clock . Five minutes from time , Breaffy were reduced to 14 players when Robbie Fadden picked up a second yellow card as the momentum seemed to have swung towards the Mitchels .

@@3224238 <h> All-French final against stage fright-prone Clermont hardly keeps us up at night , but for some it can be a dream ending , writes Eddie Butler <p> A dream final tends to depend on the head in which it forms . An all-French final at Twickenham next Saturday is n't , for example , going to make many in Ireland purr in their sleep . But even in France , they are not sure that Clermont-Toulon is the best way to launch the new order of European rugby . It 's not exactly keeping them awake at night - some dream , that - but it 's niggling them a bit . <p> Well , some of them . The swathe of France covered by the Auvergne and the Var will be thinking only beautiful thoughts , that this final could not be better . But if it is for them the dream final , it does n't seem to be the dream ticket , as in a travel voucher to England . The finest club players in Europe could be rattling around a third-full Twickenham . The date in early May was set by the French so that their Top 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run uninterrupted to its conclusion . <p> The lack of allure to the Champions Cup final can be seen in Wales , where it has quickly been pointed out that Judgment Day III , the very all-Welsh double-header of derbies , will be better attended than the Twickenham final . This boast is a slight case of urchins writing graffiti on the wall of the estate in which they can not set foot , but it will continue in every part of Europe - everywhere that is n't England and France - that fought and lost the Battle of Shifting Letters , where ERC became EPRC . <p> So , there is maybe a need for a charm offensive by the new masters , which is unlikely given the character of Mourad Boudjellal , the owner of Toulon . It is hardly his fault , he will argue , if his team stand on the verge of a third title . And does anyone think that Clermont Auvergne are going to overcome their historical inability to win a big prize by being charming ? <p> Perhaps , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that score it stands a better chance of delivering , even if the reality of modern French club rugby is far removed from anything dreamy .

If you like your meetings between second-rows to be jarring , then this could be for you . <p> Just as the old Springbok Bakkies is heading ( post-match ) into retirement , so , too , is the old All Black , Ali Williams , who should have brought a touch of elegance to the Toulon second-row , but who seems to have reached into the Bakkies bag of tricks in his dotage . A little tug on the shirt off the ball in the quarter-final against Wasps , a yellow card in the semi against Leinster . It 's not easy to imagine Mourad telling Ali to go out waltzing , but it might be soothing for the lock to revert to being the good cop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brighten any game and he may be seriously in the mood for this one . For the players , this is an occasion not to miss . As Leigh Halfpenny and Jonathan Davies have said from their respective camps , this is why they left Wales for Toulon and Clermont . <p> There is an added incentive for Giteau to show what Australia have been missing in recent years . A pathway has been opened into their World Cup squad by the relaxation of the rule that excludes their exiles . Giteau may not be Jonny Wilkinson with his place-kicking , but he has been perhaps the biggest all-round contributor of all the myriad imports to France 's club culture . <p> Of equal influence in the semi-final against Saracens was another Australian , Brock James . He lacks the running menace of Giteau , but conducted the Clermont effort with authority , kicking with variety and accuracy . His chip for Wesley Fofana 's try was expertly weighted .

There were a lot of very painful memories that would have to be relived : Kari 's search for answers , the abandonment by her birth mother , being an orphan in the world and all the feelings that go with trying to come to terms with being part of a history you have not chosen .

" <p> While Jimmy Nugent and Dennis McMonagle are well known locally for the amount of marathons they have taken part in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative newcomers to the marathon scene , but have still managed to clock up almost 100 marathons between them . <p> Norman explained : " I bent over in work one night , out of breath , and I decided I had to do something about it . Walking was n't doing anything so I took up running . In July 2013 I did my first 10k and that was it . It 's the buzz , it 's really addictive . " <p> Since then he has run 14 marathons and said if he does n't getting out running in a couple of days , it will bother him . <p> Jimmy Kelly said he had always been into running and two years ago while in Lebanon he was training for his first marathon when he injured himself on his last training run and was unable to do it . Instead he ran his first marathon in Dublin in October 2013 and has since completed 30 marathons . <p> Claire Connaughton , who is the driving force behind this particular trip , said : " I ran the Connemara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I ran my 25th marathon in Connemara and this year I ran my 50th marathon in Paris , exactly two years to the day later .

" <p> His older brother Freddie was a gym fan , but Hector was n't convinced at first . <p> " There were no gyms in Ireland in the 1980s , " he jokes . " Then one opened in Navan and I remember looking out the window to see Freddie heading off to it with his sports kit in a plastic shopping bag . " <p> It was n't until five years ago that he began to see the appeal .

" <p> It was Freddie who inspired him to open his own studio , and the template was Galway City Gym , where he loves the " no bullshit " atmosphere . <p> He goes there for three 90 minute sessions a week , where he alternates the body parts he works on . <p> He does two body parts in each visit , so for example , he might target shoulders and abs one day and thighs and glutes the next . <p> Routine is part of the appeal - he always goes at the same time and he trains alongside another gym member and friend , which he says makes him enjoy it more . <p> Along with the commitment to exercise , Hector is also a healthy eater .

" <h> Hector 's top tips : What he has learned from getting fit <p> Always wash your gym gear : you ca n't get two wears out of them . You just ca n't . <p> Likewise - have a shower before you workout . And have a shower straight after a session or you 'll get a spotty back . It takes two minutes , there 's no excuse . <p> Stop convincing yourself you do n't have time for the gym - everyone can find the time somehow . It can be as little as 45 minutes three times a week . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sneaky session if you find the time on a Sunday - that way , you 're ahead of yourself going into the next week of training . Get another one in on the Monday and you 're two down already . Yes ! <p> Similarly , you know you 've got it bad when you always have gym gear in the back of the car . Just in case . <p> To avoid disappointment , always check out the gym in a hotel before you book the place on the strength of it . Otherwise you 'll find yourself in a room with a deflated gym ball , a set of 5kg weights , a rattly running machine and a water font with no cups . <p> Do n't EVER leave a protein shake in the car boot for a weekend . Otherwise you will open it to a stench that would knock out an entire nation .

When you have a " wingman " at your side to help highlight your accomplishments at networking events , it can give you the confidence you need to approach others and break into conversations . Additionally , your friend likely knows people in the room that you do n't , and vice-versa , so you can trade " warm introductions " and connect with new people . Just avoid the temptation to use your friend as a crutch and spend the evening talking with them . That defeats the purpose of the whole enterprise . <p> -- Have a few opening lines ready .

Finally , it 's easier to talk to someone if they do n't feel like a stranger .

" When we were going well in the ' 80s all you heard from Cavan people was their glory years . " Photograph : Billy Stickland/Inpho <p> Even allowing for the usual vagaries , the 1995 Ulster Championship was a spin-the-wheel job . Down came into it as All-Ireland champions and were finished for the year before May was out . Derry were favourites for Sam until they fell to 13-man Tyrone . Having beaten Down by six points -- and instantly become All-Ireland favourites themselves -- Donegal melted next day out to a hiding from Monaghan . Anarchy went into bat and took guard for a long , untroubled innings . <p> Heading into the Ulster semi-final against Cavan , therefore , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about the possibility of a Cavan ambush . The problem was getting someone to listen . <p> The pupil-popping high of beating Donegal got mixed in with the fact that Cavan had n't beaten them in their last four attempts -- the longest streak of Monaghan dominance over their neighbours since the 1920s . As Cavan goalkeeper Paul O'Dowd remarked with pure glee afterwards , " Monaghan thought they were in the All-Ireland final " . <h> Harooing crowd <p> The rest barely needs writing . Monaghan kicked nine wides to Cavan 's one . O'Dowd saved a penalty . Fintan Cahill scored 1-2 for Cavan to seal only his second championship win in eight seasons . His first had come three weeks earlier against Antrim . <p> Soundtracked by what Se ? n Moran called " a great harooing crowd of Cavan people " , the underdogs bit and tore Monaghan 's year to chunks . That they went on to lose the Ulster final is probably worth a mention . But you would n't want to overstate it either . <p> " A member of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman from Cross-Mullagh , ran into me the Sunday after we lost the Ulster final . He met me coming out of the chapel after Mass and took me by the elbow . ' Do n't have a long face on you , young Cahill , ' he said . ' It was a good summer . We got the hay in and them f**kers from Monaghan was bet . ' " <p> In the pantheon of great GAA rivalries , Cavan and Monaghan would n't be minded to make any grand claims for theirs . Mostly , that 's because their interest in what the outside world makes of the occasional skirmish between them would be limited in the extreme . They have n't met in an Ulster final since 1952 and for most of the intervening period , they 've been two bald men fighting over a comb . But Homer made The Iliad from such a local row . <p> Cavan and Monaghan hold the record for the number of draws between two counties in championship football . They 've met 54 times -- 27 wins for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , Cork and Kerry hold the record for matches played at 111 but have only finished level 11 times . <p> That said , numbers do n't reveal very much of anything about the flavour of the rivalry . It 's more dug into the land than scrawled onto scoreboards . Denis Carolan 's History of Monaghan 1660-1860 refers to intercounty football matches going back to the late 1700s . " Large crowds attended and great excitement prevailed over the district affected , " Carolan wrote . " These games were very coarsely played and many permanent injuries were received at them . " <p> Plus ? a change , as they say out around Shercock and Carrick . For as long as there has been football , there has been enmity between the counties . Maghera ( Cavan ) beat Inniskeen ( Monaghan ) in the first Ulster final in 1888 , although it took three games to find a winner , the first of them scoreless . Though the GAA in Ulster first took root in Cavan , it was a pair of Monaghan administrators -- Eoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1910s . <h> Invited a Nazi <p> O'Duffy would become a hugely controversial figure in later life as a Fine Gael TD , a self-promoting fascist and ally of General Franco , not to mention the man who invited a Nazi to the 1940 All-Ireland final . In Cavan though , they 'd regard all that as minor stuff . Far more pertinent was the stroke he pulled -- or tried to pull -- after the replayed 1915 Ulster final . <p> Cavan beat Monaghan in Clones by a point but a Monaghan goal was apparently disallowed by Cavan umpires . On top of that , Monaghan supporters were in high dudgeon afterwards about the encroachment of Cavan fans onto the pitch while Monaghan had the ball . O'Duffy , who was Ulster secretary at the time , demanded the result be overturned at the next meeting of the Ulster Council . <p> The Cavan delegates , not unreasonably , told him what he could do with his demands and refused to send anyone to the meeting . They did n't bargain on Whelan , in his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title to Monaghan . The brazenness of the stroke from the two Monaghan men earned them a rebuke from Central Council , who overruled them and declared Cavan champions . <p> The row very nearly had far-reaching consequences . Cavan wanted the two Monaghan men kicked out of the Ulster Council on account of their rank and obvious bias but O'Duffy and Whelan dug in and kept their posts . So enraged were Cavan by this that they tried to break away and set up a fifth GAA province . <p> They invited Meath , Louth , Westmeath and Longford to join them and proposed to call it Tara . It did n't fly in the end but it 's as close as the GAA has come to genuine structural change in all of its 131 years . All because Cavan and Monaghan could n't play nice . <p> On the pitch , they were peers for a while in those early days but from the 1930s onwards , Cavan soon put clear water between them . Monaghan did n't win a single game against their neighbours between 1932 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All-Irelands . Monaghan , by piffling contrast , have been in one All-Ireland final ever . It gets mentioned . <p> " The goading is relentless , " says Nudie Hughes . " When we were going well in the ' 80s and winning a first Ulster title for 41 years , all you heard from Cavan people was their glory years . You 're never let forget it . You 're standing up one end of the pitch waiting on the ball to come down to you and all you 're hearing is , ' How many All-Irelands have you ? ' <p> " This was from boys who were n't even born when Cavan were winning All-Irelands . They might n't even have been born the last time they won Ulster . But that glory years stuff is in their DNA . Those Cavan people will always have that over Monaghan people until Monaghan win an All-Ireland . Even though it 's all past tense , their ancestors have five All-Irelands and that 's the beginning and end of all conversations as far as they 're concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1924 , the Monaghan crowd rushed the press table and knocked it flying . In 1958 , supporters from both sides chased the referee into the dressing room after a drawn replay , causing him to cancel extra-time and order up a third match to separate the sides . Games in the ' 80s and ' 90s broiled with tension and stray boots and elbows . <h> Physically marked <p> " It was tasty stuff , " says Hughes . " You needed your reflexes . I used to tell fellas going into those games to be ready to dance on hot fires and get your head down quick ! Eugene Kearns marked me in ' 87 -- as in marked me , physically marked me . The umpires had strong sunshades on that day in Breffni . They saw nothing .

Players like Declan Loughman would absolutely eat you without salt . You got tough or you got killed . " <p> If the quality was never overly high , the ache for a result was constant . Monaghan arrived in Breffni Park in 1987 considered as one of the five best teams in the country only to lose by a couple of points . Hughes nearly got trampled in the rush of supporters onto the pitch afterwards . <p> A year later , he was carried shoulder high from the pitch in Clones as they finally ended a 66-year wait for a victory against them . Shoulder high after an Ulster first-round match on May 22nd . Madness . <p> " That 's what it meant to beat your neighbour , " he says .

The fact that anyone in the hospital can tune into or happen upon the game brings the stories to the larger hospital population . <p> The project is part of Cloudlands , an artist-in-residence programme led by Helium , the children 's arts and health organisation . The radio game uses answering machine technology similar to that experienced by people when they phone a government department . Participants make choices using their keypads and opt for different paths to follow . The teenagers ' stories have been woven into a narrative by N ? methi and will be recorded by professional voice actors , with sound designer Carl Kennedy and Tom Swift of the Performance Corporation part of the creative team . Participants who dial in will become the heroes of the story and decide how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past seven months with about 20 teen patients at CUH aged between 11 and 16 . " There 's not really a space for teens in the hospital so I go to their bedside . It 's challenging -- teens do n't really want to invest in anything to do with the hospital . It takes a lot of chatting and getting to know before we can get involved in making art or stories . " <p> When it comes to preferred art-forms , most teens like making games , says N ? methi . " This can involve animation , adventure . They like making things that are real . One patient -- with CF and in isolation -- made a giant Connect 4 board game on her window , so she could play with other people through the window . " <p> N ? methi also worked with an 11-year-old boy , who devised an elaborate game about a medical land ruled by a kindly penguin king . " A virus attacks the land , stealing the puffin 's siblings . The puffin rescues them with help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladybird and Seahorse are CUH children 's wards . The main enemy is the evil doctor -- in fact the kindly king who has been turned nasty by the virus . The virus is defeated , the puffins rescued and the penguin king returned . " <p> The story was a platform computer game with special skills , weapons and levels , says N ? methi , who says such creations provide distraction and empowerment for young patients . " They see it being taken seriously -- the final radio game is a mix of elements from different teenagers ' stories . " <p> And it 's significant that the 11-year-old 's story was about beating a virus . " It 's dealing with what is going on hospitals , illness . I love encountering these stories . I can see something processing within the patient , " says N ? methi . <p> Edelle Nolan , CUH arts coordinator , says the Cloudlands project connects teens , who are unwell , with other teenagers in hospital . " The radio game is made up of all of their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contributed to . Teenagers hate being different to their peers -- they might n't even know other teens are in hospital . Cloudlands provides a way of bringing up this conversation -- normalising it so they do n't feel isolated . " <p> * Radio/Silence will be broadcast on CUH radio on May 29 . A podcast will be available at www.helium.ie <p> Art of recovery <p> * Teenagers attending paediatric hospitals and units are typically aged up to 16 years . They account for only 25% of hospital admissions , but , according to Children in Hospital , they 're the paediatric group with the highest percentage of chronic illness -- and , therefore , have the highest rate of repeat admissions and longer stays . How can participation in the arts help health ? <p> * According to Edelle Nolan , CUH arts coordinator , creativity aids relaxation -- when engaged in creative pursuits , the brain predominately uses Alpha waves . " These aid relaxation -- the optimum state for recovery from illness . The arts also offer distraction from illness , which helps to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that children and teens with chronic illness , who spend long periods in hospital , can present with depression , and other mental-health issues , as adults . But if the hospital experience had been ' normalised ' -- for example , the teen can attend school or participate in an arts programme -- this had a preventive , beneficial effect . <p> * A US study looked at the effect of having art in patients ' bedrooms , post heart surgery . " In every case , where landscapes were used , patients needed less medication and less time to recover , " says Nolan , who says that the landscapes had to be soothing and familiar , rather than abstract or dramatic .

I go about my life with the permanent assumption that my body really is n't capable of much . This is confirmed by just about everyone I encounter . People do n't usually look at short , unathletic-looking women and have any expectation of athletic prowess .

After 90 squats , the floor looks like an awfully tempting resting place , and a pool of tears a cosy pillow .

He has come to the fore with Southampton , a late developer who is now 31 . <p> John Terry <p> ( Chelsea ) <p> Another solid 38 games . He gets a lot of protection from Nemanja Matic but there is no questioning his importance to Chelsea . His experience helped get them over the line . <p> Ryan Bertrand <p> ( Southampton ) <p> He just beats Cesar Azpilicueta . The Chelsea man is an excellent defender . Bertrand gets in ahead by virtue of his attacking ability and the fact that he 's left-footed . <p> David Silva <p> ( Manchester City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanchez has done in his first season .

He made a difficult skill look very easy . <p> 3 Charlie Adam <p> ( v Chelsea , April 4 ) <p> Some have said it was just a big hit , but first of all you need the confidence to try it , then the technique and , thirdly , the awareness to recognise that Thibaut Courtois tends to sweep up and stray quite far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Koeman <p> I know that Jose Mourinho should win this by default , but bear with me . <p> Clearly , Mourinho is a great manager and he has won the biggest prize of all , the league title , but a couple of things I feel just tip the balance against him . <p> First , we are talking about a club with huge resources to buy players , and one that has been buying players on the ? 2530m mark for a number of years . Secondly , one of the biggest disappointments of the season was Chelsea 's performance against PSG in the Champions League . They never attacked the tie in the way a club of their ambition should have done . <p> Either way , I felt that Koeman built so well from such a difficult start .

All of them seemed to adapt well to the Premier League very quickly . The manager has to take a lot of the credit for getting them settled so soon and then maintaining the momentum . <p> As well as Koeman , I would give great credit to Mark Hughes , who achieved a ninth-place finish on the fraction of the budget of other clubs at Stoke City . I also think Mauricio Pochettino has done a good job with very little chance to change his squad . <p> Breakthrough player <p> Harry Kane <p> It has to be Kane for forcing his way into the Tottenham team , staying there and scoring so many goals along the way .

I am sure that he knows Next season will be difficult for him but there is no reason he can not make progress again . <p> I see him as a No 9 , a classic centre-forward . I do n't think he is a No 10 in the Teddy Sheringham mould . Sheringham would link the play but that is not Kane 's game . <p> If there is one thing that makes me hesitate then it is the lack of pace that might hold him back . <p> He is sharp and alert but as a No 9 you need that burst of pace that can take you away from defenders . <p> Kane is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard .

I accept he has had problems off the pitch settling into life in Manchester , but there is no way he can see the season as anything other than a disappointment . This was , after all , the best player in last season 's Champions League final . Nevertheless , the quality is there and I do n't think United can afford to lose him . They need that kind of player if they are to compete at the highest level in the Champions League .

@@3330236 <h> FDA panel backs ' Viagra for women ' after two rejections and a controversial lobbying campaign <p> A US federal advisory panel recommended approval of what would become the first drug to treat a lack of sexual desire in women after an intense lobbying campaign .

@@3358239 <h> Concession of costly goals will continute until exposed full back line are better protected <p> Mayo 's defensive shortcomings were exposed by the manner of Gary Sice 's goal for Galway on Sunday at Pearse Stadium . Photograph : Cathal Noonan/Inpho <p> Donegal 's Michael Murphy proved a typically towering presence during the comprehensive defeat of an Armagh team which seemed to lack belief at the Athletic Grounds . Photograph : Andrew Paton/Presseye/Inpho <p> One of the tantalising questions of every recent All-Ireland championship has also been one of the hardest to answer : can Mayo win the All-Ireland ? <p> On Sunday , I felt we saw a new and compelling reason as to why they can . But I also felt we saw the reason why they may perish by the same sword unless they adjust their defensive strategy between now and September . <p> For me , placing Aidan O'Shea in at full forward answered many of the questions that been asked about the Mayo attack . With Cillian O'Connor playing alongside him , Mayo have a top-class inside forward line in terms of ball-winning capability , free-taking , an obvious point of attack and options from both the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run onto . <h> Second Captains <p> If you bring Aidan out to centre-half for kick-outs , he becomes an option along with the brother , Barry Moran and Tom Parsons . His presence gives the Mayo attack a balance . He is not a typical marquee forward in terms of scoring prowess but in stature , size and skill level and , critically , in his leadership he is all that and he brings a shape to their attack . <p> In doing so , he will cause sufficient distraction for space to open up for his team-mates . In addition , Diarmuid O'Connor is big and hard-working . When Mark Ronaldson came on , apart from a bad decision to shoot rather than slip S ? amus O'Shea through the middle in his first possession , he did n't put a foot wrong thereafter and that too is a positive . <p> So if Mayo persist with O'Shea as a target and choose to move him in and out -- much like Donegal do with Michael Murphy -- it gives the team a very strong offensive threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with him -- therefore freeing other people up . <p> Mayo 's attitude is so strong . They went into Salthill with a very strong mindset . Even in their post-match interviews , they were controlled and focused and they just know what they are about . They are very experienced . <h> Concede goals <p> So what is going to hold them back ? <p> Mayo need to bite the bullet and sort out their defence . I do n't believe they can continue to leave their full backs hanging out to dry if they want to win an All-Ireland . Mayo have to get to the point where they do n't concede goals . <p> It is not about personnel : it does n't matter if it is Ger Cafferkey or Tom Cunniffe or Kevin Keane or Keith Higgins on a smaller player we are talking about . When you watch Mayo play , with the defensive system they have in place , you always feel it is inevitable that sooner or later a goal is going to come . <p> Mayo are very strong on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a point of attack and they are a mature team . They have almost all of the required qualities to go all the way . <p> But if you ask me are they going to win the All-Ireland as they are set up now : I think they will come close but will probably perish on the same sword that has caused them so much devastation in recent years . Goals conceded will be their undoing . <p> But it does n't have to be that way and if they make a minor concession in their approach they can make it much more difficult for opposition teams . <p> Their man-to-man system works extremely well high up the field when they press and in the middle third of the field . But once the ball goes deep , I do n't see that ruthless , relentless hunger among the middle-third players to get back and help out the full backs . <p> It absolutely astounded me to see Galway attacking and three or four Mayo men sticking to their own men while the ball travelled past them towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final third , I feel they must become ruthless and single-minded in the protection of their goal . They need two or three men programmed to help their full backs once that happens . <p> You do n't have to go extreme . You can still leave three or four men up . But for the Galway goal , I just saw a three-on-three situation inside the 45 . That wo n't work against the very top teams . It comes down to a one-on-one scenario for attacking players every single time . Any defender in Ireland would struggle in Mayo 's full-back line because of the lack of support . <p> At the moment , you can almost foresee what will happen . If you have 40 or 45 scoring chances like Dublin , for instance , often do and it is three v three or two v two , then what is the end result going to be ? <p> For me , it is a numbers game . A defender can defend brilliantly 19 times but on the 20th , the ball ends up in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwards like Bernard Brogan , Michael Murphy , Colm Cooper and company . <p> Changing that does n't require Mayo to abandon their football philosophy . But if you were facing a Mayo team , with the fitness level , the strength , the age profile , the mentality and experience they have , which had also developed a reputation for not conceding goals , then as a manager you would know you have a serious job on your hands to try to beat them . <p> Mayo should n't have a problem in making that adjustment . It would n't be a betrayal of their football beliefs . Every time a question has been asked of Kerry , they swallowed their pride and went in a different direction . They did it with Tyrone . They did it with us in Donegal . The bottom line for Kerry is winning the All-Ireland and they adapt as they must to do so . <h> Little detail <p> The big question for Mayo is : if you really , really want to win it then why not eliminate the chances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a converted wing back in Kevin McLoughlin who has a marvellous work rate . Why not deploy that ? <p> That little detail would put them in a bracket where they have a very strong chance . We all know that they have been really close in the last few years . But have they ? Bernard Brogan 's goal in the 2013 final : over the course of 70 minutes , based on the numbers , was that not inevitable ? <p> So I feel this is a critical issue for Mayo because the weekend games confirmed the provincial champions are in the position they expected to be as the championship goes through its sorting process . <p> Donegal are in a position now where they will try to improve by a further five per cent in each of their performances and I can see them doing that . It was a very classy execution of their game plan in Armagh . <p> Michael Murphy was obviously a towering figure . People talk about Michael on the edge of the square but there is nobody better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 metres and when you have an excellent forward like Patrick McBrearty in there , it can cause damage . <p> Because Michael is a natural full forward , he knows the type of ball that player wants . Paddy McGrath closed out Jamie Clarke completely and the Armagh attack struggled as a result . Karl Lacey brought his form from the Tyrone match into the Athletic Grounds and proved again how important he is to Donegal . He got on a lot of ball and I do n't recall him making a single mistake . <h> Key figure <p> Within an excellent team performance , Odhr ? n MacNiallais was outstanding in his athleticism and decision-making and in the switching of the direction and emphasis of play . He is a very fine footballer and emerging as a key figure for Donegal . <p> But Armagh mystified me . Both Galway and Armagh lost on Sunday but there are ways to lose . I liked everything about Galway 's approach . They refused to be intimidated and had a cut and worked some terrific scores . They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning knowing they had given everything and probably feeling they had closed the gap on Mayo . You can feel at peace with yourself when you lose in those circumstances . <p> My hunch is the Armagh players will feel very differently because they know they offered no resistance . They essentially prepared for this match for nine or 10 months . Kieran McGeeney spoke last week about physicality and how the Kerry-Mayo semi-final was the best game of the year -- even though it was officiated to a level where anything was let go . <p> It made me think it was going to be a war in Armagh . But the opposite was true . Nothing happened . There was zero pressure on Donegal . Karl and Neil Gallagher and Michael got on ball and threaded passes through without a hand raised or a shoulder put in . There was so little tackling or turnovers . So what happened ? For me , one of two things : either the management got it badly wrong or the players let them down very badly . <p> The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could win the game ? I am not so sure . Armagh lost by nine points . Donegal were beaten by10 points four years ago in Crossmaglen and maybe for the same reason . <p> Belief is a big factor when it comes to winning . The top teams acquire that . Mayo are still clearly pulsing with belief . The importance of that ca n't be underestimated . I feel that if they are willing to take steps to eliminate the factor that has repeatedly tripped them up in recent years , then they increase their chances of squeezing the race for the All-Ireland much more in their favour . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .

@@3361233 <p> What 's Granddad* babbling on about ? Do n't worry children , he 's just having a flashback to his youth thanks to a one-off episode of TFI Friday ( Channel 4 ) . <p> Who knows what a man from 1996 makes of the world today with its phone " apps " and fauxronic moustaches and Islamic terror and Kanye West ? If he could text or Instagram or Snapchat or Periscope , he could tell you . Sadly he can not text or Instagram or Snapchat or Periscope and using all those words as verbs freaks him out . " Am I having a stroke ? " he screams regularly . <p> " Silly Granddad , " you think . But the revived TFI Friday should help you understand him better . <p> Ah , the mid 1990s . The distant past . Picture it : see Granddad 's tribe wandering across the land bridge chasing mammoth and using the Alta Vista search engine . Communism was dead , western wealth and dominance was uncontested . These were " post-political " times , so the biggest conflict was , confusingly , that between impaired vision and a renewable desert water source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social media and reality television . It was the End of History . <p> All they needed , really , was a messiah . <p> And yea , a ginger , bucktoothed manbaby arose in the East . His name was Chris Evans . He realised that what this infantilised , booze-addled , financially fortunate generation needed was an updated version of the children 's programmes of the 1980s . <p> These programmes privileged smug self-awareness over insight and confused loudness with excitement . Nonetheless , they were hugely popular because Granddad 's generation are the worst . Eventually , Evans 's ego exploded in public and he slunk from view with his teen bride Billie Piper . Then 9/11 happened ( I 'm not necessarily saying these things are connected ) . And we forgot about Chris Evans , presuming him a myth : a tale told to frighten children . <p> Until one evening in 2015 he suddenly appeared on a one-off " final " TFI Friday ( I know he 's on The One Show , but Granddad does n't watch The One Show ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he probably ages backwards like Benjamin Button or Miriam O'Callaghan ) . The musical acts are the same . Blur play Coffee and TV . Liam Gallagher and fellow Oasis alumnus Bonehead ( a respectable Christian name in the 1990s ) perform with Roger Daltrey . " I hope I die before I get old , " they sing , which is , at their age , like crawling around the stage squawking : " Kill me ! " <p> There are retreads of old items where members of the public perform freakish activities ( Freak or Unique ) thus presenting harbingers of a coming apocalypse ( twins sway ominously , a girl weeps milk ) . We also meet several ex-babies ( people who were on the programme as children ) and experience Evans 's trademark behind-the-scenes footling and audience interaction . Jaded starlet Amanda Seyfried appears and is fake interviewed by redundant Jedi Ewan McGregor . She has huge eyes and an oval head and is clearly bored by our Earth ways . <p> There are further celebrity non-interviews with Ricky Wilson , Rita Ora , Kirstie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . Shaun Ryder even has tape across his mouth . Then brum-brum-driver Lewis Hamilton is allowed talk for 10 minutes about meetings he has attended . <p> Top dog again This is probably because , as has just been revealed , Chris Evans is going to host Top Gear . He even drives a car with haunted shadow man Jeremy Clarkson . When Clarkson 's dead eyes meet Evans 's dead eyes you need to adjust the ennui-setting on your flatscreen . <p> Still , without Evans , the big silly pranks of Top Gear would never have happened , nor would the celebrity good-sportsmanship of Graham Norton . And you could argue that Evans 's " behind-the-scenes " shenanigans and courtship of random attention-seekers paved the way for reality TV . <p> In a way , Chris Evans is responsible for the television ecosystem of today . " Look , " his smug orange head seems to be saying . " It was me . It was me who destroyed culture . " " I hate you so much Chris Evans , " screams Granddad . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idle If you feel that Granddad 's generation is obsessed with nostalgia , Channel 4 donated much of Monday evening to being nostalgic about Made in Chelsea : a programme that started all the way back in 2011 and has now reached 100 episodes . <p> What would a person from 2011 make of the world today ? In 2011 , the human race had invented the wheel and was using the iPhone 4s . But the world was still young and Sexy and I Know It was in the charts . <p> Now , in 2015 , we 're tired . We have the iPhone 6 and fire and Uptown Funk but the old Made in Chelsea joke is n't funny any more . And while we can laugh as toffs named Binky , La La and Po do dog yoga and throw wine at one another , at the end of the day , they 're still rich and idle , and we still snark emptily at our televisions . <p> This is driven home this week , at several points . First , when Jamie ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " now in Ghana building a gold mine " . And second , when resident cad and philosophiser king Spencer ( emplumpened Russell Brand ) drunkenly murmurs : " I was thinking how funny it would be to purchase an owl and write a little note and clip it to its talon , that says ' I belong to Spencer Matthews ' and see if it 's ever returned to me . " <p> That would be funny , I think bitterly , if it did n't sound like something Spencer might actually do . YEAH , IT WOULD BE SO GODDAMNED FUNNY .

Next Friday , 18,000 fanatical devotees of the band will cue in their droves down Military Road in Dublin to see them play Royal Hospital Kilmainham . ) They are four forthrightly funny -- even scurrilous , often at their own expense -- young men . They tell their tale of how it all started with mischievous smiles on their faces . Theirs is a story as much of Irish youth as anything else . " I used to walk home from school with Steve and he used to slag my mam 's car , " remembers Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> Share <h> Share <h> Share <h> Share <p> Mark : " And every day we got to my house , he 'd slag the car . I was like , ' What the fuck is going on with this guy ? ' So we went to the Gaeltacht together . " <p> " The first place we went to , we were n't allowed sing in English , " interjects Steve , " So that was really difficult . So we wrote a song in Irish . " <p> " We really started because there was a Battle of the Bands in our school which we were organising as part of transition year , " continues Steve . " There were no gigs when we 15 , 16 in Swords . So we decided to hold a Battle of the Bands . Everybody in the school heard and said -- ' Hey ! We better start a band ! ' <p> " We just stayed together for the love of it . I remember when I was 15 ... actually one of our mates who is standing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing by the grand piano in Windmill Lane studios in Ringsend , " acted as our manager but he was only 15 too . He would get us as much gigs as possible in girls ' schools . <p> Mark : " Because he liked girls ! " <p> Steve : " So did we ! " <p> " We played in the school hall and it was full of people , " Steve continues , " And if you won you got a chance to record . " <p> " So we completely fixed the whole thing , " jokes Mark . <p> What was their first performance like ? <p> One woman took me aside and said : ' Do n't take this personal but you have such a depressing sound -- you should n't sing ' <p> " I 'd say it was awful , " answers Steve . " I remember we played a talent competition in St Margaret 's and we lost . It was pretty heartbreaking . But at the time we were like ' Why did n't we win ? ' We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . But we were terrible ! " laughs Steve . " So ! " <p> " When you do gigs at that level when you are just starting out , " says Mark , " it is such a big event . " <p> Steve : " Playing in the local community centre is the most important day of your life . " ( Today , Kodaline performed a mesmerizing rendition of Michael Jackson 's Billie Jean -- with Stevie wonder sic constructing a funky fresh new melody at the piano -- for the Windmill Lane Sessions on Independent.ie . ) <p> Vinny can remember the group rehearsing at his parents ' house every weekend . " Drummers ' parents are the most lenient . It 's like you already make a lot of noise , so what 's a little bit more ! " <p> Playing Kilmainham is just like a dream come true I suppose <p> Mark : " What 's a bit of melody , hah ? " <p> Steve : " Me and mark are from River Valley , and you could actually hear Vinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley and Vinny 's house is on the other side of the valley . You would just hear drums like super , super loud . That was 7 years max ago ! " <p> Steve has grim memories of playing Gilbert &amp; Wright bar in Swords one night . " I remember playing High Hopes , which is our biggest song here , and drunken people coming up to me and shouting at me : ' Wooah , that 's crap . ' I remember one woman took me aside and said : ' Do n't take this personal but you have such a depressing sound -- you should n't sing . ' " <p> " It was my mam ! " jokes Mark . <p> " It was so weird , I was trying to play some of our own songs and people would be shouting for Sweet Home Alabama . But to go from that a couple of years ago to playing to Kilmainham is absolutely incredible . It 's just like a dream come true I suppose . " <p> The primary reason why this has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with Sony , a sublime new album Coming Up For Air -- is because of the integrity of their music . <p> As Steve told Rolling Stone : " It 's important to stay true to yourself . Do n't waste your life trying to be someone else ... If you have a skeleton in your closet , you may as well make it dance . " <p> Steve learned how to make the skeleton in his closet dance listening obsessively to one song as a young teen growing up in Swords . It was n't by Westlife . It was by Jackson Browne . " I grew up on The Pretender . It is a song that has always been around , " Steve says quoting the lyric : ' I 'm going to be a happy idiot/Caught between the longing for love/And the struggle for the legal tender ' . " Everyone is searching for love and everybody needs money , " explains Steve . " So it is such universal thing . I just love Jackson Browne . Mark probably hates Jackson Browne . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mark . <p> " I love the Eagles and I only found out recently that he wrote that massive Eagles ' tune Take It Easy , " says Mark . " So I have respect for Jackson Browne . He 's a great writer ! Not that he needs respect from me -- he is one of the best writers of all time ! " <p> Steve can recall being back in his bedroom as a teenager writing his first song . " Me and Mark used to spend ... you know , there was a good two years where we did just nothing . Everybody thought we were wasters . " <p> " We kind of are ! " laughs Mark . " We 're just chancers now -- different title . Kilmaimham for us really is the first time we 've had to put on a big outdoor show in Ireland , " continues Mark , " which is what all our summers were about when we were growing up . " <p> The Jewish poet Paul Celan described his poems as spiritual paths " for projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homecoming . " Kodaline at their masterful best do that in their songs ( like Human Again , High Hopes , Give Me A Minute , Love Will Set You Free , Honest . ) And , yes , playing Kilmainham is a kind of homecoming , for the band and for 18,000 fans . Cue guitars -- Mark Prendergast 's post-modern Edge whirr ... <p> Kodaline will play Live at the Marquee Cork on June 25th and Royal Hospital Kilmainham on June 26th .

Her work concentrated on communicating the difficult and complex decisions made . <p> She worked as an adviser to the minister from June 2006 when he was Minister for Children . <p> She said he was suspicious of the banks but he did not know whether they were misleading him or whether there was ineptitude and he was concerned about the extent of exposures and cross-collateralisation . <p> She said he was irritated at Mr Honohan 's intervention on RT ? ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Lenihan had a view that some of the anonymous briefings in advance of the bailout were coming from Central Bankers of other member states . <p> She said there was a fair amount of panic on the other side as well . <p> She said Mr Lenihan agreed th the findings in the Wright Report about a lack of expertise in the Department of Finance and said he did seek advice outside the department , including Mr Honohan and economists David McWilliams and Alan Ahearne , who was later appointed an adviser . <p> On the night of the guarantee , she was in Government Buildings at the request of Mr Lenihan but did not attend any meetings and said the discussions were held by a small group of officials . <p> Ms Herbert said the media strategy around the banks was not to frighten the horses .

40m unsecured deposit with Anglo Irish Bank on a three-month maturity . <p> Alongside the placing of deposits , the NTMA had also been discussing with the Department of Finance from April 2008 about the provision of emergency liquidity in circumstances where the Irish banks could not get funding . <p> Mr McDonagh said by September 2008 these discussions had intensified and the NTMA had put in place arrangements to allow it , in the event that it was directed by the minister , to engage in emergency collateralised lending to Irish banks . <p> He said there was a dearth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the financial state of the domestic banks and building societies . <p> He said It surprised them that there appeared to be only one or at the most two Financial Regulator staff engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution , even those institutions with balance sheets of up to ? 200bn . <p> Deputy Kieran O'Donnell asked Mr McDonagh if Anglo Irish Bank had been nationalised on the night of the guarantee whether it have saved money for the tax payer . <p> Mr McDonagh said given what had emerged it was hard to see that it would have ultimately saved the taxpayer money because the bank had so many problems . <p> Mr McDonagh said he believed the markets had made a decision about banks like Anglo and HBOS that they had huge difficulties in March 2008 . <p> Mr McDonagh was asked about correspondence from the NTMA in June 2008 seeking a direction from the Minister for Finance in terms of extending deposits to financial institutions . <p> Mr McDonagh said the NTMA had taken the view from 2007 onwards that it was n't worth them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of Dr Michael Somers , then chief executive of the NTMA , and the rest of the senior management team was that this was not the right thing to do but that if the Minister wanted them to do it , he should direct them to do it . <p> He said this was so that if something went wrong the NTMA could say that it would not have done this voluntarily . <p> Mr McDonagh said this process was outlined under legislation governing the NTMA . <p> He said Dr Somers sought a senior counsel 's opinion as to whether they would have to comply with a direction from the Minister regarding deposits . <p> Mr McDonagh said the NTMA had concerns from August 2007 about banks globally . <p> Deputy John Paul Phelan asked Mr McDonagh about the fact that he expressed surprise during a meeting in September 2008 in his statement that there appeared to be only one or two people from the Financial Regulator 's office engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution . <p> Mr McDonagh said he recalled asking Mr Cardiff if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big and there was only one or two people looking after them <p> Somers says powers of NTMA were strictly circumscribed <p> In his opening statement to the inquiry , Dr Somers said the powers of the NTMA were strictly circumscribed by legislation . <p> He said the NTMA had no power to provide any assistance to the banking sector and would have been acting outside of its remit to have done so by its own decision . <p> In his opening statement , Dr Somers said that the enormous amounts the banks lent to individual developers to enable them to buy high extraordinarily high prices for property , and the rolling up of interest , meant that insolvency was almost inevitable . <p> Dr Somers said he was in the US on the night of the bank guarantee and became aware of it through a text from a colleague . <p> On the guarantee , he said if there was a risk of a run on the banks then a guarantee on the deposits was probably the best course of action . <p> He said the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister for Finance when he announced it . <p> Dr Somers said he was hesitant about the amount of money that was going to be paid into the banks and the rapidity with which it was to be done . <p> On the decision to set up NAMA , Dr Somers said he felt that they should just take some loans from the banks and see if that would encourage them to lend . <p> He said he felt that the banks should be pressed to recover the loans themselves as they knew " where the bodies were buried " . <p> Dr Somers said transferring them to NAMA would be a bonanza for lawyers and other professionals , as well as requiring a large staff in NAMA . <p> He said that regardless of what happened the likelihood is that the outcome would have been the same . <p> Dr Somers said that he was surprised that public expenditure was not cut back after the 2007 election , as it had been after the 2002 election , if for no other reason than to increase it again before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of house and apartment building was unsustainable by any measure , and , if applied proportionately to other countries , would have given figures that were multiples of what they were actually doing . <p> He said he believed the same view was held by some persons at government level and the hope was that at least some of the building workers could be employed in other non-housing construction areas . <p> He said he was aware that costs and prices in Ireland were rising more rapidly than elsewhere in the euro zone . <p> Dr Somers said these issues are difficult to correct , particularly in the absence of a crisis , and where so many people are benefiting . <p> Dr Somers said by the time the NTMA was brought into the deliberations on the banking crisis , there were no easy solutions . <p> However , he said by virtue of the fact that the NTMA existed , and had prudently managed its operations , the State was in much better condition financially to tackle the crisis than would otherwise have been the case . <p> Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on a bank but he would have opted for a more limited measure stopping at deposits . He would need to be persuaded that senior bonds should be included . <p> He said he would have tried to buy time .

It was an accident waiting to happen . <p> By 2007 , they were worried it might collapse so they stopped placing deposits with it until directed to do so by the Minister . <p> He was in the US for the guarantee decision but the NTMA being left outside the meeting room was " quite typical " . <p> Dr Somers said the bailout was the " ultimate humiliation " and that the IMF was the bogeyman .

Now , we learn that an actress who I still think of as " young " is to play the frail widow of origin-engine Uncle Ben . Time to pull up the bath chair and break open a copt of Ireland 's Own . Of course , Tomei is easily old enough to be the aunt of Peter Parker at that start of the tale . Indeed it would not be unusual for somebody a decade younger than her to be sister to the sister-in-law of a teenager 's father .

Aaah ! They are not being " faithful " to the text . Inevitably , somebody eventually pointed out that there is some parallel Spider-Man strand in which May is middle-aged . That 's the way of comics these days . There 's a parallel strand in which everybody is whatever you want them to be . How come these people have time to complain ?

@@3420239 , I started to get a glimpse of what it might be like to be gay in Ireland <p> Until a couple of weeks ago , I had never taken the time to go to Dublin Pride . The omission was n't an accident ; the idea of going to it made me uncomfortable for several reasons , so I avoided it . The most obvious reason is that I 'm not gay . To attend pride would have felt more like a tokenistic dipping of the toe than a gesture of support for the LGBTQ community . I 'm not gay and , in the best possible sense , I never cared at all about homosexuality . <p> It has always seemed the least important aspect of a human being . What people 's sexual interests are , or whether their parts interlock with their partner 's , does n't seem important . I find the concept of any of my friends having sex mildly odd , because it is n't relevant to my relationship with them . Acceptance of the person they have chosen to be with is a given ; it is a condition of caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous grounds seems ridiculous . Of course they deserve equality . Of course they are thinking , feeling beings with as much value as any other person . <p> About two years ago , I started to get a glimpse of what it might be like to be a gay person in modern Ireland , and realised that it is n't a frivolity at all . It certainly should be : it is just the expression of sexuality , like every other basic form of selfhood and expression , and as such should be accepted . <p> Shortly after I met my partner -- a very tall , bespectacled academic whom I am lucky to have crossed paths with -- he came to Dublin to visit me . As is always the case in the first flush of love , I was swollen with gladness just to be with him . As we ambled past St Stephen 's Green , an old lady looked at us walking together , scoffed , and declared us " disgusting " . She looked at me with particular vitriol . <p> Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . I had thought that most people were more enlightened . That incident was the first of many in the time we have been together . Recently , while we walked in Rathmines after a very pleasant lunch , a group of little children on a school tour screamed racial slurs at him . He brushed it off , because he is used to it . I felt crushed on his behalf . <p> His skin is not white , and mine is . This is deeply jarring to some people ; it does not fit their paradigm of a loving relationship . As a couple , we upset these people merely by being , and they lash out . There was a time when it would have moved some people to violence . There was a time when , in many places , our union would have been illegal . <h> Shame turns to pride <p> This is nothing to what it must be like to be gay in Ireland , but I imagine the feeling it evokes is a tiny flavour of the otherness , the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . So , until the recent referendum that brought in gay marriage , I was n't proud . In fact , I was ashamed -- of our backwardness , of our fear and of our insistence on seeing other humans as being less than that . I was ashamed that by living here and being an Irish person , I was tacitly consenting to the oppression of several of my own friends . <p> So this year , I went to Pride , and felt entitled to share the pride . In my own small way , like everyone who voted Yes , I had acknowledged the value of gay people I care about , and those I 'll never even meet . The parade was a riot of colour and ironic 1990s music . As I stood on the quays with my partner , it gave me a sense of belonging that I had n't felt so fully for a while . <p> Afterwards , at the public hootenanny at Merrion Square , I stood in line for an ice cream behind a man in a wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed quite comfortable with the situation , and was given an extra flake in his ice cream for his trouble .

It goes with all complexions , we 're told -- unless , like me , you sometimes have to smooth out your face with dabs of cement . <p> Surely this grey top mania is not a parody . Political correctness would hardly tolerate that . It ca n't be a gesture of solidarity either , because obviously there are better ways of showing solidarity with old age than by dyeing your hair the same colour as your elders . That wo n't make them feel any better about their lost youth . How about increasing the pension instead ? Maybe , on the other hand , it 's some kind of a self defence mechanism for dealing with the inevitability of ageing .

But I changed my mind when I heard about dumb blonds . <p> The really maddening thing about turning grey , however , is that grey hair looks great on men . It certainly works on George Clooney . It gives men an attraction and an air of distinction that few women acquire with the advent of greyness .

Naturally , I never got to the root of the problem . I blamed work stress , of course , thinking that if I had stayed in that nice secure office job I 'd never have gone grey in the first place . <p> Now that grey hair or silver hair is the height of fashion , I 'm at a bit of a loss .

Silver locks are simply cool , and if they have to be acquired artificially , then so be it .

Replays take on a life of their own and if Cork are predictable then they will be beaten by Kerry . <p> Kerry know what worked for Cork and their first objective will be nullifying these advantages . The hardest decision for a manager is to move away from something that has worked but the best managers in the game can tweak their game-plan through the use of versatile players . <p> So will Kerry let Alan O'Connor dominate the midfield sector again ?

Nullify two or three of them and all of sudden the pendulum can swing the other way . <p> Reflecting on the Kerry performance and looking for positives , it will certainly not fill much space on the page . <p> Kerry played like defending All-Ireland champions in that they looked a yard off the pace and did not show the level of hunger that you would expect . <p> Outside of Marc O S ? and flashes from Bryan Sheehan , James O'Donoghue and Barry John Keane , the large majority of their team under-performed two weeks ago . <p> Fitzmaurice has a track record in devising strategies that will counter act the opposition strengths . <p> The only doubt in the Kerry supporters ' minds is whether the Kerry team can implement his strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions are ( 1 ) whether this Kerry team can reach the required tempo and ( 2 ) is the appetite to succeed still as strong as last year ? <p> I refuse to write off any Kerry team and expect we will see a very different Kingdom tomorrow evening . <p> Contrary to other opinions , I believe Donaghy should start . He could vacate the full-forward position for periods of the game which would allow Kerry to test the Cork full-back line for pace by changing the dynamic of their inside line . <p> Donaghy still possesses a significant threat in front of goal offering Kerry a direct route to goal which is a huge advantage in the modern game . <p> Kerry will need to improve defensively and without Aidan O'Mahony in their full-back line they look very vulnerable defensively . <p> O S ? will be given the job of marking O'Neill for the full 70 minutes this time and Paul Murphy is likely to return to the starting 15 . <p> SWEEPER <p> It would also not be a surprise if Fitzmaurice played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel . <p> Declan O'Sullivan played that role to perfection in last year 's Munster Final and I wonder could it be a role that would suit Colm Cooper ? <p> The midfield battle will go a long way to deciding the outcome of this game and it was an area of big concern for Cork coming into the drawn encounter . <p> Alan O'Connor proved that an old head with fresh legs is a good formula and he epitomised everything that was lacking in the Kerry performance by grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck in conjunction with his midfield partner Kevin O'Driscoll . <p> David Moran and Anthony Maher are the cogs in the wheel that will be needed to give Kerry a platform for success and they must dominate this sector . <p> All told Cork will have gained a lot of belief from the drawn game .

We have really learned nothing <p> Dublin 's motto is obedientia civium urbis felicitas ( the citizen 's obedience is the city 's happiness ) . This is perhaps the most unDublin motto there could be . Dubliners are nothing if not disobedient , whizzing through red lights on their bikes , not paying their water charges , boozing after-hours , jumping off bridges into water for sport , selling packets of fags on the street corner , and Air BnBing their gaffs under the nose of landlords . I propose a different , more honest motto : nihilum didicimus ( we have learned nothing ) . <p> Dublin City Council flew a kite last week about reducing the size and the number of windows in new apartments . Nihilum didicimus . The Construction Industry Federation has been calling for smaller apartment sizes for a while . More units per development equals more money . The city has gone through several phases of apartment building , including builders who were so clever they did n't even need architects . Now , as citizens are left wincing at so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about rolling back on size standards for the sake of " kickstarting development " . Nihilum didicimus . <h> Pokey accommodation <p> Less than 10 years ago , the council stipulated that one-bedroom apartments had to be , at a minimum , 55sq m . This is 10sq m bigger than the Department of Environment 's 45sq m minimum requirement . At the moment , most apartments have to have windows on both sides . The council proposes removing that requirement for some apartments . Apartments in the city are already a mess . You only have to notice washing machines and children 's toys and clothes drying on balconies to see how few have adequate storage . Bad floor layouts , pokey rooms , dark hallways , derelict communal areas , poor insulation and terrible light are common in many developments , as well as deteriorating and discoloured cheap building materials and cladding . We need to learn from this . We ca n't keep building crap . <p> It was only in October of last year , when Olivia Kelly , writing in this newspaper , foresaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive manager of Dublin City Council 's planning department , Jim Keoghan , " said he had no reason to advise councillors to reduce apartment sizes " . In that same article , Kelly wrote that Cr ? ona N ? Dh ? laigh of Sinn F ? in and the chairwoman of the council 's housing committee , " feared councillors would come under pressure to lower standards with the promise of construction of affordable housing to deal with the crisis " . At the time , she said , " we ca n't expect people to live in dog boxes " . Best of all , Labour councillor Andrew Montague , who chairs the council 's planning committee , said , " There was huge resistance to these better standards when we brought them in , but we brought them in anyway . I would be surprised if anyone was sympathetic to this call . . . There are thousands of smaller apartments in the city , our job is not to reduce quality , our job is to make great places to live . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft plan on Newstalk last week . Montague said perhaps 5 per cent of new apartments could face a reduction in size . Montague also said , with misguided reassurance , that " it 's also only in the sector for rent only " . Our renters are not as entitled to sizeable homes ? There is a conservative and completely unhelpful Irish school of thought that renters are not " long-term " people and that renting is a short-term activity , an out-of-date and unhelpful philosophy . Montague said that while previously 85 per cent of apartments had to have windows on both sides , that would be reduced to " half " , with a vague assurance that apartments with windows would only be north-facing " if you 're overlooking a park or a river , or , eh , something that looks very good " . <p> He offered the Liffey as an example , and the presenter Chris Donoghue wondered what new developments could there possibly be along the river .

I 'm sure Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly would be delighted to see apartments flying up , given the absolute hames his government has made of housing , with homeless families ensconced in hostels and hotel rooms and the backs of cars . But housing , building homes to last that people enjoy living in , is not about the " right now " . <h> Decent housing <p> More than anything else , what the draft plan shows is Dublin City Council sets out aspirations if often struggles to fulfil .

Photograph : Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images . <p> For the last several weeks , the likely slate of US Republican candidates for the first televised debate this week has shifted constantly at the cutoff line , based on new polls and issues normally confined to the nerdy world of poll analytics . <p> Fox News wo n't announce which 10 of the 16 candidates will be on stage until after Tuesday 's 5pm deadline ( 10pm Irish time ) , but the network released a poll Monday evening that makes the field look much more stable than before . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules - has said the 10 candidates who have fared best in an average of the last five polls released before 5pm Tuesday will be admitted to the debate . <p> On Monday afternoon , Mr Perry was on the cusp of making the debate , arguably tied with Mr Christie and Mr Kasich . By Monday evening , he was not . That is because the poll released by Fox was a bad one for Mr Perry . He was favoured by just 1 per cent of respondents , while Mr Kasich and Mr Christie both received 3 per cent . That may not sound like a large difference , but it was enough to push Mr Perry more solidly into 11th place . <p> Poll averages <p> Before the latest poll , Mr Perry may have had hope of making the debate , depending on how Fox 's debate organisers decided to round the poll averages . If they had rounded to the nearest whole number , Mr Perry , Mr Christie and Mr Kasich would have been tied at 3 per cent each . ( Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may allow more than 10 candidates on stage , but it has offered few details on how it would interpret ties . ) <p> Monday 's poll means even a generous interpretation of decimal rounding would not be enough to keep Mr Perry in the debate . At least two more polls are expected to come out Tuesday - one from Bloomberg and another from CBS News - which will affect the final averages . Those polls could shake up the debate again , but the candidates who are currently out of the top 10 would have to register unusually well . <p> If only two more polls go into Fox 's calculations , Mr Perry , for example , would need to beat Mr Kasich by a combined 3 percentage points to make it into the top 10 . He has not done that since mid-June , before Mr Kasich even announced his candidacy .

The tuts and head shakes in this case were nothing more than another chorus of ' how did we get such a tough group and they got a pants one ?

Over 150,000 migrants have reached Hungary this year , most coming through the southern border with Serbia . Many apply for asylum but quickly try to leave for richer EU countries . ( AP Photo/Petr David Josek ) <p> 16:11 7 Sep 2015 Newstalk 16:11 Monday 7 September 2015 <p> When I saw a picture of a drowned three-year-old child in a red tee-shirt and blue shorts on a beach in Turkey , it made me cry . I have been crying regularly since , just thinking about it . <p> I have travelled quite a bit during my time on this planet . I have seen a lot of suffering and injustice . It takes a lot to make me cry . <p> To see the child washed up on the beach in a body position so familiar to me ( my four-year-old daughter lies exactly like this as she drifts off to sleep ) was heartbreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing him in his colourful clothes earlier that day to make him feel positive and hopeful ( disguising what was probably a terrifying situation for the family ) . For it all to end in such tragedy , truly makes me despair . <p> It does not help that my four-year-old daughter just started school this week . I am very much in that terrible tug-of-war of wanting to protect her and wanting to let her grow up . Her beautiful outlook , and incredible excitement at going to school , tears me in half . In that little boy 's broken body I imagine how I would feel as his dad . <p> It also does not help that as I have got older , I have come to be softened by the presence of children . I love their ebullience , innocence , joy at the simplest of things , their endless curiosity and their ability to live in the moment . They truly make you feel more alive just by being who they are . <p> That has all ended for that poor little soul on Bodrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His five-year-old brother Galip and his mother Rihan also drowned . <p> His father Abdullah Kurdi survived and my heart goes out to him wherever he is . I just can not fathom his inconsolable grief . I pray that he is comforted and supported by whoever is around him . <p> It has prompted me to write this note . I do not know any other way to respond to the tragedy . <p> Europe is regressing <p> Let me start by saying that I think Europe is regressing . <p> Over the last couple of years during the financial crisis we have seen the worst of Europe . Despite two horrific wars in the last century we seem to have learned nothing . Extreme nationalism is dangerous . European fiscal policy during the financial crisis has caused terrible hardship to its citizens and has fuelled extreme nationalism to dangerous levels . The obvious solution was for all of Europe to share the burden of debt write-down ( by a devaluation of the currency ) . Instead , the austerity route was taken ( to protect the wealthier nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which was never their debt in the first place ) . Ireland is the poster-boy case . <p> One side consequence of all this was a fuelling of nationalistic thinking . The view that we must look after our own before we look after anyone else has risen sharply amongst populations across Europe . <p> Meanwhile Syria has been torn apart . The initial civil war started as an effort to overthrow the Assad regime - a regime that deserved to be overthrown . Procrastination on the part of the international community - together with Russian backing for the Assad regime - allowed ISIS to garner its resources and become the main Assad opponent . Now the West feels it can not support either side . As a consequence , a full-blown war is unfolding in Syria and a mass exodus of its citizens has begun . <p> Syria has a population of about 23 million . It is estimated that almost 8 million people have been internally displaced , and some 4-5 million of them ( well over 50% of them children ) have fled the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the neighbouring countries of Lebanon , Jordan , Egypt , Turkey and Iraq - all countries with their own challenges and considerably less resources than Europe . <p> Pathetic <p> The European response to the tragedy has been nothing short of pathetic . <p> Make no mistake - this is an enormous humanitarian disaster , probably the greatest in our lifetime . It is going to take enormous effort to resolve it but it can be done . Europe has a population of almost 750 million people . 4-5 million people represent less than 1% of the entire European population . A 1% change in your population in a crisis is manageable by any standards . <p> So what makes me despair ? Despite the absolute horror of the images of little three-year-old Aylan lying dead on the beach all over the social media channels , you only have to scroll through some of the comment feeds to understand that lots of people , ( and I mean lots , not just a rogue minority ) believe the right response to the disaster is to keep the refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have enough problems of our own to resolve . Problems like homelessness , unemployment and so on . <p> The trolling , the contempt for people suffering , the ignorance and conceited view that these poor people are sponging western society is chilling to the core . That even the picture of a dead child washed up on a beach is not enough to bring out the compassionate , caring side of our humanity . <p> This is not an either/or argument . Of course we have to help the most vulnerable in our communities . Governments right across Europe have forced this poverty on our shoulders and they are the ones to blame for these injustices . However , the people fleeing the Syrian civil war are fleeing for their lives . In many occasions they have had to gather their families and a few meagre possessions together and leave their homes to try to escape the ravages of the war raging unhindered in their country . These are citizens like you and I - with families , jobs , houses and dreams - who suddenly find themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the people of Syria in their time of need . <p> That is not the view shared by a significant percentage of Europeans . People have taken the view that looking after their ' own ' is more important . What they all seem to forget is that a simple accident of where you were born decides your nationality . Very few people have to work to truly earn their nationality ( except , ironically , those who have to leave their country as refugees or migrants ) . We all come into this world as human and leave it the same way . Nobody owns anyone , any nationality or any place . Nationality ownership is an artificial construct designed to protect the powerful and alienate the weak . <p> Europe went through two world wars last century and has constructed political machinery to avoid that ever happening again . At the heart of the European ideal is that sense of equality of all people - the belief that everyone has basic human rights . Europe is supposed to be a shining light of equality and freedom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is losing its soul . <p> In the vain attempt to just protect what we have and ignore the plight of others , we are behaving no differently to a more primitive version of ourselves - forming warring tribes and clans to just survive . <p> In the absence of any higher goal other than to look out for ourselves in a selfish short term way , we are doomed to societies of reckless consumption that ultimately will self-destruct . And to be honest that would be no bad thing . A fresh start might just be what is required . <p> " The correct response to this humanitarian disaster begins with compassion . Help as many people as we possibly can . Even if it hurts . " <p> We live on a planet that we have plundered for resources . We have wiped out species of animal and plant on the basis that we believe humans can do what they like . Our financial models are built on infinite growth models that are not sustainable . We have an energy crisis , an ageing population crisis and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake-up call that humanity needs . We genuinely are on the brink so what are we trying to hold onto ? <p> The correct response to this humanitarian disaster begins with compassion . Help as many people as we possibly can . Even if it hurts . That is what will help solve and dispel this nightmare . Our brothers and sisters in Syria will benefit from this response , so will Europe and so will humanity . <p> In my opinion , how we respond collectively to this crisis will define Europe and by extension us as a species . I for one want to be part of a humanity that responds compassionately to a crisis like this . It 's the world I want for my children . <p> We are a long way from living in that world it seems . <p> Aylan and his family is a chilling reminder of that . <p> So here is what I propose . There are between 4 and 5 million people currently feeling Syria . That is less than 1% of the population of Europe . Each country takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland opens its doors to 45,000 refugees . <p> One percent - Half of a Croke Park All-Ireland final attendance <p> Let 's put it into context .

Let 's open our schools , our medical and social services and our communities to the families . Let 's have extra seats at our dinner tables . Let 's get our voluntary organisations to involve them in their activities . In short , let 's welcome them with open arms and prove that , even if our political structures have failed us , our communities can prevail . <p> This would be difficult financially but I am sure we could apply to Europe for help . If they so wished they could write the debt off . How ironic would that be ? <p> In the same way that the obvious solution to the financial crisis was a collective-sharing of the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . <p> Were Europe to do this it would stand a chance of saving itself . It would send out a message to the world that there is hope for humanity . It would also send a message to the aggressors in the war , the perpetrators of evil and oppression , the extremists wanting to bring us back to the dark ages , that western society built around principles of equality and compassion works . It would lay bare the ignorance of their ideology and not a bullet would be fired or a bomb dropped . <p> Compassion should be the guiding principle for how we build our future . I really do n't care how much wealth we create , how many billionaires there are in the world , how much growth there is in our economy if we are not acting compassionately .

Once I had been to the gym , had a coffee , done a little bit of shopping , well , it was home to a silent apartment and a silent phone . It was not easy this time , and gave me food for thought . <p> I also lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the UK and I visited her every six weeks . Now there is no one to visit , just her grave . <p> So how will I deal with this loneliness that crept up on me without warning ? I will make the best of a bad job , as they say . Continue travelling a bit , sometimes on my own , sometimes with my friend , making sure I stay healthy and fit , and go out every day , regardless of the weather . Life is what you make it , even when it is n't easy . But it 's the little memories of home that can bring a few tears to the eyes when all is quiet in my apartment . <p> Rita Holmes : ' Nothing makes you feel lonely more than having to explain a joke to new friends .

As the plane left the ground , in my mind , I saw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey Mouse would do to bring the plane to a stop , but no such luck . How the dead weight in my heart did n't bring down the plane is truly an amazing testimony to engineering . <p> Even coming to a country in Europe where many people speak English , there is still a loneliness in the everyday things of life . Staring into a foreign supermarket freezer for the first time , looking at the contents and thinking " what is it and what do I do with it ? " , loneliness takes the opportunity to remind me : Mum would know ! ( ouch ! ) <p> As is often said , you can be lonely in a crowded room , and what makes this especially poignant I think for Irish people is the lack of people who share your sense of humour . You can crack a joke and there is silence in the room . Nothing makes you feel lonely more than having to explain a joke to new friends . You quickly learn to shrug . Loneliness reminds you : " Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her laughing from across the sea .

Family and friends who call and without trying , just being their own Irish selves , reassure me there are other people out there who understand my humour and who speak my language , my real language , not just the English words but the language which is me . <p> Today , in 2015 , I still look into the freezers with the same questions , and I still wonder how a whole nation could survive without a sense of humour . But the " ouch " is not as sharp . <p> ' I miss the everyday chat ' : Helen Langford , Italy Having to operate in a second language has been the cause of my loneliness since moving to Frosinone in Lazio , Italy , where my husband is from . <p> We lived in Ashbourne in Co Meath for several years , and one of the things I miss the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and come into contact with neighbours and shopkeepers .

Instead , I hear myself repeating the same stock phrases that I know are suitable for " daily interactions : out and about " as a school textbook might put it . These kinds of " conversations " seem to only add to my feelings of isolation . <p> I started a blog www.trulymadlyitaly.com as soon as I moved to Italy , and it has been a great help in keeping the loneliness at bay and helping me to make sense of all the adjustments I have had to make . It has also helped me to hold onto my sense of humour . Encouraging comments and feedback from fellow bloggers , other expats , as well as close friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were we thinking ?

Millions of them want to be back home . They are no less lonely or isolated than the Irish . Perhaps they are even more so , as their poverty does not allow them to Skype home every night , text every minute , watch every match from home online , read the Irish newspapers or fly home on just an hour 's or week 's pay . <p> ' I have sacrificed a lot to be an expat ' : Therese Cronin , Nantes I left Ireland in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and might never have left if I thought there was a threat of becoming a true emigrant . I set off for Paris with the express purpose of acquiring the skill-set needed to advance at my job back home .

Special friends and memorable experiences came my way with impromptu picnics on the banks of the Seine and scrambles through forbidden parts of the catacombs . <p> While in Paris I fell in love , and was no longer travelling alone when I followed an offer to work in Philadelphia . It too was a great city to spend some expat years . But its social problems were hard to ignore .

It 's not the Tayto 's or the Barry 's or even the pier walks that I miss . It 's Irishness . For instance , in conversation , Irish people seem motivated to put the other at their ease , whether it is with self-deprecating humour or reassurances , a trait perhaps not observed as often in other countries .

Photograph : Getty . <p> The plan was to smash a few records and then run in the Olympics . There is no sure-fire path to any sporting glory , only the tried and trusted . And when you were a young Irish distance runner with great history on your side the only path worth following was the American scholarship . <p> Something about this time of year still brings it all back home . The chill of the morning run . The first hint of fall . The miles to clock and the promises to keep . Freshman orientation week feels like a lifetime ago and it is , and yet not much before or since has come close . The American scholarship did n't so much open a path of opportunity as bulldoze it . <p> " We could sure use you guys at Villanova , " said George Guida , changing the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times : how sprinter Jimmy Reardon , thrower Cummin Clancy , and miler John Joe Barry got chatting to two American athletes , Guida and Browning Ross , at the 1948 Olympics in London .

Delany ultimately paved the way for Eamonn Coghlan , Marcus O'Sullivan and Sonia O'Sullivan . <p> Soon , the pipeline spread east to Providence and Iona , south to Arkansas and East Tennessee , north to Michigan and Notre Dame , and as far west as Pocatello , Idaho , in the heart of the Rockies . Some stayed and others followed the same path back home and yet few if any will ever admit to regretting that bulldozing opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , that pipeline is still flowing . There were signs it was slowing down -- to a worrying trickle , perhaps -- when the likes of UCD and DCU presented a partially viable alternative , although that was n't enough to halt the flow completely .

All planning to smash a few records and then run in the Olympics . <p> There is precious little left of that first chapter . Earlier this month , George Guida died , aged 93 , his niece Annie Guida Gubeno telling me by email that he was far too modest to speak about his running achievements after Villanova . Now , of those five athletes who first chatted together at the 1948 Olympics , only Jimmy Reardon survives . <p> There are plenty others who did smash records and then ran in the Olympics and still found themselves largely forgotten .

During his final year , aged 21 , he ran a European Indoor mile record of 3:55.4 , also beating the American Dick Buerkle , who held that world record . Before graduating from Arkansas he was already inspiring the next generation of Irish distance runners , particularly Frank O'Mara . <p> " Niall belonged to that great group of Irish middle distance runners of the 1970s , " said O'Mara , who followed O'Shaughnessy 's footsteps from Limerick to Arkansas , smashing a few records himself before running in three Olympics . <p> What also set O'Shaughnessy apart was his realisation that the American scholarship path could only take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd qualified for 1980 Olympics in Moscow , he 'd also graduated with a master 's in environmental engineering , working for the State of Arkansas . <h> Noble decision <p> When the Americans boycotted Moscow , over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , O'Shaughnessy took the bold and noble decision to follow suit . He retired from running aged only 24 , and spent the next 35 years as a highly successful and respected engineer in Arkansas , and later in Atlanta , Georgia , where died of cancer on Wednesday , aged 59 . <p> For every Niall O'Shaughnessy , or for every Ronnie Delany for that matter , there are countless other young Irish distance runners who followed the American scholarship path , and even if they never smashed a few records , or ran in the Olympics , it does n't mean it was n't worth following .

It wants you to feel the visceral speed and the bumps and the screech of the tyres like a racing driver would . <p> The racing car game market , like the FPS market , has always been flooded with various racing titles and every now and again one pops up that catches people 's attention . There were games like TOCA and the PGR series on Xbox and more recently there has been Driveclub on Playstation 4 and Project Cars . All good racing games . But Forza made a name for itself from its beginning and has n't let up since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made me spend my free hours and hard earned dollars was the unique feel and handling of the cars themselves . This is the cornerstone of any good racing game and Forza had it , and has nailed it , every time with every game that has released . It has evolved now to where every car has a different feel and requires adapting your driving skills to match the physics of the car . No two cars in Forza 6 feel , sound or handle in the same way and that 's an impressive feat . <p> Now that the developers of the game have finally added weather effects it vastly improves how races are approached . It adds much more diversity than any of the previous games and tests the skills of the player in a way that Forza never did before . Unfortunately , it has n't reached the point where weather is dynamic . Each race is either going to be clear , in the rain or at night . The one that stands out among them and adds the most substantial difference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The roads look treacherous and slick , strewn with hazardous puddles that can instantly throw your car into a spin if you approach from the wrong angle or at too high a speed . The water cascades off the bonnet and the windshield , and visibility can be extremely limited when other cars in front of you are billowing their rear wheel spray directly at you . But the mode adds so much unpredictability and fun that you will look forward to when you have the chance to race in the rain again . <p> The campaign is broken up into different series with a number of small tournaments in each one . These are designed for specific car classes and as you progress the performance of your chosen cars will increase . Placing in the top 3 of any race will validate a pass . It 's a satisfying formula because you know with every race your skills are improving and the races themselves are increasing in difficulty . From the beginning of the campaign you will unlock showcase events . These are specialised races and various challenge modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula races . It 's a nice addition that breaks up the linear nature of the main career mode and can give you access to some of the highest performance cars that the Forza roster has to offer . Offline Forza 6 has a very sturdy and lengthy amount of content on the track and off it . You may spend half your time with the game just upgrading the performance and look of your cars or simply gawking at the impressive amount of fine detail to admire in and out of each vehicle . <p> Accessibilty is no issue either . There are tons of difficulty options that you can tweak to make the game just as difficult or easy as you like . And the game will prompt you to do this if you are either placing first in a lot of races or not winning at all , so you are sure to hit that sweet spot . Driver AI has , in the past , been a very sore issue for players of racing games . Turn 10 's answer to this problem was Drivatar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving mannerisms of actual players and using that information to drive all the other cars on the track actually works and if improved will be the way forward for the racing game as a genre . It just means you do not know what any car at any given time is going to do or how they react to you in a race . It has happened that I have been second with no hope of crossing the finish line first and the leader has suddenly spun out leaving me to place top of the list . Or you could be in the top three and just about to overtake for the lead and the car in front of you swerves and causes you to crash leaving you last . Anything can happen because it 's random and it makes for a different race every time . It 's a cure for an age old AI problem that works . <p> Forza 6 online also works . You have the standard class set races and a few variants like tag which mixes thing up a little . Playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the competitive multiplayer modes including the League mode where you take part in a table and race against drivers of matching skill levels whilst trying to progress higher and higher up the ladder . If multiplayer is your thing then you wo n't be let down . It 's a hugely engrossing compliment to an already deep and tecnically proficient title . <p> A couple of years back at E3 I remember one of the devs , whilst announcing the release of Driveclub , boasting about the detail and painstaking effort that went into the appearance of the cars . Driveclub , in comparison to this game really does n't hold up well in terms of detail . Forza 6 can be absolutely breath-taking as regards its graphics . There is just the right amount of blur on the roads at high speeds and when you are pushing up an alpine hill in at the break of day with snow covered peaks strewn for miles and the sun 's rays are dancing on the sparkling polished paintwork of your car , it 's hard to say you have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair-raising roar of the engine noises it can immerse you and make you feel like you are actually sitting behind the wheel of that car and driving is the only thing on your mind . The dash , the leather seats , the windscreen effects and all the environmental tweaks add up to really make the this one of the best looking titles out there , period . <p> As Forza has progressed over the years , having an in-depth and varied amount of content has really been its only outstanding issue . This time around they have made up for it in spades . You can now race a multitude of vehicles strewn across several decades , even dating back to the very beginnings of formula one . Muscle to supercar , SUV to hatchback it 's all there . The opponents are intelligent enough to try and cut you off , bump you into the dirt or tailgate you until they see the opportunity to pass . You can even race against your next rival time after time honing your best lap times and try beat his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's literally hundreds of hours of gameplay and it 's exciting , fun and as challenging as you make it . Car enthusiasts will gush over the lush car models and upgrade features . Gamers of any skill level can find hours of enjoyment . Forza 6 stands , for my money , the best racing game on this generation of consoles and one of the best videogames released on this gen to date . <p> Forza Motorsport 6 is available exclusively on Xbox One .

It is essential that anyone with suspected Parkinson 's symptoms consults a specialist immediately -- the earlier the treatment , the more successful the results . <p> Slightly more common in men than women , this condition affects around one in every 100 individuals over the age of 65 . It is not passed from one generation to the next , nor is it contagious . <p> This disease usually begins with a sensation of stiffness and weakness in the limbs , often accompanied by a slight trembling of the hand when it is at rest .

@@3627238 live by the values of ' all for one and one for all ' <p> FORGET for a minute the history , the titles and the legends that are the Cork ladies footballers . At the final whistle -- the very moment Briege Corkery became the joint most successful GAA player ever alongside Rena Buckley , and incredibly finished and started in all of Cork 's 10 All-Ireland finals -- something happened . It should have been a moment of ecstasy for Corkery . A moment when everything she 's ever done to get to this point in her career came flooding back . A moment that was ultimately hers , but it was n't . Another player , another ego , would have thrown their hands in the air and their eyes to the heavens . But , Corkery turned on her heels as the hooter sounded and headed straight for the Cork dugout to hug the injured Geraldine O'Flynn . <p> Like Corkery , O'Flynn is one of the ' Super Six ' , there since 2004 prior to even a Munster senior title ever been won , but a knee injury saw her replaced 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O'Flynn spoke in the dressing room . Corkery knew she was hurting , they all did , and it was to O'Flynn 's side she ran at the final whistle . Even then , she was supporting her comrade , the woman who had got them over the line in kicking two winning points in the 2006 and 2014 All-Ireland finals . If it was n't for O'Flynn , there would be no Perfect 10 , and Corkery knew that . Her first instinct was to be there for O'Flynn , and not revel in her own glory . And , that folks , is exactly what this team is about . Each other . It 's not about titles , medals , minutes played , player of the match awards , nor All-Stars , it 's about them looking out for each other , working for each other and being there for each other . Not many realise , but yesterday 's All-Ireland bid almost did n't come to fruition . In August , the dual star debate raged on as Briege Corkery and Rena Buckley had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-final against Galway and the camogie All-Ireland semi-final against Kilkenny . The players and management met and discussed in-depth pulling out of the championship and relinquishing their title in a bid to fly the flag for player welfare and support Corkery and Buckley . They had their backs , but so too did Buckley and Corkery have their team-mates . The urge was to say enough was enough , but together they worked it out . They were all in this together and what they do best is not give in , and they did n't . Yesterday 's All-Ireland was the second they 've won on a two-point margin -- the first against Monaghan in 2011 -- and it was the second of which they were held goalless . Kerry 's record of doing that in 2012 is now no more . But , it was n't pretty by any means . The game was poor in parts , scrapy even .

In the closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mammoth block , and she making her debut in Croker despite being on the panel since 2009 .

But all those moments , and everything else in between , was n't for the limelight , or to set or break records , it was for each other . For the teammate to the left and right of them , for the 15 subs in the stand , for the management team , and the six players who did n't make it onto the match day programme -- Eimear Meaney , Laura Crowley , Eleanor Ahern , Laura Fitzgerald , Kate Leneghan and Sin ? ad Cotter .

The French star has been subjected to some online criticism after saying that the very term only creates " separation " between the sexes and that it had " no real place in the industry .

They came to another few of my gigs and one day they told me that they 'd like to invest in me . It was amazing timing too , because I 'd been working with Don Mescall on my songs . We knew we had an album ready but had no funding , so it was really perfect ! ' Oh My Gosh ' is the first release . <p> 3 .

Apple products made it to the Aran Islands years ago , but they 've never made it to our national stage . <p> In an Irish play you 'll rarely see someone text their mammy or post a picture to Instragam . It 's as if we all have decided that the 21st century does n't belong on our stages . <p> Why is this ? It could be because anything that threatens all the softly smoking turf fires and the comfortable old country pubs where colorful locals assemble to tell each other tall tales is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the 19th century it appears we decided to stop the clock . Maybe we felt we had enough to be talking about already . Or maybe we did it to prevent us talking at all . <p> Either way , it 's become obvious that most of our contemporary playwrights have decided that the Ireland they write about should never make it past 1960 . <p> That 's why it 's especially exciting to announce The Quare Land by Cavan-born playwright John McManus , which is now playing at the Irish Repertory Theatre and which I very strongly encourage you to see . <p> Set in 2008 as the country 's long national nightmare of prosperity was coming to a close , the play introduces us to 91-year-old Cavan farmer Hugh Pugh just as he is taking his first bath in four years . <p> Hugh is preparing for a much-dreaded visit from his alcoholic 92-year-old brother , but before he can even relax in his equally ancient tub he 's unexpectedly visited by an Irish stand in for the devil , a property developer named Rob McNulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwright to give a property developer , which hints at the depth of anger lurking underneath the surface of this lethally funny play . <p> But McManus refuses to turn his stressed out wheeler-dealer into a caricature . As The Quare Land progresses we begin to realize that in his own way Rob is as much a victim of the acquisitive age that he lives in as poor old Hugh . <p> When the play opens we earn that Hugh , in the most roundabout way imaginable , has come into a little parcel of land he never knew he owned . Would n't you know this land is located smack in the middle of the 18-hole golf course that McNulty wants to build next to his massive five star hotel . <p> So what he 's looking at , Hugh realizes , is an opportunity to name his price .

The only thing he has quietly admitted to is being good at essays in his school years and trying his hand at the odd play the odd time . <p> But it turns out that working in the Irish building trade is the ideal background for a contemporary Irish playwright . Because where else will you learn exactly what , when and how the country went so badly wrong . McManus writes directly from the coalface in other words , and he 's not afraid to get his hands dirty in pursuit of the uncomfortable truth . <p> Some critics have already compared him to Martin McDonagh , but the truth is McManus ' has already proven himself to be a much more accomplished reader of contemporary Ireland 's psyche . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big shots in Dublin made a mess of the small fry far out in the country , and McManus is all over it .

In The Quare Land he gets to settle accounts and the epic showdown is worth the ticket price . <p> " The play is set in 2008 when the place was about to utterly collapse , " producing director of the Irish Rep Ciaran O'Reilly tells the Irish Voice .

It 's as though he has studied mam and dad long and hard . He steps adroitly into the thought processes of Stephen , the generous-spirited , bi-sexual poet and political activist . He takes a sober look inside the heart and mind of his mother Natasha , the intensely striving concert pianist . That 's her indoors - and often out of doors too - at the family home in St John 's Wood which also included Matthew 's sister Lizzie and an Italian nanny . <p> Despite the somewhat irregular domestic arrangements , life in theSpender household was trouble-free in its own way - there were few confrontations in front of the children and Matthew has no chip on his shoulder . His mother assured her son as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest any nonsense to the contrary . In reaction perhaps to a pompous , self-regarding father whom he hated , Stephen Spender was an indulgent father , who loved his wife , his son and his daughter . <p> Correspondingly , there are pleasant memories and anecdotes dredged from the welter of interminabletensions about lovers and friends which divided his parents . Or did such tensions ultimately unite them ? Stephen and Natasha were fated to stay together , despite time out which included Natasha 's masochistic days in Arizona and California with Raymond Chandler who was a chronic alcoholic . <p> The author recalls a holiday spent with his mother in Portofino on the Ligurian coast in 1949 . On impulse , she commandeered a boat which she began to paddle it vigorously in an attempt to beat a female friend in a race which involved the latter climbing a long series of steps to arrive at the same destination . <p> " I 've done my best to raise it ( the race ) to the level of trauma , but my life on the whole has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instance of my mother behaving competitively , " writes Matthew . From his toddler viewpoint , at that moment Natasha " shone with the gleeful sheen of early motherhood .

" There is also a loving evocation of the Italian resort of Torri del Benaco , on the Eastern shore of Lake Garda , a favoured holiday retreat for the family . <p> Stephen was not always - or even often - present at home , being a busy public figure at post-war literary conferences , teaching in the USA , or courting various male lovers . Natasha 's discovery of continuing homosexuality in their marriage in the spring of 1947 led to a threat to throw herself off an Italian train , the memory of which threat still upset Stephen forty years later . " My father was terrified by this incident , " writes his son . " It revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no idea how deep it reached . " A photograph from that time , included in the book , shows his parents standing side by side on a street in Verona , each of them mired in their own painful anxieties . <p> The couple had begun this ill-fated trip in France . " At a party in Paris , Natasha saw her husband across a crowded room talking to an elegant young man , " writes Matthew . " She asked the person next to her who this man was . The reply : Do n't you know ? That 's Stephen 's new lover . My mother stood up , and promptly fainted . It was a terrible moment . " <p> However , such turbulence is only part of the peculiar story of the Spenders and their unconventional marriage , recalled vividly by their son who has lived and worked as a sculptor with his artist wife Maro for many years on a farm near Siena in Italy .

@@3675237 <p> How well do you know your mum or dad ? Enough to write their life story ? <p> My mum was Bridie Gallagher . She was best known as The Girl from Donegal and acknowledged as Ireland 's first truly international pop star . Over a 50-year career she sang at sell-out concerts everywhere from small halls across Ireland to the London Palladium , Royal Albert Hall , the Lincoln Centre in New York and Sydney Opera House . She is credited with bringing glamour to show business in 1950s Ireland , giving new life to forgotten Irish ballads , and selling millions of records . <p> Her rise to fame in the mid-1950s was marked by enormous crowds wherever she appeared , winning the hearts of legions of fans in Ireland and overseas . She was one of the few Irish singers at that time who travelled internationally to entertain Irish people , and in one memorable show at London 's Albert Hall in 1959 , mounted police had to hold back fans blocking the surrounding streets . <h> Bridie Gallagher sings Cutting the Corn in Creeslough <p> But she was n't only a successful showbiz personality . She was my mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage name ) . While much of her career had been chronicled in newspapers over the years , her private life , especially as a mother , grandmother , wife and friend had not been the subject of public record . <p> She died on January 9th , 2012 and her funeral was covered extensively in the media . Within weeks , as her only surviving son and , according to many , the only person who knew her well enough , I found myself under pressure to write a book on her life story . But I had never written a book before . As a civil servant of 35 years , and a qualified psychologist , I had written academic papers , government policy papers and ministers ' speeches . A biography , however , especially about my own mother , presented a very different challenge . <p> I faced many quandaries . Should I just write a chronicle of events ? How could I make it readable , and not sound like a ministerial press release ? How far should I delve into her private life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting , assuming some might suspect me as having a less than impartial perspective on the subject ? <p> Having decided to tackle the challenge , my first step was to " go back to school " . I enrolled in a creative writing class in Belfast and , under the expert guidance of two brilliant tutors , was shown how to write all over again . I learned about structure , style , plot and language . I read other biographies by great writers , and set about researching material . This included Mum 's personal diaries , mountains of press cuttings , hundreds of photographs , as well as interviews I conducted with Mum 's old school pals , relations , showbiz friends , and even early boyfriends . <p> I quickly found myself on a voyage of discovery . I thought I knew all about her , being close to her to the end . Then , day by day , I learned more and more about this fascinating woman . It was relatively easy to detail the successes achieved in her career , the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extraordinary people she met on her travels , like Pat Boone and Ginger Rodgers . I understood less about the difficulties she faced in show business and her personal life and how she coped with them . I experienced first-hand the personal tragedies that befell her -- a failed marriage ( which she hid from the public for many years ) and loss of her 21-year-old son , Peter , in a motorbike accident in 1976 . I also unearthed things I never knew , or more precisely , things she never told me . Perhaps they were too painful to share even with me . <p> Gradually the book took shape . I decided the first half would chronicle her life from the beginning to end . Starting with her childhood , near Creeslough in Co Donegal , in a large Catholic family , her early penchant for singing , her love of camogie , her first romances and heartbreak , and her eventual move to Belfast to work as a housekeeper for a wealthy family . Then her first steps on the professional stage in Belfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who became her husband , and evolving into the most popular Irish ballad singer with a meteoric rise to fame culminating in her show at the London Palladium in 1959 . The tours of her own variety show across Britain and Ireland ( often with hilarious fun and frolics ) , frequent visits to America , Australia and even Africa , all made for an extraordinary career , before finally closing 50 years later in August 2000 . <p> The second half of the book would focus on particular aspects of her career and life -- her musical influences , the aspects of showbiz she hated , the chronic depression that afflicted the last 40 years of her life , as well as her private world of oil painting , cooking and her beloved grandchildren , all contributing to the legacy she left behind for all . <p> All of this required striking a delicate balance . I wanted to write an interesting and accurate story to give a true understanding of Bridie as a person . At the same time I was not prepared to divulge every last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in her life , which might hurt people . So I decided I would not perform an autopsy , but rather write the story of a real person that was credible , insightful and honest , even if I found some of it painful . In other words , neither overly sanitised , nor brutally sensational . How well this balance has been achieved in the book , and for that matter , how well it is written , is for others to judge . For me , as the author , it 's been a truly emotional but deeply satisfying process of discovery and learning . <p> I wonder now would Bridie , who made famous A Mother 's Love 's a Blessing , bless her son 's efforts ?

@@3675238 <h> BIM People -- Bill East -- Prairie Sky Consulting <h> Bill East is a prolific construction management researcher whose career spans the areas of planning and scheduling , quality management , and building information modelling . Bill speaks to BIMIreland.ie in advance of his Keynote Speaker Address at the 2015 CITA BIM Gathering . <p> East currently is Owner of Prairie Sky Consulting where he helps owners and contractors specify and meet Construction-Operations Building information exchange ( COBie ) requirements . East is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Virginia and Fellow , American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) . East has a BSc in Civil Engineering from Virginia Tech , and MSc and PhD degrees from the University of Illinois . Bill will be a speaker at the 2015 CITA BIM Gathering . <p> Topic : Global BIM and the 2015 CITA BIM Gathering <p> When did your interest in BIM begin ? <p> I moved from the construction trailer to the research lab in the 1980s . At that time , a group at the lab had developed a prototype to link databases to CADD . This system added height and could render in 3D . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these technologies including : STEP , IGES , and PDES . It seemed to me that the groups could never get enough progress and after a few years they changed their names and splintered into something else . After completing several major projects in the areas of project management and design quality , I began my direct participation with the US chapter of the current penultimate group -- the International Alliance for Interoperability ( IAI ) . Today , this group is called buildingSMART international ( bSi ) . <p> Unfortunately , owner 's contracts specify BIM deliverables poorly . They do so without thought as to what they will do with the information once they receive it . They do so without thinking about what information they actually need , will use , or have the possibility of maintaining . In addition these contracts focus on technology , not outcomes . <p> On can use the following analogy to think about what 's wrong with these contracts . Consider a contract drawing that shows an excavation . The incorrect specification then tells the Contractor what kind of backhoe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technology choice is always left to the Designer or Contractor , and the risk and reward of those choices left to them . <p> What will be the main areas you will look to address at the Gathering ? <p> I will be talking about " building information " as something that designers and builders do every day . Unfortunately , the information is locked in documents that have to be interpreted by other people . We ca n't get the information out of these documents without reading each one and transcribing the information we need . <p> I invented the Construction-Operations Building information exchange ( COBie ) specification to organize construction handover information in a consistent way for every building . The work , since COBie 's first publication in 2007 , has been to help software companies extract the information we put on drawings and in Operations and Maintenance ( O&amp;M ) manuals . Once the information is off the page and into a standard format the information is available to facility maintenance , operations , and management . <p> The by-product for designers is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information they need . Designers can design the information and workflows needed to deliver the Owner 's required information . <p> The by-product for contractors is that they can reduce or eliminate job-site surveys and O&amp;M manual production , decrease the cost of commissioning , and reduce administrative overheads . Contractors can reduce their cost of doing business , while simultaneously delivering a better product to their clients . <p> Do you think BIM is for everyone from small to large size design firms and contractors ? <p> It depends on the goal and the company . Designers who want to produce construction drawings by slicing models can do this and reduce , or retrain , existing staff . Contractors with complex MEP can adopt BIM for shop drawing coordination and actually eliminate field changes of prefabricated duct and pipe runs . <p> On the other hand , Designers and Contractors who want to do the same job that they did yesterday , will find they can not effectively implement BIM , or any new technology . It does n't matter if it 's a large firm or small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step back and look at how they do work to identify every time they recreate information already known and documented before , then the firm will be successful with their BIM implementation . <p> What are the key challenges witnessed to the adoption of BIM internationally ? <p> If you ask someone in most design or construction office why they do something the answer will typically be , " Because we 've always done it this way . " Firms do not know how much it costs to deliver services . They may be able to price a wall down to the brick , they are unlikely to be able to explain the supply chain that most efficiently moves that brick from the mud to the wall . Knowing the cost of doing business is the basis of virtually all other modern industries -- except ours . <p> After 35 years of creating and deploying software to over a hundred thousand users across the world , I can tell you that the adoption of good technology in a well-managed business will make that business significantly more efficient ; allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . If , however , the same technology is put into a company that is not well-managed , the change will be chaotic and the technology will likely be abandoned or marginalized . <p> The adoption of any new technology requires management commitment to train staff , the need to address business partner and stakeholder needs , the need to understand how standard operating procedures will change , and ( and only then ) learn the technology . Understanding the role of each of these factors is the key challenge in BIM , or any other change management process . Technology is really the easiest part , and the easiest part to get wrong . <p> What are the main topics at international conferences and forums , in the question sessions and among the attendees ? <p> Designers and Contractors of well-managed businesses see the value of streamlined business processes . They see the potential for increased profit and improved customer satisfaction that keeps them in business for the long-term . The question they all ask is " How ? " I hope that attendees will find my presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their answer to this question . <p> Will BIM affect the professions and their boundaries , and the traditional statuses of those professions ? <p> Many BIM advocates in the US have an aspirational view of technology and its impact on our industry . I have a different view . In my view , it is not the technology but the specification of standardized outcomes , produced as a result of technology that drive innovation . The role of standards is critical . Standards ensure that outcomes are understood by all parties . As a result of work I did for the Army , Corps of Engineers the US now has published standards that define deliverables for Building Programming ( BPie ) , HVAC design ( HVACie ) , Plumbing design ( WSie ) , Electrical design ( Sparkie ) , and Construction Handover ( COBie ) . Readers can download these standards from https : **30;1652;TOOLONG and get examples at https : //www.nibs.org/ ? page=bsacommonbimfiles . <p> Yes . Process standardization is inevitable ; it is the basis for our economy . So the only real questions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How ? " <p> Until Owners begin to specify information deliverables as outcomes of their projects , there is really no need for Designers and Contractors in protected markets to do anything . However , once local Owner 's contracts begin to change , then those who do not understand their existing processes will find it more , and more , difficult to compete . Following my keynote presentation a breakout session will show owners how to contract for , and get , the information they need to maintain , operate , and manage their buildings . <p> The contents of this site are subject to copyright laws and may not be reproduced in any form without the prior written consent of the publishers .

On 28 minutes , sloppy play by Limerick near halfway led to a quick breakaway which required Paul O'Conor to cut out the danger inside the penalty area . From another counterattack , the home defence needed to be alert to block efforts from Timlin and Conor McCormack . <p> After surviving that seven-minute spell , Limerick at least looked more composed in the closing stages of the first half and a favourable bounce of the ball led to a half-chance for Faherty , who advanced into the Derry penalty box but could n't hit the target with McBride tracking him every step of the way . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved performance in the second half but , in the 54th minute , the Super Blues were dealt a hammer blow .

@@3681238 <h> Rugby World Cup : Best of Pool C <p> Although New Zealand were underwhelming in the pool stages , they still topped their Pool . Here 's a look at the all the best action from Pool C. <p> 1 . Fastest World Cup try <p> New Zealand v Georgia was a memorable match for many reasons , the main one being Waisake Naholo scoring the quickest try in World Cup history . <p> It took the man who recovered from a broken leg in just 10 weeks , only 72 seconds to cross over for a try that showed his pace and power in full definition . <p> The record breaking score was created after New Zealand won clean ball in the lineout , allowing Dan Carter give a deep pass to Naholo , who charged his way through 3 Georgians to score an easy try . <p> A seven try onslaught followed . <p> 2 . Mamuka Gordgodze awarded man of the match <p> The Georgian captain was one of the outstanding talents of this World Cup . Against the All Blacks , Gordgodze put in some trademark monstrous tackles and keeping the scoreboard very respectable at half-time . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , Kieran Read and Aaron Smith to name a few , it was Mamuka Gorgodze who picked up the man of the match award .

Namibia v Argentina- Johnny Wilkinson Redelinghuys <p> Although Namibia lost their final World Cup game against Argentina 64-19 , you only had to look at the delight on Jacques Burger 's face to see what scoring 3 tries meant to the Namibians . <p> The moment of the match came when prop Johnny Redelinghuys attempted to convert Namibia 's final try as the clock turned red . <p> Redelinghuys is the Welwitschias ' most capped player , earning his 50th and final cap for his country against Argentina . <p> His conversion was everything you could have expected from a prop forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . It topped off an incredibly entertaining game and all of us at Pundit Arena hope Mr. Redelinghuys has a happy retirement . <p> 4 . New Zealand v Tonga- Haka v Sipi Tau <p> One of the most intense moment of the World Cup occurred during the opening moments of the clash between New Zealand and Tonga . <p> Tonga laid down the gauntlet with a passionate and intimidating Sipi Tau , only to be met with an equally passionate Haka . <p> The crowd at St. James ' Park savoured the moment as both teams performed their pre-match rituals . This moment of tension added immeasurably to the game that followed , as New Zealand won on a score line of 47-9 . <p> 5 . Winger Master Class from New Zealand and Argentina <p> This pool has seen some quality wingers perform during its 10 games . <p> Nehe Milner-Skudder was the talking point going into the tournament after his impressive debut .

We have been particularly blessed this year by favorable currency rates but these are n't steadfast and it will be important for tourism businesses to ensure they are not stranded if that tide goes out .

A lack of capacity could mean an increase in price at an unsustainable rate " <p> " We need to remain competitive on an international playing field " <p> Noting this , Quinn added " Despite this resurgence within tourism , it is heartening to note that there are clear heads within the industry who appreciate that we need to maintain competitiveness and value for money in order to sustain growth . Capacity will also become a more acute issue , particularly in Dublin , as growth continues . We need to work towards a longer season , greater regional dispersal of visitors and additional accommodation provision where necessary if we are to sustain current level of growth for years to come . Within an industry which worked together to exit a recession , I am confident we can equally meet the challenges of success . "

They were not quite as good as they seemed in the quarter-finals because , well , France were like a giant can of oui-oui . <p> Equally they were not quite a bad as their subdued performance against South Africa last Saturday in Twickenham would suggest . <p> Before we begin , I would like to make it obvious that I am not an apologist for the All Blacks but , when it comes to who takes the pot home on Saturday , more than anything I think it is important that the side that attempts to play rugby the way it should be played deserves to win . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rugby will be the winner if New Zealand 's all-court game triumphs . They do play brilliant rugby - sustained brilliance . <p> New Zealand struggled in the semi-final for two reasons . One was because the Boks do n't lie down and die for anyone . You have to admire the South Africans for their desire and warrior code , they just do n't give up . <p> The second reason the All Blacks struggled goes down to referee Jerome Garces . Some commentators in the press thought he had a fine game ; I just can not concur with that notion . <p> Here is my understanding of how the game of rugby union is played : <p> It is a simple game and the principles have n't changed that much in over a hundred years . You win ball at the set-piece . With that ball , you apply pressure by running , passing or kicking the ball . <p> The better sides always try to retain the ball in hand when applying pressure . The opposition either concede territory , penalties or tries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly 70pc territory . They nicked five South African lineouts , ran the ball 387 metres to South Africa 's 149 and astonishingly missed only three tackles all day compared to the 20 missed by the Boks . <p> South Africa never threatened the All Black line once and were limited to the point of predictability yet there was only two points between the teams . <p> There is no other team game in the world besides rugby union that is held hostage by the peccadillos and peculiarities of the referee . <p> Garces is a decent referee but the penalty count of 14-6 against New Zealand is irreconcilable to the core values of how the game is played . <p> A penalty count of 14-6 against South Africa would seem to be appropriate on the run of play and the way the stats went . If South Africa conceded 12 penalties against Japan , how come they only conceded six against a side that would be immeasurably superior to the Brave Blossoms ? <p> New Zealand did give an undisciplined performance in many regards and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but some of them were not and I thought South Africa got away with murder on the gain-line all day and at the breakdown . <p> South Africa get into New Zealand 's territory six times and get six kickable penalties . New Zealand spend the day camped in South African territory with their opposition under all sorts of pressure and only get two kickable penalties . <p> I think Nigel Owens will referee both sides on Saturday and will make it an entertaining contest . He will be challenged , particularly at the breakdown , where it will be a game of bluff and double bluff . <p> The intuition and smarter application here particularly by the back-rows will be telling . Sometimes holding back will be the best thing to do - how many cards for rolling an opponent above the neck ? <p> New Zealand won last Saturday because both Springbok wingers were asleep at the wheel . JP Pietersen 's positioning for Beauden Barrett 's try was something a 12-year-old winger would have trials of conscience about for years . <p> What we will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides - undoubtedly the best two in the tournament - are in the final . <p> The great thing about Australia is that not only do they not fear New Zealand ; they also know that they can take them . <p> The New Zealand back-row , and Kieran Read in particular , has n't played even close to their potential . <p> Control <p> If that situation continues then they will lose the breakdown and probably the match . But if the New Zealand pack get on top in the second half , Australia will not be able to control the pace of the game off the back foot . <p> If Dan Carter and Aaron Smith are allowed unrestricted channels to control the pace of the game , that will be that . <p> New Zealand have this amazing facility to recover themselves from a subdued or poor performance . <p> Australia are unlucky that the chances of a bushwhack are remote .

Turning a decade-long friendship into a deadline-free collaboration , Matt Berninger ( The National ) and Brent Knopf ( formerly of Menomena and current Ramona Falls main man ) faced the daunting task of whittling over 450 of Knopf 's demos down to 11 fully formed songs . Do n't be fooled . EL VY ( pronounced like a plural of Elvis , obviously ) may have hit the funny button with their goofball videos and daft Instagram antics , but the pair 's debut release runs the gamut of emotions . Described by Berninger as a record of " really personal things and a bunch of bad jokes " , Return to The Moon finds common ground in a nostalgic , wry , white-collar angst while adding new shades to the duo 's palette . <p> At its best Knopf 's intricate production stands shoulder to shoulder with Berninger 's abstract lyrics , the chords and syllables folding around each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track 's guitar knots and funk rhythms set things up nicely , injecting an earworm tune into a song with oblique references to politics , family , alienation and loss . I 'm the Man to Be is even better , an overblown , megalomaniac pisstake inspired by Schoolboy Q 's There He Go ( which itself features a Knopf-penned Menomena sample ) . It overflows with striking images ( " I 'll be the one in the lobby in the collared fuck-me shirt . The green one " is Berninger at his best ) and smart musical left turns . <p> The gorgeous Paul Is Alive playfully channels Berninger 's Ohio youth and obsession with Californian punks The Minutemen , a theme that 's developed on the pseudo-glam Need a Friend . Still , a sparse , introverted atmosphere pervades proceedings . Songs drift into National-esque structures as Berninger 's trademark wine-bleached baritone dominates No Time to Crank The Sun and It 's a Game . It gets darker again when Knopf flexes his muscles with pulsating guitar crunches and brief bursts of noise on the companion pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intonations of " It 's agony " that haunt Careless makes the album 's earlier one-liners and in-jokes seem like a distant memory .

It 's a pity Rodney Smith wo n't get the plaudits he truly deserves until sometime in the future when his skills will be belatedly celebrated . A superb MC with a sharp , witty turn of phrase and an instinctive appreciation for the power of words , Smith has oddly never enjoyed the acclaim afforded lesser talents . Bleeds is another step on from 2011 's 4everevolution , with Smith taking stock of the world around him from a veteran 's perch in suburbia . He 's lost none of his ability to deliver tart commentary on both personal and universal issues , with Hard Bastards showing Smith 's observational eye on ordinary life .

" You showed everybody else that the limits that they had accepted on invention , expression , honesty , daring , were false , " critic Greil Marcus wrote in 2010 's Listening to Van Morrison . Even at this remove , the album retains its mystique . That is why any tinkering with the recording arouses suspicion . But this " remastered and expanded " version is a job well done . The remastering cleans up the sound sensitively while the expanded tracks feature two longer , and fascinating , versions of Slim Slow Slider ( a baroque coda , no less , topped by a godly invocation ) and Ballerina .

There must be times when John Newman curses the day another lanky , bequiffed soul singer appeared on his patch . But while Sam Smith has calibrated his voice and soppy ballads with the mainstream very much in mind , you get the sense that Newman is working to a different gameplan . On his second album , it 's all exuberant old-school soul and uptempo stompers from the Yorkshireman , with tracks bathed in swanky brass , dashing rare grooves and skyscraping gospel backing vocals . The retro-soul field is a crowded one but Newman and his producers Greg Kurstin and Jack Splash do well to differentiate the singer from the pack with strong , vibrant , anthemic tracks such as Give You My Love , Something Special and the funk-loaded We All Get Lonely.Jim Carroll <p> Run The JewelsMeow the Jewels Mass Appeal ? ? ?

Thomas Walsh has always borne his influences brazenly - but when those influences are classic pop bands like ELO , The Kinks and The Beach Boys , where 's the harm ? His band 's sixth album is another stellar concoction of charming , melodic tunes that are infused with everything from country ( You Could Always Cry ) to chic bossa nova ( Clouds ) and psychedelic mariachi horns ( We Are Everywhere ) .

There are many thirtysomething women whose introductions in 1995 to basic feminist truths were discovered via Jagged Little Pill . Alanis Morissette may oversing on numerous songs here , but the emotional rubble she sifts through for meaningful nuggets has as much weight now as it did when the landmark record was first released . It 's easy to understand why the album - reissued/remastered here in a four-disc collector 's edition , with previously unreleased demos , a live concert in London from 1995 , and photos/essay - struck such a chord . " I am frustrated by your apathy , " she sings on the opening track , All I Really Want .

Courting the Squall sees him engage with similar topics , but the music is different ( and possibly signposts Elbow 's next steps ? ) . Opening track Angela 's Eyes is appealing in Tom Waits ' rag'n'bone shop style ; Broken Bottles and Chandeliers is as bold as it is brassy .

His circus extravaganza , left , as aficionados may be aware , comes in for attention in Jane Austen 's Emma and Charles Dickens ' The Old Curiosity Shop <p> Stage censorship and rioting in the auditorium -- topics well covered in the existing literature -- by no means exhaust the subject matter of law in regard to the theatre . As The Irish Stage : A Legal History ( Four Courts Press ) demonstrates , there is much more , and it is curious that these other questions have generally escaped detailed scrutiny . Just to identify them underscores that level of neglect : health and safety ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing ; entertainment duty ; performers ' employment ; the dramatic author 's performing right . All these questions are examined here and accompany a revisiting of the issues of riots and censorship , to the latter of which is appended discussion of the notorious Rose Tattoo prosecution ( 1957 ) and examination of texts such as William Prynne 's Histrio-Mastix ( London , 1631 ) and JW Calcraft 's Defence of the Stage ( Dublin , 1839 ) . <p> In addition , in the case of Ireland , three regulatory regimes affecting all manner of stage entertainment had a significant impact . Constituting the law writ large , none of the three can be ignored in a volume promising an account of the legal history of the Irish stage . These were : first , the office of Master of the Revels , founded in 1638 , and which came to an inglorious end in 1830 ; second , the contentious licensing jurisdiction claimed by the lord mayor of Dublin ; and last , but by no means least , the mandatory scheme of theatre patents for Dublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only finally done away with in 1997 . <p> In recounting the history of these varied forms of control , the volume introduces the reader to what is an extraordinary sequence of key figures , actor-managers such as Thomas Sheridan , Spranger Barry and Richard Daly as well as to an understanding of the well-known rivalry for the later eighteenth century in Dublin between Smock Alley and Crow Street . <p> It is barely possible to write meaningfully on these several overarching legal regimes without glancing over one 's shoulder , as it were , at contemporaneous developments in Britain . Two very obvious differences stand out even so : leaving Belfast and Cork to one side , the legislative lacuna as regards provincial theatre in Ireland ; amd the lack in Ireland of the office of Lord Chamberlain and , in consequence , the absence of his key role in stage censorship , a role only brought to an end in Britain by the adoption of the Theatres Act there in 1968 . At the same time , an Irish political input into reforms affecting the theatre undertaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning : urging the concession of the dramatic author 's performing right in 1833 , and joining the campaigns to end stage censorship which culminated in the legislative abolition of it in 1968 . What this means is that The Irish Stage : a Legal History serves to fill a gap in the historiography of the stage in Britain as well . <p> Literary allusions enrich the story that the author unfolds . Se ? n ? Faol ? in 's short story , The Old Master , makes a fitting conclusion to the chapter on censorship . Then there is the case of Philip Astley , who was awarded the second Dublin theatre patent in 1788 . Astley 's circus extravaganza , as aficionados may be aware , comes in for attention in Jane Austen 's Emma and Charles Dickens ' The Old Curiosity Shop . It is something of a pity that a rope-dancer as distinguished and as professionally accomplished as Signora Violante ( fl. 1730s ) can not lay claim to such literary fame . The phenomenon of the hack dramatist that it was hoped , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not encourage , is splendidly resurrected in passages in both Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope . Victor Crummles offers Nicholas Nickleby a job as a playwright-in-residence with a mandate to frame original plays around recently acquired stage props such as " a red pump and two washing tubs " ( Nicholas Nickleby , ch. 22 ) . Also worthy of recall is Mr Toogood 's assertion conveyed to Mr Harding in Trollope 's The Last Chronicle of Barset ( ch. 42 ) that " there have been many theatrical managers ... who have usually made up their pieces according to the dresses they have happened to have in their wardrobes " . <p> A number of the law cases introduced into the narrative are English in origin , and justify their presence in the absence of any pertinent Irish discussion . The cases include those provoked by the determination of the opera singer Johanna Wagner to renege on her deal of 1852 to sing roles from Mayerbeer , Bellini and Gluck exclusively at His Majesty 's Theatre in London . They also include those surveyed in chapter 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most remarkable within this group of cases is surely Day v. Simpson ( 1865 ) , a prosecution brought over a spectacular show put on at a concert-hall in Birmingham . This was an entertainment dubbed Pepper 's Ghost . What was remarkable about this production was that the majority of actors and actresses performed from a chamber below the stage -- a complicated amalgam of lenses and mirror being employed to reflect all of these onto mirrors at the back of the stage . There was a great deal of dancing , mime and singing . No changes of scenery or of dress occurred . Day , the impresario , a licensed victualler from Birmingham , in his appeal , was to argue that Pepper 's Ghost was " no entertainment of the stage ' - the crucial criteria requiring to be satisfied for possible sanction under British legislation of the time - but rather an entertainment below it . Unsurprisingly , perhaps , the argument failed , the Queen 's Bench preferring to affirm the original conviction . <p> If , for comparative purposes , England makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other jurisdictions where personalities and developments there happen to be mentioned in the various chapters . This is not an attempt to compose a legal history of the stage in global terms , but it is not too fanciful to suggest that by putting foreign flesh and bones on the native story , the arguments and the picture that the author has sought to put across are both improved and embellished . <p> No apologies , therefore , for including the cast of unlikely characters which the reader who persists will encounter on their journey through some 276 pages : Herodotus , Cicero , Moli ? re , Rostand , Ibsen , Diaghilev , the Kaiser , Gustaf Gr ? ndgens and Joseph Goebbels . Nor for including in the pictures section and on the dust jacket ( back ) images of a disastrous theatre fire in Vienna in December 1881 ( over 500 deaths ) , or that image , also on the dust jacket ( front ) and inside , based on Eug ? ne Delacroix 's gruesome evocation of the beheading , on April 17th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 14th-century Doge of Venice , Marino Faliero . This episode was recalled by Swinburne , by Delavigne and by Byron , to whose play on the career of Faliero , which prompted an important legal precedent in 1822 , there is a mysterious allusion in the American novelist Donna Tartt 's The Secret History ( 1992 ) . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .

I do n't mean the creamy chicken style , but rather the glistening broth with shreds of meat , usually thick with noodles . <p> It 's so restorative and is often referred to as " Jewish penicillin " due to the fact that it 's usually prescribed to keep a cold or flu at bay . It 's light , full of flavour and easily digested . I add some Chinese Five Spice to mine , and it really needs little else . I love miso paste . It 's worth buying a nice organic one ; I use Clearspring Brown Rice Miso . <p> Miso is a paste made from fermented soya beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months , the resulting miso has rich and complex flavours and an abundance of umami , the fifth taste . So many dishes benefit from a little of the paste . I add it to gravy , stews and marinades . It 's fantastic on roasted vegetables , especially aubergine , and is lovely in French onion soup . <p> You can also use it in sweet dishes . Add to chocolate recipes as you would a pinch of salt . A little in home-made caramel sauce tastes amazing . In order to maximise the enzymatic benefits of the miso , it 's usually added at the end of cooking . I add it early here so that it helps to develop the taste of the broth and chicken , but you can add half at the start and half at the end . Stagger it with the Chinese Five Spice in order to maintain a fresh flavour . <p> I use egg noodles in this recipe , but tagliatelle or even pasta bows can be used .

To most of us , this is a good old-fashioned stock . What was the Sunday roast would often become the base for a soup on Monday . It 's a thrifty thing to do , and , while it 's not always convenient , it 's always worth doing . <p> I usually leave my stock to cool , then freeze it in half-pint-sized Ziploc bags . It is perfect for adding to risottos , stews or soups -- anything that needs an injection of pure flavour and depth . <p> It 's hard to gain that level of flavour from a stock cube , even one of those newfangled gel ? e instant stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me his favourite food : stock sandwiches .

Are little irritations part of the bigger picture , or are you being petty ? <p> Relationship expert Dr. Karen Phillop decided to drum down the details you need to know before making a long-term commitment to your other half . <p> Speaking to MailOnline , Phillop addresses some of the deal breakers you need to agree on before walking up the aisle : <p> Children : <p> It might sound obvious , but making sure you 're on the same page when it comes to having kids is vital for a marriage to last . Having the conversation of when , how many and where to raise your family should all be taking into consideration . <p> Issues with your in-laws : <p> Yes , you know it 's healthy to be honest and open with your other half , but it 's important to remember that you 're still talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their past and their future . <p> Try and be calm , and broach any issues sensitively to avoid hurt . <p> Phillop explains : <p> " You need to know that your partner loves their parents unconditionally - they may not even see the things they do as they may have been raised in a family where , for example , fights at the dinner table are normal . <p> " To us , the way we are raised is normal , so be mindful in how you phrase your issues and never throw out the phrases " how could you let them do that " or " why would you let them speak like this " etc .

' <p> Great Sexpectations <p> Phillop advises this conversation to take place as early into your relationship as possible . <p> Being aware of each other 's sex drives and needs will help both parties to feel connected and involved -- while eliminating any feelings of pressure or neglect when it comes to the bedroom . <p> While it might sound cold to keep a schedule , Phillop suggests including your daily activity as part of the routine leading into foreplay : <p> " I tell them that foreplay starts at 6am when you open your eyes . <p> " The alarm goes off , you get dressed , have breakfast , do n't talk much , maybe text about dinner arrangements , have dinner , then hop in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is thinking " well , you 've ignored me all day and now you expect this " . <p> " Where he is turned on at the sight of her in the shower , she is n't - she gets turned on by the foreplay that starts at 6am where he considers her , helps her , talks about her day and asks her how she feels - THAT is foreplay to a woman .

But that 's not to say it 's a walk in the park for her , as she brings a distinctive , endearing sense of vitriol to the part , which did n't even seem possible beforehand .

It leaves a sour taste in the mouth , as while there is something almost magical and ethereal about this mysterious , eponymous presence , Hytner uses up enough artistic licence to last to his next production .

This year has been an eventful one , with a return to dairying and a new flower variety being tried out . Like a lot of Irish farmers , Darragh has taken the opportunity of the end of the dairy quota system to expand milk production with the neighbouring Leonard farm . The 500 cow herd milked well through the summer , but the collapse in the milk price left little enough return . Meanwhile , a salmonella outbreak hit the calves , and the returns from the Sweet William were not so sweet . <p> Also back this Autumn will be our popular ' Food Journeys ' strand where we take an in-depth look at how food makes its way to our plates .

Esther grew up on a suckler farm in Rathgormack in Co Waterford . <p> She took up milking to earn pocket money and fell in love with it - so much so that she 's now managing an 800 cow herd in Lismore in Co Waterford . Darragh McCullough went to Lismore to visit the very busy Esther who showed him how a herd that size is managed and how she finds time in her hectic schedule to relax . <p> This week Helen Carroll travels to Tipperary to ask what can be done to combat the rise in crime in rural Ireland .

As a result vital natural ball skills learnt in rugby at a young age may not be picked up as kids may rather focus on their dribbling skills with the round ball instead . <p> Essentially these two rugby nations learn the game differently . Instead of England Rugby vs Manchester United or Liverpool , it is the All Blacks vs low grade football outfits . Therefore , it is a lot different to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I guess gives them an advantage over most other nations worldwide . <p> Now I 'm not trying to begrudge the English rugby skillet or their passion for the game because there have been some sublime ball players in the past .

Yes investing in a Super Rugby team may be the way to go here , but I believe more has to be done to get England back to the top . <p> As a New Zealander it would be great to see England eventually find the type of game that suits them as they are fierce rivals . I do n't want to see England become the All Blacks version 2.0 , because quite frankly we view the game and play the game differently . <p> England Rugby need to execute on all levels of the game first before they can make changes at the top .

They need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and put all their energy into finding a style of game that can be taught to kids at a young age , which they can then develop to hopefully become England stars of the future . <p> The current kicking and mauling mentality of English Rugby may have worked in the past but to keep up with the evolution of rugby , in my opinion they will have to find a way of combining their strong set-piece with a blistering attack and higher skillset . If they can get all these aspects ticking then maybe , just maybe we will see England hoisting up old Bill in 2019 . <p> <p> What would you change about English Rugby Pundit Arena fans ?

The Tir Chonaill trio of Geraldine McLaughlin , Treasa Doherty and Ciara Hegarty were all nominated but went home empty handed from the weekend 's gala ceremony at the Citywest Hotel . Geraldine McLaughlin was named Ulster Writers Player of the Year on Friday night in Bundoran and her exclusion from the All-Star selection probably raised the most eyebrows . <p> Ex-boss Davy McLaughlin said he was curious as to how the selection process actually works . Even the nominations , when released last month , left him confused .

@@3815235 <h> Gold medal for breathtaking cynicism <h> backpage@independent.ie <h> Eamonn Sweeney <p> What a difference a week makes . This time last week the Russian doping scandal seemed like one of those seismic stories with the ability to rock a sport to its foundations . Not only were the Russians apparently guilty of operating a state-sponsored doping programme , their anti-doping officials were extorting money from athletes to cover up positive drug tests and they had allegedly bribed the IAAF president Lamine Diack to help them get away with it all . <p> There was even talk of the Russians being excluded from the Rio Olympics , and also some odd talk about a 1984 Olympics-style boycott if this happened , presumably from people who have n't noticed that Russia does n't actually rule many foreign countries these days . Who was going to pull out along with them ? The Crimea ? Chelsea ? Meanwhile , the Russian government came out with the expected defence that this was all a Western conspiracy . <p> It looked like there was no way back for the Russians . After such knowledge , what forgiveness ? <p> But this week things look a bit different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approach can be summed up by this comment by an IAAF spokesman : " Everyone within the IAAF will work tirelessly with authorities in Russia on the reinstatement of the All-Russia Athletics Federation as soon as possible as this is the best outcome for the athletes . This is the first and only priority right now for the IAAF and for Russia . " <p> The mind boggles . The ' first and only priority ' is to get the Russians back within the fold , a process Vadim Zelchenok , the acting president of ARAF , says should take " two or three months " . Zelchenok may be a bit optimistic there as the IAAF have said they wo n't make a decision on reinstatement until after the World Indoor Championships in March . That 's when a five-man inspection team will report back to the IAAF on whether the Russians are now ' compliant ' . Never mind what happened in the past , if the Russians punish the officials and athletes involved in doping then everything will apparently be tickety-boo and they can start again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to portray Russia 's probable exclusion from the world indoors as some kind of humiliation , the fact is that , considering what we 've learned about a doping programme which , given the involvement of state security services , must have been sanctioned at the top level , this is lamentably weak stuff . The inspection team is already under pressure by knowing the priority is returning Russia to international competition . <p> International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach seems disposed to find Russia innocent before the inspection even begins . " I welcome the fact that the Russian Olympic Committee expressed its commitment to protect the clean athletes and to sanction all the doped athletes and officials . We are confident that the initiatives being proposed by the ROC , with the responsible international organisations , WADA and the IAAF , will ensure compliance as soon as possible in order to provide participation of the clean Russian athletes at the Olympic games . " <p> Given that the most eye-catching part of the World Anti-Doping Authority report which sparked the current crisis was the fact that the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of their doping programme , Mr Bach 's faith is touching . <p> There 's not a word from the Russians about Western plots now . Both Vladimir Putin and his sports minister Vitaly Mutko are now talking about the need to tackle doping , something they also feel can be done in a couple of months or so . Expect lots of suspensions for athletes and officials who are expendable in these matters . And nothing else being said about Russia 's role in the whole thing . The cynicism is breathtaking . <p> The great American 400m hurdler Ed Moses sounded a note of decency rare in this saga when he told WADA 's board meeting in Colorado Springs on Wednesday that " the only sanction is to say that enough is enough . It is to state loudly and clearly that the Russian athletics team can not go to Rio . I had many close friends who had irreplaceable moments stolen from them .

There are countless important questions regarding the current state of cinema and I 'm here to answer them . <p> Even if you do n't win , it 's still an honor to be nominated . What about the films that do n't even get nominated , though ? There have been numerous classic films throughout history that could n't even merit a single Oscar nomination , from Once Upon a Time in America , to The Breakfast Club , to Bringing Up Baby . The list just goes on . Despite being one of the most successful and acclaimed franchises of recent years , The Hunger Games has yet to be recognized by the Academy Awards in any categories . <p> Granted , a Best Picture nomination has probably never been in cards for The Hunger Games . This is n't because the films are n't worthy . Personally , I thought Catching Fire was one of the best films of 2013 . These movies were never going to resonate with the Academy , though , because they do n't seem " important " or " serious " enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " teen stuff . " That 's one of the reasons why they also refused to get on the Harry Potter bandwagon . <p> The Harry Potter movies at least accumulated twelve technical nominations at the Oscars over the years . Meanwhile , The Hunger Games movies have only managed to get three Golden Globe nominations in the Best Original Song category . It 's a royal shame this series has been constantly overlooked for its art direction , its hairstyling and makeup , and especially its costume design . With the release of Mockingjay -- Part 2 , the Academy only has one more chance to honor The Hunger Games for its impressive production values . <p> In addition to excelling on a technical level , Mockingjay -- Part 2 is also one of the 2015 's best blockbusters . With the final entry in the saga , director Francis Lawrence hit his target with powerful drama and riveting action . While Catching Fire remains the franchise 's most complete adaptation , this fitting conclusion still leaves Katniss Everdeen on a high note .

Just as appalling , the Transformers movies have garnered a total of seven Oscar nominations . Worst of all , even Norbit was nominated for an Oscar .

What relief then for the parents of young drivers everywhere who need never worry again about precious Sorcha or darling Hugo totaling mummy 's Land Rover . <p> Of course , there are absolutely no potholes in this ingenious ( and possibly well-intentioned ) plan to cut down on crashes , because if one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a musical recommendation from a chartered psychologist with a " specialist knowledge of customer-brand personas " , whatever that means . <p> The other spanner in the works is that for the song to make any impact , you would need to listen to it on repeat , denying your innate personal freedoms and resisting the temptation to switch to Devil Music FM for a bit of respite . <p> Having heard the song , that situation seems as likely as your Volkswagen being environmentally friendly . Safe In Sound ( available from Spotify and Soundcloud ) sounds like the hold music at an orthodontist 's surgery with Barry Manilow 's deranged lovechild playing a Casio keyboard in the background . <p> Perhaps a more sensible road-safety strategy would be to simply avoid blaring AC/DC 's Back in Black and Britney Spears ' Toxic ( the songs deemed most likely to make you crash ) . Dr Moore 's research may also cause fans of Bob Marley , Metallica , Jay Z and Jamie Cullum ( I defy you to find a Jamie Cullum fan ) to reconsider their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy metal , hip hop and jazz were found to encourage bad driving . <p> That said , if you can endure all three minutes and 51 seconds of Safe In Sound without driving your car into a tree then congratulations . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .

Aine Fitzgerald met Savoy managers past and present , Tom English and Ronan Branigan , for a trip down memory lane . <p> TOM English was a 13-year-old " green , country young fella " when he first stepped inside Limerick 's Savoy Theatre . <p> He came into the city from his home village of Hospital to see a legend of his childhood years , entertainer Jimmy O'Dea .

" <p> When it opened its doors in 1935 the Savoy primarily served as a cinema but over the next half century went on to become Limerick 's main theatrical venue -- playing host to national and international acts including Roy Orbison , Tom Jones , Joe Dolan and his band The Drifters , the Hall ? Orchestra , Rory Gallagher and The Dubliners . <p> For the audiences who attended over the decades , it was a thrill to be there .

During Tom 's eight years at manager of the Savoy there were more than 50 people employed there . <p> " And you could put your ace of hearts on them , " says Tom , whose son Alan is the editor of the Limerick Leader . <p> " In the eight years I was there we never had to call a guard . <p> " The restaurant actually kept the cinema going , " he recalls . " There were two floors of restaurants . We had dozens of restaurant staff . We had four chefs , and then we had a snack bar downstairs .

" <p> Also among the staff at the time were the two Ryans -- Jim and Michael -- who worked at front of house and Alec O'Farrell , who was the maintenance man , stage manager and head cleaner . There were eight cleaners in total -- six women and two men . Jimmy Carter was in the operating box , and Benny Franklin , the electrician , looked after the heating . There were also two junior ushers , a couple of pageboys , and eight usherettes . <p> The Savoy had built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to maintain that reputation , everything had to appear perfect -- the brass ashtrays had to sparkle , the air had to " smell of roses " . <p> Every detail mattered . <p> " Everything had to be done five-star and , as I look around the hotel here today , it 's the same , " says Tom , casting his eyes around the luxurious Liszt Lounge on the first floor as Johann Sebastian Bach 's instrumental Christmas CD plays softly over the modern sound system . <p> Back in those early days , there were two different staff uniforms -- a summer one and a winter one . In winter , it was deep purple with gold braiding and gold cufflinks . <p> For the summertime , it was light grey with red trimmings . <p> To have secured a job in the Savoy was a badge of honour . " There was a staff parade every day -- all the staff had to line up in their uniforms and you would be told who is on a day off and so on , " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three screenings from at 3pm , 5pm and 8pm .

They could leave them there all night , no trouble . <p> Was there any graffiti or vandalism ? " Zilch ! " comes the immediate reply from Tom . " Everyone knew how to behave themselves . " Different times . <p> Well after darkness had fallen over Henry Street , the heart of theatrical life in the city kept beating . A night watchman , Pat O'Shea , would sing while hoovering the lobby and a man would come every two months to tune the organ .

" <p> Such was the influence of the Catholic Church at the time , there were no pictures screened in Limerick during Lent . For seven weeks the Savoy remained closed and there was also no Sunday night pictures because it would interfere with the Novena . <p> " The stage door would have been around here on Henry Street , " continues Tom . " There was a box office . There were cheaper seats when you entered from Henry Street . " <p> The main entrance , of course , was on Bedford Row .

" There were so many couples I saw coming in as boyfriend and girlfriend -- or doing a line , as was the expression then -- who are married now .

" <p> The best friend the Savoy had in Limerick , according to Tom , was Earl Connolly who was in charge of the exceptionally popular entertainment pages in the Limerick Leader . Earl 's column was highly inflential and he was always keen to sell tickets for the Savoy . Whether the show was good , bad or indifferent , " he would give it the works " , Tom recalls with a fond smile . <p> He was manager for eight years and left in 1962 . He says January 1 , 1962 was " a day I 'll never forget . The reason I say that is it was the day television came to Ireland -- and that was the death knell of the big cinemas , all over Ireland .

" And I look up at where I used to stay , which was over the stage . " <p> For Ronan , who hails from Castleblaney in County Monaghan , Tom 's magical recollections have given him a new insight and even greater appreciation of the modern Savoy ship he now steers . " Coming to the hotel school in Shannon in 1987 when I arrived , the Savoy was then a cinema and we used to come in to it on our nights out in Limerick .

In New York we get huge amounts of corporate business , big Monday to Thursday traffic , people drinking during the week . It is much quieter at the weekends . Whereas in Singapore there is a constant nightlife , something on every night . In Dubai , you might not think it but there is a huge social drinking culture .

That 's why they have just 2pc unemployment . It 's not a bad idea ! Dubai is a place you can do absolutely anything as long as you respect the people there . There are no limits on what you can achieve . I love the people ... like the Irish , Arab people are very family-oriented . And there are lots of Irish people in top jobs over there ; Colm McLoughlin , who runs Dubai Duty Free , for example , the biggest Duty Free in the world . Or Gerald Lawless who runs Jumeirah Hotels " one of the best known luxury hotel chains in the Middle East , the company behind the famous Burj Al Arab . <p> He is still based in Dubai , where he lives with his partner , " but I 'm on a plane every second day .

Then there 's the devaluation of the Chinese yuan . <p> " The rise of the US dollar against the euro has held back Europeans , since in Dubai the currency is pegged to the US dollar . " But the best performing McGettigan 's is still the Jumeirah Lakes Towers in Dubai . " It does huge business . It is ground zero for so many people living there . <p> " In New York , everything has gone crazy again ; hotel rates have gone right back up . London has been slower to catch up - rates are up , but not as much as in New York .

In London and Singapore they will trip over themselves to welcome you because they know that business breeds business . I do n't know why that view is n't shared universally . " <p> As well as running McGettigan 's pub chain and the Bonnington in Dubai , Dennis is involved in several of the group 's Irish hotels . <p> He bought the Clanree in Donegal out of receivership for around ? 1.8m , when it was losing 150,000 a year .

We are connected to the local communities , sponsor local sports teams and employ local people . We have a great staff retention rate . <p> " Everyone is going nuts for Dublin hotels at the moment , paying top prices ... I think it 's crazy . I would buy 15 country hotels before I 'd buy one in Dublin ; the prices are so high that your risk is huge if anything goes wrong .

It 's renowned for the famous battle fought between the Tuatha D ? Danann and the Fir Bolg . The name Moytura means plains of pillars or plains of towers . The region is home to the legendary Cowboy Jack Holian . Inquire for Jack Holian around these parts and you 're immediately directed to Daffodil Ranch.It 's there you 'll find a larger-than-life character . What you see is what you get , and political correctness is sacrificed betimes in the telling of a good yarn . " Are ya with me ? " is the catchphrase he uses to keep you in tow when he regales you with stories about his life.As the original culchie , he entertained the nation when he appeared on The Late Late Show in 1989 . Over a quarter of a century ago and the Cowboy looks back fondly on that era . " I did a bit of a dance for Gay Byrne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a big hit for Brendan Shine . " I still sing it in the local pubs and I play the drums and I throw in a bit of Riverdance as well and the tourists love it . I was on Terry Wogan afterwards and he came here to interview me in my humble abode and told me he envied my lifestyle . I do n't know what the Queen Mother made of my shenanigans when she saw it . " So how did the Cowboy name -- the moniker he 's most recognised by -- come about ? " I always had a great interest in Gene Autry and Roy Rogers and the old cowboy films . When I was in London , a shop in Chelsea sold that kind of gear . I bought the shirt first , then the waistcoat and the boots and hat later . " I got a job in a club acting as MC and I 'd sing a few songs myself . When I came back to Ireland I continued to use the gear and the name stayed with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here looking for Jack Holian , they would n't know who you were talking about . " The name Daffodil Ranch came about when I was over in O'Malley 's pub in Cross one night . It was springtime and the place here was covered in daffodils . When I was leaving the pub Sal O'Malley , or Sally O'Brien as I affectionately called her God rest her , asked me : ' Are you heading for the ranch , Cowboy ? ' " I told her I was going to Daffodil Ranch . PJ Varley a well-known ironmonger below Cross , was listening . He said ' that 's a lovely name ' and that he 'd do something for me . A few weeks later he arrived with a piece of ironwork and ' Daffodil Ranch ' done out in lettering . We put it over the gate and it 's been known by that name ever since . " I 'm a big Mayo fan too and I hope they win the All-Ireland before I die but time is n't on my side . I played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in The Neale . We won the county junior final a few years back for the first time in their history and it was a wonderful achievement for a small area . The club awarded me the Hall of Fame a few years ago and I 'm very proud of that too . " <p> BUT look beyond the mirth and humour , and there 's a genuine sincerity to Cowboy Jack Holian . A gifted stonemason , every nook and cranny around his beautifully appointed Lackafinna home bears the hallmarks of the wonderful skills he inherited from his father . Lovely stone buildings and a fountain outside his back door that has become a wishing well that visitors to Daffodil Ranch throw coins into by way of making a wish come true.With the ever jovial glint in the eye , Jack says he removes the coinage , washes it and treats himself to brandy in Danagher 's , Lydon 's Lodge or The Crowe 's Nest in Cong.And it was to his masonry adroitness and gifted hands Jack turned when building a monument on his land in tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honour of my dad who died in 1986 . I wanted to do something for him because he was a wonderful father . " My mother died at the age of 37 and left a family of eight . My sister Nancy was only a year old when mum died and Dad reared us all . When Nancy was 12 she was sitting in the hob beside the open fire and her clothes caught fire . She ran outside and the wind fanned the flames more , and she got badly burned . " She was in Castlebar hospital for 11 weeks and she died from the burns she received . My father had to suffer that tragedy after losing his wife and he 'd come back here and sit in this spot . After he died I thought , I 'd do something he 'd be remembered by and I regard this as my best work . " It took me six months to complete and it 's there now forever more as a lasting tribute to him and the whole family are very proud of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards loads of people came to visit it and I have no issue with anyone coming here to see it . " ' The Big Valley ' and ' The Little House on the Prairie ' are other manmade creations of his . To build a road between the villages of The Derries and Gorthnacurra was always his dream . It was while standing on a quarry of stone overlooking the rugged landscape between both hamlets that the dream was first conceived . " I stood on that hill one day talking to a neighbour and I remarked how it looked like the Big Valley . I often said to my father how great it would be if there was a road through it linking the two places . ' Do n't be seaf ? id , ' he said , ' you 'd want to be a millionaire to do that ' . " I went to England and I met Rita Heverin from Tipperary and we married and had three children . Then she gave me the red card and divorced me and I came home . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when I returned . " But I never let go of the notion about the road , and it took me over six years to finish it . I had to build a bridge over a stream and whenever I had a few bob , I 'd buy a few posts and concrete railings to fence it off . " While I was making the road , I also built the little house there and I called it ' The Little House on the Prairie ' . I had an old Ferguson 20 tractor and I brought all the stone from the quarry . " Lots of locals use it now and they often go into the house to rest when they 're out walking . ' The Edge ' who plays with U2 , or Dave Evans ( as we knew him ) lived here for a while . He and his kids often came down to walk it and they were amazed by it . " <p> IT seems a clich ? d question to ask a man of 81 summers down if he has any regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with total candour which is a true measure of the man . " I regret the way I treated my wife with all my messing around when we were married but women were my weakness and too often I gave into that . " Rita is a wonderful woman , and when I got sick a few months ago , my daughter wrote to her and she came back immediately to Lackafinna to look after me . And with all the wrong I did , I hope I 'll be remembered for doing some good things in my life too . " Through his gifted hands and stonework he 's already left a lasting legacy on the Plains of Moytura . And at home by the range in Daffodil Ranch is where he 's happiest now . Easy enough find him too because there 's only one Cowboy.

Although he did n't believe the " art " of pipe playing had deteriorated much , he remarked at how " the pipes have been less and less in evidence and the pipers becoming fewer every day . " In the very next breath , he took a swipe at some of the music 's recent changes , lamenting that " everything Irish has been dying out " and how " in Ireland they were adopting everything English or foreign -- concertinas , melodeons and the like , and all kinds of trashy music and songs . " <p> It was a rather dire outlook , but one that did n't account for the music 's resilience . Certainly , a lot has changed since Touhey 's time , especially as it relates to the concertina .

Mullaly , Elizabeth Crotty , Chris Droney , John Kelly , Paddy Murphy , Noel Hill , John Williams , Niall Vallely , and Jack Talty ( to name a few ) have helped " indigenize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most esteemed instruments .

" <p> A concertina " band " may sound like an odd proposition in theory , but in practice it reveals its worth in unexpected ways . The group itself was Collins 's idea . He brought it together in 2014 with the idea ( as stated in the album 's liner notes ) " to explore and experiment with the melodic , percussive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision was a good one . A range of well-forged playing styles , concertinas of different sizes and pitch ranges , and a unique musical vision , all brought under the umbrella of modern studio technique , have given this fascinating project rich results . <p> The album contains nine tracks ( all instrumental ) which take the instrument to places you 've likely never heard it . The arrangements range from the fairly straight forward to the more adventuresome . Take the album 's opener " Ard RI-March Of The Dal gCais , " which is a lovely track that fulfills the idea of what a concertina ensemble might sound like in comfortable terms . " Sunday Solitude / Hardiman The Fiddler " a pair of jigs ( the first of which is a Collins original ) is another that 's like this , as is the " Loftus Jones , " a neatly arranged take on the Carolan favorite that captures the beauty of the composer 's melody and expands a bit on it 's naturally baroque feel from a harmonic point of view . <p> But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " First Month Of Spring/Maghera Mountain/LA Overture , " arranged by ? Raghallaigh , Collins , and Rynne , is one such example . It 's a track that bears the stylistic hallmarks of the three arrangers and which allows one to really hear the personalities of each of the group 's players . But by track 's end , the music has moved beyond it 's starting point , perhaps without you even realizing it . The album 's final track , " Tir Na nOg / Sport , " which plays on the concertina 's percussive and harmonic elements , is a track that works in a similar vein . <p> Then there are tracks like " Aughty Sunrise " and " Floor Shark , " which stand out as different . The former , composed and arranged by Collins , is a beautiful conceived air that begins with some haunting sounds that evoke the briskness of a cold morning 's sunrise . It unfolds into something much more conventionally put , but the contrast here tells an interesting story . The latter track , composed and arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vein of what he 's done with his group Notify -- sleek , modern , atmospheric , and richly textured . Here , he challenges conventional notions about the concertina 's harmonic limitations and does it with great style . It 's a standout for me . <p> " Zero " is a forward thinking and eminently listenable album that truly extends the concertina 's voice . It 's amazing to me that this esteemed group of musicians could not only find the time schedule an album together , but that they could do something so different without bury the essential character of each of their playing . Given what we know about Patsy Touhey 's predisposition against the instrument , it 's likely he would have disapproved of ICE 's " Zero , " but given how far the concertina has come and how much farther this particular album takes it , I 'm certain that 's not a bad thing .

@@3889230 <h> 8 Stages Of A Relationship As Told Through A Couple 's Dinner Plans <p> A relationship 's timeline can usually be mapped quite accurately by analysing the couple 's dinner plans . <p> The early stages ( 0-6 months ) are often characterised by the casual dinner date -- when the couple takes their love-show on the road to rub other couples ' faces in their joy and obvious frequent sexual activities . Those trapped in the later stages of Advanced Relationship Apathy may feel the urge to slap their smug little faces but fear not eventually all relationships will pass through these eight stages , and the circle of life is complete . <p> Here 're 8 stages of a relationship as told through a couple 's dinner plans : <p> Stage 1 : Inappropriate use of cutlery ( Part 1 ) <p> First date territory : Eating foodstuffs intended to be consumed in one 's hands ( your chicken wings , your sandwiches , your burgers ) with cutlery . It looks ridiculous and who do we think we 're fooling ? He 'll only have to spend approximately two more hours with us to discover just what kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holding hands over the table making it near impossible for the waiter to do his job <p> Dates 2 through 4 : When I worked as a waitress I had to fight the near unCONTROLLABLE urge to claw those loving f*ckers ' hands apart . This is most likely why I no longer work in customer service . Also , it 's just lame . STOP holding hands over dinner . STOP IT . It 's show-boaty , just hold hands later when we all do n't have to look at you . <p> Stage 3 : " Let 's never be those people . " ( Part 1 ) <p> I call this DEEP smug-mode -- usually dates three through seven . I wager there is no couple in existence that has n't at one time ( probably while holding hands over the table ) ducked their heads conspiratorially in a restaurant and whispered " let 's never be those people , " indicating that sad couple ensconced in Stage 7 , sitting in silence eating their chicken wings with their hands and presumably quietly and sadly remembering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill nights aka let 's get fat together <p> Six months to a year : By now The Ride is a guarantee , so the restaurant outings are no longer a necessary and expensive mode of foreplay . This couple is easily spotted dashing from car to Thai place clutching their burgeoning love-gut to keep it from jiggling too much as they jog in for a spice bag and curry . <p> Stage 5 : Eating in bed ( in a good way ) <p> During the takeaway and chill night period , savvy couples may begin to simply skip the living room portion of the evening altogether , instead opting for a cosy sex-picnic of pizza in bed with wine and chocolates . Dry foodstuffs is our recommendation for this section of the relationship . <p> Stage 6 : Inappropriate use of cutlery ( Part 2 ) <p> Year one : Eating Nutella directly from the jar with a spoon and/or using a fork to scratch yourself in front of your partner . Frankly , I consider doing this to be something of a relationship breakthrough , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you both stopped pretending that you are not completely disgusting people . <p> Stage 7 : Eating in bed ( in a bad way ) aka The End of romance as you know it <p> Years 2-4 : Once there 're curry sauce stains on the duvet , and the entire bed has been invaded by toast crumbs and other unwelcome foodstuffs , you know that the eating in bed sex-picnic has devolved dramatically . It 's become a distinctly more sadness-tinged eating in bed barren sexless wasteland where there is zero potential for touching each other . Or orgasms originating from anything other than a particularly good sweet ' n ' sour chicken balls with fried rice . <p> Stage 8 : " Let 's never be those people . " ( Part 2 ) <p> Year 3-10 : Oh , it was the height of hubris to mock THOSE people because we ALL become THOSE people eventually . Greetings from stage 8 ! I can tell you this much : When sitting in complete silence barely even glancing up at The Man of a Friday night ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more effort is required on my end , I am unburdened of the need to appear exciting or interesting . He 's contractually obliged to sit in silence with me ; we have spawned a loin-fruit together meaning we have secured a future sponge-bath-giver for our dotage , and I have n't had to interfere with my body hair in over a decade . It 's f*cking bliss .

It 's something we pushed ourselves to do . " <p> The process of becoming a registered official has been intense , and it shows no sign of letting up . <p> " You go on the trial members training course and after that you can be put into games where you 're watching a referee , touch-judging , or even sharing a game .

However , with rugby renowned for the respect between players and officials , Glenda said that on the field they have found it to be no different for them . <p> " Both of us have actually had really good feedback from the teams . Almost every game after a match they 'll say that you 've done well . Some captains have said that it 's the quietest their team has been .

Paul was eating a banana and drinking water and both lads warmed up and did their stretching on the floor of the dressing room as Denis Moynihan was delivering his team talk .

@@3905236 <p> " Yes , absolutely ! Essentially Formula E is an efficiency competition between electrical powertrains . It 's really important to have an efficient car given that the FIA regulations limit the amount of electrical energy available to us . This is limited to 28 kilowatt hours from the Williams battery we use . " <p> So 28kWh -- what is that in layman 's terms ? <p> " If we assume that the average kettle takes about two minutes to boil , you could boil approximately 280 standard kettles from that amount of energy . Then our job is to convert that electrical energy into mechanical efficiency . " <p> Great ! So how do we do that ? <p> " Well , the idea is to maximise that 28kWh available as it is transferred through the powertrain and to the track . This year 's regulations have allowed us to design and develop our own powertrain , which comprises the e-motor , inverter and gearbox , as well as a system to cool it all .

" <p> Is there anything else we can do to improve efficiency ? <p> " As with all forms of motor racing it is also vital that we can make the car as light as possible . Regulations dictate that the minimum weight ( including driver ) should be 888kg , so we try and stay as close to that as possible .

This Christmas across Ireland , older people will mourn partners they nursed through terminal illness over the past year , while young expectant mothers will long for next year , which will be the first Christmas for a new arrival . <p> So while the advertisers plot their spring campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ( as they undoubtedly did when Lemons put Santa in their window in an airplane in 1907 ) , most of us will get on with the things that make Christmas unique . <p> The military planning required for discreet attic raids late on Christmas Eve ; the carrot stump and empty brandy glass left beside fireplaces ; the expectation and sense of wonder of children desperate to fall asleep and then the sound of bedroom doors flung open at dawn , of being woken by warm bodies clambering into bed beside you and the final moments of expectation that even the smallest child seemed to want to prolong . <p> Even when your children are old enough to fly home from across the globe , you never forget those shared memories that become part of every family 's DNA . Whether you spend Christmas in a family gathering or choosing to walk alone in Wicklow , I hope you get to have the Christmas you want , as we mark another year 's passing . <p> Dermot Bolger 's novel , ' Tanglewood ' , and selected poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available now

Well then please have a read ! <h> The Lobster <p> A never better Colin Farrell is the schlub who has a limited time to find a partner to avoid turning into an animal in this blackly funny film which has a lot to say about relationships . Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos ( his previous films Dogtooth and Alps are also worth seeking out ) filmed this in Ireland and it is the most wonderful of cultural hybrids . A great script adds to the fun . <h> Mommy <p> The sickeningly young and talented Xavier Dolan ( 5 feature films made and only 26 ) has made an exquisite melodrama that succeeds because of the depth of love for the trio of main characters in the film . It is a technical marvel shot in a 1:1 aspect ratio which is essentially a perfect square and it occasionally broadens out in a glorious way . His English language debut will arrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From the sickeningly young to the grand old master of French cinema Jean Luc Godard comes his latest film Goodbye to Language ( his 43rd film ) . Godard picks through the bones of cinema and produces the only essential 3D film . Messy , occasionally painful to look at and infuriating , it is also a jolt to the heart for dull modern cinema and the placated audiences who love to be led both visually and with predictable sound cues . It is a one off kind of brilliant . And you will probably hate it . I did -- until I did n't . <h> Enemy <p> Denis Villienieve 's previous film Prisoners was well received but was overlong and bloated . Enemy is quite the opposite : it is economic , layered and very bleak . The film is beautifully shot , in the grimiest of browns , seemingly discolouring everything . There is some gorgeous and indeed disturbing imagery on show here as well . This is probably Jake Gyllenhaal 's finest performance(s) . See it , get freaked out and then see it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't quite hit the heights of his two previous films that does not mean there is not greatness in here ( The Master and There Will be Blood are amongst the finest of this century ) . An adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel , it involves a ridiculously complex investigation by Joaquin Phoenix as Doc Sportillo . There are elements of The Big Lebowski , Airplane and The Long Goodbye here but it is underpinned by the loss of the hippie dream in the US in the 1960s as it gave way to the 70s and Nixon . Sadness permeates even as we laugh . The reputation of this feel will grow as the years go by . <h> The Duke of Burgundy <p> A breathtakingly beautiful film full of stunning imagery that is also tremendously sexy . Two terrific lead performances and not a man in sight . What more could you ask from a film . Strickland 's follow up to Berberian Sound Studio is superb with underlying themes such as aging and the effort needed to keep the spark in a relationship . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stunning The Act of Killing ( probably the best documentary this century ) is another deeply disturbing tale from the bleak history of Indonesia . Whilst the previous film looked at the genocides from the perpetrators perspective , The Look of Silence is from the perspective of the victims . Beautifully shot and very moving this is a double bill of extraordinary filmmaking . Like The Act of Killing this is grim but absolutely essential . <h> The Tribe <p> Ok things are n't getting any cheerier here . The Tribe is the epic gangster film in microcosm set in a Ukrainian school for the deaf . Told entirely in sign language with no subtitles ( trust me , far easier to watch and follow than you would think ) this is a brilliantly directed film that is nonetheless at times very disturbing and difficult to watch . The Tribe is one to steer clear of if violence upsets you . If you can take it , there are rewards in a film that is absolutely committed to its ideas from start to finish . <h> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as filmmaking got in Ireland in 2015 . Unflinching and heartfelt , the humanitarian efforts of Christina Noble are put in perspective with In A House That Ceased To Be , one of the finest Irish documentaries in many years . A film that is in turns funny , angry and unbearably moving , director Ciar ? n Scott has fashioned cinematic catharsis and , in a nation that desperately needs it , that catharsis is an outpouring full of relieved joy , guilty anguish and righteous rage . <h> Foxcatcher <p> We end with a film I saw in early January and it has still not been bettered . Foxcatcher tells the true story of Mark and Dave Schultz ( Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffolo ) Olympic gold medallists at wrestling and their disastrous relationship with American millionaire John Du Pont ( Steve Carrell ) .

It is a musical/non-musical about the true story of a serial killer in Ipswich . Sounds like it could n't work but it really does . <p> Speaking of Irish films this was a stellar year . Terry McMahon 's Patrick 's Day and Frank Berry 's I Used to Live Here are both excellent . Gerard Barrett 's Glassland is well worth a watch . Your mother will love John Crowley 's Brooklyn ( I merely liked it but Saoirse Ronan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant documentary from Tadhg O'Sullivan called The Great Wall that explores very real physical , political and psychological boundaries .

What you see or know is sometimes only a fraction of the whole . That fraction can be unbelievably small . I remember reading a 1947 essay on the orchestra by Virgil Thomson and finding myself gulping at one of the statistics he gave . In 1937 , he said , there were about 30,000 orchestras in the US . <p> It seems incredible . The numbers are not made up of the likes of the Chicago Symphony or the New York Philharmonic , but the orchestras in schools and communities around the country . It 's obvious as soon as you think about it .

The individual schools and colleges that regularly find concert outlets for their orchestras , bands and ensembles are too many to mention . <p> But the iceberg analogy goes well beyond a division into professional and amateur orchestras . When it comes to permanent , professional orchestras , the concerts they give are also just the tip of the iceberg . There is often a range of extracurricular activities by players that acts as a fertiliser for the rest of the musical ecosystem . <p> You 'll find professionals playing in the orchestras that accompany amateur choral societies and amateur musicals .

NSO ) , Thierry Fischer ( former principal conductor of the Ulster Orchestra ) , and John Storg ? rds ( who conducted the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra here earlier this month ) successfully made that transition . <p> Orchestral musicians are also vital providers of music education . They teach at third level in our academies and colleges , they give concerts for young people and some of them do outreach work in our schools .

Churches and banks , he believed , were more open to experimentation . <p> The European model may be different , but the conservatism is shared . Take the NSO . Thirty-one years ago , in the summer of 1984 , RT ? started a series of essentially experimental Tuesday lunchtime concerts . Repertoire that was deemed too light , too short or too close to the " hundred best tunes " end of the orchestral repertoire found a home here . And the concerts were also used as a test ground for instrumentalists , singers , and conductors who were not yet judged ready for the exposure of a full evening programme . That series , unchanged in essence , is with us still . <p> In 1999 RT ? decided to grasp the nettle of new music with an innovative series of free , hour-long Explorer concerts by the NSO .

Each programme was given to individual Irish composers , who were asked to include their own works as well as music that had influenced them in some way . <p> The formula stuck and the new starting time opened the concerts up to pupils studying music at secondary school . But this year 's series was the last . Something new is afoot , although RT ? is not ready to divulge anything about it other than that it will address the contemporary repertoire . <h> A patchy relationship <p> RT ?

@@4746230 <h> 21 years of panto and the show must go on ! <p> As Catherine Mahon Buckley directs her 21st Pantomime at the Everyman , Colette Sheridan talks to her about growing her school from three to 500 students , battling cancer , and why live music should always be part of theatre . <p> DOYENNE of the pantomime scene in Cork , Catherine Mahon-Buckley , who is directing her 21st festive show for the Everyman , remembers that while working on her first panto , she was afraid to buy a pair of tights for the show , such was her precarious financial situation . It was her businessman husband and Everyman board member , Ted , who suggested that Catherine produce a panto for the Everyman through her academy , CADA Performing Arts . Catherine recalls that at the time , the Everyman was in financial difficulties and was unable to put on such a show . " Ted just said why do n't I do it ? I thought he was joking . I had ? 200 in the bank . Where was I going to get the money to put on a panto ? " Ted said I should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it die . He convinced me to do it . It was New Year 's Eve and Ted went out to play in a band . I poured myself a large gin and tonic and said ' The world is wishing it to you ' . The first pantomime I did was Cinderella starring Linda Kent . I 'm very proud to say that since the beginning , I 've never repeated a storyline . The scripts are always new and in keeping with the times . " This year , Aladdin is enchanting children at the Everyman . But behind the scenes , tight budgets are always to the forefront when it comes to planning the annual Christmas extravaganza . The Cork Opera House decided to use recorded music for its pantomime this year instead of employing a live orchestra . While Catherine wo n't comment on " another venue " she adds : " From my point of view , I believe theatre is a live art and if at all possible , live things should happen in it . An orchestra is expensive and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd maybe forego other things to have live music . " My father was president of the Federation of Musicians . He always believed in keeping music live . The pantomime is the first time that children go to a theatre . They 're going to see the musicians play music as well as the actors . So it 's a good way to show them how everything works together . You 've got the set , the costumes , the acting , the music and the dancing which all must gel together . " Catherine has come a long way from setting up CADA Performing Arts in her mother 's Turner 's Cross sitting room with three students . She now owns her own studio in Pine Street and has about 500 students whose alumni include Sarah Greene , nominated for a Tony Award in 2014 , singer Linda Kenny and actor Ciaran Bermingham , who is playing the dame in Aladdin . " I always had the dream of having my own premises , " says Catherine . " I 'm very strong on the environment we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings out the best in people . " CADA grew and I have Gerry Lucey to thank for giving me the use of the Grand Parade Hotel to rehearse in . Then I came up to McCurtain Street and went on to buy the Pine Street building . " Ever cautious , Catherine had to be goaded by Ted into signing the papers for the purchase of the building . " I 'm the huntress and Ted does the kill . I was afraid of signing the papers for the new studio . I had to put the pen down two or three times . I said to Ted that if we were going to make a go of this , would I still be able to buy nice things ? He said I would . Since then , I have never looked back .

" The performing arts are a great way of instilling confidence into youngsters , says Catherine . She sometimes cringes when she hears young hopefuls with stars in their eyes desperately wanting to work in the theatre and film world . " It 's such a hard life . When I meet the parents and children for the first time , I tell them about all the negatives . If the children are still interested , then I know they have a hunger for it . You have to let them live their dream . " An accomplished actress in her own right , Catherine despairs of people who think the arts and film worlds are " all glitz and glam " , adding : " I tell my students that maybe three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of the time , you 're in tracksuits and rehearsal gear . You can be waiting for the call . And your calendar ca n't afford you to maybe take a holiday -- and you ca n't afford to be sick . Yet you have to realise that you are human . " Catherine , who teaches the performing arts and office administration at Presentation Girls Secondary School in Ballyphehane , became aware of her own vulnerability through an accident and ill health . She broke both her knees in 2006 and was told she would always walk with a limp and might need to use a stick . But she defied the doctor 's predictions . However , she admits that once a person has had a serioius breakage , " you 're never out of the woods . You have to keep on top of it . I go for physiotherapy and I do exercises every day . I could be in pain but I just get on with it . " Then , in 2012 , Catherine 's got the shock of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her uterus , ovaries and fallopian tubes removed . She is grateful that her secretary encouraged her to have a smear test . She had had a slight bleed mid cycle and put it down to her age . Catherine admits that she was angry going into the operation . She was unnecessarily paranoid that doctors were trying to make money out of her as the recession was biting . " If you go into an operation angry , you pay the consequences . I had a turn four days after the operation . My heart was racing and they nearly lost me . " The loss of her reproductive organs affected Catherine emotionally . She does n't have children , having suffered a miscarriage about 13 years ago . She decided to bury what was taken out of her in her father 's grave . " I did not want my organs to be incinerated . The hospital ( Bon Secours ) was fantastic . They brought in a woman who gave me pastoral care . When the organs were released , a prayer service was held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackrock and they were fantastic and so caring .

In the meantime , the show must go on for this indefatigable woman . Aladdin runs until January 10.

To see how the years have changed us , see our picture gallery . <p> Looking at the Christmas edition of the Irish Farmers Journal every five years since 1985 , we have spotted a little bit of a pattern . The years 1985 and 1990 displayed full pictures on the front cover , with no news distracting the reader from the attractive Christmas image . <p> The 1985 edition , below , boasted the festive sight of a sheep farmer , unidentified , feeding his flock in the snow , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside the front page , however , it was business as usual , with stories ranging from low beef prices to the considerable income difference between dairy and beef farmers . Sheep prices were noted to have ended the year on a good note , while farm incomes had dropped by 17% across all the sectors , the lowest drop since 1973 . <p> In 1990 , below , a snow-covered mountain in St Remigius , Switzerland was chosen as the image for the front cover , and again no news takes away from the brilliant scene of blue and white . Inside the front page , the editorial speaks passionately about the " core of farming 's problems - the dramatic decline in the purchasing power of our output " . I <p> n the news , beef is again noted to have had a difficult year , with the " vagaries of the market " being compounded by " inflated scares rebounding from disease developments and suggested drug misuse " . Meanwhile , Bord Glas , the horticultural promotion agency , was berated for having its headquarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in the pattern , with headline news accompanying the picture on the front page . As seen below , the headline shouts , " Sheep deal agreed " , while the picture of sheep in a snow-covered field in Co Wicklow reflects the main news story of the day . Looking closer at the main story , it reveals that the Minister for Agriculture at the time , Ivan Yates , succeeded in getting the rural world premium , worth ? 5.48 per ewe , extended to sheep farmers in non-Disadvantaged Areas . Although the deal was welcomed by sheep farmers in the lowlands , it was criticised in the Disdavantaged Areas . <p> Also on the front page on 23 December 1995 was the story that 7,000 farmers could lose their ewe or suckler premium quota to the national reserve if they have not used or leased the quota over the last two years . <p> The millenium year , 2000 , below , saw a continuation of the pattern of a picture accompanied by a main news story . The picture was not as festive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it captured . Up to 2,500 farmers attended an IFA beef crisis meeting at Goff 's , Kill , Co Kildare in the Christmas week that year . Its purpose was to increase the pressure on the Irish government and that same week 's EU Farm Council meeting to deliver a price of 90p per lb for O grade cattle from 1 January 2001 . <p> Due to new BSE scares in France and Germany in the run up to Christmas , most third country markets had closed for Irish beef and live cattle imports . IFA president at the time , Tom Parlon , told the meeting that farmers " can not survive another BSE-inflicted market collapse . " <p> By 2005 , it is clear we have moved away from the pattern of having just a picture on the front cover . A picture of newly elected IFA president Padraig Walshe graces the front cover of the Christmas edition . The news story below from then livestock editor Justin McCarthy talks about a row brewing between farmers , meat factories and the Department of Agriculture over new EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumped at factories throughout the country from 1 January 2006 " . The new legislation stated that animals unloaded at a plant must be slaughtered at the plant , and , in the event of problems , the animals could not be returned to their farm of origin or any other premises . <p> Also in this Christmas edition was the news that farmers selling entitlements without land would be forced to give up 30% to the National Reserve . <p> Five years later , in 2010 , we see an example of a headline that certainly suits the festive mood . Although the word " Turkey " in the headline refers to the country and not the bird served up on Christmas tables , it still ties in appropriately with the season . The story , again written by then livestock editor Justin McCarthy , reveals that Ireland will almost certainly have access to the high-priced Turkish beef market in 2011 . <p> And again , most likely due to their snowy fleeces , sheep steal the show in the main picture , with Kenneth Kelly leading sheep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boher , Co Roscommon . <p> Finally , we are up to date with 2015 , which also leads with a picture of sheep . This year 's Christmas edition shows Kate Devane , Garrynadur , Lispole , Co Kerry , helping her father Owen , whose three-year old Charollais ewe gave birth to two male and three ewe lambs this week . The main news story , from news correspondent Paul Mooney , brings the good news that periods for hedge-cutting and burning of hill vegetation are to be extended by one month on a trial basis to make land management more practical . <p> So there you have it , a review of Irish Farmers Journal Christmas editions every five years from 1985 . We look forward to seeing our Christmas editions over the next thirty years and we hope you do too .

@@4769234 <h> FF seeks alternative to overhead pylon interconnector <p> Fianna F ? il TD for Cavan-Monaghan Brendan Smith says residents in Meath , Monaghan and Cavan are outraged over the controversial plan to construct a North-South Interconnector 400kV AC overhead line through the heart of their communities . <p> Deputy Smith said Fianna F ? il is committed to achieving community consensus for the project , and his party will work to upgrade existing infrastructure alongside ensuring the new transmission line is placed underground . " After much consideration , Eirgrid now accepts that Grid Link West and Grid Link South can now proceed on the basis that the lines be put underground . Eirgrid has recognised that it is feasible to do this due to the latest technological advances and the reduced costing associated with undergrounding transmission lines . The technology has changed quite significantly since the North - South Interconnector was first proposed and this must now be taken into account . " People in counties such as Meath , Monaghan and Cavan feel let down as their own proposals as outlined for the proposed North South Interconnector are being ignored . They feel they are not being treated equally as new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding with construction taking place underground . Despite this similar proposals for the North-South Interconnector are being overlooked . This is inherently unfair . " The Minister for Communications , Energy and Natural Resources Alex White has side-stepped a series of parliamentary questions my colleague Michael Moynihan has tabled on this very issue . I have continually pressed him for his views on proposals to underground the North - South Interconnector . This can be achieved by deploying high voltage direct current ( HVDC ) technology . However I am yet to receive a straight answer from the Minister on this matter . " At a recent all-party committee meeting on transport and communications , Eirgrid again confirmed that it was technically feasible to underground the North-South interconnector using an underground alternative which employs HVDC technology . " HVDC technology is currently employed in the East -- West Interconnector between Ireland and the UK consisting of an underground and undersea cable . In addition , average overhead line construction costs for Grid Link projects are on par with the average cost per kilometre for the East West connector . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated that the Grid 25 review strategy document shows that the cost of undergrounding has reduced close to 1.5 times as compared to the cost of overhead lines . This a big climbdown from the Eirgrid commissioned report by Parsons Brinckerhoff ( PB Power ) in 2013 which estimated the cost of undergrounding to be 6 times as much as constructing overhead pylons . " In Fianna F ? il 's energy policy launched this year , we outlined that grid development such as planned under the North South Interconnector should be subject to a full economic review in light of our reduced energy needs . Fianna F ? il has consistently maintained that undergrounding the North-South Connector is the most preferential route along with upgrading existing infrastructure , " he said . <h> Explore Our Range Of Services <h> Cookies on Anglo Celt website <p> We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website .
