@@61499239 <h> Summary <p> Since the introduction of cryptocurrency , one of the greatest concerns has been the volatility or instability in terms of exchange rates .

That concern has however been addressed by the introduction of the stablecoins -- cryptos pegged to fiat money , a basket of assets , assets or exchange traded commodities to minimise volatility . <p> For example , Central Bank can create a cryptocurrency pegged on the shilling to facilitate transactions . For all intent and purpose , Bonga points tokens are a good representative of a cryptocurrency that virtually everybody uses while understanding that its value is one third of the shilling . <p> It derives its value ( utility ) from the usage of airtime . The source of utility is important to understanding genuine cryptocurrencies . Some cryptocurrencies in the market have no utility and chances are that they are ponzi schemes . <p> The question many people ask is what has necessitated use of cryptocurrency to settle cross-border payments ? <p> The quick answer is time , cost and convenience . Prior to Mobile payment platforms for example , it used to cost a customer to send money between two cities and the minimum time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel to the nearest Post Office to pick the money . The customer paid not just the actual cost of sending but also the cost of inefficiency and time taken to receive the funds . <p> Just like Mobile payment platforms , MoneyGram and its competitor Western Union want to reach the customer instantly to settle payment generated in other countries . <p> Already there are partnerships with Banks and mobile payments platforms to achieve the same but the cost is increasingly becoming prohibitive . <p> The obvious solution is the use of blockchain , which can lower the cost significantly and improve on their value proposition . Since the cryptocurrency will be begged on the dollar ( stablecoin ) , payment can be redeemed anywhere . <p> As simple as it looks here , we need a regulatory framework .

@@61523239 <h> Sat Jan 11 23:54:00 EAT 2020 <h> Nuruddin Farah continues with the search for peace in new novel <h> By TOM ODHIAMBO <p> In the past few years , Nuruddin Farah has written like an individual pursuing a very personal quest for peace in his country of birth . His recent fiction has intensively and extensively pondered the question of the relevance of war . He has written about what the war in Somalia has done to the country , its people , its neighbours , the region , Africa and the world . <p> Crossbones ( 2011 ) , Hiding in Plain Sight ( 2014 ) , and North of Dawn ( 2018 ) are odes to the tragedy of a once beautiful country turned upside down by an internecine war that seems to have no end in sight . <p> In Crossbones , Nuruddin takes the reader to Somalia . He sets the story in the epicentre of the violence , destruction and decay that Somalia has become . The reader is made to sense the immediacy of the suspicions , the fear , the horror , the lack , the nearness of death and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , villages , markets , on the streets , throughout the country , decades after the collapse of the central government in Mogadishu . But Nuruddin also connects the situation on Somalia to the global community , be it Somalis who have been forced by circumstances to migrate , and whose children have , in turn , been seduced and trapped by the same violence , either engaging in acts of terror wherever they have travelled to , or coming back to Somalia to join terror groups . <p> The drama of the violence in Mogadishu continues in Hiding in Plain Sight . In this case Nuruddin explores the consequences of death on a family . The drama is set in the United Nations compound in Mogadishu , which is attacked by an Al-Shabaab operative . Several people are killed , including Aar , who works for the UN . He leaves behind two children in Nairobi . The rest of the story is a drama involving the children , Aar 's female friend in Nairobi , his sister Bella and Aar 's ex-wife , Valerie . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual families when war claims its victims . What happens to the extended family ? What happens to children ? What happens to friends ? What do the family , the community and the nation lose ? What does humanity lose ? These questions are raised again in North of Dawn with more urgency . <p> If one has been a literary follower of Nuruddin 's East African novels , then North of Dawn is Nuruddin 's European story . It is entirely set in Norway with the action , as expected , triggered in Somalia . The precipitating action for the story is the death of Dhaqaneh , son of Gacalo and Mugdi , Somalis who have settled in Oslo , Norway . <p> Dhaqaneh has travelled to Somalia to join the Shabaab , who have literally besieged Mogadishu . This is how the narrator describes the situation : " In Somalia , the bombs have been going off for months , roadside devices killing and maiming anyone unlucky enough to be in the vicinity . The frequency of the detonations and unpredictability of where or when the blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , constantly on edge . No one knows how many people have been injured or how many have been killed . People no longer delve into the details unless they recognise the name of a victim or that of the perpetrator . " <p> When Dhaqaneh leaves Norway for Nairobi , he marries a woman with two children . So , when he dies in a suicide bombing incident , his family remains in the care of the parents . Gacalo believes that she is doing the right thing by helping the widow , Waliya and her son and daughter , Naciim and Saafi , to migrate to Norway . This is a difficult task considering the anti-migrants feelings in Europe , especially when they are Somalis . But through legal and illegal means , the family reaches Norway . <p> However , the widow and her children become a bother to Gacalo and Mugdi . Waliya seems to subscribe to a very conservative kind of Islam ; Saafi is dealing with a tragic past -- she was raped in the refugee camp back in Kenya ; Naciim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new society and culture . Of the three , he adapts fastest , followed by Saafi , who only finds peace after a period of seeing a psychologist . <p> Waliya falls under the spell of fundamentalist Islamic preachers , which in the long run leads to suspicion of involvement with terrorists when she hosts a man , Zubair , who is suspected of links with a terrorist organisation . <p> Norway itself has its share of racists and conservatives who are opposed to migrants settling in their country . Alluding to history , Nuruddin revisits the case of Anders Behring , who detonated a bomb at the offices of the prime minister of Norway in July 2011 , and thereafter went to the " island of Utoya , where the young acolytes of the country 's governing Labor Party were attending a youth camp , and proceeded to mow down sixty-nine " of them . Among these teenagers was " Mouna : charming , exuberant , barely eighteen , soccer-playing Mouna , Himmo 's daughter . " Himmo is one of the family friends to Gacalo and Mugdi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing how violence -- real , imagined or prospective -- shadows the lives of Somalis , at home and abroad . He speaks to the tragedy of individuals and families who are directly or indirectly pulled into the web of the violence and the pain and suffering they have to live with . Whether it is chauvinism , racism or inexplicable hatred , Nuruddin seems to suggest that being Somali in today 's world is a very troubled existence . The Somali is unsafe at home , is seen as dangerous for those who do not know him closely , is a victim and victimizer , is deemed a potential killer , and thus deemed a lesser human . <p> It is this question of humanity that appears to undergird Nuruddin 's stories in the three novels . What has happened to humanity in the recent past ? What have human beings lost -- or gained -- by valuing others as lesser beings ? Why would a country and a people with seemingly shared identity and culture(s) be so violent , against their compatriots , and against others ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of ' other ' humans ? What does the society do about the loss of humanity by the victims of the violence spawned by religious conservatism and the perpetrators of the violence ? Should n't religion really be the refuge of those who have no one or nowhere else to turn to ? <p> These questions are at the heart of the story of Dawn of South mainly considering the efforts Gacalo makes to bring her daughter-in-law and step-grandchildren into Europe , yet what she gets in return seems to be heartache that in the end kills her . <p> Even Mugdi , ever the cynic about the possibility for redemption for Somali immigrants grants the newly arrived relatives the benefit of the doubt but ends up disappointed . In the end it is difficult to understand how adults , institutions and governments can not work hard at making and sustaining peace and alleviating the human suffering caused by violence , war and displacement , as currently happening in Africa and the Middle East . <p> Sense of humanity <p> Nuruddin Farah seems to have decided to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view but also from a humanistic perspective ; a position that seeks to acknowledge more of what is shared between human beings and what could make humans live together peacefully , in a world that is ever in turmoil . In other words , these are not just stories about the Somali and their troubled country ; these are tales of a seeming inscrutable collapse of a sense of humanity in the world . Nuruddin has written about Somalia his entire life , but these three recent books are very personal testimonies to his concern for his people , culture , and country , and , one would add , Africa . <p> The writer teaches at the University of Nairobi .

This was the team : Charles Barkley , Larry Bird , Clyde Drexler , Patrick Ewing , Magic Johnson , Michael Jordan , Christian Laettner , Karl Malone , Chris Mullin , Scottie Pippen , David Robinson , and John Stockton . It lived up to its billing , sweeping all competitors away , and giving us an automatic name by which to call newly-elected members of our village cattle dip committee : Dream Team . <p> Atlanta , 1996 : Atlanta hosted the centennial Olympics and selected Muhammad Ali , the greatest athlete of the 20th century and gold medallist in Rome 1960 , to light the torch .

Surprisingly , even at the Olympics , though quite rare , you sometimes see behaviour that leaves your jaw on the floor . When Cuba 's Angel Matos was disqualified for taking too much injury time during a bronze medal tae-kwon-do match , he reacted by kicking Swedish referee Chakir Chelbat in the face . The World Taekwondo Federation ( WTF ) immediately slapped him with a lifetime ban -- the maximum they could do with such an ill-mannered fellow . <p> Seoul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Dozens of doves were perched atop the Olympic torch cauldron , having been released just moments before .

The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) altered the sequence of future opening ceremonies to ensure that that never happened again . <p> Rome , 1960 : The Rome Olympics were the first to be broadcast live across Europe , making instant celebrities of the outstanding competitors .

It was his privilege to represent his proud and obsessively self-reliant people in the men 's marathon race -- an event they cherished dearly . He looked like he would do his nation proud and led the race until the last 100 metres when the following two competitors overtook him , forcing him to settle for bronze . Any other competitor would have savoured the accomplishment but Tsuburaya was devastated . <p> As far as he was concerned , he had brought shame upon himself , his family , and his fellow countrymen .

In fact , it was determined to get the Games taken away altogether . What the world did not know was the diabolical lengths to which the North would go to achieve that end . On 29 November 1987 , Korean Air Flight 858 from Baghdad to Seoul disappeared above the Andaman Sea with 115 passengers and crew on board . All of them were killed .

The university council has also been disbanded . <p> Far from being unusual , however , the crisis falls within an established pattern of government intervention in universities going back decades . Successive governments have sought to control universities with varying degrees of success . <p> Attempts to assert executive control date back to 1969 when East African countries resolved to dissolve the regional University of East Africa .

But it was dominated by civil servants . An unusual addition to the committee was a junior official in the Ministry of Education , who was also the sister of the powerful Attorney-General Charles Njonjo . Her involvement indicated that the government considered the establishment of a national university a sensitive matter that needed close monitoring by trusted insiders . <p> The committee convened against a tense backdrop . By the late 1960s the government of Jomo Kenyatta had started viewing the University College , Nairobi -- the forerunner of the University of Nairobi -- with disdain because of frequent student protests against the State . The government even banned members of faculty from using certain publications because it considered them subversive and likely to inculcate radical ideas among students . <p> The suspicions of the government became even more clear in 1970 after the elevation of the institution to a national university . The government appointed Dr Josephat Karanja , a career civil servant , as its vice-chancellor . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner in the UK . <p> The irregular appointment became a trendsetter . When President Moi came into office , he filled the vice-chancellor positions with those he deemed loyal . The consequence of this executive interference in the appointment of university heads was twofold . The practice disregarded skills , credentials and competencies , which meant that the best-qualified people were not appointed . Second , it resulted in the erosion of academic freedom and university autonomy . <p> Mwai Kibaki , who succeeded Moi , set about reducing the level of executive interference at universities . The most important step he took was to discontinue the practice of having the President serve as the chancellor of all public universities . <p> But the legal framework that Kibaki inherited stayed in place until the University Act was passed in 2012 . It introduced some fundamental reforms , giving the senate and alumni associations the powers of appointing the chancellor . <p> It also provided for the competitive appointment of vice-chancellors . Interviews were to be done by university councils , which would make a recommendation to the Cabinet secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appointing the vice-chancellor . But there were still deep flaws . <p> In 2018 , the 2012 law underwent major amendments following the enactment of the Statute Law ( Miscellaneous Amendments ) Act 2018 . This stripped university councils of the right to conduct interviews . Instead , this was transferred to the public service commission . <p> The appointment of Nairobi University 's new chancellor was done under this new regime . But George Magoha revoked the appointment barely two weeks later . These actions have been challenged in court . <p> It 's now clear that the 2018 law was deeply flawed . It is time to bring sanity to universities by taking away the role of appointing university administrators

However , a taxpayer has an option of choosing VAT over TOT . <p> The main essence of turnover tax around the world and especially in developing countries such as Kenya is to bring the informal sector to the tax net . The informal sector is by far the biggest employer in Kenya and its taxation would significantly contribute to Kenya Revenue Authority ( KRA ) ' s revenue collection targets which stand at Sh1.7 trillion . <p> A majority of Kenyans in the informal sector shy away from tax registration and self-declaration of their income for tax purposes .

" " We can not be there when things are good but run away when trouble comes , " he added . <p> Kenya is yet to decide on whether or not to bring home the nearly 100 students marooned in Wuhan , the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak . For weeks , Kenyan students in Wuhan have been desperately pleading to be brought home , narrating the harrowing experiences -- from running short of essential supplies to some beginning to fall into depression , worrying about the possibilities of contracting the disease that has killed more than 1,000 people by yesterday and infected more than 31,000 , with most of the victims from mainland China . Through their lobby group , Kenyan Students in Wuhan Association , the students wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seeking urgent intervention . " To date , the embassy has not responded to our letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worse of it all , with each passing day the situation in Wuhan is getting unbearable . Some of our students are totally without food , while some are going into depression due to fear and uncertainty surrounding this issue , " the letter said . Earlier , the students had written to Kenya 's ambassador to China Sarah Serem who ended her response with a prayer to God to keep them safe . While President Uhuru Kenyatta had stated , while on a tour of the US last week , that Kenyan students who want to come home will be repatriated , a multi-agency team in Nairobi held a different view , insisting that it was in their best interests to remain in there . <p> Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau claimed Kenya is ill-prepared to handle a coronavirus outbreak in the homeland and that the students are better off there as China is doing everything to contain the spread . He further argues that the spread of the virus to other countries is as a result of evacuation efforts , hence the reason Kenya wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any evacuation will have to await the lifting of the quarantine imposed by Chinese authorities but whose end is not in sight . <p> Granted , it is only recently that the government has moved to expand capacity to handle the novel disease by establishing an additional 120-bed isolation centre at the new wing of Mbagathi Hospital in Nairobi to the 60-bed isolation ward at the Kenyatta National Hospital where the first suspected case was handled . Outgoing Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki revealed that the government had sent out doctors for training on how to handle the virus and they were expected to arrive on Saturday together with test kits and reagents . <p> Initially , samples taken from suspected cases were being dispatched to South Africa for testing . All the four of them were negative .

Both Ms Kariuki and Mr Kamau have described China as " gallant " in its response to the crisis and the manner it has taken care of affected Kenyans . <p> " The government takes this opportunity to recognise the great work undertaken by the Chinese government and people in fighting the spread of the virus in China and in particular , in keeping Kenyan students caught up at the epicenter of the epidemic safe and healthy , " the Health Cabinet Secretary said last week . <p> Mr Kamau was quoted as saying : " We have seen a situation where Kenyans have been taken care of , have been reached out to and have been facilitated by the government of China and the people of China in ways that show they have lots of respect for our people . " Like Kenya , neighbouring Uganda has also ignored the cries of its citizens in Wuhan . <p> A medical student who has been at the forefront in seeking intervention at one point even expressed fears of arrest , stating the Chinese embassy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was based at . <p> NO RISK <p> So far , no country can claim to have been prepared for the coronavirus outbreak , including the United States , which has equally been scrambling to deal with the situation . But this did not stop them from evacuating their nationals save for the enforcement of the quarantine in place . For instance , the nearly 200 US nationals , including diplomats and embassy employees , who were the first to be evacuated from Wuhan were quarantined at March Air Reserve Base in California with the Centres for Disease Control ( CDC ) saying there was no risk of spreading the virus to other people after a 14-day period . <p> Some other countries such as Brazil are holding evacuees for 18 days . Egypt , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya are among African nations that have evacuated hundreds of their nationals from Wuhan . <p> MEGA PROJECTS <p> Others , including Nigeria and South Africa have been reluctant to do so despite desperate pleas from their nationals trapped in Wuhan . Does Egypt , Morocco , Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African countries , Kenya included ? It is no secret that China is a major player in Kenya with many multi-billion shilling projects being financed by the Asian giant and that stronger ties are important both at the bilateral and multilateral levels , including getting support for a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council . But this must not in any way blind decision making in matters of life and death such as response to the coronavirus outbreak .

@@61621239 <h> Setting record straight on testing harm in chemicals <p> Thursday , February 13 , 2020 0:01 <p> By ERIC KIMUNGUYI <p> Spraying pesticides against Fall Armyworm . FILE PHOTO NMG <p> The modern world is built on chemicals , be it the medicines we use , or cleaning fluids , crop protection products , or the raw materials for everything from laptops and mobile phones to clothes and furniture . Across all , we have created an entire modern society with chemicals , and , as a result , constantly stretched the size of the world population we can feed , clothe and shelter . <p> Yet , balancing all the gains from the modern chemistry around us against any negative environmental and human impact has been a rising concern , making for ever greater focus on testing and on risk assessment . <p> However , not all positions are about weighing the costs and benefits , or striking a balance . Sometimes issues become clouded by emotions , or populism , maybe they become a rallying call for campaigners drumming up membership drives or funding , or they can just become what some people call ' politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it just becomes rebellious to hold any other view or make any other case . <p> This has seen divergence in the way we have treated approvals in our chemical world , and particularly in relation to the crop protection products we use in Kenya to cull locusts or manage the Fall Armyworm . <p> As it is , for all chemicals , the regulatory starting point has long been what is called risk assessment . This risk-based approach assesses the possibility of a substance causing harm to human health and the environment when it is used for the purpose proposed . <h> Related Stories <p> In fact , it can be better to take examples we are all familiar with in order to understand the nature of the differing regulatory regimes : An obvious one is household bleach . Bleach can kill you nastily if you drink it . If you put your hand into it or splash it onto your skin or into your eyes , it will burn . Pour it into soils and it kills all the vital soil bacteria . Yet we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnings , and when used with water and protection for our skin , it protects us from literally millions of germs and pathogens that would have ended many of our lives already . <p> So , risk assessment would look at whether bleach will hurt or kill us when it 's used as it should be , with gloves on and diluted . And if it does n't harm us then it can be approved for home use , but with clear markings on it that it is a ' hazard ' and packaging that young children can not open . <p> In fact , until 2009 , every regulatory regime in the world used risk assessments to decide which pesticides to approve , which household cleaning products to approve , and which foods to approve ( for example , cassava is lethal when undercooked , but is still approved as a human food ) . <p> To carry out the risk assessments on crop protection products require comprehensive studies that can take six to nine years of testing , looking at what happens if the product gets in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin , and examining with animal testing its impact on the nervous system , in creating cancerous cells , in affecting the reproductive or any other biological system or function . <p> The tests span every conceivable environmental impact too . <p> These tests typically cost around Sh23 billion to complete for any one chemical , and the product will only be approved if it is safe for the use proposed , without damaging either humans or the environment . Pesticide approvals , thus , do not come from nowhere , they take years to secure and require proof that one chemical company once summarised as the equivalent of 50-man years of work and five lorry loads of test results , if printed out . <p> However , in 2009 , the European Union decided to take a different approach -- not to food , or any other chemicals , but just with pesticides - and moved to what is called hazard assessment . <p> This regime simply determines whether a chemical has any capacity to cause human or environmental harm in any way . Back to bleach -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pesticide for the EU , no testing would happen , it can not under any circumstances get approval for any use ( and nor could cassava under a hazard assessment , nor salt , nor sugar ) . <p> Now Europe 's move has been deeply controversial , but every nation and region has its politics . <p> However , the nasty part in Kenya is that because the EU changed its rules , some petitioners and NGOs have told the Kenyan parliament and public that Europe banned our approved pesticides because they caused cancer or other harm , when used as pesticides . <p> That 's just not true . Yet people have even worried about culling locusts that will otherwise drive our people into starvation because air-spraying must be dangerous , despite the Food and Agricultural Organisation ( FAO ) recommending it . <p> Whereas , in fact , all of these pesticides remain in use in the US , Australia and all those regimes that measure them for their safety in use . They have not been ' banned ' because they harm human health as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from all testing to even assess their safety as pesticides , because they can cause harm in other ways . <p> Which is a very dubious reason for letting the locust multiply . For , of course , Europe does n't have locusts , or Fall Armyworm , or food insecurity , so no one is starving to death there over its change of regime . But in Kenya , large parts of the population remain vulnerable to hunger .

We have been together for the better half of our lives . Our love life has been full of drama and many separations emanating from issues with her family and misunderstandings between us , though we end up re-uniting . <p> While I was in college , she had an affair and got pregnant , but apologised for cheating on me after she delivered her child .

The plan to settle down together collapsed again after I declined to be introduced to her parents in her absence by the very cousin who prevented the previous visit . <p> By then , she had submitted her resignation letter as she prepared to return to the country . She became so furious when she learnt that I had refused to visit her parents in her absence , that we separated again . Six months later , she contacted me again , saying she loves only me . Because I also love her , I agreed to revive our relationship though I do n't trust her . <p> Her love for material things also stresses me a lot , and I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , we have not talked to each other for the last four days . What should I do ? D.R.I.W <p> Hi , Relationships are founded on trustworthiness and commitment , neither of which I sense is in your relationship . There is a lot in your union that fails to meet the basic threshold for a maturing relationship . I agree that forgiveness is a key element in a healthy relationship , but I feel the two of you do not take responsibility over the commitments you make . <p> There are several issues the two of you need to address to move forward . <p> First , your girlfriend had an affair and gave birth to another man 's child . I sense that this issue has not been dealt with fully . It is also clear that you two had a very unstable relationship even before this pregnancy . <p> The interference by your girlfriend 's cousin is also worrying . It is also strange that this cousin would be the one introducing you to her parents in the absence of your girlfriend . It just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me right now , though , is your definition of love and what constitutes a relationship that could lead to marriage . There is a sense of dishonesty in the way the two of you are dealing with each other . Just how much do you really know about each other and is what you know enough to sustain a marriage ? From a counsellor 's perspective , I do n't think so . <p> I am an unhappy second wife ... <p> Pastor Kitoto , I am 24 years , a second wife to a 38-year-old man . He and his first wife have three children while I have one with him . We love each other but I 'm not comfortable in this marriage . I feel that I should leave him but we have a daughter together , I would not want her to live without a father 's love . Should I stay or move on ? <p> Hello , <p> Although more people , depending on their beliefs , are embracing polygamy , the practical application of such a marriage is challenging for most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain for the sake of your child 's stability , and your conviction regarding the type of marriage you are in . <p> Your dilemma can only be solved if you are honest with yourself about what you feel about polygamy and the challenges it comes with . <p> I feel that your love for this man blinded you such that you did not think through the consequences of your decision to become a second wife . What you are experiencing now is the awakening of your values . I can assure you that you are not the only one in a dilemma , this man 's first wife must also be asking herself some hard questions regarding her marriage . <p> You need to confront this matter head on . Ask yourself whether you would rather be unhappy as a second wife for the sake of your child , or whether you would rather be happy living alone with your child . Your husband is responsible for your child whether you are married to him or not . <p> Your inner freedom as a person , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a relationship of convenience just because you want to provide for your child . <p> Why do women keep rejecting me ? <p> I am 24 , but have been unable to get a good woman I can marry in future . I believe that it is because I have focused on my faith walk with God and my job . Every time I approach someone , I am rejected . Where could I be going wrong ? <p> Hi , <p> It is okay to feel the way you do . Most men tend to be shy in the presence of women particularly if one did not grow up with sisters or was made to be wary of women . <p> I feel that it is too early to get discouraged . First , you are young , second , you have a desire to date and be in a steady relationship that will lead to marriage . Third , it is clear that you are attracted to the opposite sex . This is a great start . <p> I suggest that you start by being clear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . You also need to start socialising with people that value the same things you do since this is the only way you will meet like-minded women . Your spiritual quest is important , and I believe it will add value in your search . Learn to trust and believe in God to be your guide . <p> If you find someone you are physically attracted to , do not let your desire override your self-control , neither should you let your fear discourage you from getting to know that person . <p> If you meet someone that fits the description of the kind of woman you would want in your life , then ask her out for a cup of tea or find out more about her from someone in your social circles . <p> Keep your connection casual until you are sure this person is the right one before you ask her out on the date .

My saddest moment was when I found them kissing in her room . I felt betrayed , humiliated and disappointed . My friend ended up leaving her , and she came back to me to seek forgiveness and begged me to take her back . I have tried to forgive both of them , but it is impossible because my heart is heavy . I simply do n't trust both of them . <p> Hi , <p> From your email , it is clear that you carry a lot of pain and hurt . There is little that is as painful as finding out that the person you love is cheating on you with your close friend . <p> Besides the betrayal , there is also humiliation . Your girlfriend wronged you , she should have ended things with you rather than go behind your back with your friend . <p> Only you is in charge of how you feel , I suggest that you work on letting go of the pain you feel , otherwise it will become an emotional burden that will affect all aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of your relationship with your girlfriend unless you do some deep soul searching and reach a place of complete healing .

The delegates will have only one candidate to confirm -- the incumbent Nick Mwendwa -- whose candidature is unchallenged as his competitors gave the nomination process a wide berth arguing the process was skewed . <p> Nonetheless , the one major step remaining could be so near yet too far -- depending on pronouncements of Ohaga when the SDT makes its ruling Tuesday . <p> A flashback to December 2019 helps give a picture of Tuesdays ' eagerly awaited ruling . <p> Just before the December 7 , 2019 FKF national elections , the tribunal cancelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had already taken place . <p> This was a big blow to the federation , as the SDT ruled in favour of a section of aggrieved FKF presidential hopefuls , who poignantly , questioned the 2019 Electoral Code . <p> The composition of the Electoral Board had been contested , with the presence of Prof. Edwin Wamukoya as the Chair and Elina Shiveka as a member rendering it illegal , according to the SDT . <p> Wamukoya was initially serving as the FKF Club Licensing Committee Chairman , while Shiveka is herself a member of the SDT . <p> Among the other issues related to the code , public participation was deemed to have been improperly conducted , and the SDT demanded that there be enough public participation in line with the 2010 constitution . <p> And so , the dream of Mwendwa and team to have elections completed months before expiry of his tenure was quashed .

@@61722232 <h> TB , HIV and Covid-19 : Urgent questions as three epidemics collide <p> Tuberculosis ( TB ) and HIV pose a significant burden on South Africa 's health system . There 's a close relationship between the two . About 60 percent of TB patients are also HIV-positive . The novel coronavirus ( Sars-CoV-2 ) is likely to be of particular concern for communities with high rates of TB and HIV . Sars-CoV-2 and its resulting disease ( COVID-19 ) have n't been fully researched and understood yet . But speculation based on the behaviour of other viruses and chronic illnesses raises concerns that HIV and TB patients may have a higher risk of developing severe disease . Emily Wong answers some questions . <p> SARS-COV-2 's primary target is the lungs where it causes inflammation in the delicate tissues that usually allow oxygen to transfer into blood . In mild cases , COVID-19 can just cause a cough , but in severe cases the lungs can fill with inflammation and fluid making it very difficult for them to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body . In people who are otherwise healthy , most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I 'm not aware of any data that directly address whether TB makes people more susceptible to COVID-19 . But from the Chinese experience , we have seen that people with chronic lung disease are more likely to have increased severity of COVID-19 . On that basis , we are concerned that people with undiagnosed active TB , or people currently undergoing treatment for TB , may have increased risk of developing more severe COVID-19 disease if they become infected with SARS-COV-2 . <p> There is also increasing recognition that post-TB chronic lung disease can be an important long-term consequence of TB . We are concerned that this could also affect COVID-19 severity . After TB , people can get bronchiectasis -- chronic damage to the airways of the lung . This can predispose them to other lung infections . Another lung condition -- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- can be caused by tobacco use or by the changes left in the lung after TB . <p> Even though there 's no data about the effect of post-TB lung disease on COVID-19 at this point , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and have been left with some lung damage -- may have a more difficult and severe time with COVID-19 . <p> What about people infected with HIV ? <p> There is also very little data to guide us here . But we know that in general HIV infection has profound effects on lung health and immunity . This is why HIV infection increases susceptibility to both Mycobacterium Tuberculosis ( Mtb ) -- the bacterium that causes TB -- infection and TB disease . We are therefore concerned that HIV infection may also affect SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity . <p> But most experts think that people who are on antiretroviral therapy and whose viral loads are suppressed will probably have a better time with COVID-19 than people who are n't . It is very important that people keep taking their HIV medications throughout any disruptions caused by the current COVID-19 epidemic . <p> What will the impact of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic be on TB and HIV services in South Africa ? <p> This is a major concern . Even countries with better resourced national health systems have rapidly become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the world 's largest antiretroviral programme . Huge progress has been made . Even in KwaZulu-Natal , the epicentre of the HIV epidemic in South Africa , new HIV infection rates have been dropping . This is because of tremendous efforts to test people and to put people on antiretroviral treatment in a sustained way . Other factors have included national programmes like voluntary medical male circumcision . <p> The country has also started to see a decline in TB rates . We think this is related to improvements in the HIV treatment coverage . This is good news . But it 's the result of massive public health programmes that have taken a huge amount of time and effort to set up and optimise . And they 're still challenged by shortages of human and system resources . <p> We are very concerned about the impact that COVID-19 epidemic could have on HIV and TB services . <p> Thought is already going into how to try to maintain these critical HIV and TB services . In light of an impending health crisis , attention is on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) and the South African HIV Clinicians Society are trying to address this . For example , they are urging the health system to make six months of antiretrovirals available to people to save them from having to visit their clinics every month . <p> Are there extra precautions that individuals with TB and TB/HIV can take ? <p> It 's very important that people ensure a supply of their HIV and TB medications and take them regularly . <p> At this point all South Africans should be heeding the call made by the President to focus on the basic hygiene interventions such as frequent hand-washing as well as implementing social distancing to the maximum extent . That means avoiding contact with groups of people outside of households , and staying home strictly . <p> All of these measures are extremely important , whether someone is personally at higher risk of severe infection , or for people who may not personally be at risk of more severe disease but may have a family member who 's older or HIV-positive or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point the national recommendations apply to everyone .

There are already candidate COVID-19 vaccines in human testing . The company Moderna in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US have started clinical trials of an mRNA vaccine candidate . Other candidates are also under development . When these are ready for larger scale human testing , the global scientific community will almost certainly use existing vaccine trial networks to do this testing .

@@61722239 <p> COVID-19 is going to have a devastating impact on economies . Africa has a particular vulnerability because so many people work in the informal sector . In an interview with Moina Spooner from The Conversation Africa , Njeri Kinyanjui explains how this could unfold for Kenya 's informal labourers and whether there 's anything that can be done to support them . <p> How many people in Kenya 's workforce are informal workers and what type of work do they do ? <p> The informal sector thrives in Kenyan rural and urban centres . According to 2015 estimates , there were 11.8 million people employed in the informal economy , against 2.4 million working in the formal sector . By 2018 the informal sector accounted for 83.6 percent of total employment . <p> But we ca n't be sure of these numbers . There are no accurate statistics on how many people work in the informal economy . The figures are estimates which governments and international development organisations reach by excluding workers employed in the modern formal sector and those in small-scale farming . The methodology is in line with what multilateral agencies such as the World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different categories of workers in the informal sector . And , worryingly , despite the huge number of people in this labour force , the earnings differentials between the formal and informal sectors are significant . Entry-level staff in the formal sector earn between Sh10,001 and Sh50,000 ( US$100-$500 ) a month . Those in the informal sector typically earn a monthly income of between Sh5,000 and Sh25,000 ( US$50-$250 ) . <p> There are those who are self-employed and work for themselves . These people -- for instance tailors or welders -- then hire others on weekly or monthly contracts . <p> Then there are those who will take up any job that may arise . For instance , house cleaners or porters . <p> Some informal workers are trainees who are learning on the job or family members who are helping a family business by overseeing accounts or running errands . <p> The informal sector is typically viewed as a stopgap measure where people subsist while they wait for jobs in the formal sector . For these reasons , the sector is neglected by government policies at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But , aside from job creation , it 's hugely important to the country 's economy and many households depend on the informal sector . For instance , a lot of vehicle repair and metal work takes place in the informal sector . And the fresh vegetable trade in Kenya is largely informal and unregulated . <p> What are the main challenges they face because of this pandemic ? <p> Like any other businesses , informal sector business will end up with a reduction in customers because of the pandemic . The government is forced to implement quarantines and stay-at-home orders which will have negative consequences for spending in shopping malls , markets and restaurants . <p> For instance , customers will avoid crowded markets like Gikomba , Kariakoor and Wakulima -- the biggest informal markets in Nairobi . The demand for their goods will decline and stocked goods may go to waste . Those making school boxes , suitcases that children use for school , or school uniforms may be affected by the closure of schools . <p> The businesses that supply the informal sector could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies . That will increase the cost of goods . This will affect the cash flow that businesses have . <p> Travel time to and from work will be affected if public transport is disrupted during the pandemic . This may also mean increased transport costs or delays in getting to work . <p> Those with children will be affected by school closure because there will be nobody to supervise their children at home . During my fieldwork studies and visits to markets , I observed that young market women usually take their children to informal daycare centres . If these close due to the pandemic , it means they can not go to the market every day . Those who take their children with them to their workplaces may now be too concerned for their children 's safety . <p> Informal workers will also not be able to take many of the precautions that health authorities suggest , such as social distancing , hand washing or self-isolation . <p> Social distancing between workers in informal markets may be difficult because of crowding . For instance , in markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls separating them . The same can be found in other informal sectors like in public " matatu " transport , vehicle repair and metal work . <p> Maintaining hygiene by handwashing with soap and water may also be a problem because there are n't any facilities . For example in my research , I 've not seen any water points in Githurai and Ruiru markets . I think this will apply to most of the other markets . <p> Working from home is also difficult . Most informal workers live in informal settlements in single rooms or bedsitters . They do not have enough space to work from . For others , their jobs require them to be on-site , where they 're in contact with their customers . The informal economy operates in agglomerations in different parts of the city . In Kenya these are known as jua kali ( hot sun ) sites . <p> Is there anything that can be done to support them ? <p> There is a lot that can be done to support informal workers . <p> In light of this pandemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , they should be provided with masks to protect themselves and others . Water points should also be set up in markets and other informal sector clusters . <p> Longer-term , the pandemic highlights the need for government and urban planners to plan cities with building designs that cater for traders , artisans and peasants . These facilities should include adequate room size for work , storage and display . There should also be a good supply of clean water , electricity and garbage collection . And there should be facilities that allow traders to access the internet . <p> Nairobi News is the most trusted website in Kenya that provides the latest breaking news , entertainment news , sports news , showbiz and celebrity stories . will also keep you hooked with memes , gifs and funny videos .

At 32 percent , the proportion of debt owed to private lenders is almost on a par with multilateral institutions at 35 percent . <p> The IMF is making $50 billion available from its emergency financing facilities and some 80 countries have already asked for help , including around 20 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Covid-19 response package . <p> But African governments say that wo n't be enough . Ethiopia said in a proposal submitted ahead of the G20 meeting that Africa needs $150 billion in stimulus measures . <p> " Covid-19 is the most significant threat to our way of life and global security in modern times , " government spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said . " If it is not met with collective response , the global health crisis will be a global financial crisis . " <p> ' NOW IS THE TIME ' <p> Even before the coronavirus outbreak set the stage for a global recession , African governments were feeling the strain . Over the last decade , Africa 's public debt has increased by half to about 60 percent of the continent 's gross domestic product . <p> Seven African countries were in debt distress as of October , according to the IMF , with nine more at high risk . For some , the strain could become too much . <p> " Zambia does stand out as the country that was already underperforming , " Simon Quijano-Evans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Zambia would be to go down the path of an IMF programme , very clearly , and now is the time to do it . " <p> As lockdowns shut factories around the world , demand for metals is plunging , hitting countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia , Africa 's biggest copper producers . <p> Africa 's biggest oil producer , Nigeria , has slashed nearly $5 billion from its budget and devalued its currency . It factored in an oil price of $57 a barrel for 2020 but is selling crude for as little as $20 . Other oil producers such as Angola , Gabon , Congo Republic and Chad are also hurting . <p> Yvette Babb at investment firm William Blair International said the recent performance of many African Eurobonds reflected investors ' concern about the ability , and willingness , of governments to service their debt while the risk of sovereign credit events was rising in the short term . <p> " We do believe that this over time will be mitigated by strong support from international finance institutions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NO HALF MEASURES <p> While rich countries can borrow at close to zero interest rates to finance their massive stimulus packages , that 's not on the menu for African nations where bond yields have spiked . <p> " If you are South Africa , or one of the other sub-Saharan African countries , and have seen your borrowing costs soar in recent days , you do n't have that option , " said Charlie Robertson , global chief economist at Renaissance Capital . <p> Tim Jones at the Jubilee Debt Campaign , which is pushing for the debts of the poorest countries to be cancelled , said the multifaceted nature of Africa 's creditors meant handing out more loans to see countries through the crisis wo n't be enough . <p> " If their proposal is just to lend a lot of money without a moratorium on debt payments , it 's not going to stay in country . It 's going to be used to pay back various creditors , " he said . <p> Ethiopia wants interest payments on government loans written off with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into low-interest loans . <p> African finance ministers went further last week , calling for a waiver of interest and coupon payments on commercial debt and sovereign bonds - a move they said would save Africa $44 billion this year . <p> But suspending those debt obligations wo n't be easy , because getting all the disparate creditors to independently agree to debt relief is unlikely , analysts say . <p> " The challenge that we 're seeing globally is really one of the most profound that the global economy has faced in several generations . This requires a lot of out-of-the-box thinking , " said Abebe Aemro Selassie , head of the IMF 's Africa Department .

PHOTO PHILIMON BULAWAYO REUTERS <h> In Summary <p> *The IMF cities a devastating drought , a sharp rise in inflation and " policy missteps " by President Mnangagwa 's government as some of the reasons for the country 's projected economic slump . <p> * Economists say the country is already facing a huge HIV/Aids burden , mass starvation and economic stagnation and is too fragile to handle a pandemic with a big threat as what Covid-19 poses . <p> *Eddie Cross , a veteran economist and former opposition legislator , said Zimbabwe was facing a ' ' perfect storm ' ' because the country was already in the middle of a multifaceted humanitarian crisis . And still has to address its land issue . <p> A fortnight ago , President Emmerson Mnangagwa 's government a said it was offering about 800 commercial farms as compensation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizures that began in 2000 under then President Robert Mugabe . <p> The offer sparked heated debate in parliament , with legislators demanding that for it to be viable , the country 's constitution had to be changed to reverse the land reform programme . <p> The Sadc Tribunal Rights Watch , a group that had successfully challenged Mugabe 's land seizure in international courts , however , now says the new regulations to apparently restore farms to their owners " are misleading and provide false hope to dispossessed farmers , many of whom are now destitute . <h> Related Stories <p> Ben Freeth , the Sadc Tribunal Rights spokesperson , said the farmers will reject government 's offer because it was racist and did not offer dispossessed farmers any legal protection . <p> " Regrettably , this piece of misleading legislation is another attempt at window dressing to make it appear that the Zimbabwe government is going to return farms to their owners and re-establish property rights -- but this is not the case , " Mr Freeth said . <p> " More than 40 years after Independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning ' equality and non-discrimination ' would apply with full force . <p> " The reality is that so-called ' indigenous ' Zimbabweans have more rights than ' white ' citizens who have been deprived of their homes , businesses and livelihoods , as well as compensation for their losses . " <p> He said the regulations also favoured foreign land owners whose farms were covered under BIPPAs and BITs as the white Zimbabweans who were violently thrown out of their farms during the Mugabe era . <p> " As such , this legislation is discriminatory , " Freeth said . " It also goes against the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) Treaty and the landmark Campbell Case judgment of November 2008 in the SADC Tribunal , the regional human rights court . " <p> The Sadc Tribunal ruled that Zimbabwe violated the regional body 's treaty by denying the dispossessed farmers access to the courts . It also said Zimbabwe 's land reforms discriminated against the southern African country 's white minority population . <p> " Discriminatory laws can quickly lead to institutionalising racial discrimination . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterproductive laws against our Constitution and international law , " said Freeth . <p> " Furthermore , the government can not convince international investors from countries like the UK ? who are discriminated against because there 's no bilateral investment treaty ? that Zimbabwe is a secure investment destination when it fails to respect the rights of both international investors and its own citizens . " <p> Protected <p> Some of the dispossessed farmers were from Germany , Netherlands and Switzerland , and whose properties were protected by treaties between Harare and Western countries . <p> " While the regulations do not define the meaning of the term ' ' indigenous , ' ' the government has consistently referred to ' ' black ' ' Zimbabweans exclusively as ' ' indigenous ' ' persons , " the Sadc Tribunal Rights Watch said . <p> " This is despite the fact that the standard definition of ' ' indigenous ' ' applies to persons born and residing in a particular place or region , and is not exclusive to a particular race , gender or ethnicity . <p> " A significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many were second , third or even fourth generation who knew no other home , " the group said . <p> Agriculture minister Perrance Shiri said 440 farms belonging to ' ' indigenous ' ' people were seized during the land reform programme . <p> Mr Shiri said 350 of the farmers were still on the acquired land while 90 farms had resettled people , but the Sadc Tribunal Rights Watch said only three black farmers were forced off their land . <p> For years , Zimbabwe has ignored rulings by regional and international courts compelling it to reverse the takeover of farms protected by BIPPAs and BITs.The International Centre for Settlement of Investment <p> Disputes ( ICSID ) -- part of the World Bank Group -- in 2009 and 2015 ruled against Zimbabwe in cases involving Dutch farmers . <p> In 2008 , the now defunct Sadc Tribunal ruled that Zimbabwe 's land reform programme was patently racist and Harare was ordered to compensate the dispossessed farmers . <p> " The reason that BIPPA and BIT-protected properties are now being considered for compensation is that the bankrupt government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Sadc Tribunal Rights Watch added . <p> The EU , Britain and the US put the issue of compensation of the white commercial farmers as one of the pre-conditions for re-engagement with Zimbabwe after Mugabe 's fall in a military coup in 2017 . <p> International lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have also emphasised that Zimbabwe must compensate the dispossessed land owners if it wants loans . <p> Mr Mugabe , who had ruled Zimbabwe since Independence from Britain in 1980 , championed the land reform programme saying it was meant to correct colonial injustices . <p> Critics , however , say the government parcelled the productive farms to ruling party officials and supporters who had no interest in farming . <p> A land audit initiated by President Mnangagwa showed that a number of top politicians owned multi-farms that remained underutilised . Some of the multiple-farm owners include Mugabe family members . President Mnangagwa hinted late last year that former first lady Grace Mugabe owned at least 16 farms . <p> He said the farms would be taken back in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " policy .

The CS acknowledged having received several calls to waive rent to Kenyans whose sources of income have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic but ruled out any direct intervention . <p> " We decided that that ( calling for reduction of rent ) could destroy the industry , " said Yatani during a recent interview with Financial Standard . This comes at a time when sharp divisions have emerged among landlords , with some taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their only source of income .

In most cases , these players have offered deferral of rent payments . The International Monetary Fund has waded into the debate , asking governments to find ways of protecting both the tenants and landlords . While the government has been non-committal on how it intends to help out those who can no longer afford rent , President Uhuru Kenyatta is on record thanking landlords who have slashed or waived rent for their tenants for a few months . <p> " I note with appreciation that some property owners have reduced monthly rent to help provide a roof over the heads of our vulnerable brothers and sisters .

About 4.6 million households in the country live in rented houses , according to the latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . In Nairobi , nine out of every 10 families live in a rented house . In Mathare Sub-county , arguably Nairobi City 's poorest area , according to analysis done by Financial Standard on various socio-economic factors , virtually everyone ( 97 per cent ) lives in rented property .

These tax measures include slashing of value added tax ( VAT ) from 16 to 14 per cent and waiving Pay As You Earn ( Paye ) for those earning Sh24,000 and below . Those earning above Sh24,000 will , on the other hand , see their Paye decrease from 30 to 25 per cent beginning this month . " The net effect in terms of reduction in income tax will mean there will be more disposable income and , therefore , the power to purchase more .

The origins of Atl ? tico de Madrid 's ' Metropolitano ' stadium name <p> Atleti 's Wanda Metropolitano is a very modern stadium with one very traditional element . <p> Such was the love for the old Vicente Calderon stadium that Atletico de Madrid 's famously traditional and passionate fans were wary when the club declared that they 'd be moving to a new stadium on the eastern outskirts of the city in 2017 . But when the club announced the name of the new stadium in December 2016 , many began to look at the new project with love . The new venue would , as we all now know , be called the Wanda Metropolitano . <p> Wanda refers to one of the club 's principal sponsors and partners , the Wanda Group . Nothing traditional there . But , what about Metropolitano ? <p> Metropolitano is a nod to the club 's history and to the club 's home before the Vicente Calderon : the Stadium Metropolitano , which curiously used the English term . Atleti played there between 1923 and 1966 at the ground which was situated in the west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University City , ' thanks to the many universities and higher education institutions in the area . <p> Initially , Atl ? ti had to share with some other local clubs and the stadium -- which had been built by the same group behind the construction of the city 's metro system -- did n't belong to them . And their time at the Metropolitano was n't uninterrupted , as they also had to play some matches in Chamart ? n and Vallecas due to a variety of reasons ranging from scheduling conflicts to post-Civil War damage . Disruption and ground-sharing was problematic , but eventually , Atl ? tico purchased the venue and enjoyed some of their finest years there . <p> Eventually , though , the decision was taken to move to a new site by the Manzanares river , to the ground that would eventually become known as the Vicente Calder ? n in honour of the president of the same name . In 2017 , Los Rojiblancos were on the move again and a purposeful decision was made by the club to reconnect with the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Metropolitano name . A campaign was launched with the hashtag #HistoryAndFuture , while a newly-created ' ATM Metropolitana ' font was created to brand the stadium . The lettering was inspired by the Art Deco typefaces found on the tickets and signage on the old Stadium Metropolitano . <p> When the time came to move , the club released a video that harked back to the past and to the previous Stadium Metropolitano , showing black and white images that depicted some fans peeking over the walls at the magic that was inside . For Fernando Torres , whose grandfather experienced Atleti 's time at that ground , this was especially emotional . " It reminds me of my grandfather , who I can recall speaking about the Stadium Metropolitano as he passed the history of the club onto me , " Torres said of the name . " I know what it means for Atl ? tico fans . There could n't be a better name . "

PHOTO JARED NYATAYA <p> The world has over the years witnessed a wide range of examples of powerful forces , natural and man-made , which often have an unavoidable long-lasting and dramatic effect on the commercial landscape . We have seen tsunamis , earthquakes , revolutions and civil wars make headlines , which are often followed by economic crises . <p> Today , let 's consider some of the legal implications on commercial contracts such as force majeure and frustration arising from negative world crises . Force Majeure has its origins in Roman law under the name " vis major " or " vis divina " where unforeseeable and irresistible events relieved a party from responsibility for non-performance of contractual obligations . The doctrine was then adopted by civil law countries . <p> The Black 's Law Dictionary defines " force majeure " as " An event or effect that can be neither anticipated nor controlled . The term includes both acts of nature ( e.g. floods and hurricanes ) " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God " as being " An overwhelming , unpreventable event caused by forces of nature such as an earthquake , flood or tornado ... the effect of which could not be prevented or avoided by the exercise of due care of foresight . " <p> Events that result from natural phenomena ( for example , flooding , strong winds or ice storms ) as well as acts due to human intervention such as third-party actions ( for example , strikes , wars , acts of terrorism , embargoes or rebellions ) are some of the occurrences that would qualify as force majeure . The list of these events is inexhaustible , so let us look at the characteristics of a force majeure event . <h> Also Read <p> According to case law , to constitute force majeure , an event must be both unforeseeable and irresistible . Unforeseeability means that the party claiming " force majeure " did not foresee it neither could he/she be reasonably expected to foresee the same . It is also expected that such a party 's efforts to tackle the event must be useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable party to have taken reasonable measures to avoid the occurrence of the event is an additional requirement . Irresistibility means that the harm-causing event must render absolutely impossible the performance of the debtor 's obligations . <p> If performance becomes more onerous , perilous or difficult , the irresistibility element of the force majeure concept is not met . <p> The doctrine of frustration is said to be the common law equivalent of the civil law force majeure doctrine in the area of contracts . <p> Following leading English cases , common law courts have concluded that frustration takes place when a supervening event , which occurs without the fault of either contracting party , so significantly changes the nature of the parties ' rights or obligations that it would be unjust to hold them to the contract 's literal stipulations in the new circumstances . <p> The criteria used to satisfy the test of the doctrine of frustration include that : ( i ) the event in question must have occurred after the formation of the contract and can not be self-induced ; ( ii ) the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the parties had intended . <p> This difference must take into account the distinction between complete fruitlessness and mere inconvenience ; ( iii ) the disruption must be permanent , not temporary or transient . The change must totally affect the nature , meaning , purpose , effect and consequences of the contract so far as concerns either or both parties ; and ( iv ) the act or event that brought about such significant change must not have been foreseeable . <p> Impossibility of performance is a key factor in determining whether a contract has been frustrated . Impossibility has been linked to cases of physical impossibility ( for example , where the subject matter of the contract has been lost or destroyed ) , supervening illegality , death or sickness of a contracting party in a personal services contract , land transactions ( for example , sales or leases of property ) and even delays in contractual performance due to natural phenomena or acts of third parties for example , wars , government regulations , strikes . <p> There is a striking resemblance between the civil law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration as has been covered above . A typical force majeure clause in a contract should spell out specific events that would meet the ' force majeure ' characteristics discussed earlier .

@@61984239 <p> Some Kenyans exhaust me -- utterly . But let me be fair . I exhaust them too . So we are even because we exhaust each other . Even so , I am sick of being sick and tired of them . It upsets me to no end when individuals who 've never done anything for Kenya -- except steal from the public -- question the patriotic bona fides of those who 've sacrificed themselves for the country . <p> I write here not to defend ODM 's Raila Odinga but to give the man from Bondo his due . Since his March 2018 Handshake with Jubilee 's Uhuru Kenyatta , Mr Odinga has faced ruthless public opprobrium by his foes and even some of his comrades . Let me tell you why they should zip it . <p> In the annals of the Republic of Kenya , not many Kenyans can hold a candle to Mr Odinga as a freedom fighter . I know -- Mr Odinga is n't perfect . Who is ? Mr Odinga has made his own share of political mistakes . <p> No one of his age who 's been in the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition , can claim to never have taken at least one wrong turn somewhere . <p> DEMOCRATIC CULTURE <p> Show me such a person , if they exist , and I will show you a liar . Politics , like everything else , is an experiment . This is true in a rickety post-colonial state like Kenya where you often have to improvise because the country lacks a democratic culture . <p> In life , it 's only fair you judge people by the full body of their work . You take the full measure of a person 's life and then you put it on a scale . Against this standard , Mr Odinga must be adjudged as one of the most patriotic Kenyans , alive or dead . <p> I rank him up there at the top of the pyramid with his father , the late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga . <p> Detractors say that he 's one of the " dynasties . " I agree -- but he 's an opposition " dynasty . " Similarly , those who call themselves " hustlers " are also right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deceivers . " They want to appropriate the language of revolution , but have no history or track record of opposing the state . <p> Mr Odinga and his family , including his spouse Ida Odinga , know what it is to face and live the ire of a savage , undemocratic state . For the nearly one decade in which Mr Odinga was under detention for being a liberator , Mrs Odinga held the family together . <p> It 's not a secret the persecution and mental anguish that the Moi-Kanu state put her and the family through . Jaramogi , her father-in-law , was himself Mr Moi 's public enemy number one . <p> The Odinga family lived not knowing whether they would be alive or free from one day to the next . These sacrifices are legend . Yet , and this is remarkable , I 've found neither Mr Odinga , nor Mrs Odinga , bitter people . I do n't know how . <p> Much of the current ire and angst against Mr Odinga springs from his Handshake with Mr Kenyatta . The vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insiders who thought Mr Kenyatta would hand over the presidency to DP William Ruto on a silver platter . <p> UNREQUITED ENTITLEMENT <p> Their hysterics arise out of a sense of unrequited entitlement . Their bitterness is actually anti-democratic because in a democracy , no one is entitled by right to rule . <p> It 's the people who choose their leaders , not the other way round . Like Senator Kipchumba Murkomen , who was ousted from the Senate Majority Leader perch , they are seeing red . They now threaten Armageddon . They fail to recognise that the chickens they hatched have come home to roost . <p> Similarly , some in Mr Odinga 's camp have left with angry conniptions over the Handshake . They ca n't reconcile themselves to the changed political landscape . Several have made unsavoury alliances with the devil to spite Mr Odinga . They accuse him of betrayal . <p> It 's their right to feel betrayed . It 's also their democratic right to castigate Mr Odinga for exercising his right to associate with Mr Kenyatta . They claim Mr Odinga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly . How can one man kill the opposition ? If the opposition had only one man , then it was n't an opposition at all . Why ca n't they step up and take the mantle of the opposition ? Mr Odinga ca n't be -- and do -- everything . <p> Mr Odinga says he went into the Handshake with Mr Kenyatta to save the country from collapse after a botched election . <p> HANDSHAKE <p> It 's a fact the country stabilised after the Handshake . We know Mr Kenyatta has taken uneven and fledgling steps against some corrupt mandarins since then . He 's neutered Mr Ruto , the deputy who thought he was the real power behind Mr Kenyatta . <p> He 's decapitated Mr Ruto 's allies right and left . These actions would 've been impossible without Mr Odinga 's support . Let 's just say I am not shedding any tears . Mr Odinga is entitled to play out his rapprochement with Mr Kenyatta . Is he being played ? Only history will judge him .

Persephone spends six months aboveground living the good life of summer and song before returning for six months below with Hades . ( He 's her husband . ) Hermes , of course , has wings on his feet . And the Fates ( at least in this version ) are always darting about , minding everyone 's business . <p> But watching " Hadestown " unfold so gorgeously at the Walter Kerr Theater , I found myself thinking of other Greek characters : those lucky few saved from heartbreak by radical metamorphoses . <p> That 's because " Hadestown " -- written by Ana ? s Mitchell , developed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's onstage at the Kerr is almost unrecognizably different from the version I saw at New York Theater Workshop in 2016 . There , it was garbled and precious , too cool for its own good , let alone Broadway . <p> The gods , or more likely Chavkin and her creative team , have saved " Hadestown " on its way uptown -- via Edmonton and London -- by turning it into something very much warmer , if not yet ideally warm . The story is clearer , the songs express that story more directly and the larger themes arise from it naturally rather than demanding immediate attention like overeager undergraduates . <p> All this has been done with hardly a change to the plot , which cleverly grafts its two myths into one . In Mitchell 's telling , Eurydice ( Eva Noblezada ) winds up in hell because of the frost and famine that follow when Persephone ( Amber Gray ) pays Hades her annual conjugal visit . ( Classically , Eurydice just dies of a snakebite . ) And because Hades ( Patrick Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jealous Persephone who persuades him to let Orpheus ( Reeve Carney ) take her back . <p> Even Hermes , who does n't really belong in either story , has been recruited to narrate , contextualize and kibitz . And why not , if it gives the great Andr ? De Shields a chance to slide around in silver sharkskin ? It 's he who tells us -- in what is now , correctly , the opening number -- that what we 're about to hear is " a sad song " no matter how jaunty it sounds . Also that he 's " gon na sing it anyway . " <p> That 's a pretty good pr ? cis of the original myths , but Mitchell , fascinated by them since childhood , has taken them further as she expanded the material from song cycle to concept album to show . In the story of Orpheus and Eurydice she tugs on the tension between art and domesticity : What good is beauty if you 're hungry ? And the struggle between Hades and Persephone naturally becomes a parable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth is akin to infidelity . <p> To make these points , " Hadestown " moves the tale to an earth that resembles sassy New Orleans , with hell a demonic foundry . As such , Mitchell 's score combines folk , pop and Dixieland with rhythmic work shanties and , for the lovers , ethereal arias . All of it sounds great in swinging arrangements for a terrific seven-piece onstage band . <p> Other than some reordering , that 's mostly just as it was three years ago -- at least on the surface . But if there 's one thing this " Hadestown " is pushing , it 's the idea that what really matters is happening where you ca n't see it . <p> Underneath the hood , a million small adjustments have been made , especially to the lyrics , which have shed some of their pop haze in favor of specificity . The Fates , a girl-group trio , now feel more integral to the action , not just witty commenters on it . And a new chorus of five hunky workers expands not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of freedom . <p> Yet the most obvious transformation is visual : " Hadestown " is now performed on a proscenium stage instead of in a miniature Greek amphitheater . Though still high-concept , Rachel Hauck 's single set depicts a recognizable idea of place : a basement jazz joint that miraculously turns into the furnace room of Hades ' factory . This is emblematic of the production 's choice to deliver the story to the audience in as close to the Broadway manner as the material can accommodate . <p> In truth , it can only accommodate so much . " Hadestown , " even with the heat turned up , is still a somewhat abstract experience , mediated by several layers of narration from Hermes , the Fates and many of the songs . A feeling is as likely to be described as enacted , and Mitchell develops her larger themes mostly through metaphor . This can get tiring ; even though so much of what happens happens beautifully , I began to feel it would be better shorter . <p> The main story suffers most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eurydice are blandly written and thus performed . What starts off as a smart riff on " Rent " -- poor bohemian girl falls for musician who ca n't finish his song -- soon becomes vague and merely pretty . Attempts to complicate the characters ' psychology backfire , and their climactic ascent from the underworld , the one thing that worked perfectly downtown , now does n't . They merely walk in circles . <p> Luckily , the second story is direct and vivid throughout . Page , rocking a Leon Redbone look and rumble , makes an electrifyingly maleficent Hades , even without playing up the Trumpian parallels that have overtaken the material . ( One of his songs , written more than a decade ago , is called " Why We Build the Wall . " ) <p> And Gray , never better , makes something quite brilliant out of Persephone : a free spirit , a loose cannon , a first lady co-opted by wealth yet emotionally subversive . When , as part of the curtain call , she sings the score 's loveliest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last wish the show would slow down so you could live in the glowy moment forever . <p> Along the way there , Chavkin has probably come as close as anyone could to selling a cerebral downtown story as state-of-the-art Broadway entertainment . Like the sets and musical arrangements , the costumes ( by Michael Krass ) , the lighting ( by Bradley King ) and the sound design ( by Nevin Steinberg and Jessica Paz ) are as good as it gets . <p> The result is just as busily beautiful as Chavkin 's production of " Natasha , Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812 " -- and more coherent . Which almost gets you over the hiccup that a show so fundamentally despairing ( " It 's a sad song " ) is now so aggressively welcoming . <p> Do n't let that distract you , though , from its quiet point , buried in a lyric near the end : that we sing the sad song again and again the way we play solitaire : " as if it might turn out this time .

This year there have been five -- in New York , Texas , and Washington state -- for a total of more than 120 cases . Here 's what you need to know about the disease and the risk of getting it . <p> Measles Outbreak : Your Questions Answered <p> New York Times <p> -- What is measles ? <p> Measles is an extremely contagious virus . It can cause serious respiratory symptoms , fever and rash . In some cases , especially in babies and young children , the consequences can be severe . Measles killed 110,000 people globally in 2017 , mostly children under 5 . <p> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , one in 10 children with measles gets an ear infection , which can lead to permanent deafness . One in 20 children with measles develops pneumonia and one in 1,000 develops encephalitis ( brain swelling that can cause brain damage ) . Pregnant women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies . <p> One or two in 1,000 children who contract measles will die . In countries where measles vaccination is not routine , it is a significant cause of death , according to the World Health Organization . <p> -- How is measles transmitted ? <p> Measles is transmitted by droplets from an infected person 's nose or mouth . If you 're in a room with someone infected with measles , you can inhale their virus when they cough , sneeze or even talk . Infected people can transmit the measles virus starting four days before they develop a rash , so they may be contagious before they realize they have the disease . They remain able to spread the virus for about four days after the rash appears . <p> The virus can also live on surfaces for several hours , and is so contagious that , according to the CDC , " you can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been , up to two hours after that person is gone . " <p> -- What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people show no symptoms up to two weeks after being infected . Then they develop symptoms typical of a cold or virus : moderate fever , cough , sore throat , runny nose , red and swollen eyes . <p> But after two or three days of that , fever spikes to 104 or 105 degrees and the telltale red dots appear on the skin , first on the face , then spreading down the body . <p> -- Is there a cure for measles ? <p> No . The vast majority of people who contract measles have n't been vaccinated , and giving them the measles vaccine within 72 hours of being exposed to the virus might help -- at least by reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms . The Mayo Clinic says that pregnant women , babies and people with weak immune systems can receive an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin within six days of being exposed to measles , which might prevent or lessen the symptoms . <p> -- How safe and effective is the measles vaccine ? <p> Extremely safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects in most children . Small numbers may get a mild fever , rash , soreness or swelling , the CDC says . Adults or teenagers may feel temporary soreness or stiffness at the injection site . Rarely , the vaccine might cause a high fever that could lead to a seizure , according to the CDC . Contrary to rumors that some anti-vaccine activists continue to repeat , the vaccine does not cause autism . <p> Children should receive two doses of the vaccine : the first when they are 12 to 15 months old ; the second when they are between 4 and 6 years old . If infants who are between 6 and 11 months old are about to travel from the United States to another country , the CDC recommends they receive one dose of the vaccine beforehand . <p> One dose of the vaccine is about 93 percent effective ; two doses boost that number to 97 percent , the CDC says . <p> People who do n't get the vaccine are at very high risk for contracting measles . " Almost everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are exposed to the measles virus , " the CDC says . <p> -- If I 'm not vaccinated , is it too late to get the shot ? <p> It 's not too late . In fact , if measles is occurring in your community , it 's a good idea to get vaccinated unless you are sure you have previously received two shots of the MMR vaccine ; or you 've had all three of the diseases the vaccine protects against ( which gives you lifelong immunity ) ; or you were born before 1957 . ( The vaccine was made available in 1963 and in the decade before that , virtually every child got measles by age 15 , so the CDC considers people born before 1957 likely to have had measles as children . ) <p> -- If most people are getting vaccinated , why does it matter if I do n't vaccinate my child ? <p> You are probably thinking of the concept of herd immunity , which means that if a large number of people are protected from a disease by a vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishing the risk for people who are unvaccinated . The threshold for herd immunity varies by disease -- for a highly contagious disease , a very high percentage of people need to be vaccinated to meet that threshold . <p> Because measles is so contagious , between 93 percent and 95 percent of people in a community need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity . Remember , some people ca n't be vaccinated for medical reasons : infants , pregnant women and people who are immune compromised . <p> During the Disneyland outbreak in 2015 , a 9-month-old child whose parents were planning to immunize contracted measles from an older child who had n't been vaccinated , said Dr. Annabelle De St. Maurice , an expert on infectious diseases at UCLA . So vaccinating your child not only protects your child , it helps protect others in your community . <p> -- Wait , did n't we eliminate measles ? <p> In 2000 , measles was declared eliminated from the United States because the country had gone for more than 12 months without any " continuous disease transmission " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease was completely eradicated ; it means the United States no longer had any places where the disease was endemic or homegrown . <p> There have been a small number of measles cases in the United States since then , ranging from 37 in 2004 to 667 in 2014 , largely among people who were not vaccinated . So far this year , there have been five outbreaks ( defined as three or more cases ) , in New York , Texas and Washington state , for a total of more than 120 cases . <p> Most of the cases in New York affected the Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County . An unvaccinated child contracted measles in Israel , and it spread to unvaccinated children . The New York City health department is recommending an MMR vaccine for anyone traveling to Israel , where there is a wave of cases . <p> Most of the American cases since 2000 have been the result of people traveling to or from countries where measles is endemic because there is little vaccination . <p> -- How many people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . Measles immunization in the United States is stable and high -- more than 90 percent -- according to CDC tracking . <p> -- Who are the people not getting vaccinated ? <p> One way to measure is by looking at the annual assessment of kindergarten vaccinations . It shows only Colorado , the District of Columbia , Idaho and Kansas dipping below the national 90 percent vaccination rate , though in certain communities the rate can be lower . <p> Generally , those who do not immunize their children are demographically more white and more educated , De St. Maurice said . " In part due to the success of vaccines , people are not as familiar with these diseases , so they question their effectiveness , " she said . Conversely , when the disease reappears , as it did in Washington , demand for vaccines rises . <p> Every state has these laws . Three states allow only medical exemptions : Mississippi , West Virginia and , more recently , California , following the Disneyland outbreak . The rest grant exemptions for personal , philosophical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lax laws the ones with the most measles cases ? <p> There have not been enough cases to warrant a major survey , but Dr. Saad Omer of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta warned that with a rising number of cases , that could change . <p> Omer , who studies immunization coverage and disease incidence , said research had shown that states that allow more exemptions have increased pertussis ( whooping cough ) outbreaks . <p> Studies have also shown that people who refuse vaccines are disproportionately represented in the early stage of outbreaks . " They 're providing the tinder that can start the fires of the epidemics , " Omer said . <p> -- How does the U.S. compare with other countries ? <p> Measles cases have been increasing around the world , too . Worldwide , there was an 80 percent drop in measles deaths from 2000 through 2017 . But reported cases of measles have increased 30 percent since 2016 , according to the World Health Organization . <p> Ninety-four percent of children in the United States get the recommended two-dose vaccine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen countries reached the 99 percent mark , including Cuba , China , Morocco and Uzbekistan . Canada , Britain and Switzerland are a few of the Western countries that are below 90 percent . <p> In Europe overall , only about 90 percent of children receive the recommended two-dose vaccine . Worldwide , about 85 percent of children receive the first dose , but the number drops to 67 percent for a second dose , data shows . <p> -- Does this mean mumps and rubella cases are re-emerging , too ? <p> The MMR vaccine has also greatly reduced the threat of mumps and rubella in the United States . It is not quite as effective against mumps , with 88 percent effectiveness , according to the CDC , and cases have increased in recent years , from 229 in 2012 to 6,366 in 2016 . <p> Rubella used to cause millions of infections in the United States . According to the CDC , 12.5 million people got rubella in an epidemic from 1964 to 1965 , and the disease caused 11,000 women to lose their pregnancies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with congenital rubella syndrome , which can cause brain damage and other serious problems . <p> Rubella was declared eliminated in the United States in 2004 , and the CDC says that fewer than 10 cases are reported each year .

From elephants targeted for their tusks , to smaller game at risk of poaching for meat , no wildlife is safe from the spear or snare . <p> According to James Isiche , IFAW regional director for East Africa , though this group of 76 female rangers supported by the organisation faces the constant threat from armed poachers and sometimes , dangerous wildlife , the pandemic has made the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stakes have never been higher as pressure is on these women , and other rangers to protect wildlife , often staying in the bush for weeks on end without seeing their families . <p> " The disease has changed our normal working routine since we do n't have the one week off every month , a fact that has forced us not to return to our homes , " says Purity Amleset Lakara , a 23-year old mother of one , who also is a member of Team Lioness . <p> Apart from that , their patrolling routine has shifted due to fear of increased poaching . <p> " We are no longer interacting with the community , hence we 're not getting the helpful information , " explains Lakara . <p> Economic fallout <p> She also reckons that a decrease in tourism , which is the main economic activity means the locals lack income to support their livelihoods . <p> " This has made our interaction with these people a little bit difficult especially when it comes to dealing with poaching .

He says , though there are no indications that poaching has spiked , there is imminent risk as a result of scaling down of anti- poaching operations caused by lack of funds due to loss of tourism revenues . <p> " The economic fallout on communities dependent on a thriving tourism industry has been catastrophic . Tourism revenue supports land leases , community rangers and livelihoods . In its absence , wildlife security is threatened as conservancies are likely to collapse leading to loss of space for animals , " he adds . <p> He adds , the ability of the rangers to conduct patrols will be severely hampered with the likely consequence that poaching will rise . <p> Human-wildlife conflict <p> " These community wildlife rangers are often the first-responders to these incidences .

She was co-signed by Beyonc ? to feature in the Directory of Black Owned Businesses . PHOTO SALATON NJAU NMG <p> From her photos online , Theresia Kyalo possesses a piercing , quirky charm . In-person , the jeweller is refined and collected . The young multidisciplinary artist is a fixture on the scene of what one might call elite African art . <p> Last month , the jewellery designer was signed by American singer and songwriter Beyonc ? Knowles on the pop artist 's directory of Black Owned Businesses . What this nod means is that she will have increased visibility . It also lends credibility to her artwork in the global market of contemporary jewellery . <p> Now she is sitting in front of me wearing as much unassuming calm as makeup , occasionally glancing at her phone as any 24-year-old would . <p> I ask her what it is like for her work to be recognised by Beyonc ? . What does this deal mean to her brand ? <p> " I was excited , " she responds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were happier for me than I was for myself . It 's yet to dawn on me just how big this deal is . Not everyone gets their business listed on the directory . " <h> Also Read <p> " This boost means that my brand will grow to the next level . Given how the pandemic has affected businesses , this was the best news to me . " <p> Theresia comes off as plucky with twice the amount of foresight . From her Instagram bio that reads " metal works and line drawing " , one is tempted to imagine she is an artisan . Eclectic to the core , she often experiments with different materials , ranging from metal to textiles and recently glass and ceramics . Before she is a jeweller , she is a line artist . <p> " It 's from these lines that I started making pieces that imitated the drawings . After some time , I was n't happy with just line drawings . I wanted a medium that would give tangibility to my lines . " <p> Brass does it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach her craftsmanship in brass . <p> " I took long to get things in motion since most of the artisans I approached could n't comprehend my concept , " she says . <p> She has since found an artisan , and after sketching out designs of various creations , spurred on by her everyday experiences , the artisan fabricates them into jewellery . <p> A model adorned in jewellery from Theresia Kyalo . PHOTO COURTESY <p> When I ask her about her place within the community of artists , Theresia confidently replies that she has carved her own space , where she is n't obliged to conform . <p> " Most artists tend to make designs that people are familiar with . We always want earrings and necklaces to look a certain way . It needs not to be that way . " <p> Quite rightly , her work heavily features pieces that are nearly as hard to discern as they 're to find elsewhere . I 'm curious to know how this bears on her brand . <p> " I create first to fulfil my artistic self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and how to wear some of the pieces . I attend to those who understand what I 'm trying to do and those who do n't , " she says . <p> Among her leading creations , a hybrid of modern and traditional African jewellery , include Utosi headpiece , Kinga Pua nose bridge , Mdomo Kipande lip piece and Saba Pete ring . The pieces retail for Sh7,000 for an earpiece to Sh35,000 for the headpiece . <p> " I 'm not looking to sell to everybody , " she notes with a fiery punch of self-belief . <p> She sells these on her Instagram page and on Ditto Africa , an online marketplace that features products from a curated community of African and African diaspora brands . <p> On who the primary target is , Theresa notes that her pieces are non-binary . " They can be worn by either gender for a fantastic look . The pieces work well for people who are n't fixated about gender : those with a different eye . " They can also be used to style the cast for theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long ago , it was a taboo for a man to wear earrings . This mind-set is shifting . We are n't where we ought to be , but we are n't where we were 20 years ago . " <p> She observes that even artists themselves are becoming more accommodating to emergent forms of art . <p> For a maker of such innovative pieces , what is her style and what type of jewellery does she wear ? Theresia is a minimalist who prefers a simple dress code and even far less jewellery . <p> On the day I 'm met her , she was in denim pants paired with an inconspicuous brown sweater and flat shoes , subtly accessorised with an almost unnoticeable black pouch . <p> " I do n't bling out all the time . If I 'm wearing something , it has to accentuate my face . Occasionally I buy jewellery at Maasai Market , " she says . <p> A model adorned in jewellery from Theresia Kyalo .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including myself and my friends , have had to stop thinking about business and just focus on survival . " <p> She only resumed work recently after a long break . " I just was n't in the right mental space to work . I realised how privileged I am because not so many people would decide not to work and still be able to fend for their families during this time . " <p> This lull has been a time of reflection for her " in terms of the trajectory I want my brand to take " while evaluating whether her products are " suitable for the market given the prevailing circumstances . " <p> " I 've been designing and thinking about different elements that I 'd incorporate in my brand as an expansion plan .

I also would n't have taken time to reflect on my business holistically as I have . Despite the negative atmosphere around the world , there have been positives too . " <p> So , what strikes her about Beyonc ? ? Theresia chuckles . " I 'm inspired by her business acumen , which most people do n't notice . How she is stuck with her practice is admirable . Whichever line of work you 're in , longevity is key , which is why most people look up to her . " <p> More often than not , society frowns upon strong women and even erroneously labels them feminists . It 's a touchy subject that often divides than it unites . Her views ? <p> " We need strong women who can articulate various issues . It 's encouraging that we 've embraced women in business and the corporate space and those occupying positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> For her , the biggest test of the society 's honesty is not simply to lobby for women leadership but its readiness to fully support women already holding such positions . <p> Ironically , Theresia refers to young people and their behaviour as though she is not one herself . While eloquent , she punctuates her speech with deliberate interludes characteristic of millennials , talking playfully if giggly , but barely mincing her words . <p> She laments that sometimes clients assume she is aloof " when in reality I 've a lot of work to do " especially since " I do n't have a team yet . " <p> A model adorned in jewellery from Theresia Kyalo . PHOTO COURTESY <p> When she enrolled for a law degree at Riara University , she 'd hoped to become a diplomat .

" <p> I remind her that she is only 24 , with a long life ahead of her , and possible changes of heart . <p> " I 'm still figuring it out . Nothing is fixed .

" <p> She could also decide to go back to school to " study something different that tickles my fancy such as culinary arts to become a chef . " <p> Theresia is also an active participant in local art workshops . " It fascinates me to watch people practice their crafts and to learn different things .

Going forward , the Sh316.5 billion figure will be used as the baseline to calculate county allocations . But Meru Senator Mithika Linturi has sought to reduce the baseline from Sh316.5 billion to between Sh250-Sh270 billion . Both Linturi and Sakaja have been tasked to come up with a harmonised proposal to have a fixed figure ahead of today 's vote . But it appears the House is still headed for another standoff after senators from across the divide indicated there was no such consensus . Murkomen said they expected the House leadership to facilitate passage of the new proposal .

Yesterday , Deputy Majority Leader Fatuma Dulo ( Isiolo ) said there was no sincerity among the senators over the standoff .

" One of the proposals that is gaining support is to have between Sh250 billion and Sh270 billion divided using the second generation formula then the balance be shared using the CRA formula or Senate Finance Committee proposal , " said Zani .

@@62057233 <p> The dormant Laikipia Airstrip , parallel to the Kinamba-Rumuruti road . XN Iraki Laikipia is a fascinating county . It straddles modern and traditional ways of life ; airstrips and manyattas coexist ; ranches and small-scale farmers survive side by side . And so does affluence and poverty . It is a melting pot , multiracial and multi-ethnic . It has been that way for more than 100 years . Settlers were finding their way into this county even before World War I. After independence , some of the big ranches were sold and sub-divided into small farms that now dot the region from Nyahururu to Kinamba and Rumuruti . Last month , I paid a cultural visit to Laikipia as a dowry negotiator . The state of the road network left me impressed . One member of my team even suggested he would not mind if Laikipia were allowed to annex his county to the south . <p> But what caught my attention was something else - a disused airstrip running parallel to the Kinamba-Rumuruti Road . The airstrip is not far from a place called Ndurumo , a mzungu misspelling or mispronunciation of ' ndururumo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Ndurumo next to a small waterfall . The airstrip is next to the small-scale farmers who are unlikely to fly any time soon . It may have once been in use , but the fact that it is there is a plus for this county . The former ranchers or large-scale farmers who owned this land before used to fly and most current ranchers own airstrips . After independence , the airstrips were chopped into shambas . Maps made in the 1950s show airstrips in Nyandarua , Laikipia , Nakuru and other counties where British or Afrikaans ( Boers ) had homes . Some are immortalised by schools named Kiandege . <p> Why were these airstrips not spared ? Why were they subdivided into shambas ? Did the new land owners believe they or their progeny would never fly ? Why did our government allow that ? By sparing the airstrip near Kinamba , Laikipia has spared a dream . Maybe one day the boys and girls who neighbour it will fly home . Flying is a dream most youngsters harbour till they meet simultaneous equations in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some might find me condescending , but why would former colonialists do better than us when we are free ? Should we not have either maintained their lifestyles or even outdone them ? Subdividing airstrips into shambas instead of keeping them even when no one owns a plane is what low expectations are made of . Should you build a house without a parking because you have no car ? It seems we loved to hate the mzungu 's symbols of affluence , yet we all want to be affluent . In the former White Highlands , the biggest and most grandiose houses were build by mzungus . They are yet to get competitors . <p> We turned polo fields and golf courses into shambas , yet we all dream of becoming rich and affluent . And who said peasants ca n't play these games if they are demystified ? What of their progeny ? Do n't say the small-scale farmers do n't care about niceties like golf courses or airstrips .

Or replanting an indigenous forest ? Destruction of these symbols of affluence or higher standards of living , from polo fields to airstrips may have inadvertently attenuated our dreams and aspirations . We often try to revive the dreams by taking kids on trips to Nairobi . At Kisumu International Airport , I always find school kids visiting , watching planes as they land and take off . Could the decimation of sports facilities explain why soccer is an addiction in Kenya ? Could that explain why everyone wants to live in Nairobi where there are airports , golf courses , skyscrapers and others signs of affluence ?

In the privacy of my thoughts , I keep wondering why we did not improve on what the mzungu left beyond taking their names like Jayden , Ethan , Liam , Carol , Gentrix or Beryl . How did they create their wealth beyond use of cheap labour ? How about economies of scale because of large swathes of land ? Not that I admire colonialism , but we could have learnt a lesson or two from mzungus . Why should mzungus who lorded over us fly planes while we cycle ? Why should they play golf or polo while we play soccer on TV ? Some could argue persuasively that the mzungus were already affluent by the time they settled in Kenya - going by their titles and educational backgrounds , with a number having gone to Eton and Oxbridge . Titles ranged from lords to generals .

@@62057234 <p> Deputy President William Ruto wants a State agency to abandon its quest to recover the land on which Weston Hotel stands , and instead accept payment for the land . Ruto argues that the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority ( KCAA ) should conclude negotiations for compensation as ordered by the National Land Commission ( NLC ) instead of pursuing a fresh case seeking to repossess the land . The new filing by Weston Limited , which was done a few days to the July 29 hearing date , is a departure from the hotel 's initial defence that it was the legitimate owner of the property , and that a directive to compensate the government amounted to ' unjust enrichment ' of the State agency . <p> Weston Ltd had argued that NLC 's order issued on January 21 , last year , that it should pay for the land was unfair because it bought the contested plot legally and should not be compelled to pay for the same a second time . With this latest change of tack , the company will be seeking to conclude negotiations that will determine how much it will pay KCAA for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuation of the land was to be done to estimate how much Ruto was to pay for NLC to regularise the title to Weston Ltd . Citing NLC 's orders , Weston , through lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi , now wants the court to strike out the case " because KCAA has not exhausted the remedies offered by the commission . " Weston Ltd argues that KCAA 's case is frivolous based on the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies . The principle states that a person challenging a decision must first pursue the available solutions offered to him or her before seeking a review or setting them aside . <p> In the latest filings , the lawyer says the land team 's orders were couched in mandatory terms that the aggrieved party was to follow " to the tail end . " The company also accuses KCAA of abusing the court process by allegedly filing multiple claims over the property in different forums . " While appreciative of the substance of the subject matter herein and in cognisance of the adjudication process that had already been undertaken by the first respondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second respondent ( Weston Hotel ) prays for stay and or dismissal of the petition herein , " the application filed on June 16 reads . It adds : " The Constitution and the relevant statutes set out a detailed procedure and process for seeking redress , and the petitioner has already pursued that process and procedure half-way . It is in contention of the second respondent that the procedure and process are mandatory , and this honourable court is lawfully obliged to order the petitioner to finalise and or pursue that process and procedure to the end . " Ahmednasir says the dispute had already been settled by the commission , hence the only avenue for the aviation agency to approach the court is through an appeal and not filing a fresh suit . <p> " The determination of the dispute between the petitioner and the second respondent ( Weston ) had already been made by a commission of competent jurisdiction . This , coupled with the express and mandatory provision of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 , and the NLC Act that expressly provide for a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this court . The same can not be ignored or wished away by the petitioner herein and the court , " read the court papers . Weston 's new application is supported by Priority Limited , a firm that is alleged to have been the initial owner of the contested land . The company , through lawyer Katwa Kigen , argues that KCAA prosecuted a case against Weston before the NLC and obtained a valid judgment , hence it would not be able to initiate another case against the same parties . " The petitioner 's claim is res judicata in toto in the face of lack of an appeal from the NLC 's adjudication and decision of the selfsame dispute . The petitioner 's petition is an abuse of the court process , including the proceedings available at the NLC , " reads Priority 's reply filed on July 1 . But KCAA says it had asked for restitution in its complaint before the NLC and not compensation as the commission had ordered . KCAA lawyers Stephen Ligunya and Otiende Amollo however say the agency 's only desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first respondent 's ( NLC ) determination further is irrational and irregular , as no party pleaded for compensation . The final order also fails to account for the fixtures on the land , making the order ambiguous and absurd and incapable of implementation . " Similarly , the determination is irrational because it deliberately turned a blind eye to the corrupt dealings of the second ( Weston Hotel ) , third ( Priority Limited ) and fourth ( Monene Investments Limited ) respondents instead of upholding the petitioner 's legitimate expectation to enforcement of its property rights , thereby setting a bad precedent that wrongfully elevates land grabbing by private entities beyond legal reproach , " argues KCAA . KCAA Director General Gilbert Kibe has stated that Weston Hotel was built on public land intended for use by the Directorate of Civil Aviation ( DCA ) to ensure air navigation control and safety . Mr Kibe claimed the DCA actively occupied and utilised the land by installing sensitive air navigation equipment and storage of spare parts . It also had advanced plans to build its headquarters to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priority and Monene were registered as the land 's owners through illegality , fraud and corruption . The court heard that the firms forcibly evicted the DCA and its employees from the land , removed costly air navigation equipment and spares and dumped them at sites in Industrial Area and Athi River , thereby causing their degradation from harsh exposure to the elements . " In furtherance to the fraud , Weston , despite full knowledge of the KCAA 's lawful claim , procured registration of the transfer in its favour and began rapid construction of the current development without bothering to seek or obtain development approvals from relevant State regulatory agencies , including KCAA , " said Kibe . He also accused the NLC of " attempting to sanitise the illegality KCAA suffered by ordering that it must accept compensation . " The court heard that the NLC ignored its own finding that the parcel was adversely mentioned in the 2004 Ndung'u Report . The report specifically identified KCAA 's unchallenged ownership of the land . " Any due diligence conducted by a bona fide party in 2007 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land belonged to the petitioner . Therefore , Weston was in fact aware , or by reasonable diligence would have discovered that KCAA owned the land . It can not , therefore , allege that its transaction was bonafide , " Kibe said . It was also claimed that the NLC ignored clear evidence that Weston Ltd recklessly continued with the purchase and rushed construction without obtaining KCAA approval as required by Regulation 65 of the Civil Aviation ( Aerodromes ) Regulations . Weston Ltd , the court heard , further failed to comply with a notice to stop construction in a bid to secure air navigation safety . Documents attached to the main case reveal that KCAA had knocked on doors at , among other places , the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ( EACC ) , filed a complaint before the Paul Ndung'u inquiry in 2004 on grabbed land , and sought help from the police . On July 3 , 2001 former Commissioner of Lands Sammy Mwaita allocated KCAA plots LR Nos. 9187 and 9188 through letter reference No. 51776/XVI , with the agency paying Sh3,530 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of a deed plan to enable us locate the site for further necessary action , " BSK Muli wrote to Mr Mwaita on behalf of KCAA MD Chris Kuto on August 6 , 2001 . True position On August 22 , 2001 , Transport PS Francis Muthaura wrote to his Lands colleague Nehemiah Ng'eno asking him to safeguard the plot . " The true position is that this plot , which is strategically located just outside Wilson Airport , is not vacant because it has buildings which provide central storage facilities for sensitive air navigation . To safeguard ownership of this government plot , which seems to attract attention of property developers , I request your office to issue a title deed to the DCA , " Mr Muthaura said .

@@62057235 <p> Chief of the Defence Forces , General Robert Kibochi when he visited KDF soldiers in Somalia on June 6 , 2020 . He met soldiers stationed in Afmadhow , Billis Qooqani , Tabda and Hoosingo . Courtesy , Standard The appointment of a female officer as the Foreign Liaison Officer of the Combined Joint Task Force -- Horn of Africa comes at a very important time . News reports over the past few months have indicated that gender-based violence is increasing due to people staying at home longer than usual . Unfortunately , some men are venting their frustration over the Covid-19-induced situation on the women and girls in their lives . At the same time , with schools closed , girls are not receiving an education and are statistically less likely to return to school once they reopen . This is for a number of reasons , including an uptick in teenage pregnancies due to more time spent at home . In Machakos County , for instance , there are unconfirmed reports of hundreds of teen pregnancies since March . <p> More women than men also work in the informal sector , which means that more women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically vulnerable . It is important therefore that girls have positive female role models to look up to as they get through this difficult time . The Kenya Air Force Lt Col Rodah Mwasigwa is the first female KDF officer to hold the position of Foreign Liaison Officer of the Combined Joint Task Force -- Horn of Africa . Mwasigwa 's responsibilities will include facilitating accurate communication between the task force and the KDF , organising key leadership engagements and facilitating expert exchanges and participation in exercises among military forces across East Africa . In addition , the Lt Col will liaise between KDF headquarters and the African Union Mission to Somalia ( AMISOM ) . This includes liaising between fellow African militaries as well as coalition partners from North America and Europe . Fulfilling all of these roles will be no easy task , but Mwasigwa is certain she is the right woman for the job . She was quoted an in-house KDF magazine saying : " In line with the KDF gender policy of 2017 , which provided a comprehensive overall framework to guide gender-mainstreaming , KDF has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criteria " . <p> There is no doubt that she meets the criteria . During the terrorist attack on Camp Simba at Manda Bay in January , she was part of a joint operation command centre that shared information vital to the counter-attack operation . Playing this key role during a volatile situation shows that Mwasigwa is ready for the challenge , whether in peace time or during more volatile periods . Her appointment came shortly after that of Zipporah Kioko as the new KDF spokesperson -- the first female officer to hold the position . The appointments are also aligned in general with President Uhuru Kenyatta 's forward-thinking gender policies . Ever since Kenyatta became president , Kenya has been a step ahead of the rest in terms of advancing the position of women , especially in leadership roles . While stereotypical gender roles and the oppression of women is still culturally pervasive in many countries on our continent , and indeed around the world , the ground is shifting in Kenya . There is the realisation that a country can not rise if half of its population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's continued commitment to ending maternal deaths , female genital mutilation , improving educational opportunities available to girls , and increasing the participation of women in leadership is all part of building an economically developed , progressive-thinking nation . Increasing the participation of women in leadership positions in the military is especially important to this mission because the military is traditionally perhaps the most male-dominated space . The more we shatter limitations based on gender as a country , the closer we get to our ultimate goal : Reaching the status of middle income country . There is no space for a traditionally patriarchal country in the cluster of economically prosperous nations . While we still have not had a female president , the past several years have seen more women entering politics and running companies . These are the kinds of role models that our young girls need to be seeing on a regular basis . And as forward-thinking adults , these are the kinds of women we should be supporting and putting all our trust in .

@@62057238 <p> One sunny Sunday sometimes in 2008 , an announcement was made at the Christ is The Answer Ministry ( Citam ) , Valley Road branch ( above ) , that sounded like a good deal . A land-buying company had entered into an agreement with the church sacco to partner in acquiring land with the intention to help members become home owners . Membership into the land-buying company was through membership in the sacco . At the time , it looked rather simple and like a match made in heaven . The land-buying company , known as La Nyavu Gardens , was led by none other than Citam 's then presiding Bishop Boniface Adoyo and two other partners - Haron Nyakundi and Joyce Gikunda . These three were also officials in the church sacco . The relationship between La Nyavu Gardens and La Nyavu Sacco was not just skin deep . A memorandum of understanding between the company and the sacco details the level of their entanglement . " The purpose of this MoU is to establish a working arrangement between La Nyavu Gardens Ltd and La Nyavu Sacco Ltd to promote a joint participation in investment projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reads in part . Between 2008 and 2014 , almost all the 431 plots on a 100-acre piece of land that was being sold to church members by La Nyavu Gardens were bought , with the sacco almost playing the role of broker . But there were signs of cracks and the buyers were unsettled . Their land ownership journey seemed to be full of potholes that looked like they could swallow their home ownership dreams . <p> During the entire month of December 2009 , La Nyavu Gardens and the promise of home ownership became a common fixture during church announcements not just at Citam Valley Road , but in many other sister churches . Open days were held in the churches ' many compounds around the capital . And although La Nyavu Gardens had been registered as a separate entity , there was dedicated effort to paint it as being part of the church . Documents and correspondence in our possession show that joining was pretty simple . First , those interested were required to become members of La Nyavu Sacco Ltd for a joining fee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application for allotment of the plots . The application form was sold for Sh2,000 to aspiring home owners . The tentative land-selling price for the first buyers averaged Sh400,000 . The prices , according to the documents that include sale agreements , were inclusive of government taxes , consultancy services , administrative charges as well as infrastructural costs . Like many other similar initiatives , it was based on a first-come-first-serve basis . There were other costs , too . For example , Sh100,000 for provision of infrastructure and Sh35,000 as consultancy fees . The customers were also to foot the cost of transfer of lease at Sh16,840 . In 2010 , the City Council of Nairobi gave its approval for the subdivision of the 100-acre piece of land into individual units for development . The development was to be known as Mwiki Court . The more than 400 plots on the piece of land sold out quickly . A key enticement for many who purchased these parcels of land was the proposed conflict resolution mechanism . " Any disputes arising from this transaction shall be resolved amicably by mediation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other senior pastor from any Citam assembly appointed by the presiding bishop in writing , " read a clause in the sale agreement . Things fall apart But in the years that have followed the initial introduction of the project to the flock , disenchantment runs deep among the investors . Particularly after Citam publicly distanced itself from the project . One of the key complaints by the owners over the years has been the incomplete registration process of their plots . " The welfare committee is yet to receive any feedback regarding the same . The purchasers , having complied with the terms of the agreement for sale , are entitled to their duly registered titles . On behalf of these purchasers , we demand to know what has become of the titles to their parcels of land , " reads a letter written on May 29 , 2020 by Mwiki Court officials to La Nyavu Gardens . The residents also decry the lack of infrastructural development that was promised by the developer when they signed the sale agreements . An approval from the defunct city council for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have murram access roads , a comprehensive surface water drainage scheme as well as a perimeter wall . Most of these are invisible on site , although there is a partially completed perimeter wall . Man of conviction Nyakundi speaks with the conviction of a man firmly rooted in his beliefs . His office in Nairobi 's Upper Hill area is littered with files . Nyakundi is not only a co-director in La Nyavu Gardens , but is also the Mwiki Court project manager . " The project started in 2010 and , yes , it was mooted at NPC Valley Road , " he says . In fact , investigations show that as far back as 2004 , the church sacco was already exploring ideas on how it could get into the real estate business . A 2016 internal audit by the church following an inspection report by the Ministry of Cooperatives into the relationship between La Nyavu Gardens , the sacco and Citam shows just how entangled the three entities were . The addition of a fourth ingredient - the investors - into the relationship could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and the church sacco went by the same name - La Nyavu . Then there was the little matter of office holders . The audit lists the sacco officials in 2004 as Harun Nyamboki who served as the chair , Nyakundi who served as the vice chair , and Gikunda and John Ng'ang'a , who both served as treasurer . " In November 2007 , some sacco leaders incorporated La Nyavu Gardens to act as the sacco 's investment arm , " the audit reads . Nyakundi , Gikunda , and Adoyo became co-directors of La Nyavu Gardens Ltd . This blurred delineation of names , and roles were in later years to become a huge source of confrontation between the church , the sacco and the land owners . Although the company and sacco were legally different , there were overlapping elements in the running of the two entities . And this , Mwiki Court officials say , is why buyers believed from the word go that La Nyavu was part of the church . They now want the church to arbitrate in areas where they feel they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have never been part of Citam . We partnered with private people to form La Nyavu Gardens . " In 2010 , the Ministry of Cooperatives instituted an audit of the sacco . The results of the audit necessitated another internal audit by Citam whose findings , which were made public in 2016 , threw the land-buying and development company under the bus . " While the company was incorporated as a private company , it is apparent that the sacco leaders presented it as the sacco 's investment arm of Citam , as it was referred to in various minutes and documents . Operationally , the company was managed by Nyakundi , the sacco vice chairperson and the sacco accountants , " reads the Citam report on the dealings of La Nyavu Gardens and the sacco . Before the internal audit was made public , Citam had already distanced itself from La Nyavu Gardens through advertisements in the local dailies . Five-point disclaimer In a five-point disclaimer , Citam explicitly said that La Nyavu Gardens had never been the business arm of the church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did not represent Citam . Back in Mwiki , less than a dozen homes are in various stages of construction . Some have been completed and families have moved in . Nyakundi has an explanation for this . He ruffles through dozens of records in his files . " To date there are people who have not finished paying for their plots , " he says . " This resulted in cash flow issues with the project . " He insists that although there have been some delays , the company remains committed to finishing the project . He also says La Nyavu Gardens never promised the buyers individual titles to their land . " The agreements say we will provide a sub-leasing agreement . And we have done that . " Mwiki Court residents say these issues have been raised previously with La Nyavu Gardens . " The welfare committee and the previous oversight committee have both continuously attempted to engage , with meetings being called by you only for the purpose of issuing platitudes and unfulfilled promises , " a letter from the Mwiki Court officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull between the land buyers , the church and the land-buying company that is intriguing about this case . The history of ownership of this prime piece of land is also interesting . On April 24 , 1970 a letter was dispatched from the office of the Registrar of Titles to the Lands ministry . The purpose of the letter was to indicate the ownership of a prime piece of land on the outskirts of the city . " Know all men by these presents that in pursuance of a surrender as Number L.R 7206/13 the President of the Republic of Kenya hereby grants unto His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta of Post Office 530 Nairobi as natural guardian and trustee of Uhuru Muigai ( hereafter called the Grantee ) ALL that piece of land situated in the city of Nairobi in the Nairobi Area containing by measurement Forty decimal four seven ( 40.47 ) hectares of thereabouts ...

President Kenyatta held the land in trust of his son Uhuru Kenyatta until he passed away in August of 1978 , an event that transferred the management of his estate through a letter of administration to Mama Ngina Kenyatta and Uhuru 's elder brother Peter Muigai Kenyatta . Decades later , on what turned out to be a busy day at the Land Registry with regard to this particular property , the administration of the estate was to change hands several times ending in it being owned by a private company .

Fish aquariums seem like something you only see in a fancy restaurant or at a big aquarium that features marine life from all over the globe . <p> But , believe it or not , fish are excellent starter pets and studies have even been conducted that show that owning an aquarium can actually have health benefits for the owner . That 's right , owning an aquarium can be good for your health . The presence of a fish tank in the home and the owner spending time watching the fish swim throughout the day has a soothing effect on not only the mind but also the body ( which we will discuss further down in the post ) . <p> Still not convinced as why or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep reading ! <h> 10 Reasons Why Fish Make Good Pets <h> 1 ) Fish are low maintenance when compared to other pets <p> Fish are extremely low maintenance when compared to pets such as cats and dogs , hamsters , reptiles , etc . They are self-sufficient in the sense that as long as they have clean water , light during the right times , and food supply -- they are happy and content . Installing a secure water filtration system will help maintain the aquarium as well as the water is continuously filtered to remove impurities and contaminants.Cascade is a good choice ! <p> The most maintenance you will have to do with your fish is the cleaning of their aquarium on a scheduled basis . Once that is done , you are free to enjoy your day and your fish are free to do the same . <h> 2 ) Content while alone or as part of a community <p> When it comes to other types of pets , they can get lonely if they are the only ones in the home during the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes manifest itself intoanxiety issues which is never a good thing for the pet or the owners . Fish , however , are perfectly content being alone or certain species of fish are excellent community members . That means you could have multiple fish in your tank if you chose ! <h> 3 ) Fish aquariums do n't smell like most people think <p> People have a misconceived notion that fish aquariums and tanks must carry a stench that will travel through the air of the home . This is incorrect because only a dirty , unmaintained fish tank will have a stench and that 's usually accompanied by green , murky water which is caused by an algae and waste buildup . As long you clean your tank as per the instructions , then you wo n't have this problem ! <h> 4 ) Fish are great for teaching younger children responsibility <p> Having to feed the fish the same time every day , clean the tank on a schedule , and manually turning on/off the lighting system are excellent ways to teach a child responsibility for another living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their owners for everything and they will experience a sense of accomplishment when their fish are thriving and healthy ! <h> 5 ) Fish aquariums have mental health benefits <p> Owning a fish tank can have a positive impact on yourmental health . You will witness firsthand the determination of these little marine creatures and how they will get themselves from point A to point B , regardless of any obstacle . Watching your fish swim around the tank soothes the mind and relaxes the body , allowing for the escape of stress and tension . <h> 6 ) Fish have physical health benefits <p> Fish owners , especially those with aquariums , tend to have a lower blood pressure than others because of the soothing and relaxing feeling they experience while watching their fish swim around the tank . Studies have shown that those who own aquariums are also at a lower risk for dementia and heart disease for the same reason . <h> 7 ) Fish are not expensive to purchase or take care of <p> Fish tend to be on the lower end of the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unless you are planning to purchase exotic fish that are not typically found in your local pet store ) . Fish can be purchased in bundles and certain species are safe to live together in the same tank , so you are able to have an array of fish . Except for their food , water filters , and a slight jump in electricity costs ( lighting , etc. ) , they are pretty cheap to take care of ! <h> 8 ) Fish are quiet <p> If you live in an apartment building or townhouse , then owning a pet that has a vocal presence can be difficult . Fish do n't have any vocal presence and the only sound you will hear would be the slight murmur and gurgle that comes from the tank itself . You will never have to worry about neighbors complaining about your pets nor will they keep you up at night . <h> 9 ) Fish are trainable <p> Think fish must be boring and all they do is swim all day ? That is n't correct and you can actually train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Train your fish to follow your finger along the glass of their tank . You can also train them to come to the surface of the water for their food , train them to seek and find objects , and even train them to enjoy a slight stroking when they come to the surface of the water . <h> 10 ) They do n't require a large space <p> You wo n't have to worry about finding enough space inside and outside the house for your fish . Their world is contained within the glass walls of their tank and that is where they feel the safest . <h> Conclusion <p> Fish are the type of pet that is perfect for the first-time pet owner or the type of pet that will suit someone with a busy lifestyle . Granted , the interaction with pets such as cats and dogs is without a doubt livelier ; but this constant need for interaction can be a damper to some people who love to travel or have to travel for work and will spend large chunks of time away from home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons outlined above . <p> Because does n't the thought of unwinding in front of your aquarium in the evening after a long day at the office , with only the lighting system being the only source of light in the room , a glass of your favorite relaxing beverage in your hand while watching the shimmering flashes of watery light and vivid color of the fish sound appealing ?

Thousands of tonnes of sandalwood logs are illegally ferried out of the vast , rolling jungles of Samburu County , feeding an international trafficking network stretching from Samburu to Pokot , Baringo , Nakuru and other parts of the North Rift . Sandalwood is smuggled from Kenya to the international market involving Uganda , Malasyia , China , Australia , Dubai , Indonesia and Sri Lanka , with India dominating the global sandalwood oil market . <p> Villagers in areas where the tree grows sell one kilogramme of sandalwood for a pittance -- Sh100 to Sh200 -- while the traders who smuggle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sh150,000 on the international market , minting millions of shillings . <p> " Most of the locals are involved in the preparation and sale of sandalwood . Sometimes dealers promise to pay once they manage to evade police dragnets all the way to the market . Sometimes we are not sure of our payments , " Mr Leleshipai told the Nation . <p> With such huge sums at play , several people are involved in the trade to ensure the sandalwood arrives at the markets . <p> Local youths are hired as woodcutters , transporters or middlemen . <p> PREPARING WOOD <p> For instance , when the Nation team visited Ndume Forest , it came face to face with a group of youth , in a secluded place , deep inside the forest , preparing sandalwood for sale . <p> We were welcomed by heaps of sandalwood ready for the market and loads of raw ones too . <p> Yet the woodcutters and transporters hired to prepare the sandalwood for the market remain impoverished , even as their millionaire masters smile all the way to the bank , after bribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood is expensive on the international market , but we have no option but to accept the little payment because we can not manoeuvre and make it to the market by ourselves , " said a local hired to chop the precious wood in Ndume . <p> Investigations reveal that the smuggling syndicate runs deep into government agencies , including those meant to fight the illegal trade . <p> Some of those already being investigated in connection with the illegal trade , documents seen by the Nation show , include Ms Agnes Nasieku , a business woman based in Loitoktok , who is said to have at least Sh100 million in one local bank account . <p> Others are a Mr David Mucheru , based in Nakuru , and Ms Emma Wanjiku , alias Mama Jimmy .

KFS does no issue permits to harvest sandalwood , " he said in an interview at his office in Maralal . <p> " We only have 15 forest rangers manning government forests in the entire county and only one vehicle serving four forest stations , making mobility difficult . <p> " Nevertheless , we are working with other government security agencies to fight the illegal harvesting of sandalwood in the region , " he said . <p> We have been arresting people , but we lose cases in court . " <p> The forest cover manned by KFS includes the Matthews ( or Mathews ) Range , South Horr forest station , and the Ndotto , Rirugi and Mount Nyiro forest reserves . <p> Mr Ochieng revealed that Samburu East is the most affected in the harvesting and smuggling of sandalwood . <p> The KFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of Public Prosecutions , saying they had failed in the fight against the business . <p> " We have been arresting people , but we lose cases in court .

" The process to survey salaries and remunerations of public servants , has just begun and will run for the next 10 months , " said Lynn Mengich , chairperson SRC . According to Mengich , the review of salaries will be determined by the evaluation of the work done by the officers . " We might not be able to know how much anyone will be getting in terms of a pay-cut or a pay rise , until then , " she added . <p> The event comes , as the country continues to grapple with a hefty wage bill that takes a big chunk of the national budget .

The first cycle ran for the financial year 2013/14 -- 2017/18 , the second was for the financial year 2017/18 -- 2021/22 , while the third , and current cycle , will run for the financial year 2021/22 -- 2024/25 . According to the SRC boss , the remuneration cycle shall be anchored on the principles of pay determination as set out in Article 230(4) of the Constitution of Kenya , 2010 , and the SRC Act , 2011 . <p> These constitutional principles are ; the need to ensure that total public sector compensation is fiscally sustainable , the need to ensure that the public service can attract and retain the skills required to execute their respective functions , the need to recognize performance and productivity , the need to ensure transparency and fairness , and equal pay to persons performing work of equal value . <p> The commission , says it addresses these principles , noting that the remuneration cycle shall be informed by job evaluation , salary survey , streamlining the management of allowances , and the public sector wage bill in general . The SRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure equal pay for work of equal value . The Commission uses job evaluation as the basis for determining the remuneration of public servants in an objective , transparent , and equitable manner . Job evaluation seeks to achieve internal equity when it compares jobs within the same organization , and external equity when jobs are compared with those of other public sector organizations . The results of job evaluation , therefore , determine the relative worth of jobs in the public sector and inform the assignment of rationalized and equitable job grading and pay structures . Salary Survey Section 11(d) of the SRC Act , 2011 , mandates the Commission to conduct comparative surveys on labor market trends in remuneration to determine the monetary worth of the jobs in the public sector . <p> " The Commission will conduct three distinct salary surveys namely ; salary survey of all public sector institutions ; salary survey to benchmark jobs in selected private sector institutions ; and international survey of anchor State Offices ' jobs , " said Mengich . " The salary surveys will provide information on current compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary structures that enable the public sector to attract and retain requisite skills for delivery of its mandates , " she explains . SRC reports that , while the current public sector wage bill has shown a positive trend as a percentage of ordinary revenue and as a ratio to Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , there is room for improvement . According to SRC , the wage bill , as a percentage of revenue , dropped from 57.33 per cent in 2013/2014 to 48.1 per cent in 2018/19 , while the percentage of the wage bill to GDP dropped from 10.43 per cent in 2013/2014 to 7.9 per cent in financial year 2018/2019 . The positive trend is large as a result of both revenue growth and initiatives by SRC , in collaboration with key stakeholders and players in government .

Never more <p> Be careful about this . First , one should not over borrow . There should be a proper assessment of what the business actually needs , not what the person needs . This is usually based on what the business can actually generate . This will determine how the payments can be made . Ignore this and you will struggle to pay it back . <p> Make your product accessible <p> I joined KWFT when it had zero customers . The first thing we had to do was make it relevant to women .

In a similar manner , you can not grow the customer base if your product is not accessible to those you intend to serve . You must realise that money follows a product . An accessible product at the right price will draw in customers . <p> How to increase chances of funding <p> For a lender to give you money , you must prove you are bankable . For example , if you have a culture of depositing small amounts on a regular basis and withdrawing something for business purposes , you are showing the bank that you have good financial management skills . This also applies if you want to join a group that lends money to members . <p> Get a faltering business out of trouble <p> Anyone who looked at KWFT in the initial stages could have recommended its closure . There was little going on then . But there was nothing wrong with the business model , just the wrong strategy . If your business is faltering , step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of simple things that just require personal commitment . For example , do you open your business on time , when your customers are up and about ? Are you for example reinvesting in the business ? For example , when I go to the market , I will meet women who want to give me a bunch of bananas , another wants to give me a bag of potatoes , all for free . Those are nice gestures but it is also a lack of business manners and simple business discipline . What they are giving out for free is their profit for the day . How much more of their products are they giving out for free ? In business , you must account for everything on your table . Ask yourself whether you are doing things that make your business succeed . <p> Time to quit ? <p> Ideally , a person should not quit at the slightest hint of trouble .

We have in the past connected someone with a thriving startup with another person looking to start a startup . However , do not start the business like your neighbour 's . For example , one woman goes to Dubai to buy clothes for resale in Kenya and you invest your savings on the same model without any understanding as to why they did it . Do not sell tomatoes just because everyone is selling them . Look for real needs that ought to be addressed by your business . Could you perhaps do value add to the potatoes , perhaps by making crisps ?

In the process , she fills a real need that in turn brings her some income . Have more than the need to make money in your vision and you will be fine . <p> Ideas attract capital <p> One of the common complaints among young people aspiring to do business is lack of business mentoring . However , I encourage them to join networks and learn to be innovative . Banks fund ideas and when young people innovate , they can get bargaining power .

But this time around , any movement towards a transition of the East Wing and the Executive Residence has not begun . <p> Instead , another source with knowledge of Melania Trump 's daily schedule said there is very little in the way of change taking place at all , and most of the focus of the first lady 's office remains on day-to-day meetings and upcoming holiday planning . <p> " It 's my understanding that it 's business as usual in the East Wing , " said the source . The source said that even if Melania Trump wanted to begin the process of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump 's baseless refusal to accept Joe Biden 's victory . <p> " I 'm not sure it 's fair for anyone to expect them to start transitioning when the President has not yet conceded , " the source said . <p> Anita McBride , who served as Laura Bush 's chief of staff , who noted that Melania Trump has occasionally acted or expressed opinions different than her husband , said : " This moment is more complicated . Her reaching out before he has conceded could be seen as going completely against what the President and the administration are doing . " <p> The source familiar with Melania Trump 's thinking says when the time does come to acquiesce , the first lady will comply . <p> " If the President concedes , I 'm sure the East Wing will be gracious and professional to the incoming administration , that 's just how they work , " the source said . <p> For every day that passes without transitioning , however , the job of readying the White House for a new first family , and moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This transition is going to be a daunting task , even though Dr. Biden is familiar with the White House and extremely capable , " said Capricia Penavic Marshall , who served as special assistant to Hillary Clinton when she was first lady , and then as the Clinton 's White House social secretary , and is the author of " Protocol : The Power of Diplomacy . " <p> Marshall was with the Clinton administration for its entirety and recalls clearly the importance of adhering to a tight schedule for the days between election and inauguration . <p> " By now there would have been at least a conveyance of notes between the current East Wing and the first lady-elect 's team , to talk about dates and schedules and what needs begin to take place , " she said .

" <p> Among other things in a tight laundry list of to-do 's , there is the planning for organizational changes , moving trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inauguration Day is a to-the-minute choreographed event , displacing one family and setting up the next , down to stocking the refrigerators and unpacking a first lady 's clothes into her dressing room . <p> McBride was part of the Bush team who were forced to wait until the vote between Bush and Democrat Al Gore was settled by the Supreme Court . <p> " We could only begin the transition to the White House after December 13 , " she said . " It worked . It was frenetic , but it worked . " First ladies passing the torch <p> For first ladies , the awkwardness of surrendering their ( temporary ) home and staff they have come to know and rely on to a new President and first lady is n't always easy . In particular , there was a well-known frostiness between Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan , two women who were fiercely loyal to their husbands . The transition for Carter and Reagan was not a pleasant one . <p> " Rosalynn grew even angrier when rumors circulated that Nancy Reagan wanted the Carters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Blair House , across the street from the White House , so that she could begin redecorating the family 's private quarters , " Kate Andersen Brower wrote in her book , " First Women : The Grace and Power of America 's Modern First Ladies .

' She just said she did not make those statements . ' " <p> Barbara Bush , too , was not happy to be moving out after one-term , yet she was gracious and insightful when Hillary Clinton came to the White House after the election for the traditional tea . <p> " Mrs. Bush took Mrs. Clinton up into the residence and through her dressing room to show her the window she would look through , across the Rose Garden , to see into the Oval Office , " said McBride , recalling the congeniality of the visit .

Obama added : " My chief of staff continues to talk to Laura 's former chief of staff on a very regular basis and it 's that kind of sharing that prevents us from re-creating the wheel , allows us to build on the things that are already working so that the country gains as we transition from one party to the next .

" <p> Tea for two <p> The traditional welcoming of the first lady-elect to the White House holds a different meaning than for the President and President-elect . For a first lady , though archaic , part of her role is to explain the workings of the White House as a home for a family . <p> It 's for her to instill advice about living there with children , as Laura Bush and her daughters did for Obama and her daughters , showing them how to wave from the Truman Balcony or slide down the sloped hallway near the private movie theater . <p> The image of Melania Trump and Jill Biden enjoying tea this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it more scrutiny , given the weeks of bitterness . <p> " It could be awkward , but that moment will bring a bit of a collective sigh of relief to everyone else , " McBride said . " That visual of the two custodians of the White House , of the home ... will resonate . That image does help to chip away at some of the acrimony of the politics . " <p> Even in the most divided races America has seen between presidents , there has until now , remained at least a thread of country over party , and a willingness from one side to help the other find its footing . <p> " That 's what is so beautiful for our country . That moment on Inauguration where one family says to the next , ' Welcome to your home , ' " Marshall said , recalling one of her favorite memories of that day , as the Bushes arrived to the White House to ride with the departing Clinton 's to the United States Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony . <p> " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their overcoats , and Clinton reached over and straightened Bush 's coat on his shoulder and said to him , ' Come on , let 's do this .

@@62503236 <h> Why we need to encourage the use of securitization financing . <p> By September 8th 2009 at 00:00:00 GMT +0300 <p> By Odhiambo Ocholla <p> The enactment of Capital markets ( Asset backed Securities ) Regulations 2007 , governing securitization transactions was lauded as long overdue then , against a back drop of an increasingly sophisticated capital market and the need to deepen our capital markets . <p> But to date there is no single transaction that has been structured under the securitization regulation . <p> The Asset backed securities regulations defines Securitization transaction as " means an arrangement which involves the transfer of assets or risk to a special purpose vehicle where such transfer is funded by the issuance of securities to investors and payments to investors in respect of such debt securities are principally derived , directly or indirectly , from the cash flows of the transferred assets " . <p> Simply stated , a securitization is the term used to describe the process of issuing securities backed by the cash flows from a pool of underlying assets . <p> Securitization is a fairly recent financial innovation . The first securitised transactions occurred in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgages for resale as tradable securities by lenders . Since then , securitised markets have grown in sophistication to cover a wide range of assets . <p> Securitisation looked a beautiful idea , but since CMA introduced regulations governing the issuance of asset backed securities it was more talked about than practiced today . I think the Government should support this type of transaction by using securitisation to further its developmental objective . <h> Subscribe to Our Newsletter <p> Subscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest developments and special offers ! <p> For example the Government can arrange to issue to investors some collateralised loan obligations , securitising loans extended by Youth Enterprise Development Fund or Women Enterprise Development Fund to small and midsize enterprises . <p> This will assist small businesses that are starved for cash . Under this arrangement and specially-designed scheme , small firms get access to capital , borrowing up to a certain limit without putting up collateral . <p> The loans are guaranteed by the Government and the loans are thereafter pooled and securitised . Then a bond can be issued against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted at retail investors . <p> Need for Securitisation <p> It would be of interest by financial institutions to use securitisation as a mechanism to transfer risk , and thereby manage their balance sheets more efficiently . <p> In addition , corporates should look at securitization as a new source of financing . When the asset backed regulation was enacted a few years ago , the market expected to see increased growth in the use of securitisation funds to securitize corporate loans as well as the expansion of the securitization of consumer loans , future flows , and trade receivables . <p> The securitisation of trade receivables may prove an attractive source of funding for small and midsized enterprises ( SMEs ) . The key problems facing SMEs seeking debt financing are lack of a credit history and lack of sufficient collateral . The thirdly , ability to service debts . <p> To address this problem , companies can use securitization financing . The innovative structure allows many borrowers to obtain financing at much lower interest rates , allow issuers to lengthen the maturities of their debt , improve risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of investors . <p> Several constraints , however , have prevented the realization of this potential . A major constraint on the growth of future flow transactions is the lack of good collateral . Securitisation of future flow receivables may be the only way to begin accessing our capital markets . Future flow deals entail additional incentives to firms going securitisation route . <p> It 's important to note that despite the numerous benefits offered by the securitization transaction and a robust regulation under the Capital market ( Asset backed securities ) Regulation 2007 , companies have not yet seized the opportunity . <p> The need to develop securitizations market should not be overstated as it would become a valuable source of financing for many companies . For securitisation to work , of course , investors must demand the securities . 
@@62510234 <h> Why Kenya has plenty of ' useless ' varsity degrees <p> Dedan University graduands at a past graduation ceremony . File , Standard <p> The Commission for University Education ( CUE ) produced a very well done document titled ' University Statistics 2016/2017 ' . Depending on what you want out of the document , one gets many insights on the performance of universities , student career choices and specialisation , staffing in both public and private universities , and major challenges and opportunities for future academic development . <p> In addition to my interest in higher education policy , I read this document alongside available data on the Internet on the so-called ' useless ' degrees with a view to guiding students searching for ' useful degrees ' . <p> According to the document , " a general concern in the university sector in Kenya is the imbalance between humanities , arts and social sciences , on the one hand , and science , technology , engineering and mathematics on the other " . As a result , " the consequent shortage of needed knowledge and skills in areas such as manufacturing , housing , health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICT ) is obvious and can not be gainsaid . " The document adds : " Despite the fact that the country has in the last five years invested heavily in key sectors such as energy and infrastructure , university programmes and curricula stand faulted for not addressing the main sectors and pillars of national development . " <p> For my mentorship task , it has been hard for me to pick out the useless degrees that students should avoid , or the useful ones that they should embrace . Statistics , however , show that most students go for the humanities , arts and social sciences . Many reasons account for this . Top on the mind of any young Kenyan is the question : " Will I get a job with this degree ? " Well , much younger students talk about ' my passion ' , which they later realise does not add much value . <h> Read More <p> Kisii University students celebrate during their graduation ceremony . Sammy Omingo , Standard <p> Most students who use this as the main criterion to choose a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just passion , however relevant this is to personal potential .

Sadly , right from primary to secondary schools , natural sciences are considerably poorly taught leading to low uptake of STEM programmes . <p> Looking at the other end -- the job market -- there is a great disconnect between the industry and academic output . Graduates are many and ill-prepared for the few jobs available . There is a mismatch between available degrees and available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . This means given the right conditions , the redundant degrees could be very useful . <p> So my indicative ( rather than scientific ) comparative analysis between useless degrees in most developed countries and Kenya shows that unless a student is really talented , taking engineering , mathematics and agriculture for any purpose other than teaching will be unproductive in the job market . We are just not prepared to be locally and globally competitive by using knowledge in these fields . <p> Performing arts <p> Taking degree programmes in philosophy , literature , languages or performing arts is great . No doubt such degrees help a society to reflect on itself and generate systems of governance that improve the quality of life . However , the bad news is that these are redundant degrees whose market need is negligible .
