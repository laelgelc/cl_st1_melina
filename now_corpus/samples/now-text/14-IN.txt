Whether it 's the consumerization of IT that has driven mobility policies and BYOD adoption or the Indian government committing to a Digital India vision ; at their very core is the user . Infact a very intersting shift has begun to happen , where the user who was earlier considered at the endof the IT food chain ( end- user ) is now playing the most pivotal role while the rest of IT needs to be designed to meet his/her needs . Hence the emerging world is now shifting from the " end- user " paradigm to a " user-first " one ! <p> From an enterprise perspective , the mobility-transformed business means being able to move projects forward , close deals , serve customers and collaborate with colleagues and partners whenever you need to , wherever you may be , without having to worry about the technical details . We are now moving into an era of hybrid solutions spanning networking mobility and virtualization . Cloud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth of centrally coordinated applications that can be delivered to any device . This is enabling synchronized content across multiple devices and the ability to address application portability across these devices . Why ? For the user 's productivity and convenience . <p> Representational Image <p> Another exciting proposition will be the Digital India project , one of the key trailblazing announcements of the new government . A step that promises several new possibilities for India , this project is a testament to how technology can be a key enabler in the economic development and outlook for a country . If implemented correctly , this project will create a new layer of engagement between the government , businesses and citizens . Why ? To facilitate access and provide transparency to the user ( citizen ) . <p> All things considered , 2014 was the year of the user -- the year where they set the pace for the future of enterprise mobility and made demands of their technology infrastructure that some very critical innovations will address in 2015 . These include : <p> User-centric computing will lead : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are realizing the need to push past outdated models of computing that are solely focused on the data center . Moreover , since users are n't tied to one location , neither should their data . " Computing everywhere " is becoming the norm , and users are expecting any-time , anywhere and secure access to their data . Enterprises will focus on adapting and building their computing environments around the needs of today 's mobile workforce -- the kind of environment that does n't depend on the data center but considers all aspects of computing . In fact 2014 already saw companies investing in ways to innovate around the user-experience . Everything from intrapreneurship to accelerator programs have been kicked off and I believe that many of these will come to fruition in 2015 . <p> Apps will be designed to be secure : The increase in data we 've seen from mobile computing has led to some very high-profile threats over the last year .

Organizations will also choose apps that include policies for adaptive access controls to combat potential threats and security breaches . <p> Humanizing of computing : 2015 will also be about the " humanizing of computing . " This means software must have a customer-centric design in order to drive innovation by understanding customer needs . Companies will also focus on the design ( User interface etc. ) from the perspective of the customer , not just in terms of delivering features and capabilities . By uncovering this new way of evaluating business objectives based on customer-driven thinking , both the business and the individual become more successful <p> Work-life device balance : 2015 will be the year BYOD gains further momentum .

@@2212238 creating such a huge affair out of Panesar inviting a lady to his room ? <p> Monty Panesar was once again in the headlines for the wrong reasons . Abhishek Mukherjee tries to explain why the media has been unusually harsh on him . <p> Monty Panesar has made the news again , this time for a reason that could not exactly be classified as renal . Hours after their humiliating defeat in the recently concluded Ashes Test at MCG , Panesar had apparently chatted up an American backpacker ( who goes by the name of Alison ) using Tinder , a mobile dating app , and had invited her to his room . <p> Much has been made of the issue since , which leads us to the obvious question : Has Panesar really done anything wrong ? <p> India in the 1960s used to be a different place .

Only in India could it have happened , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Cricket . <p> Kripal Singh , who had been sharing room no 7 with Gupte at the Imperial Hotel in Delhi , had asked the hotel receptionist out for a drink .

If not , should we actually point fingers at poor Panesar ? He was n't , after all , trying to do something illegal or immoral : he was merely trying to find a companion who might have turned his woeful evening into a better one . <p> What we are trying to say is this : <p> Normal person after a bad day : Will you come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct , while <p> Cricketer after a bad day : Will you come up to my room ? <p> Other person : No . <p> is not . <p> How can a cricketer ask a woman out after he has lost a Test ?

The basis for annual quota should be the minimum quantity of gas needed by a family of 4 ( 2 adults and 2 children ) . This can be worked out scientifically , taking into account the calorific value of LPG and convert it to number of cylinders .

The electoral success of AAP based on the promise of eradication of corruption has changed the mainstream discourse <p> Developing countries have been suffering from corruption and draining of financial resources for a very long time . The scale of damage is not very well understood . Illicit capital flows from poor countries is one of the major impediments to reduction of poverty . Research organisation Global Financial Integrity ( GFI ) estimates that " assets now stashed in tax havens around the globe are estimated at $11.5 trillion and non-bank cash deposits outside the country of origin are rising . " Another striking piece of statistic , illicit capital flows are ten times the amount of foreign aid received by developing nations . <p> GFI states its mission very simply : " Our mission stems from the estimate that $1 trillion in funds which are illegally earned , transferred or utilised are spirited out of developing countries annually . Of this , $500 billion a year ends up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurting the poor . " Authored by Dev Kar and Brian LeBlanc , GFI published a report titled " Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries : 2002-2011 " in December 2013 . According to this report , illicit financial outflows from the developing world aggregated a staggering $946.7 billion in 2011 , with cumulative illicit financial outflows over the decade between 2002 and 2011 of $5.9 trillion . Crime , corruption , tax evasion and laundering of money trigger these vast capital outflows . <p> GFI has tried to estimate these illicit capital outflows from developing countries and proceeded to publish a league table of sorts for the period under study . The top five countries are : ( 1 ) China : $1.08 trillion , ( 2 ) Russia : $880.96 billion , ( 3 ) Mexico : $461.86 billion , ( 4 ) Malaysia : $370.38 billion , and ( 5 ) India : $343.93 billion . Every year , an estimated $1 trillion is being transferred from poor countries to tax havens and developed economies . The record of repatriation of such funds is also dismal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only $147 million had been repatriated back . <p> India 's underground economy is closely tied to illicit financial outflows . The total value of India 's illicit assets held abroad at present ( $462 billion ) accounts for approximately 72 per cent of India 's underground economy . This means that almost three quarters of the illicit assets comprising India 's underground economy -- which has been estimated to account for 50 per cent of the nation 's GDP ( approximately $640 billion at the end of 2008 ) -- ends up outside the country . <p> Kar , who has authored another report for GFI titled : " The Drivers and Dynamics of Illicit Financial Flows from India : 1948-2008 " comes to this startling conclusion : " From 1948 through 2008 , India lost a total of $213 billion in illicit financial flows ( or illegal capital flight ) . These illicit financial flows were generally the product of corruption , bribery and kickbacks , criminal activities , and efforts to shelter wealth from a country 's tax authorities .

In May 2012 , the Indian government published a white paper on black money that disclosed the country 's effort at addressing black money and guidelines to prevent black money in the future . However , concerted action is falling short of public expectations . <p> Indian banks have a shocking figure of Rs 2.6 trillion as gross non-performing assets . By the end of June 2013 , almost four per cent of the bank 's advances to industries were classified as NPAs . India 's Rs 80 trillion banking industry is under stress and it is estimated that 50 per cent of NPAs may have to be written off . <p> While some of the bad loans are due to economic downturn and failed business ventures , there is an element of systematic , collusive stealing involved where dishonest borrowers are siphoning the bank loans and abandoning the units sick . <p> Professor at IIM Calcutta Sitangshu Chakraborty had coined a term ' Hosu ' ( healthy owner , sick unit ) for this class of industrialists . Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan is fully aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough action . Finance minister P Chidambaram has directed all public sector banks to set up separate verticals for this purpose and has asked every bank to target the top 30 NPA accounts . <p> The spectacular electoral success of the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) in Delhi based on the promise of eradication of corruption has changed the mainstream discourse . It will no longer be possible to have one enquiry commission after another followed by no action . In the coming months , there would be demands for tougher laws , swift actions to eradicate corruption and illicit capital flows of funds outside India . <p> The reduction of corruption is directly related to growth with equity .

Compared to Rs 500-crore issue size of ECL Finance , IRFC and NHAI are expected to be more liquid in the secondary market , given the issue size of Rs 8,663 crore and Rs 3,698 crore , respectively .

@@2246233 <h> BETWEEN THE LINES In defence of the classics <p> A file photo of Mary Beard posing with her Most Excellent Order of the British Empire medal on 28 June , 2013 . Photo : John Stillwell/AFP <p> Mary Beard is not a stereotypical classicist . While she has three decades of experience teaching undergraduates at Cambridge University , it 's hard to imagine her becoming trapped in the fusty enclosures of academia . As well as teaching , Beard writes a column for The Times , called " A Don 's Life , " which touches on subjects as diverse as governance , beer making and escalators . She writes and presents programs on classics for television and has an active presence on social media . Since having been at the Jaipur Literature Festival in India , for two days , Beard has found time to write a blog about the event , in between appearing on a panel in defence of the classics , lecturing on the ruined Roman city of Pompeii , interviewing a fellow festival speaker on the subject of " spice " and being questioned by journalists . <p> In 2014 , Beard completes her 30th year teaching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 70s . In that time though , she does n't seem to have lost her zest for the subject or her irreverent sense of humour , most often directed at the pomposity of those who consider her subject to be the holy grail of academia , off limits to the undeserving . In fact , Beard considers that the opening up of classical texts and historical artefacts to as broad a range of people as possible to be almost a moral obligation . She is an egalitarian , and a feminist , with a good deal of common sense and an impatience with elitism . <p> Perhaps that 's because the " ordinary girl from Shrewsbury " was bitten by the ancient history bug by another act of generosity . Beard dates her interest in classics from a trip to the British Museum aged five , when a lenient guard opened up a case in the Egyptian department and brought out a piece of carbonized cake for her to look at . " He did n't have to do that , " she said to her audience , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to see that ? ' But he did n't and so here I am today . " <p> Being a female academic and classical historian puts Beard in a minority , but it 's a minority that she feels has sometimes given " tough women " an edge over their male colleagues . Beard is tough , on the verge of brash sometimes , but self-consciously so . " For some time I was the only woman on the faculty , " she says , of her early teaching days in the ' 80s . On television also , the kind of classics and history programmes that Beard presents have traditionally been the preserve of men . She made a humourous jibe during one of her talks at the literature festival directed at " boy scout " archaeologists who charge about the world looking for Odysseus ' grave or Julius Caesar 's head . " That 's what gets on telly , " Beard told the audience . " The same goes for gladiators , if anyone wants to get funding for an excavation , they do one simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the skeleton of a female gladiator ' . " <p> Beard did not agree to appear on television without a few doubts . " I was very dubious , the first time , I thought it would take up a lot of my time and it would change my life , that there would be a lot of stick . There was . I was finally convinced by Janice Hadlow ( who was then controller of BBC Four ) . She said to me , ' I want to get real academic women on TV and if you do n't help me , you ca n't moan about it anymore . ' I said that A.A. Gill ( the notoriously sardonic TV critic ) would hate it . And he did . He said I looked like the back end of a bus and I should be on The Undateables instead . " <p> Gill was n't the only one to pile on the criticism , Beard has experienced years of slurs on social media for not conforming to the stereotype of women TV presenters : super-young , uber-blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizable , all in black and dark grey , with a head of long , wild , silver hair , owlish purple glasses and a pair of sparkling gold pumps . She seems largely unconcerned about all that vitriol though , " I had a lot of support , and now I have a day job . But I 'd hate to depend on TV . It 's not how I define myself . " <p> Beard really defines herself as a teacher , and she does n't want to limit herself to the intellectual or social elites . One of the things she admires most about the Jaipur Literary Festival , she says , is the age range of its audience -- well below that she is used to in the UK . The large numbers of teens milling about is due to the fact that the festival is free , she says , and she thinks it 's wonderful that kids of any age group or background can have the opportunity to listen and learn . " I thought it would be a reneging of my responsibility as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge undergraduates , " she says , of her decision to broaden her interests to TV and blogging . " The perilous state of the classics is greatly exaggerated . It 's more resilient than it appears , but you have to make sure it 's not being ghettoized in fee paying schools , or only schools with an extraordinary ethos . " <p> The same applies to Sanskrit , she says . The previous day , Beard had debated this subject with two Indian academics : professor of Indian and South Asian Art , Vidhya Deheja and professor of Ancient Indian Art and Architecture , Naman Ahuja . In the panel , she talked about the connections between the Roman and Greek civilisations and ancient India , and the difficulties of keeping the conversation going with the past in both Europe and Asia . <p> " Britain is a long way from the roots of its civilization , Delhi is relatively close to its ancient heritage , Greece I suppose would be somewhere in between , " she said . " In Greece , they have politicized their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin acronym for Senatus Populusque Romanus , or The Senate and People of Rome ) is still written on the manhole covers . <p> But , she agreed , the Indian intimacy and proximity to its ancient past , in terms both of the relevance of Hindu mythology in the lives of many , and also the many architectural sites that exist , unrestored and mingled in with the modernity of its cities . " I find Delhi interesting , " she said . " I ca n't internalize the logic of it , its urban topography . I find it very confusing . " Reflecting on her lecture on Pompeii , in which she laughingly pointed out that we know almost nothing about the kind of society that lived within its walls , Beard admitted that perhaps we impose modern European ideas of what a city looks like onto those ruins , to our own detriment . <p> " Maybe the understanding of the logic of Roman towns has been built with an early modern view of what a city is , " she said . " Maybe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cute to say , ' If you want to know what Ancient Rome looked like , look at modern day Delhi , ' and probably not correct , but you 've helped yourself by experiencing a different version of what a city can be like and still function as well .

TOI took a tour inside the stadium on Tuesday and discovered that the stadium complex , on which Rs 1000 crore were spent just three years ago , is anything but world class . In fact , it is slowly decaying . <p> The interiors are wrecked . The roof appears to be collapsing on the first floor and the false ceiling has developed huge cracks in other areas .

If this reads like the plot of a typical masala movie , you are not wrong . Goli Soda IS a masala movie . But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists are n't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents , early teens to be specific . There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters , like Brick , Bugsy Malone and Young Sherlock Holmes , but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema . <p> However , unlike those films , Goli Soda stops with fitting only its young protagonists with adult , mass hero attitudes ; the other characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose a challenge because young boys taking on rowdies can take away the seriousness but Vijay Milton manages to evade this hazard to a large extent by keeping the plot fleet-footed so that we do n't dwell on the less believable scenes .

The four boys have grown into adolescents but their acting is as assured as in that film . <p> Pulli ( Kishore ) , Settu ( Sreeram ) , Sithappa ( Pandi ) and Murugesh ( Murugesh ) are orphans and thick friends , who make a living doing odd jobs at the Koyambedu market . The two adults who empathize with them are Manthiravadhi ( Imman Annachi , who has a riotously funny scene at the police station ) and Aachi ( Sujatha ) , who is a wholesale dealer at the place .

But trouble comes in the form of Naidu 's brother-in-law and right hand man Mayilu ( Vijaimurugan ) , who starts using the place for his illicit activities . Unable to contain their anger at the defiling of their workplace , the four friends take him on , which earns them the wrath of NKB as well , and he badly wants to put them in their place to save his image . <p> Despite the familiar storyline , Vijay Milton 's script is interesting and at times , unpredictable . The film does take some time to get going and the initial scenes , when the boys try to woo girls like your typical Tamil cinema heroes , are somewhat tedious . But the director shifts gears when the boys start getting responsible .

The dialogues ( by director Pandiraj ) are a plus , sharp and cheeky . And the manner in which the problems escalate for the protagonists is well realized -- it is gradual in the beginning when Mayilu starts using the place for his activities and worsens exponentially when the lads take him on and NKB comes into the picture . The film also shows that our masala films could be much better without frills like romantic songs . It is only when the director makes his heroes take on over a dozen men that the film turns less believable and we wonder if he could have found a way to make his protagonists use their brains more instead of their brawn to bring down the villain . And , the dues ex machina that the director resorts to when the heroines are being chased by the villain 's men towards the end of the film -- they run into a school and one of the goons ' daughter who is studying there comes to him causing a change of heart -- is unintentionally hilarious . <p> TRIVIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early morning visit to Koyambedu market for cinematograpger turned director Vijay Milton .

@@2262233 <h> Battling cancer with nanoparticles : Indian scientists devise new strategy <p> Upping the ante for a competent drug delivery system that specifically destroys cancer cells and ensures reduced toxicity to the normal ones , Indian scientists have successfully used a new strategy to enhance targeted drug release by nanoparticles . <p> Targeted drug release confines the medication - which for cancer is fraught with side effects - to the specific location within the body , prolongs its action on the affected part and reduces the amount of drug circulating in body fluids , preventing exposure to healthy cells . <p> According to a WHO report , one in every 10 Indians runs the risk of getting cancer before 75 years of age , while seven in every 100 is at risk of dying from cancer before their 75th birthday . <p> This rising graph necessitates cutting-edge therapy . <p> Small but powerful in impact , carbon nanotubes ( miniscule spaghetti-like particles fabricated from carbon ) have dominated the scientific arena for their myriad applications in electronics , material science and medicine . <p> As their name suggests , carbon nanotubes ( CNT ) measure in nanometres - 50,000 times smaller than the width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few millimetres . <p> This size is perfect for loading considerable amount of cargo ( drugs , proteins and the like ) and because they can spontaneously cross through cell membrane barriers , they are quite a sensation with scientists studying drug delivery mechanisms . <p> Being solid , CNTs are aided by a dispersing agent to ease their diffusion into biological fluids and liquid mediums . <p> A group at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science ( IACS ) here used a type of vitamin - biotin or Vitamin B7 - as part of the dispersal medium of the CNT . <p> Attached to the nanoparticle surface ( as part of its dispersing agent ) biotin facilitated the " selective " unloading of the drug at the destined stop - the lethal cancer cell . Doxorubicin , a popular chemotherapy drug , was chosen for the study . " The structure of the CNT-dispersing agent was simplified and modified so that it could effectively deliver the drug to the cancer cell and cause minimum damage to normal cells , " Prasanta Das , who led the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IANS . <p> " A good drug delivery vehicle needs to remain intact while it carries out its function . It should be compatible with the host 's body ( biocompatible ) and , most importantly , it should be target-specific so that it does not destroy neighbouring normal body cells , " Das explained . <p> Here lies the importance of biotin , which is an essential vitamin for the growth of all cells . But the demand for this vitamin is considerably higher in rapidly dividing cells and tissues , like cancer cells . Cells absorb this substance via receptors on their surface , like a key fitting into a particular lock . " Biotin receptors ( that absorb the vitamin molecule ) are produced at elevated levels in certain types of tumours like breast , ovary , kidney , liver , prostate , and some lung cell lines , " said Das about the study that is published in the January issue of Journal of Materials Chemistry . <p> So , when a biotin-equipped CNT was administered ( in a cell culture ) , it recognised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside them . " Not only was it selective , it remained intact during transit . Moreover , toxicity to normal cells was remarkably reduced . " <p> If 100 cancer cells were decimated , then around 20 normal cells were affected , which is an " improvement " over other variants of CNTs tested across the world . Besides , it did not interfere with the nanotube 's function . <p> The next step for Das and his team is to verify the findings in a living organism and assess its toxicity to the host , including if it can be naturally flushed out from the body , Alok Dhawan , an expert in nanomaterial toxicology , said . " CNTs should be modified in such a way so as to reduce their direct interaction with vital molecules in cells like DNA and proteins . Their excretion from the body is an important factor in determining long-term toxicity , " Dhawan , Director of Ahmedabad University 's Institute of Life Sciences , told IANS via email . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2262235 <h> India : Merger Regime Under The Companies Act , 2013 <h> Introduction <p> Merger is a restructuring tool available to Indian conglomerates aiming to expand and diversify their businesses for various reasons whether it is to gain competitive advantage , reduce costs or unlock values . In commercial parlance , merger essentially means an arrangement whereby one or more existing companies merge their identity into another existing company or form a distinct new entity . Company law in India is undergoing a complete overhaul and a new law was finally passed in 2013 . However , only 98 sections of the new Companies Act , 2013 ( " 2013 Act " ) have been brought into force and the provisions relating to mergers covered in Sections 230 to 240 are yet to be notified . Until then , this court driven process will continue to be governed by Section 391-396A of the Companies Act , 1956 and the Companies ( Court ) Rules , 1959 ( collectively referred to as " 1956 Act " ) . <p> This newsletter describes selective key changes introduced by the 2013 Act in relation to mergers , which term , in common parlance , is used interchangeably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare those changes with the 1956 Act . <h> 1 . The Framework <p> Chapter XV of the 2013 Act deals with " Compromises , Arrangements and Amalgamations . " In this chapter , the Act consolidates the applicable provisions and related issues of compromises , arrangements and amalgamations ; however , other provisions are also attracted at different stages of the process . Amalgamation means an amalgamation pursuant to the provisions of the Act . In an amalgamation the undertaking comprising of property , assets and liabilities , of one ( or more ) company are absorbed by and transferred either to an existing company or a new company . Simply put , the transferor integrates with the transferee and the former loses its entity and dissolves without winding-up . The 2013 Act creates a new regulator , the National Law Company Tribunal ( " Tribunal " ) who , upon its constitution , will assume jurisdiction ( the High Courts will no longer have any jurisdiction ) of the court for sanctioning mergers . Once the Tribunal is constituted , expected to be formed sometime this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 Act would be implemented . <p> Before detailing the key changes under the new law , a brief overview of the existing process will be useful . Under the 1956 Act , companies which have reached a consensus to merge must prepare a " scheme " of amalgamation/merger ( " Scheme " ) . The lenders ( financial institutions or banks ) of the transferor and the transferee must approve1 the Scheme in-principle , followed by the subsequent approval of the respective Board of Directors of the merging entities . If the merging entities are listed companies , then the listing agreements executed with the stock-exchanges require the company to communicate price-sensitive information to the stock exchange immediately , to seek an approval from the capital market regulator , Securities and Exchange Board of India ( " SEBI " ) simultaneous with the public notification . This essentially happens after the approval of the Board to the Scheme . The next step is to apply2 to the High Court having jurisdiction over the registered office of the company seeking an order to convene shareholders and creditors meeting . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is that any objector amongst the stakeholders can object to the Scheme in the court proceedings . <p> The element of preparing the Scheme has been retained under the 2013 Act . Unlike the 1956 Act , the new regime ( a ) recognizes cross border mergers , ( b ) sets out separate procedure for merger of small companies and those of holding with wholly-owned , ( c ) prescribes thresholds for objections , and ( d ) describes mandatory filings to ensure legal compliance . <h> 2 . The Changes to the process <p> Regulatory/Third party approvals3 : As shareholders ' and creditors ' consents are essential , the 1956 Act , therefore , contemplates issue of a notice to them . The 2013 Act requires service of the notice of the merger along with documents ( such as copy of the Scheme and valuation report ) not only upon the shareholders and creditors but also on various regulators including the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( through Regional Director , Registrar of Companies and Official Liquidator ) , 4 Reserve Bank of India ( " RBI " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( only for listed companies ) , Competition Commission of India ( where the prescribed fiscal thresholds are crossed and the proposed merger could have an adverse effect on competition ) , Stock Exchanges ( only for listed companies ) , Income Tax authorities and other sector regulators or authorities which are likely to be affected by the merger.5 This ensures compliance of the Scheme with other regulatory requirements imposed on the merging entities . In fact , under the 1956 Act the courts have made mergers subject to approval of the regulators . The 2013 Act prescribes a 30 day time frame for the regulators to make representations , failing which the right would cease to exist . This is a positive step because in the 1956 Act no such time frame was provided leading to considerable delays in the court proceedings . <p> Approval of the Scheme through postal ballot6 : The 1956 Act required presence of the shareholders and creditors in the physical meetings , either in person or by proxy , to cast vote for/against the Scheme . In the 2013 Act , the shareholders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot while considering a Scheme . The 1956 Act did not allow this and the shareholders and creditors could only cast votes physically . This right will ensure wider participation of the shareholders and creditors , particularly for those who are scattered all over the country and who find it difficult to be either physically present or provide a proxy . Postal ballot , therefore , will offer them a greater flexibility to cast their votes . <p> Valuation Report : Though the 1956 Act is silent on disclosing the valuation report to the stakeholders , as a matter of transparency and good corporate governance , the listed companies used to make available the valuation report for inspection and also during the course of the meetings . Courts also required annexing of the valuation report to the application submitted before them . The 2013 Act now mandates annexing of the valuation report to the notices for the meetings to enable ready access to the shareholders and creditors7 . <p> Objections8 : A bane under the 1956 Act was that it permitted the individual shareholders and creditors to raise frivolous objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such right to object to the Scheme would no longer be available to any and every person . Objections can be raised by shareholders holding 10% or more equity and creditors whose debt represent 5% or more of the total debt as per the last audited financial statements . By raising the bar , the new law aims to ensure that the frivolous objections/litigation can be avoided . <p> Accounting Standards9 : As a matter of practice , frequently the Scheme provided for accounting treatment that would deviate from the prescribed accounting standards necessitating a note to this effect in the balance sheet of the company . This was frowned upon by the tax authorities . Consequently , in case of listed companies , the listing agreement was amended to provide that an auditor 's certificate stating that the accounting treatment is in accordance with the accounting standards was required to be filed for seeking approval of the stock exchanges . The 2013 Act makes such prior certification from an auditor mandatory for both listed and unlisted companies . <p> Merger of a listed company into an unlisted one:10The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that the merger of a listed company into an unlisted company will not ipso facto make the unlisted company listed . It will continue to be unlisted until the applicable listing regulations and SEBI guidelines in relation to allotment of shares to public shareholders are complied with . Further , in case the shareholders of the listed company decide to exit , the unlisted company would facilitate the exit with a pre-determined price formula which shall be within the price specified by SEBI regulations . The Indian securities law prescribes strict enforcement of listing requirements by companies intending to get listed . SEBI had , however , eased these requirements for listed companies proposing merger by granting them exemptions from complying with the initial public offering requirements11 on a case-to-case basis . Recently SEBI had issued guidelines12 stating that if the Scheme provides for listing of shares of an unlisted company without complying with the initial public offering requirements , then , upon court approval of the Scheme , the unlisted company has to file a specific application seeking such exemption from SEBI . Such an application has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the holders of securities of the listed company.13 The changes under the 2013 Act are in line with SEBI requirements . The 1956 Act was silent on this aspect . <h> 3 . The New Kinds of Mergers <p> Apart from the aforesaid changes , the 2013 Act provides for separate provisions for cross border mergers , merger of two small companies and that of holding with wholly-owned subsidiaries . These are described briefly below . <p> Cross-border mergers14 : The 1956 Act permits cross-border mergers only where the transferor is a foreign company . In contrast , the 2013 Act permits in-principle mergers between an Indian and a foreign company located in a jurisdiction notified by the central government in periodic consultation with RBI . Such a merger would be subject to RBI approval and Scheme may provide payment in cash or depository receipts or both . The payment in cash or depository receipts would facilitate exit to the shareholders of the merging entity who do not want to be a part of the merged entity . These changes reflect the legislature 's intent to facilitate cross-border business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mergers if the transferee is an Indian company and does not recognize a situation where the transferee will be a foreign company , as contemplated under the 2013 Act . The introduction of cross-border mergers under the 2013 Act may , therefore , require corresponding changes in other laws , including foreign exchange and tax . <p> Merger of " small companies " and holding with wholly-owned subsidiaries : Unlike the 1956 Act under which merger of all companies , irrespective of nature and size requires court approval , the 2013 Act carves out a separate procedure for small companies16 and the holding and wholly-owned subsidiaries . Section 233 of the 2013 Act prescribes a simplified fast track procedure for their merger which requires consent of shareholders holding 90% in value and creditors representing 9/10th of debt in value as well as approval of the Scheme by the Regional Director , Ministry of Corporate Affairs in case no objections are received from the Official Liquidator and Registrar of Companies . Approval of the Tribunal is not required for such mergers . This could be good news for the merging entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents required to be filed under the listing agreement , in the case of listed companies , ( ii ) give notice to various authorities , ( iii ) provide auditor 's certificate of compliance with applicable accounting standards . However , if the Regional Director is of the opinion that the Scheme is not in the interest of the stakeholders , he may approach the Tribunal who could follow the merger procedure prescribed under the 2013 Act . This ability to transfer to the Tribunal has the potential to change fast-track to a normal merger and make such mergers less appealing . <h> 4 . Penalties <p> The penalties for contravention of the provisions under the 1956 Act were a maximum of INR 50,000 ( approximately US$ 80617 ) which apply to the company as well as officer-in-default . However under the 2013 Act , separate penalties have been levied on the company and its defaulting officer . To bring in more accountability , quantum for companies has been increased from the aforesaid sum to a minimum of INR 100,000 ( approximately US$ 1,612 ) and maximum of INR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be punishable with imprisonment up to one year or with a minimum fine of INR 100,000 ( approximately US$ 1,612 ) and maximum INR 300,000 ( approximately US$ 4,838 ) or both.18 Such stringent penal provisions will not apply to mergers of small companies and that of a holding company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless their merger is transferred to the Tribunal and approved by it . <h> Conclusion <p> While several noteworthy changes have been proposed , corporations could perceive the need to get multiple approvals from different regulators as onerous . However , the thirty days time limit imposed on the regulators will , hopefully , ensure that they respond in a time bound manner . On the face of it , the 2013 Act offers comprehensive and better transparency ensuring protection of stakeholders ' interest , while simultaneously avoiding frivolous objections . The exact time frame that the entire merger process would involve will be known once it is tested and which will happen after the Tribunal is constituted and the rules implemented . It would be fair to say that the 2013 Act seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new provisions should make it easier for corporations proposing mergers as it spears to have a good system of checks &amp; balances to prevent abuse of these provisions . <h> Footnotes <p> 1 Clearance of the lenders is essential to void any major change in the meeting of creditors convened at the instance of the company courts under section 391 of the 1956 Act <p> 2 The transferor and the transferee should make separate or joint applications to the High Court <p> 3 See Section 230(5) of the 2013 Act <p> 4 Under the 1956 Act , approval from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs is taken but subsequent to shareholders and creditors approval and before the final approval of the High Court <p> 5 For example , Department of Telecommunications in case of merger of telecom companies <p> 15 The Income Tax Act contains provision that mergers of companies where the transferee is an Indian company will not be subject to tax if certain conditions , namely , all assets and liabilities of the transferor become the assets and liabilities of the transferee , and at least three-fourth ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transferee , are fulfilled . If the two conditions are fulfilled , then the merger is a qualified one for the purpose of the Act and there will be no tax implications in the hands of the transferor and its shareholders <p> 16 See Section 2(85) of the 2013 Act which defines " Small Companies " as a private company , with a paid-up capital of maximum INR 5 million or a prescribed amount up to INR 50 million or with a turnover of maximum INR 20 million or a prescribed amount up to INR 200 million .

@@2262236 <p> One of the key messages from the recent Ashes series , according to the media anyway , was that " pace rules " . The primary difference between Australia in England in 2013 , and then England in Australia in 2013-14 , was seen by many to be the fast bowling of Mitchell Johnson , the eventual Man of the Series . <p> His raw speed ( admittedly combined with far greater control over direction than in some previous years ) was claimed by many commentators to be the deciding factor in Australia 's transition from a 3-0 series loss to a 5-0 series victory in the space of a few months . It was not uncommon to hear comparisons between the speed of Johnson and that of the legendary Jeff Thomson in the 1970s . <p> But what does " pace " or " speed " actually mean ? <p> In recent times , the proponents of various fast bowlers often base their argument around the figures generated from the speed gun . While the overall speed readings are very interesting , it would appear misleading to rely solely on these figures , as they do n't actually come close to telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consider a bowler to be . It was not uncommon to hear commentators literally jump with excitement about the extreme pace of a certain Johnson delivery that caused a batsman significant problems , only to then see a speed-gun rating show that it was actually slower than the previous ball that the batsman had played easily . <p> In the most recent Ashes series , a recurring theme among the commentators was that James Anderson was tired and " lacking a yard of pace " compared to his spells during the English summer . This would appear to be supported by raw statistics that show he took 22 wickets at an average of 29 in England , whereas in Australia he took 14 wickets at nearly 44 . However , a review of his average bowling speeds across both Ashes series makes for interesting reading . <p> In the first Test in Nottingham he averaged 84.9mph ; in the fifth Test in Sydney he averaged 84.5mph . Anderson 's average bowling speed per innings was remarkably similar across the ten Tests , and only varied around three miles an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Perth , the " eighth " Test , where he averaged 85.5mph . Whatever the reasons for his relatively poor performance in Australia , it can hardly be argued that it was due to him " lacking a yard of pace " . <p> At this point , I understand that many readers will no doubt be striking their foreheads on their monitors and shouting , " You idiot - he is a swing bowler and does n't rely solely on pace . " This is precisely why the speed gun is an unreliable measure . Ultimately , does it matter how we judge the " pace " of opening bowlers ? Unfortunately , and this was primary reason for this article , the speed gun is becoming a concerning aspect of team selection . It was only a few weeks ago that Australian coach Darren Lehmann outlined that bowlers need to be bowling at 140kph to be considered for the Test team . Clearly the speed gun is becoming a determining factor that helps fast bowlers get selected . <p> There is a former Australia Test opening bowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 202 first-class wickets at an average of 25.10 , and took 5 for 105 in his last first-class match , but appears to have been forgotten about in terms of national selection . Trent Copeland does n't bowl at 140kph , and therefore does n't appear likely to add to his three Test caps . However , players who have faced bowlers such as Copeland , Chadd Sayers or even Glenn McGrath will note that they are " faster " than they appear . A few years ago McGrath 's deliveries were measured as being slower than those of Greg Blewett . However , if you asked opening batsmen which one was " faster " , without any reference to the speed gun , Blewett would have struggled to gain a vote . <p> Phrases such as " hitting the bat hard " or " bowling a heavy ball " are used to describe bowlers who manage to bowl " faster " than someone with an identical speed-gun rating . From discussions with many batsmen over a number of decades , I have concluded that certain bowlers seem faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the ball is not quite where they expect it to be . <p> From the point when the bowler hits his delivery stride , the batsman starts moving into position to play a shot . With only half a second or so from the bowler letting it go until the batsman plays the ball , the batsman has to move on instinct into the correct position . A bowler who delivers a " heavy ball " is generally one who consistently hits the bat slightly higher than expected , thus leading to a batsman feeling a less than ideal contact and subsequently having less control over the shot . <p> Likewise , if a bowler has an unusual or strange action that prevents a batsman getting an early sighting of the ball , they will appear faster . The great South African Mike Procter was rated by Tony Greig as one of the " top five " paceman of his era ; Greig thought Procter bowled at a similar pace to Andy Roberts , John Snow , Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson . However , it was interesting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 , Procter came second-last among 12 bowlers , and only managed to beat Pakistan medium-pacer Sarfraz Nawaz . At that time Procter was in his early 30s , but he played first-class cricket for another decade , and he opened the bowling for the WSC World XI . <p> While the actual speeds recorded in this trial can not be fairly compared to those of current bowlers , due to differing measuring techniques , the comparative nature of the test showed that Procter was a long way behind Thomson , who led the field . However , opening batsmen of that era would clearly not agree that Procter was n't a genuine fast bowler . He is an example of how speed can be disguised , as his " wrong foot " action meant that batsmen were not picking the ball up early . <p> When Brett Lee was bowling at 135kph , batsmen perceived him as far " slower " than McGrath at the same velocity , as Lee had a flat and predictable trajectory . This meant that a batsman was in position to play a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounce or movement off the seam that forced batsmen into a late readjustment . This then made the batsmen perceive the bowler as being faster than a pure speed reading would have given them cause to do . <p> It would appear clear that Anderson 's lack of effectiveness in Australia related more to his inability to move the ball consistently , rather than him being tired and " losing pace " , as some commentators argued . Speed is not easily defined , and success does not always equate to high speed-gun measurements . The current No. 1 bowler in the world , Vernon Philander , is a great example of this , but it appears that he would not get a run for Australia as he bowls at a " mere " 130kph . <p> I hope the Australian selectors and coaching staff are willing to recognise that the speed gun alone does not define the effectiveness of an opening bowler , or just how " fast " he may be . <p> Stuart Wark works at the University of New England as a research fellow <p> lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series philander s 130kph is not at all troubling davey warner he smashed all over the park steyn is not fit so he bowls around 137 obly he also getting smashed by warner high quality pace makes huge difference <p> on January 30 , 2014 , 14:57 GMT <p> Unfortunately most of those commenting here r just armchair critics &amp; have never play competitive cricket let alone Hard ball cricket ................

In the 80s , when India won two World ODI events - namely the 83 World Cup in England and the World championship of cricket in 1985 in Australia , the team was hugely supported by bowlers such as Binny , Madan Lal and Balwinder Singh Sandhu - and of course lead by Kapil Dev . None had the real " pace " , but were all masters of swing and were successful in those helpful conditions . Same story in the 1986 test series in England , where Indian bowlers appeared to be unplayable ! ! ! These instances are a few more examples that support the authors theory . <p> bouncer709 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer , recently SA vs India , I noted Dale Styen was bowling 135kph , and Indian bowlers were bowling 140+ kph , but Indian bowlers were looking slow as compared to steyn and other SA bowlers . <p> on January 29 , 2014 , 11:26 GMT <p> Bowlers obsess far too much over speed gun readings , just as T20 batsmen do over the lengths of sixes . Neither is much help when it comes to actually winning matches . <p> NeutralKN on January 29 , 2014 , 11:11 GMT <p> For matches that are provided in Oz through channel 9 they are using a radar type speed gun to get the speed of the ball . not sure how accurate that system . I think hawkeye has got ways to get speed of the ball using the ball tracking mechanism would be interesting to get difference between 2 different approaches . <p> IndianInnerEdge on January 29 , 2014 , 8:20 GMT <p> The thing with pace is - if a real good batsman is facing , Pace alone will seldom get him out , pace combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wickets around the world , especially in the subcontinent is if you donot have the pace-read the minimum pace , in conditions where there is no swing or bounce , u are likely to get hit - that is where LEhman is coming from , and also i remember Duncan Fletcher whilst coaching Eng in the early 2000 's saying if you do nt bowl at 140+ donot bother turning up-wish he does something about indian pathetic bowling attach because by that attribute india would have a non existant pace attack ..... i also believe the action , the height of the bowler has a lot to do with the perception of pace , that said i still am not sure if the speed gun gets it right every time <p> SAFan11 on January 29 , 2014 , 8:03 GMT <p> An accurate measure of speed should include several stats . <p> Time from release point ( Point A ) to strike point ( Point B ) divided by distance measured horizontally . i.e. speed to batsmen . <p> Velocity of the ball . i.e. Actual average speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rate of deterioration of velocity through the air ( due to aerodynamics ) . <p> Amount of velocity lost on the bounce ( due to pitch conditions , ball condition and seam presentation ) . <p> This will give us as viewers , commentators , analysts and selectors a better idea of what is really going on . <p> Measures of revolutions per minute of a spin bowler are also meaningless unless they are presented alongside a visual representation of the angle of the spin and the presentation of the seam in relation to that spin . <p> SAFan11 on January 29 , 2014 , 7:49 GMT <p> What is speed ? Is it the time the ball takes to get from point A to point B ? No ball takes a direct route from point A to point B. Therefore velocity out the hand is different from speed from A to B. How does the velocity of a delivery deteriorate over its course ? Some bowlers may bowl the ball more aerodynamically and the ball gets to you sooner than you think . Different seam presentation and pitch conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus you get skidy bounce or bounce that seems to jump at you . Some bowlers lean forward and deliver the ball from closer to the batsmen while batsmen strike the ball in different places thus shortening the distance between point A and B. A shorter space means less deterioration of velocity . Just because the batsmen hit the ball on the front foot does n't mean the bowler had more velocity to start with he may just have lost less over a shorter distance . These stats should be presented side by side when measuring pace . <p> CoolJeeves on January 29 , 2014 , 7:38 GMT <p> Stuart does make an important point - late movement adds to the illusion of pace as seen by the batsman . But never heard of a batsman get frightened by " that " kind of pace , e.g. as bowled by Anderson , whether or not he caused discomfort . <p> But Marshall swinging the ball - that was dangerous , as many a batsman like Andy Lloyd would testify . <p> Heavy ball is easy to understand - the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , much quicker than the bowler 's action would have you expect . <p> Some interesting comments on what is measured - the average speed , or the initial speed ? And what is displayed - average over the 22 yards , or initial ? <p> Finally , by now everyone understands that a 150kmph from a tall bowler is much more dangerous than 150kmph from a " flat " bowler like Lee ... <p> But if that be the case , then 1 ) why was Akhtar so dangerous - perhaps due to more pronounced movement and 2 ) Steve Finn must be a very very expensive loss for England and their tamper-happy staff . <p> RightArmEverything on January 29 , 2014 , 6:15 GMT <p> I think Stuart makes an interesting point . I think guys like Copeland and Butterworth are too easily overlooked . They have consistently performed well and perhaps conditions overseas should be taken into account e.g. they might perform well in England . Copeland did well in Sri Lanka . I certainly do n't think every fast bowler in the team needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that speed in the Ashes and performed well . <p> Udendra on January 29 , 2014 , 6:05 GMT <p> By now many fans know that speed guns do lie often . The best evaluator of pace are the batsmen who face the deliveries . <p> sifter132 on January 29 , 2014 , 1:29 GMT <p> It 's a matter of semantics is n't it ? A truly fast bowler is one who troubles batsmen with his pace , it does n't matter how fast that is . ' Bowls a heavy ball ' is basically short hand for a sub 140kph bowler who is pretty useful . Never heard anyone faster than that described like that . The 140+ guys have ' genuine pace ' instead . Bowling a ' Heavy ball ' is kinda like being strong for a woman/skinny man , it 's nice , but you 'd rather have the bigger , faster , stronger one . It 's a compliment where one needs to be found . If you ca n't say ' heavy ball ' , and he does n't swing it , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice ? <p> As a follower of american sports they have a similar thing , but it 's based around race . Quick white athletes are ' deceptively fast ' , even if they actually measure fast in tests . You 'll never hear a black athlete called ' deceptively fast ' , he 's either fast or not . It 's just matching up expectations with language , and odd descriptions . <p> Pace bowling and the 140kph rule are just a passing fad that 's part of a cycle . When Lillee and Thomson followed by the WI quicks became all the rage in the mid 70s , they followed a period where there had been few genuine pace bowlers- Snow and Procter were the only genuine fast bowlers in 1970 . Batsmen were really shocked by these batteries of fast bowlers , but they eventually got used to it ( together with better protective gear and stricter rules on bouncers ) . During that time , spin was no longer in fashion , with only Abdul Qadir being a truly great spinner . Then along comes Warne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with them . Then Warne &amp; Murali retire and genuine fast bowling seems to be most batsmen 's achilles heel because they have not been exposed to real pace . And on it goes ...... <p> on January 28 , 2014 , 22:45 GMT <p> Valid point but poorly written . This point could have been summed up in one sentence or even a tweet . Could have at least quoted some expert opinions if there was no real data available . <p> on January 28 , 2014 , 22:16 GMT <p> Great to be reading these kind of intelligent articles . It is noteworthy that the speed gun records the moment the ball leaves the hand and slows considerably by the time it reaches the batsman . Also TV notes the average speed which is deceptive because of the occasional deliberate slower ball which brings down the average the down . <p> on January 28 , 2014 , 20:40 GMT <p> A 130 kph bowler will concede far less ( lucky runs ) edges beating 3rd man/ fine leg , its also rarer that they are top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of square require more effort therefore the batsman sometimes losing technique , slip catches will be easier to take , a 140/150 bowler has the ability to change a game at any time and just as important , ideally you want great bowlers all offering something different ( Steyn , Phillander , Morkel ) ( Harmison , Hoggard , Jones , Flintoff ) ( Pollock , Donald , Kallis ) , <p> MaruthuDelft on January 28 , 2014 , 16:33 GMT <p> It is the trajectory and the delayed release . If the trajectory is more of a parabola then it will be really difficult . Abdul Quadir , although is a spinner , delivered parabolas that reached batsmen before they were fully ready . Ambrose 's final delivery moment was delayed so long when he was bowling at his best that often Mark Waugh was not able to make up his mind ( or his instinct failed him ) as to when to begin his own movement . <p> Imranzia on January 28 , 2014 , 15:40 GMT <p> The speed gun gives the average of the ball 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the pace of the wicket . bowlers like Anderson , Philander , Mcgrath or Mohd .

Can I just add that the decision time that a batsman has is longer than the time it takes for the ball to get from hand to bat , and this is critical . The later the bowler gives a clue as to his delivery , the faster the ball is perceived to be . Smooth actions such as Blewett and Lee are much easier to read early ( in fact some of Lees bouncers were telegraphed by the way he held his shoulder ) . Whereas McGrath used a lot of wrist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of strength , and Thomson could vary his pace dramatically with little change of action . Bowling , particularly at the highest level , is the art of deception . <p> on January 28 , 2014 , 12:26 GMT <p> I have seen it argued that the speed guns only measure lateral displacement ( over the measuring interval ) with the implication that a short-pitched ball will always register as being slower than a beamer projected at the same initial velocity . But a well-directed bouncer will always seem much faster to the batsman than a half-volley , even if the latter arrives sooner . From this point of view , the issues about late movement , whether off the wicket or in the air , are less germane to the question whether the speed gun gets it wrong . <p> Anderson is evidently not quick enough to trouble good batsmen when there is no later movement . In 2011 , it was often wetter , and more grounds had abrasive squares ( rather than drop in pitches , surrounded by green grass ) . So there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feature in the 2014 Ashes . I agree that Anderson was down on movement rather than pace . <p> Bamber on January 28 , 2014 , 11:48 GMT <p> I 've never really understood the apparent reliance on the speed gun - as I understand it , it measures speed at point of release and not when the ball pitches or when it reaches the batsman , both more relevant measures of pace surely ? ? <p> Katey on January 28 , 2014 , 11:38 GMT <p> Thanks for that Stuart ... interesting read . I wish we could hear a bit more about the various aspects of bowling , e.g. what really causes a ball to swing . For instance , I have heard it said that slower pace results in more swing , but Dale Steyn does n't appear to fit that rule . It would be great to get some science to shine a light on this and other bowling matters , a.o.t. just hearing someone 's assertions .

I wish we could hear a bit more about the various aspects of bowling , e.g. what really causes a ball to swing . For instance , I have heard it said that slower pace results in more swing , but Dale Steyn does n't appear to fit that rule . It would be great to get some science to shine a light on this and other bowling matters , a.o.t. just hearing someone 's assertions . How about it ? <p> Bamber on January 28 , 2014 , 11:48 GMT <p> I 've never really understood the apparent reliance on the speed gun - as I understand it , it measures speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when it reaches the batsman , both more relevant measures of pace surely ? ? <p> on January 28 , 2014 , 12:26 GMT <p> I have seen it argued that the speed guns only measure lateral displacement ( over the measuring interval ) with the implication that a short-pitched ball will always register as being slower than a beamer projected at the same initial velocity . But a well-directed bouncer will always seem much faster to the batsman than a half-volley , even if the latter arrives sooner . From this point of view , the issues about late movement , whether off the wicket or in the air , are less germane to the question whether the speed gun gets it wrong . <p> Anderson is evidently not quick enough to trouble good batsmen when there is no later movement . In 2011 , it was often wetter , and more grounds had abrasive squares ( rather than drop in pitches , surrounded by green grass ) . So there was more new-ball movement and more reverse swing . Neither was a feature in the 2014 Ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pace . <p> Hrolf on January 28 , 2014 , 14:24 GMT <p> Very well thought out article . Can I just add that the decision time that a batsman has is longer than the time it takes for the ball to get from hand to bat , and this is critical . The later the bowler gives a clue as to his delivery , the faster the ball is perceived to be . Smooth actions such as Blewett and Lee are much easier to read early ( in fact some of Lees bouncers were telegraphed by the way he held his shoulder ) . Whereas McGrath used a lot of wrist to get subtle variation , Johnson has an unrefined action with a lot of strength , and Thomson could vary his pace dramatically with little change of action . Bowling , particularly at the highest level , is the art of deception . <p> Imranzia on January 28 , 2014 , 15:40 GMT <p> The speed gun gives the average of the ball 's speed through the 22 yards . But it does not show the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mcgrath or Mohd . Asif when bowling well would be quicker of the pitch . These types of bowlers grip the ball further up the fingers and impart less backspin . With the pitches in Australia a bowler like Morne Morkel might be more effective than Philander or Steyn as he bangs the ball in and the other two bowl fuller and skid the ball .

@@2278231 <h> Will the Technical Pillar of the Fourth Railway Package cross the finish line ? <p> After five years of debate , centralised certification of rolling stock in Europe is gradually moving closer with the technical pillar of the Fourth Railway Package . <p> However , Philippe Citro ? n , director general of the European Railway Industry association ( Unife ) warns that delays to this key legislation remain a distinct possibility . <p> ABOUT a year ago the European Commission ( EC ) published its proposals for the long-awaited Fourth Railway Package . In particular the Technical Pillar , comprising the revised Interoperability Directive , the revised Safety Directive and the new European Railway Agency ( ERA ) Regulation , was welcomed by Europe 's railway industry and the railway sector at large . <p> The Technical Pillar is of great importance for the industry as it brings , among other things , much-needed reforms to the way we carry out authorisation of railway equipment in Europe . <p> The proposals reflect the ideas that have been discussed between the EC , national representatives , the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies ( CER ) , Unife and the broader rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of authorisations and safety certification in Europe is fragmented and not fit for the Single European Railway Area that the European Union aspires to build . When it comes to selling railway products today we are far from an internal market and we lag behind many other industries . The authorisation processes for rail vehicles currently differ from one country to the next , with member states having their own authorisation procedures which do not necessarily comply with European legislation . <p> This leads to costly double testing and red tape for those seeking authorisation , creating a system that is expensive and unpredictable . This has negative effects on the whole railway sector as the costs incurred in the authorisation process must somehow be recovered . It is therefore high time for reform of the system and to moving towards central management of authorisations by the ERA . <p> The Technical Pillar as proposed by the EC does exactly that . If implemented , it will help to make authorisations predictable for the rail industry and reduce costs . <p> Train operators will not only benefit from European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better planned . It could be argued that the Technical Pillar is transport and industrial policy in one : it helps to make rail more attractive as a transport mode while providing the European rail industry with the strong home market it needs to maintain its position of leadership in the global market . <p> It is for this reason that the Technical Pillar of the Fourth Railway Package enjoys the unanimous support of the railway sector . While the Political Pillar remains controversial , CER and Unife are united in a desire to see the Technical Pillar adopted in the next few months . <p> After its publication in January 2013 , the EC 's proposal for the Technical Pillar had to make its way through the European institutions . As with most legislative proposals , the European Parliament and the member states in the Council were given an opportunity to modify and improve the text . Unife accompanied the Technical Pillar closely on its path through the institutions . <p> In this context , Unife would like to thank the Irish and the Lithuanian Presidencies of the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directive and in October on the Safety Directive . Unfortunately , an agreement on the ERA Regulation was not reached in 2013 for logistical reasons but Unife hopes that the Greek Presidency will succeed in closing the file by the time this article is published . <p> The European Parliament started working on this complex file in February 2013 and , thanks to the strong commitment of the rapporteurs , managed to define its position in December 2013 in a first vote in the transport committee . <p> At the time of writing , two of the three agreements of the Council are available as well as the vote of the Transport Committee on the three dossiers . The next step in the legislative process is to define a common position between the institutions in three-way negotiations between the Council , the European Parliament and the EC . From what is known about the positions of the Parliament and of the Member States these negotiations should go smoothly . As in any joint decision-making process , a few compromises will need to be found during the discussion , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Council should be able to do this quickly . It looks possible that the texts could be adopted by June 2014 . <p> However , at the time of writing , these three-way discussions have not yet begun and time pressure is mounting as European elections are due to take place in May 2014 , which will be followed by the nomination of the new Commission . This will be followed by parliamentary hearings of the Commissioners-designate , which will continue until November 2014 . It is hard to imagine that during this time of institutional change that the Technical Pillar will receive the attention it needs . Therefore , a one-year delay appears to be a real risk . <p> It is against this alarming backdrop that the European rail industry hopes that the European institutions will start three-way negotiations to adopt the Technical Pillar during the early part of this year . The European rail industry is keen to see that the institutions and the member states will quickly come to an agreement on the much-needed Technical Pillar and that this will come into force as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EC , the Parliament and the Member States so far , the European institutions can now push the Technical Pillar over the finish line which is so tantalisingly close .

The three-day event , opening at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy this week ( 7 to 9 February ) , will showcase art and artists from across South Asia , including India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Nepal and Afghanistan , as well as Bangladesh . Fourteen artists will present major ( mostly ) new solo projects and India is inevitably strongly represented , by the likes of Shilpa Gupta and Jitish Kallat . Others showing include Pakistani artist Rashid Rana and Bangladesh-born British artist Rana Begum ( See W*153 ) . The programme also includes curated exhibitions , a public art project and a series of talks and film screenings . <p> Mumbai-based Campbell Betancourt is becoming a real force across the region , working with well-funded local collectors to create ambitious public art programmes . She worked with Creative India Foundation and Shilpa Gupta to create a monumental light sculpture , ' I Live Under Your Sky Too ' in Mumbai and is now working on developing India 's first sculpture park . We spoke to her about this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in Dhaka . <p> W : This is your first year as director of the summit . It looks like a lot of hard work ? Diana Campbell Betancourt : Yes , but the wonderful thing is that a lot of the projects are new commissions . And internationally established artists do n't have many opportunities to show in this part of the world , so they have all put forward these crazy projects . <p> And you were behind the commissioning ? Yes , and I have been really lucky in that the Samdanis have been so open-minded to this . With Shilpa Gupta for instance , she has been interested in border politics for a really long time so she wanted to travel the Bangladesh/India border . There are pockets of India that are in Bangladesh and pockets of Bangladesh that are in India , if that makes sense , and they have their own economies and ways of operating . So we just gave her an amount of money and said ' go travel and figure out what you want to do ' . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with something . It is very rare that someone is so open in the commissioning process . <p> So the Samdani Foundation funds research and production ? Yes . The great thing is that afterwards , they do n't own these works , they belong to the artist . If they want to buy them , they will buy them through the gallery , so it 's not a way for them to collect incredible works on the cheap . <p> Why is this a summit rather than a fair or a biennial ? I think it means it 's a place to bring people together for a short period of time . It 's only three days . And most biennials , you have to pay to get in . This is free to the public . It is also free for the galleries . There are 33 galleries showing and they are by invite only but there is no booth cost . The costs are born by the Samdani Foundation . <p> Are they selling work ? They are but there is n't really a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will sell to institutions that are visiting . The Tate is sending people , as are many of the international institutions . So the brief that I gave the galleries was to show works that curators from institutions might be interested in . <p> Part of the reason that the Samdanis wanted to support this is that there is no representation system with galleries in Bangladesh . Artists have to develop their career on their own . There is no professional development or investment or mentoring on the part of the galleries . The Samdanis thought that if they could bring in more professional galleries from around the region , then maybe that would inspire local galleries to adopt similar practices . <p> Are there just no galleries in Dhaka ? There are but they are more like shops for art , if that makes sense - there is no long-term engagement . And most people are buying Bengal masters . They are not buying emerging contemporary artists . Artists do n't really have studios here - they work out of their homes and they have to have other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can encourage the development of a supportive art infrastructure by showing what is possible ? Yeah . And there are lots of issues about travelling with visas and things like that . So even if you have the money , it might not be possible to go and see the Venice Biennale , for example . The idea is to bring the best to Bangladesh . Rajeeb is 39 and Nadia is 31 . And there is a new generation in Bangladesh that might be interested in art if they lead by example . <p> And the point of the summit is primarily to talk to institutional curators rather than gallerists or collectors or dealers or critics ? Yes , there is a huge list of international curators coming and it is really encouraging to see that all these people have an interest in art from South Asia . And the reason why Rajeeb is on all these museum committees is that when people talk about building South Asian collections they normally mean India and Pakistan . Bangladesh rarely gets into the picture , let alone Sri Lanka , Nepal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangladeshi artists coming through and are they doing something distinctive ? There is actually a strong tradition of photography in Bangladesh and some of the younger artists are taking this photography background and making really interesting videos . To support them , there is the Samdani Art Award for an artist under 40 and the winner will spend a three-month residency at the Delfina Foundation in London . We show work from the shortlist at the summit . <p> It used to be a cash award but they found that since it is so hard to be a professional artist in Dhaka , the two artists who won last year just took the cash and decided not to be artists anymore . <p> Having gone back and forth between Mumbai and Dhaka , how do the cities compare ? Well , because of the political situation , I 'm not sure you would call these normal conditions at the moment . There are surface differences . Because Bangladesh is a Muslim country , you ca n't order wine in a restaurant in Dhaka but you can get the most amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , great Hibachi steak . And because there is a minimum wage in Bangladesh , not many people can afford their own cooks , unlike in India , which means that there is a really vibrant restaurant scene in Dhaka .

Of course , there are the occasional moments when they break into an impromptu fusion . <p> This , in short , was what happened in the jugalbandi between Kottakkal Madhu and Ambalapuzha Vijayakumar , brilliant exponents of Kathakali Sangeetham and Sopana Sangeetham , respectively , at the Azhakiyakavu Temple festival at Palluruthy , Kochi , recently . <p> This was only their third public performance after Madhu and Vijayakumar decided to embark on this new musical venture . " We are still probing the possibilities ; we found it to be an exciting experiment and we are sure of turning it into a perfect jugalbandi where the boundaries of the two forms will blend without blurring the identities of the two styles of music , " says Vijayakumar . And certainly the immense possibilities of such a fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them took turns to sing the invocation , Madhu set the ball rolling with two popular padams , ' Naishadhan evanthan ...

Both these ragas and the padams were rendered elaborately bringing out the nuances of the raga as it is handled in Kathakali Sangeetham . With your eyes closed , letting the bhava-laden voice of Madhu , backed up by Nedumpilly Rammohan waft into your inner recesses , the chenda , maddalam and edakka joining in , it was as if the characters came to life on stage . Vijayakumar used Ananda Bhairavi in a kalampaattu kriti . Vijayakumar was supported by Ambalapuzha Sreekumar . <p> There is something poignant about ' Ajithahare ... ' ( ' Kuchelavritham ' ) and Sree raga that make your heart melt . Both Madhu and Vijayakumar must have sung this padam on so many stages .

This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , in his style , to make it a different experience . <p> Instead Vijayakumar used Sree raga in a Kesadipada varnanam or a graphic description of the presiding deity of Guruvayoor .

And this Vijayakumar rendering was just that . <p> " We actually could have thought of this . In Kathakali , bhakti is not all important but in Sopana Sangeetham this is the soul . So we need to look for padams that suit both the styles , such as ' Ajithahare ... ' . There are a few of them , and we try and sing them together in our different styles . We will do this in our future programmes , " says Madhu , with Vijayakumar nodding in agreement . <p> Vijayakumar gave an elaborate exposition of Kalyani raga , exploring the two distinctive styles in Sopana Sangeetham -- the Vadakkan ( north ) popularised by masters such as Njeralathu Rama Poduval and the Central Travancore style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose ' Ghora vipinam ...

@@2312238 <h> A never-ending spree <p> The Hindu Secret files : Pay and perks of government staff have been a taboo topic of political debate . - RAVINDRAN <p> The government has tripled the pay of babus every decade . What are we getting in return ? <p> February 19 , 2014 : <p> Just how much control do bureaucrats exercise over their so-called political masters ? Quite a lot , it turns out -- especially over things they see as impacting their own , immediate welfare . <p> Take the deafening silence over the constitution of the Seventh Pay Commission , one of the parting ' gifts ' of the UPA government for whichever government comes next . Earlier this month , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , a former bureaucrat himself , signed the order constituting the Seventh Pay Commission . <p> The Commission will be chaired by retired Supreme Court judge Ashok Kumar Mathur and has been asked to recommend the extent to which the salaries and benefits of more than 70 lakh Central Government employees and pensioners . The commission 's award is slated to kick in from 2016 , ten years after the last one . <p> Going by the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next finance minister , including a slowing economy , reduced revenue growth , soaring non-Plan expenditure , and a major -- and permanent -- diversion of central funds to states for implementation of most of the government 's welfare schemes , this might seem like small beer . <p> But nevertheless , given the scale and size of the potential outgo , there has been practically no noise over this . Which is quite astonishing , since the previous Pay Commission has so far cost the central government over ? 2 lakh crore , the Railways and additional ? 1 lakh crore and state governments , local governments and public sector undertakings probably more than this , thanks to me-too demands from their staff . <p> This is because , regardless of the colour of the political dispensation in power at the Centre , pay and perks of government employees -- a significant vote bank by themselves -- have been a taboo topic for political debate . If at all any noise is made , it is almost always in support of the demand for better pay and perks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different this time around either . Even the Aam Aadmi Party , the most vocal advocate for accountability among public servants , has kept quiet about it . <p> This may , of course , be because the AAP 's definition of accountability is fixated on just one parameter , corruption . No political party has seriously taken up the issue of another key parameter , which anybody else who works for a living , including , ironically , politicians themselves , takes for granted -- performance . <p> Although the Sixth Pay Commission had mandated certain performance-linked parameters , and had even stipulated that a fifth of all the increments should be given on the basis of performance and productivity and not merely on the basis of time served , government employees remain the most cosseted part of the working class . <p> And for people who have no clearly defined productivity targets to deliver on , and are further protected by statute and law from the most basic of risks run by every other type of employee -- that of getting fired -- government employees have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel has roughly tripled pay . This means that simply by turning up for work for 10 years , a government employee would have tripled his pay . This , by any yardstick , is far better than what their counterparts in the private sector have been able to achieve . <p> Take for the sake of illustration , the case of Hindustan Unilever Limited . As a multinational and as India 's largest consumer products company , HUL is considered to be a sought after employer at all levels . From IIM graduates to factory hands , one can safely assume that all HUL employees get , if not the best deal in the market in each and every case , a deal which compares favourably with the best that the market can offer . <p> More the merrier <p> Between 2003 and 2013 , HUL 's annual reports show that outgo on wages and salaries rose from ? 493.76 crore to ? 1,318.34 crore . This translates to a 2.67 times increase in all wages and salaries . Since HUL 's wage bill is heavily weighted in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , one can argue that the average wage of a factory worker in HUL increased by less than 2.67 times over 10 years . <p> This is actually more or less on par with the increase of 2.6 times effected in the pay of an entry level employee over the past decade , which rises sharply to well over three times in the case of higher pay grades . <p> However , this is not accompanied by the tough productivity-linked norms that all HUL employees -- from factory hands to C-suite honchos -- had to meet in order to achieve the same level of increase in pay and benefits . <p> At higher levels , life gets even better for a babu . One of the key characteristics of any performance-linked compensation system is the percentage of ' pay-at-risk ' to total pay . <p> Pay-at-risk the component which the employee stands to lose if she or he does not meet mutually agreed performance and delivery goals during the review period . <p> Risk elements <p> Indians as a rule are very risk averse when it comes to remunerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the component of variable pay and pay-at-risk in the total pay package to levels comparable to developed economies .

At C-suite levels , the pay at risk ratio rises to over 40 per cent of total pay . <p> In contrast , government employees have very little skin in the game when it comes to performance . The biggest risk is the higher level of increment . <p> This means that a government employee who performs will get a 3.5 per cent increment , in contrast to a time-scale 2.5 per cent garnered by a non-performer ! <p> This is ridiculous . The need for a ' living wage ' -- the guiding principle for the first Pay Commission -- is long past .

This day is also accompanied by making charity , offering barley in sacred fire and worshipping Lord Ganesha and Devi Lakshmi on this very day . <p> From time immemorial people have been buying precious jewellery and valuables to commence the year of prosperity on this occasion . This faith stems from the occurrence of the moon gradually increasing in size to its full form during this period and only what is truly eternal will embody the virtues of prosperity and good fortune . It is also believed that this day is auspicious and of special significance as it symbolises purity , hence white payasam , jasmine flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puja . <p> The Golden day The word Akshaya means eternal ( that never diminishes ) . On this day , initiations made or valuables are bought . They 're considered to bring success and good fortune . Another popular activity during this time is buying gold . This metal has always found a special place amongst Indians and India is considered to be the biggest buyer of gold in the world . <p> Gold is considered to be the ultimate symbol of prosperity and wealth . Wearing gold jewellery on this day signifies never diminishing good fortune . This day also marks a new beginning of business ventures and weddings in the Indian household and brings wealth and prosperity . On this day people indulge in buying of gold -- whether in the form of jewellery , gold bars or coins . Even though the cost of gold declined at its lowest early this year , it is on a steady rise again . But this does not seem to deter the customers who are placing orders by dozens to buy gold on this very day . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go higher on bargain hunting due to drop in gold prices . This can support the prices for bullions for few days . Gold in India is expected to go higher due to weaker rupee and local physical demand on upcoming festival of Akshaya Tritiya . <p> Will you buy gold , no matter the soaring prices ? Whether or not the prices rise , it does not discourage people from indulging themselves to a piece of that precious yellow metal this year . From buying plain gold to investing in gold plated jewellery -- kundan sets , pearl sets or traditional meenakari jewellery encrusted with gold , the list is endless . <p> Says Mahesh Jagwani , jewellery connoisseur and managing director of a reputed jewellery brand says , " Gold has been an all time favourite with Indians . Gold and Akshaya Tritiya have always been synonymous with one another . It is also considered auspicious to buy something precious on this day . Apart from gold , nowadays people are also investing in buying emeralds , diamonds , sapphires and other precious stones along with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> TV actor Nakuul Mehta believes this is probably one of the best times in the year when people should make some sort of investment that goes a long way in securing his future .

This is because festivals are considered to be auspicious and buying valuables during this time is considered to bring good luck and fortune . My mother would always buy gold jewellery during Akshaya Tritiya . That is how I got introduced to the concept of buying valuables during this time of the year . I invest in gold ETF every year on this day . Apart from this , I also remember my buying my first car on Akshaya Tritiya , four years ago . " <p> It is no different for TV actress Ashlesha Sawant who would enjoy these days going out shopping with her mother in Pune . Says she , " Apart from the usual pujas and distribution of mithais at home , I would always accompany my mom to the jewellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of gold on Akshaya Tritiya . Whether it 's a gold earring or coin . As a child I used to find it fascinating and probably still do ! " <p> Jewellery trends The option for buying valuables during Akshaya Tritiya is not just restricted to buying gold this season . The current jewellery trend is purchasing functional and wearable jewellery rather than traditional and heavy designs which are difficult to wear on a day-to-day basis . <p> Says jewellery designer Renu Oberoi , " Jewellery trends this season has moved beyond just gold . With the price of gold on the rise again , other popular metals like rose gold , platinum and silver are doing the rounds . Traditional and contemporary designs rule the latest trends for the upcoming Akshaya Tritiya . Rose gold is the hottest trend for this season . Chokers and uncut diamond jewellery are also in for a run . Choker necklaces are a must-have jewellery item that will complete your ensemble . Uncut diamonds in asymmetrical designs break monotony and can be worn at parties and special occasions alike . Stylish long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A long string with Columbian emerald is also in fashion . " <p> The culture of buying jewellery is not just restricted to women . Men too have a wide variety of valuable items to choose from . Adds Oberoi , " Necklaces and bracelets are in hot demand among men . There are some intricate designs well crafted for men so that they give a strong display of a masculinity of a man . " <p> Myths around Akshaya Tritiya This day is also considered to mark the beginning of the Satya Yug ( the first of the four yugas ) or the Golden Age . In the Puranas or the holy Hindu scriptures , there is a story that says that on this day of Akshaya Tritiya -- Veda Vyasa along with Lord Ganesha started writing the great epic Mahabharata . Mother Ganges is also believed to have descended on Earth on this very day . <p> According to another legend , during Mahabharata , when the Pandavas were in exile , Lord Krishna on this day presented them with ' Akshaya Patra ' a bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food on demand . <p> Things to keep in mind while buying gold <p> Gold is the most loved precious metals . It is not only a wonderful ornament to wear but also a great hedge against inflation and falling markets . One of the most important attribute of gold is that it can be liquidated easily around the world . Since it is a symbol of purity , prosperity and opulence , there are certain things you must keep in mind when you go to purchase this metal . <p> The first and the most important thing to keep in mind is that you need to understand the variations in gold that affect its purity , quality and price . <p> Purity : Remember to pay attention to the purity of the product . Most gold have markings inside that indicate its caratage . Pure gold is very soft to use as a piece of jewellery . That is why it is alloyed with a mixture of metals like silver , copper , nickel and zinc to give it durability and strength . The most common carat options are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the higher will be the purity of gold . <p> Price : The price of gold jewellery is determined by the purity of the gold , which alloy it is combined with and by the amount of skill and labour that goes into the piece -- the higher the skill and labour , the higher the making charges . <p> Colour : Gold has many variations , thus you need to keep the colour of the metal in mind when purchasing . In addition to yellow gold ( which is commonly available and popular ) there are white gold and rose gold . You can also find two-toned styles . Apart from that , you can combine pure gold with other metals that creates a new and diverse colour palette . Mixing in white metals , such as silver or palladium creates a white gold which is a popular option for weddings . <p> Identification : In India , local law requires that every item of gold jewellery bears a clear stamp indicating its caratage . This identification is controlled often through a hallmarking system . Branded jewelers usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark and caratage of each piece . <p> Jeweller 's reputation : Buying gold is not only based on trust alone . You need to be sure of the brand you are purchasing it from .

The Bharatiya Janata Party named Modi in September last year , much ahead of the polls to the 545-seat parliament . By all accounts , Modi , the four-time Gujarat chief minister , is a picture of confidence . <p> In sharp contrast is the Congress , which looks a pale shadow of its 2009 health when it stunned friends and foes by winning more seats than in 2004 with Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi at the helm .

@@2343236 <p> In a chat with ET Now , Mehrab Irani , Investment Manager , Tata Investment Corporation Ltd , shares his views on the market and the current political developments in the country . Excerpts : <p> ET Now : How are you reading the relative strength that we are seeing in the markets and are you bullish or cautiously optimistic at this juncture ? <p> Mehrab Irani : The Nifty is currently trading close to 6275 levels and the Sensex is trading at about 21000 levels . If you rewind six years back , in January 2008 for the first time , the Sensex had touched 21000 levels . However , at that time , the earnings of the Sensex was around Rs 850 while today the expectation for 2015 earnings is closer to Rs 1550 . <p> Hence , earnings have almost doubled , while valuations have contracted , because the market stays at the same level , though it has gone up and down during the same period . There is a lot of dichotomy currently in the markets . Some of the sectors like consumers , outsourcing , software and , selectively , pharma are valued very richly and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the other sectors like PSU banking , engineering , capital goods and so on are very cheaply valued . There are a lot of problems in those industries and they are trading as if the Sensex is around 8000-10000 levels . So this kind of dichotomy is going on in the market . <p> On the positive side , the current account deficit has considerably reduced . Even the fiscal deficit is currently under control , thanks to the generous dividend payment by a lot of PSU companies . Even the GDP number given out last Friday was around 4.7% , but there is a sense in the market that the GDP maybe close to the bottom , or it may improve over the next couple of quarters , or after a couple of quarters . <p> On the negative front , inflation still has to slightly reduce to come within the RBI 's comfort zone . Interest rates are actually still rising , the repo rate was raised by the RBI last time and even the short term borrowing and bank CD rates have again started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 9% and again inching up . So those will still be some concerns on the macro front . <p> ET Now : How are you viewing the political developments right now , because the markets seem to be almost pricing in , or hoping for an NDA leadership led by Modi . What are your views on that hypothesis ? <p> Mehrab Irani : Yes , the market is surely banking on that . I do not think the market is overhyped , but it is surely hoping that a Narendra Modi-led BJP government will come to power . If that comes about , policy will get some push and it will be very positive for the markets . However , if that were not to happen , then it would be very bearish for the market . <p> The NDA has to get 272 plus seats in the Lok Sabha and if by any chance they were to fall short by maybe , say , 40-50 seats , then two kinds of scenarios may happen . One , the BJP-led NDA may come to power but without Modi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two some kind of a weak coalition government may come to power , which may not be able to implement a lot of policies which would be again very bearish for the markets . <p> ET Now : What about the pharma space ? What do you like there ? Would you pick the midcap counters , or would you rather go with the large cap companies , given all the noise that is being made about the US FDA issues that have a lot of investors pretty nervous ? <p> Mehrab Irani : We have to be selective in pharma . There are some companies which are doing quite well , particularly on the midcap front . Even today , some companies are available at decent , or should I say , reasonable valuations . So there , we have to be selectively positive . We have to be careful , but yes , there are a lot of opportunities in the midcap pharma at this point of time . <p> ET Now : Any contra trade where you have a different position versus the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not say a different position , but I would cautiously look at PSU banks . There are a lot of concerns just now regarding PSU banks , because of their high NPAs and restructured loans . <p> Today if you see , the typical restructured loan of a large PSU bank would be almost 8% to 10% of its advances , which is a huge number . Yes , there will be a lot of capital requirements and there are estimates of around Rs 3-5 lakh crore of capital requirement for PSU banks . <p> Also , this capital will be raised at below book value . So it will be EPS negative or dilutive for those banks and growth without capital will also suffer . However , a lot of the loans which those PSU banks have given and which are under restructuring now are backed by assets , but those assets have become unviable due to lot of policy inactiveness by the government , or maybe non availability of raw material , or high interest rates . <p> If these problems were to be fixed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy , a lot of those assets which are being restructured or are bad may actually not remain so and they may actually become good assets . Under that condition , the PSU banks will start looking interesting , particularly with the valuations they are trading at , but yes , we have to be cautious over there .

@@2356233 <h> How smartphones and tablets are changing the hospitality industry <p> by Rohan Swamy , 11 March 2014 <p> The days of long check-in queues or struggling to get a waiter 's attention when you 're trying to order are being left behind . The hospitality industry is innovating quickly , and swiping through menus on a tablet or controlling the temperature of your suite using an iPod are becoming the new normal . With the advancements though come vulnerabilities , whether in the form of an app crashing , or even something as simple as training guests on how to enter their rooms . <p> Swipe tounlockIn case you think that this all sounds far-fetched for India , then you 're behind the times . We 're already seeing these kinds of uses for technology in hotels and restaurants here . The Radisson Hotel at Pune was one of the first places here to keep an iPod in rooms in 2010 , to control basic functions like lights , the air conditioning , and to let you change channels on the TV through a custom touchscreen interface . <p> And at the ITC Grand Chola in Chennai guests will find an iPad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gadgets that guests will find a special app running that lets users order their room service from the iPad without having to find a menu and call . Aside from this , guests can also control the lights , and the air conditioning from the iPad , and if there 's someone at the door , then the iPad can also show the video feed from the door security camera , and be used to unlock the door if guests choose . As with Radisson Pune , here too , the app can be used as a remote control for the television and guests can also use it to check their room bill - to see the damage they 've been doing with room service during their stay ! <p> The Sheraton Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway meanwhile has a comprehensive programme that they call Link@Sheraton experienced with Microsoft . Link@Sheraton gives the guests a number of facilities such as free workstations , printouts through the cloud platform PrintMe.com and of course , free Wi-Fi access . That 's all fairly standard these days , but an interesting new facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - guests can connect up to five devices to the in-car Wi-Fi . The hotel 's general manager Suarabh Bakshi claims they are the first hotel to offer such a service to guests for free . <p> This is just the beginning though - in the US , Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide is already experimenting with keyless entry systems in two of their hotels . The Stamford headquartered hotel chain is one of the largest companies in the industry and if the test is successful then it 's safe to imagine that other hotel chains will follow suit . <p> Starwood has partnered with Swedish lock manufacturers Assa Abloy to develop a feature that lets guests use an app instead of a key or card to enter their rooms . The hotel chain is now testing the feature , which works by fitting a Bluetooth receiver in the lock that pairs with an app guests have to install on their phones . <p> The company already has iOS and Android apps for members of its Starwood Preferred Guest programme.The app can be used for making a booking , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest nearby . According to a Starwood spokesperson , guests can even skip the check-in formalities by using the app . <p> Companies , big and small , benefitIt 's not just big hotels that are trying to catch up with global trends that are doing this . Smaller restaurants have enthusiastically embraced technology to increase efficiency and also to stand out from the competition . <p> At restaurants like Hai Bao in Mumbai , the entire menu is presented on an iPad - you can swipe through the items , see pictures and read descriptions , before ordering . Flambos , in Pune , has had Android tablets with the same type of interactivity , since 2012 . <p> TJ 's Brew Works is a brewery in Pune which takes things one step further .

It has become more of an interactive experience . With the iPads , the idea is also to reduce the downtime for serving the food and to eliminate errors that happen while delivering and serving an order . " <p> Security needs to come firstOf course , there are some " what if " questions that need to be answered . For instance , if the application hangs or goes down , what is the backup ? What if the hotel security is compromised ? Or if the receiver on the hotel suite lock refuses to pair with a person 's smartphone ? These are questions that need to be answered as and when the technology is being developed . <p> For now , most hotels are reluctant to talk about what would happen in case an iPad fails , or what failsafes are in place to prevent someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel - an insider tells us - had an issue with their app-based implementation because commands would take around two minutes to register . Users who did n't realise this would keep repeating commands , causing the app to crash . <p> When we reached out to security experts Symantec , they pointed us to an official blog post that highlights the importance of security in a world where everything 's connected to everything else . Kevin Haley , Director , Symantec Security Technology and Response , Symantec says , " This is the nature of new trends - security is usually an afterthought . Companies are pushing forward quickly , trying to establish a market . They are thinking of how to meet customer needs , not their security . And no consumer buys into these new ideas because they are secure . They buy into them because they are new ideas .

@@2359235 <h> Cyrus Todiwala 's Goan Portuguese food finds favour in London <p> To many , it seems that Cyrus Todiwala can do no wrong . As Cafe Spice Namaste approaches its 20th anniversary , the veteran Indian super-chef 's flagship London restaurant not only remains a bastion of fine Indian dining , but is also one of the only places to experience proper Parsee cuisine in the UK . <p> Cyrus is all about widening diners ' eyes to new culinary experiences -- be it introducing the Queen to Country Captain at a Jubilee dinner , introducing the British to the niceness of spice in the recent BBC ' Incredible Spicemen ' series he starred in alongside fellow chef Tony Singh , or inspiring the Indian viewing public in ' Mr. Todiwala 's Galleons of Spice ' . But even for intrepid explorers of Cyrus ' order , certain culinary territory has thus far remained unchartered . Portugal is one such place , and Assado is the ambitious project with which the chef wants to share its far-flung food influences with the world -- or at the very least , his loyal customers . <p> Assado is a new addition to London 's dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define and impossible to ignore . It 's not pure Portuguese , and neither is it all about the gourmet Goan food influenced so heavily by the European country 's explorers . Instead , it 's as quirky and unique as the man at the helm ; worthy of extensive exploration.That man does not stand alone . Cyrus is vocal about Team Todiwala -- the close-knit family that incorporates immediate and honorary members alike . His beloved wife Pervin and sons Jamsheed and Hormuzd are all involved with myriad and various elements of the chef 's empire , fostering a firm and supportive family bond that only seems to bring more success their way . <p> Cyrus and Pervin are a powerful pairing ; two halves of a whole . In an industry full of ego , pomp and circumstance , the chef 's endless recognition of his wife 's role in the smooth running of his operations is rather refreshing . If she vetoes his food , he claims , it never makes the menu . Accordingly , the duo diligently dined their way through Assado 's intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can one expect from Assado ? Cyrus says that the restaurant will offer the opportunity to explore both bygone jewels of Goan Portuguese cuisine and learn about the rich spice legacy provided by the Portuguese at every port they pulled up in . If that sounds a little stodgy , do n't fear that you 'll get a long lecture along with your lunch -- Assado is intended as a friendly , casual stop for a spot of all-day khana sure to sate curiosity and appetite alike . Cyrus is certain that anyone who comes hungry and leaves their preconceptions at the door will be delighted by whatever they dine on . <p> A meal at Assado might include tiny tapas like beetroot-and-coconut puffs or traditional Goan prawn rissois with a Portuguese cheese dressing ; and larger dishes like Goan prawn curry with red rice , or the caldeen that so suited the initially spice-averse Portuguese palate . Desserts like Portuguese pastel de nata celebrate the sweet legacy left on India 's smallest state . The all-day diner also does a nice line in Goan breads like poi and lacete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concise menu is certainly novel amongst London 's other options . In a banal babble it speaks for itself ; treading that tricky tightrope between innovative and authentic . Cyrus is adamant that it will evolve and expand , eventually exploring the wider world of the culinary legacy left by the Portuguese all over the globe . The only thing the chef feels is missing from the menu is Goa 's trademark cashew feni -- but that 's merely a personal pining , not a real business regret . <p> Something Cyrus never regrets is the time he devotes to discovering Britain 's finest food artisans and farmers and representing them on his menus . This approach is not so novel for restaurants serving European cuisines ; but ' local ' , ' seasonal ' and ' sustainable ' are lesser selling points for many of the UK 's so-called ' ethnic ' establishments , where it 's attractive prices and unusual dishes that are more the draw for diners . <p> But as ever , Cyrus flips the script , demonstrating how championing the people and the produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cuisines that are not always afforded the respect or recognition they should so rightfully command . At Assado , it 's hard not to be impressed by finding fare like rare Manx Loaghtan mutton in the xacuti or British Lop pork in the vindaloo.For Cyrus , it 's not just about the final fusion involved with inspired menu items ; that happy harmony also has to happen between multicultural restaurants and the best British produce . The British public relishes a wealth of worldwide cuisines , but is also proudly patriotic . At Assado and elsewhere , Cyrus ' approach ticks both those boxes . It 's also simple , sustainable , and eminently sensible . <p> It 's a well-known fact that Cyrus never stops . As Assado finds its feet , he 's already striding forth ; planning a pure Parsee place to provide a home and showcase for that shrinking community 's cuisine , plotting a school of Asian and Oriental cookery to inspire chefs from all backgrounds , supporting multiple charities , and launching culinary talent contest ' Zest Quest Asia ' .

" <p> The comments set the local organising committee on a collision course with Castelao officials , who have confirmed Brazilian pop veteran Roberto Carlos will perform at the venue April 5 . Ceara state 's special World Cup secretary Ferruccio Feitosa last week guaranteed the Castelao 's playing surface would not be affected . The World Cup will be staged in 12 Brazilian cities from June 12 to July 13. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Indisputably , it holds true for all sport , as it does in every facet of life . In cricket , too , a plethora of examples spring to mind . How often have we seen the most technically adept of batsmen falter and fall , whereas the relatively lesser skilled teammate grabs the opponent by the throat and nonchalantly unfurls the finishing blow , primarily because , in stark contrast to the former , he 's brimming with confidence ? Every tournament , if not every game , will present an aforementioned case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player 's deficiencies . It 's not a clich ? when experts say the course of a match can dramatically change based on the outcome of a single over .

Whilst Tests require seven or eight players in a team to have a decent game in order to script a win , T20 allows the luxury of carrying the under-performers .

Enough pundits have written of his natural stroke-making ability , and umpteen videos of some of his finest knocks , housed on YouTube , reveal elegance of the type that words fail to do justice to .

On this count , the diffidence on his walk back to the pavilion was hard to miss . <p> As guesstimated , Yuvraj buckled in the following game against West Indies , his painstaking 10 off 19 in a match that was as good as won by the time he walked in shedding light on his almost non-existent self-confidence .

Probably , he will get back into flow as we know how good a match-winner he is . " But how long will they persist for , since there is no dearth of a replacement ?

@@2387236 <h> The Afghanistan cricket team have been nominated for the Laureus World Sports Awards . <p> In the 19th century , the British introduced what seemed like an alien game made up of willow and leather to Afghanistan . The game from its humble beginnings has stood the test of the time and now Afghanistan is on the verge of being recognised for its surge towards dizzying heights in international cricket . They were justifiably nominated by the esteemed Laureus World Sports Awards ' panel for ' Breakthrough of the Year ' for 2013 . <p> In fact , it has been a long and arduous journey for those Afghanistan cricketers . They have had to wade through the rough terrains of a country invariably under incessant threat of wars and the terrible Taliban regime . However , the Afghans have shown incontrovertible self-belief to wash away every challenge with aplomb . <p> In an interview to CricketCountry , Afghanistan 's coach Kabir Khan talked about how the tough upbringing has made the team resilient , " I would say that these are things that are inbuilt or they are born with . The thing is that the generation that is playing with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough . Most of them were in refugee camps in Pakistan or other countries .

That is the main reason I would say . <p> " They wanted to prove to the world that they are good enough . They could do anything . You just tell them , ' Run 20 laps of the ground . ' Stupid thing , and they 'll do it if they think whatever the coach is saying is good for them and would make them better cricketers . They took it as a challenge .

These are those players who want to go and perform there . " <p> Curiously enough , if we look back at Afghanistan 's history , Taliban have played a part in helping cricket to branch out in the country . Even though , the cruel regime 's rule led to mass bloodshed and destruction that still haunts people in Afghanistan , it was Taliban , who gave permission for the sport to be played in the country , as they played in clothing that did n't offend the regime . <p> The sheer passion for the game was also rekindled by those Afghans who had crossed the border during the Soviet Union war to live in refugee camps in a cricket-mad country like Pakistan and were charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport brought it to Afghanistan . <p> Taj Malook , former national coach and father figure of the Afghanistan national team talked about the refugee camps playing a part in the growth of the sport .

" <p> Nowadays , the entire country has been smitten over by the game . Recently , when Afghanistan qualified for ICC World Cup 2015 , thousands of people came out on the streets to rejoice the landmark achievement with unfettered fever . In streets and parks , kids play cricket with unbridled enthusiasm . <p> It has to be said that kids also need twinkling stars , who have shone brightly by leaving an indelible mark at the international stage to follow in their footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are n't just gifted with heavy dollops of skill , but also have that never say die spirit to come out as a true winner . <p> The likes of Mohammad Nabi , Shapoor Zadran , Asghar Stanikzai , Hamid Hassan , Mohammad Shahzad , Narwooz Mangal and company are stars in their own right . Just recently , the Afghanistan setup took a gargantuan leap in the international circuit by upsetting the applecart and defeating Bangladesh in Asia Cup 2014 . <p> It is heart-warming to see that despite the odds being stacked against them , the Afghanistan team , with an undying love for the game and an unstinting service to the cause , have pushed the envelope of possibility with their heroic deeds on a cricket field . The sport can even turn out to be a harbinger of peace and harmony in the country .

@@2406240 <p> " People knew I was different not only because of my skin colour but also because of what I could and could n't do . " <p> Britain has seen the arrival of over 4 million South Asians since the 1950s . Second and third generation immigrants born and brought up in Britain have therefore had ample opportunity to integrate into the community . <p> However with increasing numbers of politicians and media commenting on integration suggesting that insular ethnic ' ghettos ' have risen up , this assumption may be far from accurate . <p> Many first generation Asians perhaps find it difficult to ' blend in ' with English people . Language and cultural barriers are just a few major factors that cause this difficulty . <p> Although many choose to sympathise with the Asian communities and wish to aid them in their daily struggles as immigrants , others have a slightly different approach . <p> Sir Robin Wales , Mayor of Newham has made drastic changes in his town , the least White borough in England . <p> In an attempt to make foreigners understand and speak English , he has taken away foreign language newspapers from libraries , removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons for immigrants . He insists that such action is his way is to prevent ' apartheid ' . <p> In an interview with BBC Asian Network , Sir Robin said ; " I 'm very strongly of the view that if you try and segregate people into different groups and try to keep them separate , that 's not only bad for everybody , it 's bad for the particular community you do it to . " <p> For second generation Asians , lack of understanding and discrimination is often one of the main reasons they find it difficult to integrate . <p> Cultural differences are often so significant that they feel isolated from the rest of society . Differences in upbringing also have a significant impact on the children . <p> Isma mentions how , due to certain restrictions by her parents as a child , she would often be seen as ' different ' : " People knew I was different not only because of my skin colour but also because of what I could and could n't do . " <p> " Other girls would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a close family friend or relative . Although these things seem minor at first , they were still restrictions which meant that there were certain things that I , as a Pakistani , could n't do , whereas other English people could , " she said . <p> Many South Asian parents do feel the need to make sure their children grow up with the same cultural beliefs , especially if they are first generation South Asians coming to Britain . <p> Seema shares Isma 's views : " My parents were very afraid of me losing my cultural values and becoming too ' Western . ' They generally preferred for me to mingle with other Indians . " <p> The most ironic and perhaps frustrating thing in this situation is if the roles were reversed and the White parent were to prevent their child from mixing with non-Whites in order to preserve cultural values -- they would most likely be labelled as racist . <p> However , this desire to socialise only with others of their own race has been defended by an unexpected source . David Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a norm within British society , South Asians are seeing this as ' a threat to the values they hold dear ' . Cameron explains : <p> " Not for the first time , I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life , not the other way around . " <p> Such differences may make British South Asians believe that they are in fact different , and they would rather mingle with those who understand their culture and share common values ; thus choosing to interact solely with other South Asians . <p> It is also common for South Asians who can not identify with White people to make friends with those of different ethnicities . A shared sense of ' otherness ' brings together people from different minority groups . <p> Contrary to the common belief that children are ' colour-blind ' in terms of race , psychological research suggests otherwise . Research shows that children , can in fact , recognise race from a young age , and have the ability to develop racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishable features such as skin colour or difference in accent , it is easy for children to discriminate based on these differences , creating barriers . <p> Parents shoulder a responsibility to discuss discrimination and not brush aside harmful remarks that may be made by their children . Choosing not to discuss race at all may create even more of a barrier and allowing the child to live on in ignorance . <p> Fortunately , the barriers that prevent integration have been highlighted in British media . Documentaries like Make Bradford British ( Channel 4 , 2012 ) have had a positive impact on integration within different ethnic communities . <p> Media aside , various charities including ' Challenge Network ' aims to ' connect and inspire people to strengthen their communities ' . <p> A study carried out with this charity showed that , worryingly enough , people were more likely not to have a best friend at all than to have one from another ethnicity . <p> Fortunately , there are many British South Asians who do integrate with all communities , regardless of race : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier between Asian and non-Asians , so I always fit in better with the Asians as I felt that they understood me more .

We can not say for certain , however with an increasing number of South Asians integrating and associating with those of other ethnicities , and with various charities aiming to eliminate barriers , one can only hope that Britain will have a brighter future ahead .

Yet , it was as a 36-year-old veteran that he enjoyed his best moments with the ball . At Barbados in 1976 , after Andy Roberts , Michael Holding and Bernard Julien had shocked the Indian top order , the veteran leg-spinner ran through the rest of the batting in a space of eight overs and one ball , claiming five for 23 .

West Indies clinched the hard-fought series 2-1 and Holford ended his career by playing a vital role . <p> In his 24 Tests , Holford scored 768 runs at 22.58 and captured 51 wickets at 39.39 . He could perhaps have found a spot in the impoverished West Indian side with the stars roped in to play in Kerry Packer 's World Series Cricket .

The meaning of what he said was manifestly clear : The badly let down people across the nation will throw out the undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Congress destined to suffer an ignominious defeat . Earlier , uncouth and uncultured Jairam Ramesh and manipulator Janardhan Dwivedi had also predicted fall of the Congress and the UPA , but they were snubbed . <p> That the Congress has completely lost people 's confidence became manifestly clear on April 24 , when lakhs and lakhs of jubilant people , cutting across caste , community and political barriers , thronged the streets of Varanasi to have a glimpse of the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandi conducted a road show , sans people , in Lucknow . News channel Aaj Tak , which is biased against the BJP and in favour of anarchist Arvind Kejriwal , rightly described Rahul Gandhi 's road show as " a show of cars " . Indeed , it was wonderful to see " Ganga Putra " Narendra Modi filing his nomination papers on April 25 after garlanding the statues of Madan Mohan Malaviya , Sardar Patel , Swami Vivekananda and Dr BR Ambedkar with Malaviya 's grandson Giridhar Malaviya , noted classical singer and Padma Vibhushan winner Chhandu Lal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epoch-making event and proposing Narendra Modi 's nomination to the prestigious Varanasi Lok Sabha seat . <p> Coming back to the point , it was Farooq Abdullah , a very close ally of AICC president and the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and founder member of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Liberation Front ( JKLF ) , who did some plain-speaking and put things in perspective . In an interview to News X on April 23 , Farooq Abdullah , who in a collaboration with Rajiv Gandhi , rigged the 1987 Assembly elections on an unprecedented scale and forced the general public in the Valley to bring off a coup against India -- not only lambasted Rahul Gandhi for his utter failure to play a pro-active role in politics and the Government , but also explained the circumstances responsible for the decline of the Congress and the UPA .

They have made mistakes ... the country 's ruling alliance might face a defeat in the Lok Sabha election , " crestfallen Farooq Abdullah said . <p> He summed his interview with the observation " it 's all over now " . And remember , he predicted end of the UPA less than 24-hours before the election in the Anantnag ( Kashmir ) Lok Sabha constituency . Farooq Abdullah , in short , candidly admitted that the Congress-led UPA will be booted out of office and the causes of its collapse will be sky-high prices , never ending inflation , mal-administration , corruption on an unprecedented scale , scams and scandals , arrogance and trust-deficit . It is , however , a different story that he , unlike his son and Jammu &amp; Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah , but like the puppet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and all of the Sonia Gandhi 's minions and sycophants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's socio-political scenario .

@@2473231 <p> The Mountain : My time on Everest -- The Irresistible Lure of the World 's Highest Peak . <p> The climbing season at Mount Everest has pretty much been called off after the tragedy of April 18 . Sixteen Sherpa guides were killed in an avalanche , making it the single-most deadly day on the 8,850 ft peak . A range of issues about the climbing arrangements have bubbled up to the surface , all of them relating to the inordinate risks the guides have to take to help climbers summit . Technological advancement in climbing gear and other aids have brought even more visitors to Everest , many of them little more than amateur in their climbing experience , causing a " traffic jam " with the abundance of climbers insisting on the guarantee of summiting on their first attempt , no matter what . There has , for long , been a feeling that this is imposing immense risks on the venture , especially to the guides . However it pans out from here , the Sherpa guides will have to be substantively reassured that their devotion to Everest and their safety will not be compromised , that their concerns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tension currently centres on the amount of compensation for the families of the dead , but it is clear that whatever resolution to the crisis that may be struck in the days ahead will finally put the Sherpa guides at the heart of the Everest story . George Mallory once said , reportedly in exasperation , that that he was obsessed with scaling Everest " because it is there " . Now , the long-overdue reassessment of the Everest story should rehabilitate the Sherpa guides with the tag-line : " because they are there " . <p> The Everest story , so far , got a good and proper airing in the past year , as it 's been 60 years since the first recorded successful summit , by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay . That British expedition of 1953 got a last dash of imperial flair , with the news of its success being reported on the morning of the coronation of Elizabeth II . Jan ( then James ) Morris , the sole reporter covering the expedition , for The Times , had famously devised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONDITIONS BAD ( = summit reached ) ADVANCED BASE ABANDONED ( = Hillary ) AWAITING IMPROVEMENT ( = Tenzing ) ALL WELL ( = nobody hurt ) . " It was a different news era , of course , as Morris recalled in her anthology , A Writer 's World ( 2003 ) . It did n't make front page , because the paper did not carry news on the front page then , and stories did not carry bylines either . <p> In the current context , it is interesting to get a recap of the Everest story from a fascinating new book by Ed Viesturs , an American climber who has climbed all 14 of the world 's peaks higher than 8,000 m , The Mountain : My time on Everest -- The Irresistible Lure of the World 's Highest Peak . He revisits the Mallory expedition of 1922 , when seven Sherpas were killed , and his mate agonised , " Why , oh why , could not one of us Britishers have shared their fate ? " Mallory wrote , " Do you know the sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undone ? " Mallory , of course , subsequently disappeared , and the discovery of his body so many years later is the stuff of " what-if " romanticisation . But valour took on many other forms , including Reinhold Messner 's climb without the use of supplemental oxygen . ( Messner was also the first person to climb all 14 8,000-ers . ) <p> Climbers like Messner have made Everest literature particularly rich , but as Viesturs notes , no other book has shaped public perception as Jon Krakauer 's bestselling Into Thin Air , about the 1996 disaster . It conveyed the scene as serious and casual climbers got caught in a blizzard on May 10-11 , as dilemmas about assisting others versus getting on oneself on a particularly crowded day zeroed in on the ethics of climbing . Viesturs worries that while Krakauer 's account was absolutely authentic , it has left some avoidable stereotypes about the Everest travel phenomenon as a " circus of dilettantes " . His book is an attempt to counter that impression . <p> However , given the circumstances of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a scuffle between Sherpa and foreign climbers , and in a year when Nepal instituted new requirements on climbing teams having local guides and committing to bring back garbage from Everest , the mountain 's particularly able chroniclers must know that there is a fresh book waiting to be written .

Recalling his association with the legendary Ustad Vilayat Khan , he says his music is entirely his guru 's <p> This is perhaps one of the most charming stories from the world of music . It is about two legendary artistes , one a wild and passionate pursuer of music with every stroke spelling brilliance , and the other , a devoted student who took forward the legacy of his great guru with his exceptional artistry . The most fascinating aspect of this guru-shishya duo is that when they met , they both were of the same age -- all of 17 ! Arvind Parikh , one of the greatest living sitarists of the country , recounts this incident that changed the course of his life 70 years ago . He narrates it with a striking warmth that you begin to imagine you were a part of it . <p> " I first saw him first at my friend Subodh 's house in Mumbai , he was in a light-blue kurta with a cigarette in hand , " recalls Arvind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mumbai All India Radio and during that visit had expressed my wish to learn from Vilayat Khan saab to my friend Subodh . He immediately said , ' Want to meet him ? He 's coming home for tea this evening ! ' . " That evening when Arvind Parikh went to Subodh 's house he could hardly believe that another young man of his age was the great maestro he was seeking . " Play for me , " Vilayat Khan saab had said , " and I , who had till then thought that my musicianship was outstanding and of course had to be some Khan , and not a mere Parikh , realised that I had a long journey to undertake . " Khan saab pointed out the shortcomings , nevertheless , he immediately called someone in the AIR and said ' my student is coming for audition ' and of course , Arvind Parikh not only became an auditioned artiste of AIR , but also his disciple which the Ustad himself announced . <p> Coming from a wealthy Gujarathi family of businessmen inclined spiritually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parikh household in Ahmedabad . Arvind Parikh could play several instruments including the violin and flute which he played with considerable competence . In fact , Arvind Parikh 's mother was a painter and a painting teacher used to come home to teach the young Arvind as well . " I created such a masterpiece that my teacher was shocked and stopped teaching me ! " he reminisces laughing . An avid listener of the radio , Arvind Parikh listened to great music by great masters in those days . " I was so inspired by Ustad Vilayat Khan saab 's sitar that something within me said that he had to be my guru and sitar was the instrument I had to pursue . I was also listening to a lot of Pandit Ravi Shankar on the radio but I was drawn more towards Vilayat Khan saab . I feel that these things are shaped more by one 's destiny and there are hardly any logical answers to them ... , " explains Arvind Parikh , who left Ahmedabad and went to Mumbai to pursue music in 1944 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guru-shishya relationship , and also an enduring friendship between the two . Khan saab and Arvind Parikh came from two strikingly different worlds -- the guru from a traditional Muslim family and with the loss of his father fairly early in life , there was no one to support them . Arvind Parikh however , came from the most comfortable circumstances and had hardly been exposed to any difficulty in his life . The young Arvind was shocked to see the " tiny hole " in which Khan saab lived in Colaba . A sari hung as partition and Khan saab 's mother sat behind it . " He was under tremendous emotional , financial and physical stress . He was in such bad shape that he was n't even sure if they could have a cup of tea the next morning , " recounts Arvind Parikh . " I lived in plenty and had no problem spending on him . This gave him emotional comfort and we gradually developed a close bond with each other . " Many people tried to dissuade Arvind Parikh from learning from Khan saab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumriwallah ? " -- but nothing changed between the two . " Even with all the difficulties that life had heaped on him , he was a man of no compromise . Even if he had no penny for tomorrow , he would n't abandon his beliefs . He was a man of principles , and could n't care more for anything else , " speaks Arvind Parikh with reverence towards his guru who refused awards and opportunities , unwilling to put his values on the sacrificial altar . <p> Arvind Parikh became Khan saab 's trusted lieutenant . For 20 years they met each other every single day and spent the evenings together . He shared everything with Arvind Parikh and implicitly believed that he would solve all his problems . In fact , many times he would even ask him what he should play in a concert . " My devotion for him was boundless . With bated breath , I used to stand in the balcony waiting for his bus to come .

He was the centre and would surrender to none except the medium . I was a bhakti margi , I found my music through total surrender . I play Vilayat Khan , but in a different mode . The vidya he has imparted to me has been converted into my music with my gyaan . As far as my music is concerned , he is my only influence , " he says categorically . <p> A rendition , says Arvind Parikh , is like telling a story that has a beginning and unfolds gradually paragraph by paragraph before reaching the end . There has to be bawat ( content ) and tareeka ( expression ) . Without substantial content music is reduced to mere excitement rather than introspection and meditation , he argues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did Arvind Parikh 's interest in musicology develop ? " All India Radio is my first guru . I used to carefully listen and by the age of 12 , I could make notations of all the ensembles that were being played on radio . This , I used to play on my violin . I used to do this so seriously that my swar gyan became perfect . In fact , I still have four books full of notations from those days . " <p> Khan saab 's taalim was no different from the tutelage other masters of those times imparted . It was based on assimilation and no questions were asked . " I would think about every little instruction that my guru gave during the lessons and wonder why he had said so . Gradually , all the techniques and dimensions of his music opened up to me and I wrote a trainer 's manual , " he explains . " However , the manual is useless if your being is not filled with great devotion when you touch the instrument . " The other legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ustad Amir Khan . " He would always say , ' Arvind Bhai , socho bhee ... ' ... While Amir Khan saab believed that riyaz was important , he also stressed on the importance of thinking music .

He insisted that every phrase , sung or played , should have meaning , and the movement of every single note should also have a basis , even when it is coloured by intuition . " Amir Khan was an extraordinary , intense man and musician , " says Arvind Parikh , recalling the time he spent with him . <p> Unlike his guru Vilayat Khan saab , Arvind Parikh loves teaching .

@@2473234 <h> Why is the work of Pulitzer-winning poet Vijay Seshadri so appealing ? <p> ' Who has not felt a little of the despair the son of righteousness now feels/ staring wildly around him ? ... / This is the final illusion , / the one to which all the others lead . ' <p> These lines from Vijay Seshadri 's poem , ' The Long Meadow ' , have stayed with me since I first encountered his work seven years ago -- this image of a gob-smacked Yudhishtira discovering that the morality of the afterlife is just as unfathomable and compromised as the morality of this one . <p> And yet , beside Yudhisthira in this supreme moment of human bewilderment is the faithful mongrel dog that ' shivered and burned with him , /and never abandoned him to his loneliness ' . In an exquisite flash , Seshadri offers us that ancient mythic reminder : that alongside the unanswerable question of dharma is the equally mysterious presence of love . <p> The good thing about awards ( like Seshadri 's Pulitzer ) is that they motivate you to go back to poetry you know you enjoyed , without quite remembering why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 3 Sections that won him the Pulitzer , I was happy to revisit The Disappearances . Published by HarperCollins , India , in 2007 , this comprises his first two books of poems : Wild Kingdom and The Long Meadow . Reading an omnibus is a particularly rewarding experience because it allows you a deep-focus experience of a writer 's work . <p> On this revisit , I found out again what exactly appeals to me about Seshadri 's poetry : the fact that a maturity and breadth of vision is matched by a subtle , non-showy technical capability . This equipoise deepens , for it is in the latter half of the book that Seshadri poses questions about truth , love and morality with a particularly memorable clarity . He employs an interesting mix of fable , epic , news headline and anecdotage , steering dexterously between tones both grave and casual , to ask these questions . Questions about what it means to be the self -- ' you as seen by them , and them as seen by you , / and you as seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine assistance ' , with only the stout companionship of a few . Questions about those age-old archetypes -- ' a boy and his dad ' -- and how to love and heal those ' chemical bonds ' across vast gulfs of time and experience . Questions that can only be asked when one arrives ' at the limit of understanding ' , in those places where ' the myths are somewhere else ' , but there are ' the meanings , / and you have to breathe them in/ until you burn your throat ' . <p> Seshadri once wrote of how it felt to grow up Indian in the American Midwest : ' small , brown , bespectacled , alien and saddled with a name that others thought was unpronounceable ' . That experience of strangeness is at the heart of an evocative prose poem in this book : the fidgeting awkwardness and embarrassment of being ' transfixed ' by an uncomprehending ' Protestant Midwestern ' perception of one 's oddball family . <p> This strangeness , however , does not give way to easy nostalgia or ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dual inheritance -- in terms of content and poetics . The subject of a father psychologically ravaged by the immigrant experience and stripped ' down to his naked soul ' is treated with a mix of rage and tenderness , exasperation and love . Without flattening him into easy specimenhood , Seshadri brings him gently to life with all his personal obsessions and idiosyncrasies . It is not easy to reach ' the naked soul ' , but it is good to read poetry that acknowledges that difficulty . <p> In ' North of Manhattan ' again , a bus-ride downtown turns into a jubilant anthem to velocity , rather than a more predictable poem about urban despair and dislocation . The body that travels at a speed greater than the mind is ' ecstatic in its finitude ' , while the panting mind , lagging far behind , knows it ' will never catch up ' . <p> In an interview , Seshadri once invoked a line from Joyce that resonated with him : ' History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakening to life 's perpetual strangeness -- in the widest sense of the word .

That sanctuary is hard-won , in Seshadri 's poetry as it is in life . And for that very reason its shade is more restorative .

Pallavi Polanki/Firstpost <p> Many see the SP chief 's decision to contest from Azamgarh as a mere ploy to prevent the Yadav vote in Eastern Uttar Pradesh from falling under the influence of Modi , who is contesting from the nearby district of Varanasi . <p> Umairus Siddique Nadvi , a senior research fellow at Azamgarh 's well-known Shibli Academy , says " With the coming of Modi to Banaras , Mulayam Singh wanted to ensure that the Eastern Uttar Pradesh districts that are Yadav strongholds are not influenced by the Modi 's campaign . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . If that slips , the BSP or the BJP can take advantage of it . You see , if he fails to hold on to the Yadav vote , he will also lose the Muslim vote .

Pallavi Polanki/Firstpost <p> Could this election turn out to be an existential test for the Samajwadi Party ? <p> The large Yadav clan -- Mulayam Singh 's brothers , his nephews and son , the chief minister - have descended on Azamgarh backed by the full might of the party machinery to the ensure the party supremo makes it past the post with a respectable margin .

Pallavi Polanki/Firstpost <p> Falahi sees the election in Azamgarh as being a contest between the SP and BSP . " Azamgarh 's Muslims are very angry with Mulayam Singh . But that does n't mean they are happy with Mayawati either . If the graph of the voters who are angry with Mulayam Singh is higher , the BSP will get more votes ... But the general feeling among people is that they would rather vote for a new comer than vote for Mulayam Singh , " says Falahi . <p> Anger against the SP government in Azamgarh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots . It also has to do with the failure of the party to meet the promises it had made to win the Muslim community 's support ahead of the assembly elections . <p> Speaking about one of the two key promises Mulayam Singh had made ahead of the assembly polls , Falahi says , " The manifesto had promised that the youth who have been falsely implicated in terror cases would be released and given compensation and jobs . People were very taken up with this . Even old women who had no interest in politics came out to vote for SP in the hope that their children would be released . But so far not a single youth has been released . The same promises have now been repeated . No one is ready to believe him this time . " <p> Also fresh in the mind of Azamgarh 's Mulsim community is the public pressure that had to be built up before the SP government finally tabled the R D Nimesh Commission report which raised serious doubts about the claims made by the police about the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 . <p> The Nimesh commission had been up by the Mayawati government to inquire into the arrest of Mujahid and Tariq for their alleged involvement in the 2007 UP blasts . <p> A die-hard Mulayam Singh supporter , Nisar Ahmed , a masters student , says no party has done as much for the development of Azamgarh as Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh have . Pallavi Polanki/Firstpost <p> " For 121 days people sat in protest outside the Vidhan Sabha . It was only then that the SP government tabled it . And despite the cabinet accepting the report , no action has been taken so far ... Mulayam Singh only talks about Muslim issues on the streets but he does nothing in places where it matters , in places where laws are made , " says Shafique , a Sanjarpur-based activist . <p> But Sanjarpur also has its share of Samajwadi Party supporters who swear by Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh . Among them are students who 've benefitted from the SP government 's free laptop scheme . <p> Nisar Ahmed , a masters student says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mulayam and Akhilesh . If anyone has laid a brick for the development of Azamgarh , it is the Samajwadi Party . Mulayam has announced an agricultural university in Azamgarh . We gave SP nine seats in assembly . Inshallah , Mulayam will win from Azamgarh . " <p> When asked about SP government 's record of communal riots ( the worst of which was the Muzaffarnagar riots ) and its failure to deliver on his promise of taking action in cases where innocent youth were accused of being terrorists , his supporters say he should be given more time . <p> Mohammad Tariq , a B.com final year student says , " First of all , what happened in Muzaffarnagar is very shameful . And we condemn it . As for his promises , he still has two-and-a-half years to deliver ... In this election the Muslim voter has to look at who can defeat the communal forces . While Guddu Jamali ( BSP candidate ) is a strong candidate , majority of the Muslims are looking at supporting the SP in Azamgarh . " <p> Also playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 election , when a division of the Mulsim vote resulted in a surprise win for the BJP . <p> Retired block development officer Mohammad Rafi says Muslims will gain nothing by being angry at Mulayam Singh and that they should unite to avert a repeat of 2009 . Pallavi Polanki/Firstpost <p> " Modi has made people realise that if we do n't unite , results can go awry like it happened in 2009 . The Ulama Council fielded a candidate , the Muslim vote got divided and the losing candidate won , " says a retired block development officer Mohammad Rafi . <p> Rafi says the anger against the SP government has subsided after Mulayam Singh decided to contest from Azamgarh . <p> " There was anger against Mulayam Singh after the Muzaffarnagar riots .

Since Facebook went public , Morgan Stanley has been involved in 47 technology public offerings with a total value of $23.4 billion . ( JPMorgan Chase is second by dollar value and Goldman Sachs third . ) <p> That does n't count the Alibaba megaoffering scheduled for this summer , which was announced this week . Morgan Stanley is one of five investment banks chosen to underwrite the deal for the company , which operates China 's biggest website and online shopping platform .

@@2498233 <h> Time of return to India impacts tax on overseas salary <p> For an Indian tax resident , worldwide income is taxable in India . For a non-resident , only income accrued in India or received in India is taxable . Therefore , when a resident leaves India for taking up employment abroad or a non-resident returns to India after having completed her employment , it is important that her residential status under Indian tax laws is that of a non-resident for that particular year and for the years in which she is employed outside India , to ensure that her overseas salary is not taxed in India . <p> A person is normally a resident if she has been in India for more than 182 days during the relevant financial year . She is also considered as a resident if she is in India for more than 60 days during the relevant financial year , having also been in India for at least 365 days during the earlier four years . However , an exception has been made for a person leaving India for the purpose of employment outside India , for a member of crew of an Indian ship and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside India , visits India during the year . For such persons , the 60 days period does not apply , but the period of 182 days does . <p> Therefore , a person who leaves India for taking up a job abroad needs to ensure that she is in India for less than 182 days during the year , so that her overseas salary is not taxed in India . There is , however , no benefit of such extended period requirement for a person who quits her overseas job and returns to India for good . Therefore , if a person leaves her overseas job after a few years and returns to India , she needs to ensure that she is in India for less than 60 days during the year , particularly if she has been on visits to India during the preceding four years for extended periods totalling more than 365 days , or has left India within that period of four years by virtue of which her stay during the past four years exceeded 365 days . <p> Of course , if a person has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , been non-resident for at least nine years during the last 10 years or has been in India for less than 730 days during the past seven years , she may qualify for the status of " not ordinarily resident " . In this case , her overseas salary would still not be taxed in India . <p> Also , specific tax treaties may grant certain benefits , by virtue of which , overseas salary may not be taxable in India . <p> The problem faced by returning non-resident employees was brought home in a recent advance ruling . In that case , an Indian citizen was employed with an Indian company from 2002 till 2007 . Her employment was thereafter shifted to a Chinese company of the same group from October 2007 till January 2011 . She returned to India on 12 February 2011 , but her total stay in India ( including earlier visits to India ) during the financial year 2010-11 was for 119 days .

Her husband 's house in India continued to be occupied by tenants , and the taxpayer had been travelling to different locations for holiday and to meet with family , friends and relatives , staying in hotels at different places after her return to India . She had a valid Chinese employment permit till 31 March 2012 , and could take up fresh employment in China , if she so desired . <p> The Authority for Advance Rulings pointed out that the test to be applied was whether the taxpayer had come on a visit to India as a non-resident , and whether she came to India only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it concluded that the taxpayer was not just on a visit to India , particularly as she did not leave India thereafter for any employment . It therefore held that the taxpayer was a resident of India during the relevant year and that the income by way of encashment of stock options received by the taxpayer was taxable in India during the year . <p> The facts of this case show that if the taxpayer had taken a little bit of care in returning to India after a couple of months , in April instead of February , it would have saved her a considerable amount of tax in India and ensured that the hard earned savings from her Chinese employment were not significantly eroded .

What is even more worrisome is that more than a third believe torture can be justified . <p> Amnesty International has reported on torture or other ill-treatment in 141 countries over the past five years . The survey found that support for international rules against torture is weakest in India , Argentina , Mexico , Nigeria and Peru - less than three quarters of people agree that international rules are necessary . <p> And 74% respondents in India ( with China- the highest numbers in any of the countries polled ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain information that may protect the public . <p> Torture is rife across the Asia-Pacific region , with China and North Korea among the worst offenders and a host of other governments betraying promises to stamp it out , Amnesty International said as it launched its latest global campaign , ' StopTorture ' . <p> " Torture is a fact of life in countries across Asia . The problem is n't limited to a few rogue states , but is endemic throughout the region , " said Richard Bennett , Amnesty International 's Asia-Pacific director . <p> " Asian countries must stop paying lip service to theircommitment to end torture . Signing up to the international treaties is important but not enough . It must be backed up with concrete action , " he added . <p> The two-year campaign , ' StopTorture ' , launches with a new media briefing , ' Torture in 2014 : 30 Years of Broken Promises , ' which provides an overview of the use of torture in the world today . <p> " The shocking fact that so many people fear torture- in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities across Asia-Pacific into meaningful action by taking concrete steps to eradicate this horrific human rights violation , " said Bennett . <p> Amnesty International has reported on torture or other forms of ill-treatment in at least 141 countries from every region of the world over the past five years - virtually every country in which it works . <p> In 2014 , thirty years after the UN adopted the 1984 Convention Against Torture - which commits all states parties to combatting the abuse - Amnesty International observed at least 23 Asia-Pacific countries still torturing or ill-treating . Given the secretive nature of the abuse , the true number is likely to be higher . <p> Torture is used by governments against a range of individuals across Asia-Pacific . It is used to force confessions or to silence activists in countries such as China , India , Indonesia , Malaysia Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Viet Nam . Torture is used to extort money in places such as Myanmar and Nepal , where poor and marginalised people are unable to bribe their way out of being tortured . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch found nearly half ( 44% ) of respondents - from 21 countries across every continent - fear they would be at risk of torture if taken into custody in their country . <p> Measures such as the criminalisation of torture in national legislation , opening detention centres to independent monitors , and video recording interrogations have all led to a decrease in the use of torture in those countries taking their commitments under the Convention Against Torture seriously . <p> Very few countries in Asia-Pacific , however , have putin place effective mechanisms to prevent the use of torture , and others are failing to implement the mechanisms properly . <p> Amnesty International has documented various forms of torture and other ill-treatment used in different countries across the Asia Pacific region , ranging from North Korea 's brutal labour camps , to Australia 's off-shore processing centres for asylum seekers , or Japan 's death rows - where prisoners are kept in isolation , sometimes for decades .

Police officers reportedly spun a " wheel of torture " to decide how to torture prisoners . Media coverage led to an internal investigation and some officers being dismissed , but Amnesty International is calling for a thorough and impartial investigation which will lead to the prosecution in court of the officers involved . Most acts of police torture remain unreported and torture survivors continue to suffer in silence . <p> Torture and other ill-treatment are officially illegal in China , but in practice beatings , electrocutions , forced injection of drugs and the denial of medical treatment are regularly used to intimidate and punish dissidents or ordinary criminals . China last year announced the closure of its notorious " Re-education Through Labour " camps , but the change has been mostly cosmetic with authorities simply using new forms of detention to arbitrarily hold and torture dissidents . <p> In Pakistan torture is frequently practiced by police , intelligence services and the army , in particular in the conflict-ridden Tribal Areas or Balochistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights defenders , lawyers and journalists among others .

He registered a complaint with police but no one has been brought to justice for his abduction or torture . <p> Authorities in Sri Lanka still routinely torture detainees . In 2012 at least five people died as a result of torture and police brutality ; Sri Lanka 's National Human Rights Commission registered 86 complaints of torture in the first three months of 2013 alone . The government makes liberal use of a draconian anti-terror law to detain people arbitrarily for long periods . <p> Amnesty International is calling on governments in Asia-Pacific to put in place protective mechanisms to prevent and punish torture - such as impartial medical examinations , prompt access to lawyers and courts , independent checks on places of detention , effective investigations of torture allegations , the prosecution of suspects and proper redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UN Convention against Torture , it is well overdue that governments in Asia Pacific stepped up totheir responsibilities to stop torture .

@@2498236 <h> The heart of Modinomics <p> Having fashioned an election campaign built around governance and the economy , what may one expect on economic policy if Narendra Modi becomes the prime minister of India ? <p> The magnitude of what Modi will be able to do will be directly proportional to how close the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and its allies get to the magic number of 272 , if they do not surpass it . <p> While exit polls suggest a big win for the BJP , they have been known to be off the mark in the past . Let us , then , consider all possible scenarios . <p> If it is a weak government , Modi will most likely spend the first few years in office consolidating politically before venturing forth on more controversial matters . <p> At the very least , though , one can expect administrative reforms that would attempt to speed up the notoriously creaky Delhi bureaucracy , emulating , to the extent possible , the Gujarat model of expeditious project approval . This , coupled with a few headline-grabbing infrastructure projects , should signal to corporate houses and investors -- both domestic and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further , as a leader who will move to the centre from a state , rather than being a Delhi political insider , he will most likely reach out to potential allies amongst chief ministers , rather than attempt the fruitless task of getting ambitious legislation through a fractious Parliament . <p> Modi has already suggested that a politically difficult subject , such as labour law reform , could be handled in such a manner , and there is every reason to believe that this might be a template for handling more contentious items on the economic policy agenda . <p> In other federal states , such as the US or Canada , regions often serve as laboratories for economic policies that may be seen as too radical or unpopular to win ready acceptance at the centre . Success in one region may then invite leaders in other regions to emulate ; by the same token , failed policies will not be attempted elsewhere ; and the best ideas generated in the states may then " trickle up " to the centre in due course . <p> Ironically , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least by his critics within the liberal establishment -- to ride roughshod over India 's democratic institutions , Modi may well execute a greater decentralization of economic ( and other forms of ) policymaking in India . <p> Let us assume , instead , that the exit polls are correct , that Modi and the BJP receive a strong mandate -- an absolute majority , or close . <p> For while Modi has indeed repeatedly invoked the phrase " maximum governance , minimum government " -- which would make a Ronald Reagan or a Margaret Thatcher proud -- he has been careful to avoid going into too much detail on how exactly he would put the mantra to practice . To the contrary , he has even repeated the usual Congress-style platitudes of giving the poor first dibs on the state 's coffers and so forth . <p> Some of this is just sensible electioneering -- after all , there is very little to be gained , and much to be lost , by being too specific in advance of an election win on controversial matters of policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace a liberal economic policy agenda than merely being a shrewd politician . Modi 's instincts are certainly pro-business , but are they pro-free market ? Apart from the four word mantra , there is little to go by . Indeed , unlike the US or the UK , India has lacked , and continues to lack , an intellectual ethos in which a forthright articulation of pro-market policies may find succour . <p> This is where the Reagan and Thatcher analogies so frequently invoked go awry . For while they most certainly pushed against a leftist consensus in their respective countries at the time that they burst onto the scene , each could hark back to an older intellectual and political tradition which put the market first and the state second . <p> And it is not as if they had to go back to Adam Smith for inspiration . The ties were very direct : Thatcher could seek counsel from Friedrich von Hayek and Reagan from Robert Mundell -- and they did , giving them the necessary intellectual foundation to then articulate a case for , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for tax cuts . <p> Modi can certainly seek the advice of Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya , and hopefully he will . But the intellectual mainstream in India remains , alas , so far to the left of centre , that pushing forward major economic reforms is going to remain a tough sell for the time being . <p> The good news is that a pro-business , results-oriented Modi can not possibly be worse for the economy than the outgoing government ; and , freed from the paralysis induced by a dual power structure , may well be a good deal better . <p> In the longer run , in the wake of a Modi victory , the best hope for a more radical reform agenda will be the birth of a new intellectual ecosystem in which centre-right economic thinking will be mainstream and Marxist economics will be on the fringe -- the reverse of today . <p> Vivek Dehejia is a professor of economics at Carleton University in Ottawa , Canada . @ @ @ @ @

It gives us immense tension , makes us sweat , and heartbeats race , but nine out of ten times we emerge victorious . That sigh of relief can not be compared to any other feeling . And we the CSKians , have become immune to this situation . We can tackle heart conditions better than anyone else . And despite all the last minute theatrics , CSK also has the reputation of playing fair , having won the Fly Kingfisher Fair Play award 4 out of 6 times . <p> The Yellow Sea <p> Our coaching staffs consisting of Stephen Fleming , Steve Rixon , Tommy Simsek , Russel Radhakrishnan and Co. has shown how happy a unit we are . And hence , it comes as no surprise why every player looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer a part of the yellow dressing room has left behind some fond memories here . Our eyes too bleed when we watch some of them play in any color apart from yellow . But even if they do so , we always hope they do well wherever they are , for whichever team they play . A CSKian still cheers for Hussey , Bailey , Vijay , Balaji , and the rest of them . <p> We are always proud to say that these players once played for us . Under Dhoni ; Faf , Bravo and Bailey blossomed as captains for their national sides , and we are very proud of them when we see them sport jerseys for their countries . We have appreciated and always given our opponents their due credits when they beat us . We have come out to cheer in large numbers from across the world for every match . <p> Five out of six finals , with two victories and three defeats shows the journey we have had ; both happy and sad . But those are just numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this journey can not be described in mere numbers or words . Every moment for us is an emotion , not just a mere feeling .

Philippines have 126 , Pakistan has 109 and Egypt has 103 shadow businesses to every legally registered business . <p> This is the first time that the number of entrepreneurs operating in the shadow economy has been estimated . <p> As these businesses are not registered it takes them beyond the reach of the law and makes shadow economy entrepreneurs vulnerable to corrupt government officials . <p> The researchers suggest " if India improved the quality of its democratic institutions to match that of Malaysia for example , it could boost its rate of formal economy entrepreneurs by up to 50% , while cutting the rate of entrepreneurs working in the shadow economy by up to a third . This means that the government could benefit from additional revenue such as taxes " . <p> The study says that business activities conducted by informal entrepreneurs can make up more than 80% of the total economic activity in developing countries . <p> Types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small landscaping operations . The UK exhibits the lowest rate of shadow entrepreneurship among the 68 countries surveyed , with a ratio of only one shadow economy entrepreneur to some 30 legally registered businesses . <p> The researchers also found that the quality of economic and political institutions has a substantial effect on entrepreneurs registering their businesses around the world . <p> Professor Autio said " Understanding shadow economy entrepreneurship is incredibly important for developing countries because it is a key factor affecting economic development . We found that government policies could play a big role in helping shadow economy entrepreneurs transition to the formal economy . This is important because shadow economy entrepreneurs are less likely to innovate , accumulate capital and invest in the economy , which hampers economic growth . " <p> The researchers suggest that shadow entrepreneurs are highly sensitive to the quality of political and economic institutions . <p> Where proper economic and political frameworks are in place , individuals are more likely to become ' formal ' entrepreneurs and register their business , because doing so enables them to take advantage of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation . <p> The study said " We investigated the influence of economic and political institutions on the prevalence rate of formal and informal entrepreneurship across 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region during the period 2001-2010 . We found the quality of institutions to exercise a substantial influence on both formal and informal entrepreneurship . One standard-deviation increase in the quality of economic and political institutions could double the rates of formal entrepreneurship and halve the rates of informal entrepreneurship . The two types of institutions had a complementary effect on driving entry into formal entrepreneurship , whereas only direct effects were observed for informal entry . Institutions exercise an important influence on individual and firm-level strategic choice , and consequently on the type and form of the resulting economic activity such as entrepreneurship " . <p> Informal entrepreneurs trade legal products and services , yet do not apply for business registration or file any incorporation documents with government authorities . The phenomenon of informal entrepreneurship is seen as a potential driver of job growth and economic development , especially in developing countries . <p> A recent survey by ILO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , approximately 40 % of non-agriculture employment across 39 low and middle-income countries . The informal sector accounts for close to half of all non-agricultural employment in Sub-Saharan Africa , 51 % in Latin America and Caribbean region , and the highest rates , 58 % , are observed in South and East Asia . <p> A large share of these would qualify as informal entrepreneurs . Informal entrepreneurship also speaks to another important issue for less developed countries , that of poverty . Nearly 1.3 billion people remain in extreme poverty ( defined as a daily income of less than $1.25 ) , many of which live in Asia and the Pacific region . <p> The Imperial researchers said " In this study , we argue that informal sector entrepreneurship , poverty , and inequality are conditioned by a country 's economic and political institutions . Non-inclusive political and economic institutions can engender and perpetuate inequality and aggravate poverty . The institutional qualities of a society and its economy -- such as economic freedom , the presence of policies that condition the operation of private sector , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bureaucratic system -- play an important role in either facilitating or inhibiting economic growth and alleviating poverty " . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

The Delhi University in a controversial move that was widely criticised dropped Ramanujan 's essay from the History ( Honours ) syllabus in 2011 . <p> But before Batra began to successfully take on scholars of international repute , his focus was largely on NCERT school text books . <p> " As far as NCERT is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Batra , who in 2006 had filed a PIL in Delhi High Court raising objection to specific passages in history textbooks . <p> " There were 75 passages that were misinterpretations and defamatory .

He says he has already met the HRD minister and put forward his suggestions to the ministry . <p> " We have already met the HRD Minister .

In today 's world , the sheer variety of tyres you can buy depending on what their specialist applications are is long and varied . One can easily walk into a dealership today and replace your manufacturer provided tyres for a set of high performance ones that can completely change the way your car looks or performs on the road . <p> Basically the tyres are divided into Standard and Premium categories . Premium category is further divided into Sporty and Touring category . In the premium category , some special construction types are available i.e. High Speed Tyres and Run Flat tyres . In the Touring category , Eco-Friendly tyres are available . For SUV and MUV , a different classification is available . Depending on percentage of On/Off usage , categories available are A/T ( All Terrain ) , H/T ( Highway terrain ) , and H/L or H/P ( Highway Luxury/ Highway Performance ) <p> Here is a list of tyres you can buy to get the best out of your car . <p> Standard tyres : Also known as Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OE fitted tyres you get with the car . Same specification tyres are also available in aftermarket . These are the tyres to go for if you are satisfied with your current tyre performance and your expectations from tyres are not very demanding . Since these are tested and approved by OE manufacturers , most of the performance parameters are optimized for general usage . These tyres generally do not tax your pockets as much as premium tyres ! <p> Touring tyres : Comfort is the main emphasis of these tyres . Comfort not only stands for driving comfort ( Less vibrations ) , but also lower noise levels . Such premium tyres are usually preferred by people using premium cars mainly for going to office or travelling with the family . The tread patterns of Touring tyres are less aggressive than Sporty tyres and have certain design features on tread which create lesser noise . Top category within Touring tyres may have asymmetric patterns and may be even asymmetric construction varying between " Outer " and " Inner " Sides . <p> Sporty tyres : Also known as Performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of a vehicle are called performance tyres . Made of softer tread compound rubber , they are designed to give maximum grip at high speeds especially during dry and wet weather conditions . Most sports cars come fitted standard with these superior performance tyres to improve their handling and cornering ability . These tyres are also available in the aftermarket for drivers who want better handling and performance from their vehicles . In fact , for people who use their vehicle in tarmac based motorsport applications , a sporty tyre is the cheapest and most preferred way to cut down on lap times . These tyres usually come with aggressive tread patterns than standard and touring tyres , which make them a bit noisy at high speeds . <p> High Speed tyres : High speed tyres are available in Touring and Sporty patterns Their construction is more durable that can resist high temperatures due to high-speed rolling resistance and deal with strong G forces under hard cornering . Manufacturers often use their findings from motorsport applications to make these high performance tyres for road use . One can often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercars and coupes that are capable of higher speeds than a standard family sedan . <p> One must remember though that although the technology exists for tyres to achieve speeds well above 300kmph , fitting such tyres in your average hatchback is pointless . Due to price constraints in new cars , one will often find manufacturers providing tyres that are capable of handling speeds slightly higher than what that particular car can achieve . <p> Here is a chart denoting tyre speed ratings commonly available in India : <p> Speed Symbol <p> Max speed ( Kmph ) <p> Category <p> Q <p> 160 <p> Available in MUV tyres <p> S <p> 180 <p> Available in standard tyres <p> T <p> 190 <p> H <p> 210 <p> Speeds of H &amp; above are considered high speeds <p> V <p> 240 <p> W <p> 270 <p> Available in Premium category tyres and premium/ luxury imported cars <p> Y <p> 300 <p> Eco-friendly Tyres : It 's not just automobiles that have kept pace with the times and increased environmental pressures to become environment friendly .

Low rolling resistance , as the name suggests , is achieved by reducing friction losses in the compounding . <p> Currently the Eco-friendly tyres use silica to a tyre compound which allows tyre makers to make low-rolling resistance tyres with adequate grip . Tyre manufacturers have also looked at optimising design , contour , compound and tread pattern , and took a completely new approach to all four components of the tyre to achieve both fuel efficiency and optimum grip . <p> In India , fuel expense per year is several times that of expense on tyres . Therefore savings through Eco-friendly tyres are much higher than the premium paid for these tyres . <p> Run Flat tyres : Run flat tyres are available in premium category ( Both in Touring and Sporty types ) They are designed to minimise loss of handling of a vehicle after a tyre puncture has occurred .

Loss of air pressure in a tyre also increases friction and heats up the tyre , therefore , heat resistant rubber is used to construct a run flat tyre to reduce heat build-up in case of a puncture . On normal tyres , the air pressure inside the tyre keeps the tyre bead in place on wheel rim flange . The beads of Run flat tyres are designed to keep the tyre them in place on the wheel rim flange even while there is no air pressure inside the tyre . <p> Although run flat tyres with their added stiffness can usually end up improving a car 's dynamic properties , they work best in countries with better road conditions .

Spelling out the goal lets you choose the most appropriate asset mix for achieving it . If you have more than 10 years , the asset mix should be heavily tilted towards equities ( 70:30 ) as the time frame allows you to take more risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , debt investments should form the major chunk of the portfolio . <p> 2 . Increase SIP amount every year : Although SIPs help you invest regularly , it does not mean you should keep the amount fixed over the entire tenure . As your income rises , your savings must also go up . This means you can target larger goals even though your current income does not allow big investments . For example , if you require a corpus of Rs 25 lakh after 10 years with 12% returns , you would need to invest Rs 11,000 every month , but if you increase the contribution by 10% each year , you would only need to invest Rs 8,000 in the first year . <p> The step-up SIP can have a dramatic effect on your longterm savings . As the graphic shows , even a 10% increase in the SIP amount can give you a 45% bigger nest egg . This is why the Provident Fund , which links the monthly contribution to the basic salary of the member , is so effective as a retirement savings tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . One , you reach your goal faster if the amount you need is fixed . You may have targeted to save Rs 20 lakh for your child 's education in 10 years , but increasing the SIP amount would help you achieve it in just nine years . Besides , if you raise the SIP amount , it will prevent you from blowing away the money if your income goes up . " It will automatically prevent you from indulging in excessive spending , " says Chauhan . <p> The surplus savings need not be directed to an SIP in another scheme . Instead , one can simply increase the existing SIPs . Having separate SIPs for different goals does not mean that you invest in different funds . For some goals , you may invest separately in the same set of equity funds . If you have 4-5 different goals , you can plan for them using the same set of equity funds . " It is better to invest in a limited number of funds , " says Sumeet Vaid , CEO , Freedom Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new investors who do n't have a high income . Many get intimidated by the huge savings required for certain goals , such as buying a house or retirement planning . Instead of losing heart , they should start saving small amounts and then scale up as their income goes up . <p> Suppose you need to invest Rs 10,000 a month for a certain financial goal . If your current income does not permit that right now , do n't junk the plan altogether . Start with Rs 5,000 now and gradually increase it by Rs 500-1,000 a year as per your convenience . " A step-up approach can be used to gradually start moving towards your desired goal with whatever savings you have at the time , " says Bala . <p> 3 . Stagger the SIPs to avoid bunching : Fund houses have specific dates on which SIP investments are made . <p> Whether you are planning an SIP through the same set of funds , or different funds for each goal , it would be wise to stagger each investment across different dates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spread them in a way that each SIP is made on a different date of the month . <p> This allows you to retain some liquidity in your savings account since the money does not flow out at one go . The bigger advantage is that you reduce the risk of market timing because the money gets invested on different days , negating any adverse market movements in the interim . If you are adding to an existing SIP , while giving a fresh mandate for the additional investment , you can specify any other date of the month on which the SIP instalment has to be paid out . <p> Having said that , the SIP mode is supposed to make life simpler for the investor . However , some variants of SIPs defeat the purpose . For instance , the Value Investment Plan offered by some fund houses keep varying the SIP amount on the basis of the returns the fund has generated . If the fund does well in a particular period , the next SIP is lower because the corpus is already bigger than planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to account for the shortfall . Such investments only complicate things for the investor and should be avoided . Only extremely sophisticated investors should go for these plans . <p> Then there are fortnightly , weekly and daily SIPs as well . <p> We calculated the returns for several options in the past five years and found that there was no significant difference . The daily SIP is very cumbersome . The monthly option is the best because it coincides with the income flow of the salaried person . The quarterly SIP has done well , but its returns are very volatile . Also , it will entail a lump-sum payment s equal to three monthly SIPs . <p> 4 . When to review your SIPs : Even the best laid plans can sometimes go awry . This holds true for y SIPs as well . You may have chosen the best fund , but there s is no guarantee that it will keep performing well . Similarly , an unexpected turn of e events could upset your calculations . " A yearly review of s your portfolio will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strayed from the path , you can make timely changes that will ensure you e get back on track , " says Bala . <p> Here 's how to go about it . First , check whether your asset allocation is in synch with your original asset mix . If the portfolio is skewed towards a e particular asset class , you t need to rebalance it . Next , check the corpus accumulated against each goal to see if you are on track . Compare the performance of your funds against the return assumed at the time of investment . " If the , fund you invested in has generated less than the assumed return , you might be falling short of your desired target , " cautions Chauhan . If the underperformance is because the broader market is in slump , then all you need to do is rebalance the portfolio . If the fund itself is underperforming , then it is a red flag and you should switch to a better fund . <p> Ending an SIP is almost as important as starting it . Continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At some point , you will have to get out . How do you decide when to stop ? If you are not investing for a specific goal , this decision wo n't be easy . But if you have certain target in mind , you can end the SIP as the goal draws near . If the goal has been reached before time , it is advisable to shift the money out to a stable option . Exposing it to the market 's vagaries for the remaining tenure will not be a wise move . " Where the money requirement is for a bullet payment like a wedding expense , you must ensure that you set aside the amount much before the goal dead line , " says Raghvendra Nath , managing director , Ladderup Wealth Management . <p> On the other hand , if you have not managed to save the required amount , you may need to consider whether you wish to continue with the same SIP . If it is not performing in line with its peers , you may have to switch to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

They have served as incredible role models for me . My oldest sister graduated from Fuqua in 2004 and has since become a partner at PWC . She is now a working mother of two and has not slowed down in her personal and professional aspirations . <p> My middle sister , also a mother of two , is a partner at Altius Associates , the private equity firm .

" How often have you walked into a shop , tried on clothes , and thought , " If I could just change this one thing about the outfit , it would look perfect " ? Similar experiences led 24-year-old Jennifer Mehta to start Je Couturier , to offer women clothes customised based on their taste and comfort . " I was always extremely thin and found it difficult to get the right fit . The few that fit were expensive . So I 'd cut off sleeves or tweak clothes to suit my body . Eventually , my parents bought me a sewing machine and by the time I was 18 , I was making outfits for myself .

I use colours , styling and combine image consulting tools with design to give clients height , a powerful presence or anything else they require . " She does n't sell Indian wear , but for her bridal package , she conceptualises the outfits and gets them made with her specifications .

With an enormous snake on the loose , can they come out alive ? <p> Movie Review : Four kids go missing in a zoo . There is a gargantuan snake on the loose inside the grounds . The kids are speech and hearing impaired and so finding them is doubly difficult . Meanwhile , there 's a media circus outside the place . With a plot like this , all we expect is a tense thriller ( with a bit of satire and dry humour ) but Enna Satham Intha Neram is tone-deaf . Rather than be a thriller , it wants to be a comedy ( hey , after all , that 's the trend , right ? ) and what we get is a dumb film that passes silliness for comedy and implausibility for thrills . <p> One scene in particular highlights everything that is wrong with this film . We are told that the kids might try to find a way out by climbing over an electric fence . So , the zoo keeper and the kid 's school teacher rush to turn off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids climbing the wall . This is the Jurassic Park moment of the film and we must be experiencing nail-biting tension . But the scene is so insipidly written and staged that the moment barely makes any impact . <p> The characters are as inept as the writing -- incompetent zoo keepers , incompetent cops , incompetent school staff , and , yes , even an incompetent snake that can not kill a prey even if it stands before it ! Some of the characters are also major irritants as well -- a TV news journalist who will never be let within a mile of a mike , a zoo keeper who cracks the blandest PJs when he is supposed to be searching for the children ( Poor Nithin Sathyaa is made to do things that you normally associate with Premgi Amaren ) . <p> In fact , no adult character is serious about finding the kids . Right till the climax , instead of actually doing something , everyone keeps talking about mundane matters -- the journalist talks about the impending divorce of the kids ' parents , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , a Blue Cross official tells the cops not to harm the snake , the zoo keeper and the school teacher fight over sleeping tablets ... It would have been better if the snake had swallowed one of these annoying characters . <p> The only sensible beings in the film are the kids themselves , and they seem more than capable of taking care of themselves , despite their age and disabilities -- when one of them falls in a pit , they rescue her all by themselves , intelligently signal their location with balloons , and even use the tab that they have to find their way out of the place . And , it is only for them that you even endure the film . <p> TRIVIA <p> 1 . The fours kids acted in the film were real life quadruplets while many think it is a gimmick <p> 2 .

Prices of fruit grew by 23.17 per cent , along with all vegetables ( 15.27 per cent ) , milk products ( 11.28 per cent ) and eggs , meat and fish ( 10.11 per cent ) . However , in June overall food inflation fell to 7.9 per cent . But that 's hardly a solace ; with 90 per cent of India all set to have deficient monsoon , the threat of food shortage is alive and kicking . <p> India is the top producer of milk , pulses , livestock , fisheries and poultry , and the second largest producer of fruit , vegetables , rice , wheat and sugarcane .

This legislation empowers the Government to declare any commodity as essential and impose stocking limits , which creates uncertainty in the market . <p> There 's another problem . The Agricultural Produce Market Committee ( APMC ) Act mandates the purchase and sale of agricultural commodities in government-regulated mandis . The journey of a commodity from farm to fork involves multiple levels of transportation and handling expenses , agents ' commission and mandi taxes -- all jacking up the final price of the farm produce by up to 20 per cent . <p> Also , anywhere between 5 per cent to 40 per cent of food is wasted depending upon the perishability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price is suppressed while retail price is inflated .

This discourages the production of non-cereal food items even if the demand for them is rising at a faster rate than that for cereals . <p> Further , the way food is stocked is also an issue .

In case of rice it is Rs. ? 20 and ? 32.30 , respectively . <p> Input subsidy <p> Public expenditure on agriculture is 25 per cent of the agri GDP -- which is quite high , yet farm productivity remains abysmally low for most crops . For example , per hectare yield for rice , wheat and onion are 2.4 , 3.1 and 14.2 tonne compared to 4.7 , 5.0 and 22 tonne respectively , in China .

The Government has banned or suspended futures trading in various commodities since 2003 . Data show that non-traded agricultural commodities have witnessed greater price fluctuation than the traded ones . For example , vegetables prices rose 40.2 per cent in FY14 and accounted for one-tenth of the increase in the Wholesale Price Index -- rice rose 16.5 per cent , moong 14 per cent and masur 12 per cent in FY14 .

@@2650230 <p> Zia Haider Rahman was born in rural Bangladesh . He moved to the United Kingdom before his sixth birthday and was raised in a derelict squat before moving to state housing . His father was a waiter ; his mother a seamstress . Zia won a scholarship to read mathematics at Balliol College , Oxford , and completed graduate studies at Cambridge , Munich and Yale universities . After working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs on Wall Street , he turned to practising as an international financial lawyer before moving to human rights work . Rahman 's recently released debut novel In the Light of What we Know has been hailed as a masterpiece . Excerpts from an interview : <p> How much time did it take from manuscript to printed book ? <p> Many of the ideas and images in this novel have been percolating for a long time . The first draft was about the same in length as the final one , as I recall . Before I began revising , my editor made suggestions conceding that those comments might actually increase the length of the novel by ten per cent . In the end , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count did not change much between the first draft and what is there now in the printed book . From final manuscript to printed book , it took about three to four months . <p> How many notebooks did you maintain to create this ? <p> As a matter of routine , I have always kept notebooks , jotting down ideas and things of interest . I used to try to keep track of them . While writing the novel , my note-taking activity increased hugely . The research was done in various places . Some of it was done on the internet . The libraries I used were the British Library in London , the New York Public Library and the library of a small town in upstate New York , near Yaddo ( a foundation for writers , artists and composers , where I wrote most of the novel ) . <p> Who are the authors and writing styles/traditions that have influenced you ? <p> Over the years , many books and authors have had an emotional impact on me , although whether and how they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . To name a few : Dostoyevsky 's The Brothers Karamazov , Marquez 's One Hundred Years of Solitude , Dorothy Allison 's Bastard out of Carolina , Thomas Mann 's Doctor Faustus , David Adams Richards ' Mercy Among the Children , Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children , Sylvia Plath 's The Bell Jar , Sebald 's Austerlitz , many of Philip Roth 's novels and Coetzee 's , James Baldwin 's . Writing is really an interruption of reading and vice-versa . <p> You have a lot of epigraphs in the novel but they seem to be used in an unusual way . What is their purpose ? <p> Ordinarily in novels , epigraphs are evidence of the writer peeking in from behind the curtain ; here , the narrator has actively included them after retrieving them -- or most of them -- from Zafar 's notebooks , as he himself explains . The epigraphs actually do a job of storytelling . Described in this way here -- and not encountered in the course of reading -- it might seem like the assignment of epigraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention of the novel . <p> At a time when it is easy to Google for information , why did you introduce extensive footnotes in the text ? <p> The narrator himself does precisely that -- goes to Internet search engines in order to look things up . The narrator simply does n't want to omit something that Zafar said or wrote and yet can not justify to himself the inclusion of the material in the main body of text . The footnotes -- their presence , form and the kind of material they include -- are an example of what emerges from the first person perspective here . In a third person narration , they might not have emerged in a necessary way . <p> Mathematics is fundamental to my outlook on very many things and in ways that I can not easily measure . In my formative years it was everything to me , the single place of beauty in my life , and of breathtaking beauty at that . The mathematical tilt remains basic to my epistemological perspective , my insistence on reasons for a claim -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathematics gave me that . <p> The analogy between cartography and translation is a fascinating concept on the art of representation via illustrations and word . How do you view your novel in the light of this theory ? <p> In the novel , the narrator relates Zafar 's observations on one underlying similarity between map projections and the translation of poetry . Both involve choices about what to preserve and what to let go . Moreover -- and this is crucial -- in both cases , a decision to preserve one thing limits , or even destroys , the freedom to preserve others . The similarity of the two enterprises speaks to the pervasiveness of an underlying point : in order to gain access to the world , we undertake an activity of representing it that necessarily involves destruction . There are several themes in the novel but its backbone is to do with the status and nature and limits of knowledge . <p> Would you say that In the Light of What We Know explores the concept of a " global or an immigrant " novel ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York a few years ago and discovering that under fiction they had an " Asian writers " section , as well as other ethnically or regionally defined categories . This sort of arrangement is not uncommon . The geographic and cultural categories into which novels are placed , often because of an identity assigned by people other than the author , is driven by a market that has become habituated to conceiving of literature in terms of these categories . The root of the problem is a word : novel . The novel is such an expansive menagerie , holding such varied beasts , that a taxonomy is inevitable because it is useful . But the expansiveness of the idea of a novel gives rise to all manner of problems . <p> Whereas in your novel there are many epigraphs drawing the reader 's attention to the Bangladeshi women raped during conflict . Please comment . <p> What is there to say that has n't been said already ? Tahmima Anam , the distinguished Bangladeshi novelist , has written evocatively about the plight of the Birangonas . But one finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suffering that these women have been through at the hands of Pakistani soldiers and Bangladeshi collaborators is stomach-churning . But it galls me to think that after rape and violence during the war many of them returned to communities that turned their backs on them . <p> How would you identify yourself -- by country of origin or domicile or a bit of both like Zafar who is perceived as " Anglo-Bangla " ? <p> I am often asked where I 'm from -- in Europe , mainly because of my skin color , and in the US , mainly because of my British accent . I know that this is the case because in the US when I say that I was born in Bangladesh , nine times out of ten , an American probes further to get an explanation of the accent . But if , instead , I tell Americans that I grew up in the UK , there seem to be no further questions . I have long sought a sense of belonging to a place , something lacking in my psyche . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it keeps one a little removed from things , which is a helpful vantage from which to observe .

@@2650235 <h> Fault(y) Lines of Poverty <p> EMAIL <p> PRINT <p> COMMENTS <p> ( Sonia Singh is the Editorial Director , NDTV ) <p> As a mother of young kids , I find myself listening to this catchy song from ' The Jungle Book ' all the time , sage advice from a Bear ... " Look for the bare necessities , the simple bare necessities , forget about the trouble and the strife . " Like all seemingly simple homilies , however , cracking this basic equation for India 's policymakers is today the single biggest challenge we face as a nation , increasingly hurtling towards an unsustainable divide between two Indias . <p> Given the total amount of money spent by the Government of India on social welfare schemes ( an allocation of 3,38,408 crores in the new General Budget alone ) today , we are still in a situation where three in every 10 Indians are poor , or one-third of our urban population lives on less than Rs 47 a day according to a new report on measuring poverty by D C Rangarajan , former Chief Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister . A global UN report released this week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poor , it says , lives in India , the highest number of extremely poor people in the world . <p> Yet , our single-minded focus on POVERTY as the most crippling problem facing India 's growth today is diverted by theoretical debates every time a new poverty line figure is mooted by a high-level committee . The latest from Dr C Rangarajan ( someone who 's had his hands full determining both poverty figures and gas pricing formulas , ironically ) says the cut-off for a family to be considered poor is Rs 4860 per month in rural areas and Rs 7065 per household in urban areas . This new figure , in one fell swoop , changes the number of people considered poor in India from nearly 270 million according to the Tendulkar committee to 363 million according to Dr Rangarajan 's commitee . That 's nearly a 100 million people 's lives impacted in terms of whether they are eligible for old age pensions , Indira Awas Yojnas , free beds in hospital etc just by a more realistic look at what poverty means . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge human cost of exclusion of so many people had been discounted , you hear not a murmur of protest from people who have now been ' elevated ' to a poor status virtually overnight , precisely because these numbers matter so little to their daily lives . <p> So , why exactly do we need a poverty line at all , especially when the world 's largest food security scheme , India 's Right to Food actually IGNORES this statistic . The act passed by Parliament makes it clear that 75 per cent of rural households and fifty per cent of urban households must have access to subsidised food , a fact which seems to contradict the government 's own numbers on how many people in India are actually poor . The Rangarajan report sheds some clarity on the thinking behind this poverty line , while admitting its limitations . He says , " Nevertheless , there is need for a measure of poverty . Only then , it will be possible to evaluate how the economy is performing in terms of providing a certain minimum standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , important policy implications . " <p> Yet , it 's exactly because this is so crucial in terms of policy , that determining a poverty line as an aggregation of numbers based on consumption , spending patterns etc and not as a measure of human dignity is deeply flawed . <p> For instance , the poverty line places too much emphasis on the PERSONAL spending of an individual or a family unit , what it does n't factor in is the cost paid for the failure of public services which are meant to be free . So , the assumption is that a person below the poverty line will have access to free health services when the reality is the heaviest financial burden for a poor family is usually health related . Poor people are being forced to pay for private health services precisely because the state is failing them in this area , yet this and expenses on , say , education are not being factored in , to determine how much a family actually needs to live an extremely basic existence . <p> Another crucial aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of poverty are the human and social implications of poverty . A poor person , especially in urban India , does n't exist in a world filled with other people living on Rs 42 a day or even people near his level of income . He works , interacts , co-exists with people for whom his monthly income can be equivalent to a restaurant bill for one meal . Incomes may well be on the rise but statistics show that the divide between the poor and the middle class in India ( forget the super rich ) is also growing at a higher rate . As Professor Amartya Sen puts it , " Our vision of India can not be one that is half California , half sub-Saharan Africa . " On the NDTV Dialogues this week , Professor Abhijeet Banerjee , author of ' Poor Economics ' stated his case even more forcefully , saying its " ... this process of growing exclusion which is leading to volatile processes , the outcome of which is playing out even in the recent rash of rapes . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exclusion Report points out that a child ragpicker in Delhi can earn up to Rs 150 a day which would make him enormously wealthy as per this poverty line , yet it has no value because it ca n't get him a roof over his head or admission to a school . <p> So , are we in this debate actually addressing the key question - how much is enough for every Indian citizen to live a life where at least the bare necessities are taken care of ? The McKinsey Global Institute in a recent report uses a completely different model , the " empowerment line , " which has eight basic criterion including food , healthcare , energy , housing , clean drinking water , sanitation , education , and social security . Is this a more workable one for India to adopt ? By ' underreporting ' the poor , do government committees and planning mandarins actually do the country a larger disservice ? Do we also , by adhering to textbook definitions , confine ourselves to textbook solutions without the political will to actually reboot our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of Bangladesh 's Grameen Bank has said , " Poverty is the absence of all human rights . The frustrations , hostility and anger generated by abject poverty can not sustain peace in any society . " <p> Being poor is not an individual affliction , it 's India 's affliction . The poor can not be wished away by rolling up a car window and meeting the challenge to provide every Indian a life of basic dignity . A life where at least the bare necessities are available is what will eventually be the litmus test of us as a society , as one nation . <p> Disclaimer : The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author .

After Murali Vijay fell for 146 and Matt Prior was wrongly given out , the much hyped DRS is in the news once again . <h> When did it all begin ? <p> A controversy stricken India 's tour to Australia in 2007-08 saw almost 11 decisions go against the tourists in the 2nd Test in Sydney , leading to a backlash from the BCCI accusing the Aussies of playing against the spirit of the game and the umpires of being biased towards the hosts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Bucknor and it forced the ICC to introduce the DRS . <p> The DRS or Decision Review System was launched in 2008 by ICC with the aim of reviewing decisions which seem inconclusive to the on-field umpires in case of whether a batsman has been wrongly adjudged out or not . The system was first tested in an India vs Sri Lanka game in 2008 and officially launched on 24 November 2009 during the first Test match between New Zealand and Pakistan in Dunedin . <p> Advertisement <p> The system was initially made compulsory in all international matches , But later ICC changed its stance and made it optional , stating that the the system would be in use only if both teams agreed . <h> How does the DRS work ? <p> 3 parts constitute the DRS : <p> 1 . The Hawk Eye is the ball tracking technology that tracks the journey of a ball after delivery and can determine if it will hit the wicket or not . <p> 2 . Hot Spot -- This system uses infra red imaging and illuminates where the ball has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot spot 's success rate is found to be 90-95% and has helped the umpires to find out if the ball nicked the bat or gloves on the way to the fielder . <p> 3 . The Snickometer relies on microphones to detect small sounds made as the ball hits the bat or pad . The Snickometer was suspended in 2010 , but reintroduced last year . <p> If a decision has been given in regards to whether a batsman has been dismissed or not , and the players oppose that decision , the fielding team or the batsman in question may choose to challenge the umpire 's call and refer it to the third umpire . He does so by signalling a " T " with his hands . After a number of replays have been seen by the TV umpire , he conveys his views to the on-field umpires , reporting whether he is in favour of the call or contradicts it . If an umpire is unsure after taking into account the various replays , the original decision as given by the on-field umpire stands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the players . <p> Each team can make 2 unsuccessful reviews every 80 overs of a Test innings and have the luxury of 1 unsuccessful review in an ODI innings . However what is to be noted is that errors while viewing the replay is common . A wrong delivery may be played or the organisers might not have reset the system , as happened with Jonathan Trott in the Ashes at Trent Bridge , which can ultimately impact the outcome of the game . <h> The Criticism and the dubious decisions <p> Often a howler can change the complexion of the game , like in the Sydney Test , where India could have saved the match , if not for the errors . The DRS was introduced to bring about a change in the way cricket is played by eradicating these umpiring errors , making the game a fair contest for both the sides . <p> The players and coaches have generally given a positive feedback to this system since its launch , with the ICC sure that technology is the way ahead . However there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest critic as it believes the system is not 100% accurate . Also , the cost of using the system in every match takes a toll on the host nations with almost USD 60,000 spent per match . This has led to various vociferous protests from member boards who have criticized the ICC for coming up with such technology as the money is not going from its " coffers " , but rather from their own purse . <p> The Indian board so far has questioned the unreliability of the ball tracking system or the hawk eye . Initially when a not out LBW was reviewed , and if the ball was 2.5m away from the wicket , the batsman was adjudged not out as it was argued that since the ball has 40 cms more to travel before hitting the wickets , it ca n't be deciphered accurately if it actually would have hit the wickets or not because of the batsman 's long stride out . <p> During the 2011 WC match in Bangalore , England 's Ian Bell was adjudged not out by umpire Billy Bowden after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhoni referred it to the third umpire where replays suggested that Bell had been struck in line and the ball was going on to hit the stumps . However as he was 2.5 metres down the pitch and was declared not out . The match ended in a tie , with Dhoni voicing his displeasure at the decision . <p> Indian skipper MS Dhoni calls for a review of the decision in 2011 World Cup <p> The ICC , tweaked the rules in the middle of the World Cup after it earned BCCI 's wrath and issued fresh guidelines to match officials that even though the distance between the stumps and the point of impact be 2.5 metre or greater , on-field umpires can reverse not out LBW decisions.This did not go down too well with Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara who had accused the ICC of bowing to the demands of the BCCI , despite the rules being laid down well before the tournmaent started . <p> Niranjan Shah , a BCCI heavy weight , explained why BCCI is against the system and argued that the limited number of reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausts its options in the first over , the team has to live without the system for the whole match . If the system is n't available , what is the use ? " <p> An incident occurred in the first Ashes Test in Trent Bridge last year when Stuart Broad 's edge carried to the slip via Brad Haddins but the umpire gave it not out . As Australia had no reviews remaining , Broad stuck to his crease , and scored a crucial knock to hand England a 14-run victory . <p> There have been cases where despite the batsman not nicking the ball with his bat , the TV umpire has adjudged him out if the Snickometer reveals a sound , which can be of the ball brushing against his pad or glove as it zooms to the keeper . The system had came under scrutiny on the second day of the third Ashes Test Down Under when in Perth , Joe Root was given out caught behind when all the technology suggested the ball did not touch his bat . Umpire Marais Erasmus put up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not nicked it . The much-criticised HotSpot showed no sign of an edge while the snickometer proved that the noise occurred after the ball had passed the bat , but still he was still sent back to the pavilion . <p> Warren Brennan , the inventor of the hotspot has a cure for the unreliability of the technology by advising cricketers to stop using all tapes around the bat . To this , Ravi Shastri argues that " is it the job of cricket to make the technology work better or the other way round ? " <p> The DRS has has a life changing impact on the umpires too , with their attitude in the game being questioned . Often they reason that if they make a wrong decision , the reviews will over turn it , not realizing as Dickie Bird states that " No matter what the technology , umpires will be the best judges of a decision . " <p> With a large scrutiny now reserved for them , the DRS has taken a huge toll on the umpires . Tony Hill was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the DRS in the Ashes Series in 2013 . In order to reduce their stress , the ICC has banned the replays to be screened at the ground . <p> With only 28% reviews successful at the World Cup in 2011 , it is high time the ICC reward these umpires with their rights once again until they come up with a foolproof system . The intent of the ICC to make cricket devoid of any errors is on the right path . They can take a leaf out of FIFA 's book who introduced the Goalline Technology in the World Cup after trying it out for months at the grassroot level . <p> Till that happens , we can prepare ourselves to watch cricket with all its human mistakes , which is what makes the game such a great leveller .

The skewed sex ratio ( 877 females per 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ensures that there are just not enough brides for the large number of bridegrooms on the waiting list ' . <p> Image used for representational purpose only . Reuters <p> While majority of the brides have adjusted themselves to the robust Haryanvi lifestyle , there are also instances of women not being able to adjust to the customs and traditions of the state . Haryanvis in the rural areas have a practice of sitting idle smoking hukkahs , even as their wives perform all household as well as outside chores , a practice unique to the state . There are instances where these purchased brides ' have been forced to work as maids , exploited or even denied their basic rights . <p> It was in this context that OP Dhankar , senior BJP leader and president of the Bhartiya Kisan Morcha suggested recently that the party could get girls from Bihar for the eligible bachelors of the state if the BJP came to power in the state . What he really meant was that instead of trafficking marriageable girls from other states , marriages could be solemnised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Dhankar 's Bihari brides for Haryanvi boys ' remark , which seemed offensive at the moment , was objected to by the Bihar State Women Commission ( SWC ) which slapped a notice on him immediately . <p> Maintaining that Dhankar 's remark was offensive and very insulting ' to the women of the state , the Commission said it would proceed against Dhankar after receiving his reply , according to Anjum Ara , SWC Chairperson . <p> According to Dr Anita Yadav , Director , Women Studies Centre ( WSC ) , Maharishi Dayanand University , Rohtak , there are at least 6-7 brides from outside the state in almost all of the 6,000 villages of Haryana . Many of such brides are sexually and mentally harassed , many live in inhospitable conditions . In some cases the bride becomes common property ' of male members in the family . This is exploitation of the worst kind . Sources say the fee ' charged by the dalals for procuring women as brides from other states ranges between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 . Since these women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be subjugated and exploited . <p> Families of boys who procure wives from other states never accept that they have actually paid money , but it is a fact that they are ready to pay anything between Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 for them . An independent study conducted in Haryana showed that there is hardly any village out of 6000 villages if the state where there are no such cases found . Jats of the state face the most shortage of brides , according to the study . There are agents spread all over the state who are engaged in the business ' of buying girls from outside the state . They charge their professional fee ' from the parents of both the boys and the girls for finding suitable match . <p> " It is most unfortunate that brides have to be bought from other states for the boys of Haryana . Just shows where the society is heading as a result of high percentage of female foetecide , " says Karamvir Singh , president of the Confederation of SC/BC/ ST Organisations . " Initially it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Haryana , but slowly they become used to it , Besides coming from very poor families , they do n't actually have any choice , but to learn to live in the new environment . An even disturbing fact is that in some Jat families a single molki from outside the state is married to many men and denied their basic human right of living in dignity and honour , " he adds . <p> Dr Santosh Dahiya , one of the leading woman Khap leaders of the state and national president of Akhil Bhartiya Mahila Shakti Manch , says now that there is so much shortage of brides among the Jat community , the boys in Haryana are left with no choice , but to marry outside . " We have been carrying out an aggressive campaign for the last few years to give women bought or brought from outside the same maan-samman ' ( honour and dignity ) as any local woman . We want marriages to be solemnized in a proper manner instead of the girls being bought , " she says . <p> Talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says there are organized gangs operating in the state . " These agents are professionals . They work like a mafia and never come out in the open . Problems for the girls start when they are exploited by their in-laws , ill-treated or sometimes even re-sold . " <p> According to Khushwant Singh from Rohtak , the skewed sex-ratio among the Jats in Haryana is the prime reason for the shortage of girls . " The rigid system of not allowing inter-caste marriages or not marrying same gotra girls has only led to increase the shortage of brides . How long will the community depend on girls from other states ? The need of the hour is to learn from past mistakes and stop killing females , besides making marriages more flexible . Otherwise the problem will just persist , but also get worse in the coming years , " he says .

Mr. Gupta further explains how such a system of education will attempt to rectify the drawbacks in the existing educational set-up : " Academic rigour in higher education has gone missing in many institutions , and people 's allocation of potential is focused on the marks a student scores in board exams . The scope for critical thinking barely exists as a large part of such exams involve reproducing information from textbooks . A liberal education emphasises critical thinking , thus contributing to students ' holistic development . " <p> Skills and values <p> The founders believe that every individual should be equipped with certain skills and values such as critical thinking , team work , communication and leadership abilities which are more important than bookish knowledge . " We scrutinise not only the board exam marks of applicants , but their scores throughout classes IX to XII . We give more importance to factors such as problem-solving skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined on the basis of extracurricular activities and community projects , " says Mr. Gupta . " As writing skills are important , students are judged based on the essays that they are asked to write . A final face-to-face interview will decide whether or not they make the cut . " Sankalp Garud , who will be part of Ashoka 's founding batch explains how radically different this interview had been from the other interviews he has attended . " I was given 30 minutes and asked to write an essay on a given topic . After this , I had a personal interview which lasted for about 30 minutes .

@@2651234 <h> Mapping the risk-return profile of owning land <p> A well-reasoned investment decision never undermines time , risk and return , the three essential constructs of money . Within the broader gambit of real estate , it is , therefore , essential to deconstruct the various stages in the life of real estate to correlate with this . <p> Land being the essential raw material for real estate offers the first and the most profitable avenue within the life cycle of a realty investment . But not only is it a naturally limited resource , for real estate development , it becomes more scarce as all construction has to be on areas that are not under agriculture , forests , mines , and others . <p> And since each city has well-defined boundaries , marked by local municipal government , land becomes a finite commodity . Further , every city is developed according to Development Control Regulations ( DCR ) , which earmark land parcels for different users -- residential , commercial or public utilities . With all these regulations governing land use , the available portfolio of land to invest for development purpose essentially trickles in rather than gush in . This makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The biggest benefit of investment in land comes first from an economy of scale perspective . Typically , an astute investor in land would look at buying non-converted land on the peripheries of growth cities by aggregating it from farmers . While it is still being used for agriculture , its value is measured in terms of the returns on farm produce , which is not very high . Secondly , since such land does not have artificial restrictions on usage , it is in relative abundant supply , and sold in large tracks . <p> Mostly , the real value is unlocked when this land is amalgamated to the ever growing master plans of cities . So , the holding period of land investments tend to be higher -- 8-15 years . Once the land comes within city limits and within the purview of city development plans with clearly defined end use , its essential character changes . First , it becomes a finite asset as against the relatively large non-converted land . Second , it starts to get valued in terms of per sq . ft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy of scale by a factor of 50,000 or more depending on the floor space index ( FSI ) of the area and the proposed use . The returns on land , therefore , tend to resemble a " j " curve at the land stage and have surpassed returns from any other investment alternative . <p> But there are risks attached which should not be overlooked . To start with , the basic acquisition process of land is cumbersome and fraught with risks . In the absence of accurate reckoner rates , pricing can seldom be predicted , leading to large variations in pricing . Most land while still outside city limits is usually owned by many farmers on a fractional basis , and the woes are multiplied by subdivision within each family . A single acre can be owned by 2-4 families , with 3-4 subdivisions in each family . In the absence of title insurance in India , it is the prerogative of the buyer to ascertain the ownership flow by tracking at least a 60-year family tree of each seller to establish inheritance and authenticity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First challenge pertains to contiguity of land . For a land to be eventually developable it needs to be contiguous . However since it needs to be purchased from multiple people it requires one to take a chance on buying what is available first rather than the adjacent parcel . Over time one may therefore end with an aggregation that does not speak to each other in parts . If the chasms in acquisition are large it may frustrate the entire effort and leave the acquisition valueless at the end of the day . Piecemeal acquisition also has challenges in terms of pricing . Over time the blocks of land left in between a large aggregation hold sufficient black mail value driving the prices higher than budgeted . <p> Access is another major hygiene factor to consider while buying land . This may be easier said than done as , often , the process of acquisition happens on the principle of " cheapest and largest land first " . By the time the aggregation reaches the face of the road , either the prices become exorbitant or sellers vanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available land is likely to be off city limits and far away , maintenance and management poses another big challenge . One needs to provide for adequate fencing and security to ensure that no illegal occupation takes place . Possession is 70% ownership in India , and , hence , to ensure value retention in land , it is also important to hold vacant , peaceful and marketable titles or ownership . <p> The other risk to ownership comes in the shape of acquisition notices served by the government for social development purposes such as to build roads , industry , public amenities or even government housing projects . <p> Therefore , in keeping with the universal principle of risks defining returns , land may be a lucrative investment but carries commensurately high risk .

The growth in FY15 will also be supported by a low base as cement production grew by merely 3% in FY14 .

Increased provision under Rural Housing Fund and interest deduction on housing loans will boost urban and rural housing demand and in turn demand for cement .

At the same time , such assessments have been looked at with raised and unimpressed eyebrows in some quarters . Arunabha Sengupta provides some key statistics to show why this win is indeed special . <p> Green top , an inexperienced batting line up sent in on the first day . They stumble to 145 for seven on the first afternoon , a familiar tale seems to be on the cards . The young team fights back , propped up by an exquisite century by Ajinkya Rahane playing only his seventh Test match . Bhuvneshwar Kumar , all of seven Tests under his belt , bats and bowls like a dream . The tussle continues , and Murali Vijay leaves ball after ball in a display of impeccable restraint . And finally , Ishant Sharma produces that monstrous spell after lunch on the final day , and for the first time an Indian pace bowler performs the feat of bouncing out the opposition in their backyard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian team , if not the greatest . Yes , the England team is not really in the best frame of mind , but they are a very good batting unit who have worthy men coming in from deep in the order . Yes , they played some poor strokes , but if we look at the entire spell of Ishant Sharma instead of dwelling on the actual dismissals , we will realise that there was a definite plan executed to perfection . It was a challenge thrown at the batsmen , pressure built up , they were committed into the rash act of daring and fell with their blades flashing to a well set trap . <p> Yet , we have the usual raised eyebrows of the skeptics , who refuse to read much into the triumph . Of course , Indian cricket following being what it is , often success of a team is devastating to personal beliefs and the race towards rationalisation through undermining feats is quite hectic . Hence , we find many voices already wondering aloud why this victory should be accorded special status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was India 's eleventh win outside the subcontinent in this century . We have ignored Zimbabwe for the analysis . <p> Let us look at what makes this particular win special . <p> The table below lists the amount of experience of each of the teams while scripting these eleven victories . For each victory we have listed the total number of Test matches under the combined belts of the members of the team . Besides , performance in overseas conditions is heavily dependent on the success of the batting line up which has so often failed the touring Indian teams in alien environments . Hence , we have also listed the total number of Test matches of the top six in the batting order in each of the wins .

Not only did the team have just 251 Tests between the eleven -- more than 100 less than the next in the list -- 84 of those had been played by captain MS Dhoni , making the others significantly greener in comparison . <p> Besides , if we look at the amount of experience in the top six batsmen , we again find that the side is way less seasoned than any of the previous batting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the Indian team became a cohort of specific individuals through the 2000s and gradually matured into a unit of incredible experience .

Few teams can dream of being blessed by an average of 90 tests per batsman . <p> Anyone aware of the recent history of Indian cricket will vouch that such was indeed the case . With Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid , VVS Laxman , Virender Sehwag , Anil Kumble , Harbhajan Singh , Zaheer Khan and Sourav Ganguly , India developed a core set of players and the wins came -- albeit not as frequently as one would have wished -- down the decade with the team gaining from this splendid spread of wisdom . <p> From 2011 , a close look at the team composition will indicate a change of guard and setting up a new foundation .

@@2680235 <h> Asus Zenfone 4 A400CG Review : Rounding Out the Family <p> Asus made quite a splash by launching three new phones this month , the Zenfone 4 , Zenfone 5 and Zenfone 6 . Despite the naming scheme , these are not the same device with different screen sizes . The sizes correspond to significant differences in price and capabilities . <p> Each of the three has its niche , and the Zenfone 4 is aimed squarely at capturing the bottom end of the smartphone market . Asus has its sights on first-time Android buyers who represent a massive opportunity for smartphone vendors . <p> There are two versions of the Zenfone 4 - the A400CG model which we have in for review today has a 4-inch screen and a 5-megapixel camera , whereas the A450CG , which has n't launched here yet , has a 4.5-inch screen and 8-megapixel camera . Most other specifications are the same . <p> We were pretty impressed by the Zenfone 5 and Zenfone 6 , which both provide excellent value at their price points . Now it 's time to put the smallest sibling through our review process . <p> Look and feelThe Zenfone 4 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very easy to hold and use . It 's very slightly shorter and wider than an iPhone 5 , but quite a bit thicker . The bulging back in fact makes it more comfortable in the hand . <p> Our Zenfone 4 test unit came with a striking satiny blue rear panel , though black , white and red are also available . It 's a high-quality finish , but we really wonder why Asus printed its own logo in red , right beneath the camera lens and speaker grille . There are also prominent white Intel Inside and Zenfone logos on the bottom rear . <p> The front is pretty consistent with the larger two Zenfones - there are three capacitive buttons below the screen and a speaker and camera above it . The lower lip and buttons have the distinct concentric circle texture that all Asus 's Zen products have , but in this case it 's all plastic and much less apparent . <p> The power and volume buttons are on the right edge , while the Micro-USB port is on the right and headset socket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slots on the left edge , beneath the removable cover . The microSD card slot is to the left of the camera lens , right above the battery cavity . Unlike its bigger siblings , the Zenfone 4 has a removable battery . <p> Specifications and SoftwareWith reduced prices come reduced specifications . The screen is a 4-inch 480x800-pixel panel which really is n't very bright and has poor viewing angles . The processor is a relatively low-end Intel Atom Z2520 , which is a dual-core 1.2GHz model with Hyper-Threading and integrated PowerVR SGX544MP2 graphics . The 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage space are both on the higher side for phones in this price range , and will help keep things fresh and snappy for a while . You also get Wi-Fi b/g/n , Bluetooth 4.0 , A-GPS , an accelerometer and proximity sensor . The essentials are all accounted for , except maybe an ambient light sensor for automatic brightness control . <p> Asus ships the Zenfone 4 with Android 4.3 , and there 's quite a heavy skin on it called ZenUI . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock screen is clean and simple with all the required functionality - a big clock , weather information , notifications , alarm time , and shortcuts to the phone , messaging and camera apps . The shortcut icons also show the number of missed notifications , but strangely , you ca n't see who called or messaged . <p> You can have up to nine homescreens . Asus includes a widget called What 's Next that shows upcoming appointments and important events . The app drawer has tabs which let you show only your downloaded or frequently used apps . <p> The notifications shade and quick settings panel are customised . They 're both crisp and clear , which is all the more necessary on the Zenfone 4 's low-resolution screen . You 'll also see visual tweaks in the Settings , Messaging , Music , Email and other apps . <p> We were n't too happy with the default Asus keyboard - the layout is a bit odd with keys stacked perfectly in a grid rather than the more natural layout with each row offset - but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the decision to stick with capacitive buttons means you wo n't accidentally hit them while typing . <p> Asus includes a few interesting apps . SuperNote lets you create multi-page notes , on which you can type or sketch in multiple colours and styles . You can also embed photos , videos , audio clips , shape stamps and more . Do It Later is a reminders app that integrates with cloud services including Google and Exchange accounts . What 's Next is the app counterpart of the homescreen widget of the same name . <p> The Splendid app lets you tweak screen parameters such as colour temperature and saturation . You can tweak each of the options by a few steps , but avoid the extremes ( unless you want a monochrome screen , which is totally possible ) . The AudioWizard app only presents six audio EQ presets for different scenarios , including one for saving power . Share Link lets you easily set up a Wi-Fi Direct connection between two devices for file exchanges . Power Saver lets you define a custom profile or use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , there 's the Kindle app , Movie Studio , Omlet Chat , Mirror , and of course assorted Google apps . Since most of the choices are actually quite useful , it does n't feel like the Zenfone 4 comes with too much bloat . <p> CameraAsus has packed quite a few filters and effects into its camera app . There are twelve modes to play with , including Time Rewind , Night , Selfie , Miniature , Smart Remove , All Smiles and GIF Animation . A Time Lapse mode is available when recording video . These work to varying degrees , but it takes quite a while to process some effects such as fake depth of field . There are also assorted filters which are applied before taking shots - Pencil , Cartoon , Lomo , Sepia , and more . <p> Party Link is a feature that uses Wi-Fi to sync photos between Asus phones as soon as they 're taken . One person creates a group , and then others in the vicinity can join it . Other options you can adjust include image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus mode , face detection , ISO , white balance and EV . It 's a pretty broad range of capabilities for such an inexpensive device . <p> ( Click to see full size ) <p> Images measure only 2560x1440 ( 16:9 ) by default , but you can choose the larger 2560x1920 ( 4:3 ) if you prefer . Despite the low resolution , our test photos came out surprisingly sharp and clear . Other phones in this price range have fixed-focus lenses , but the Zenfone 4 has full autofocus and you can tap anywhere on the screen to change focus and metering . Close-up shots are far better than landscapes , but even so , the amount of detail in shots is remarkable . Even in low light , quality is n't bad at all - there 's no flash , but we 've seen far worse photos from phones which are twice as expensive or more . Even the front camera does an admirable job - another area in which budget phones typically do n't do well at all . <p> ( Click to see full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected . Full HD 1920x1080 clips look surprisingly good . They 're definitely not crystal clear , but detail in things such as rustling leaves and curtains flapping in the wind is very good . These are videos that can be shown off and shared anywhere . <p> PerformanceThe Zenfone 4 might be cheap , but it 's no slouch when it comes to performance . It managed to edge out the more expensive MotorolaMoto E and SonyXperia E1 Dual in pretty much every test . The score of 15,096 in AnTuTu was significantly better than the 12,546 and 13,200 points achieved by the Moto E and Xperia E1 respectively . Similarly , the Quadrant scores for all three phones were 6,395 , 5,234 and 5,109 respectively . <p> Graphics scores were also higher - we recorded 16.4fps in GFXbench as opposed to 10.7 and 12.8 for the Moto E and Xperia E1 respectively . The three phones traded blows evenly in the more CPU-intensive SunSpider and Mozilla Kraken tests , though . <p> As far as subjective usage goes , we did find ourselves waiting for apps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid . Basic games such as Temple Run were good enough - we would n't try anything heavier than that . <p> Battery life was also good , at 5 hours , 14 minutes in our video loop test . We would have liked to see a better score here , but it 's at par with the competition . This should just about get you through a full day of calls , messages and a little bit of 3G Web usage . We had no complaints about call quality either , but were surprised to see an integrated option to record calls right in the phone app . <p> The built-in speaker is decently loud . Sound is thin , but it can get pretty loud and at least it does n't distort . It came as a pleasant surprise that even our heaviest 1080p video sample played flawlessly on the Zenfone 4 . However , as stated earlier , the phone 's screen itself is pretty awful . We had to push the brightness up to its highest setting and even then , it was n't always easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible and reflections on the glass make things that much worse . <p> VerdictIt seems that Asus is really on to something here - the Zenfone 4 is a fantastically capable device , considering its price . A lot of that has to do with the choice of an Intel processor - could the company finally be about to crack the mobile market , after struggling to do so for years ? <p> The Zenfone 4 's screen is pretty bad but nearly everything else is outstanding . We 're particularly impressed with the device 's camera capabilities . Full HD video recording is pretty neat , and it 's nice to have a front camera - more so one that is n't terrible ! We 're looking forward to the A450CG revision which has a totally different screen and have high hopes that Asus will improve on this phone 's one weakness . <p> It is n't hard at all to recommend the Zenfone 4 . You can weigh your options between this phone , the Moto E and the Sony Xperia E1 , but we think a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than happy to save around Rs. 1,000-1,500.

Not only has he had to battle internal dissent in the Congress party from the likes of Industries Minister Narayan Rane , he also had to surmount opposition to his leadership from long-time alliance partner , the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party ( NCP ) . In an exclusive interview with MG Arun of India Today , Chavan puts forward his track record as CM , the future development plans for the state , his critique of the Modi government , and his views on the rising clamour for Priyanka 's elevation within the party .

People went with the accepted premise that this is the norm for the day . They did not realise they were violating the law in letter and spirit . When I came , I had limitations , in the sense that I had not worked in the state , was unfamiliar with the legislative systems , the MLAs , or the geography .

There was a system capture , where only a few developers were exploiting their contacts , their links . They built up a huge nexus , and that was being exploited at the cost of the citizens , the city and the state . The value that was locked in the land in Mumbai was not coming to the state , and was all going into private hands . I told myself that I will do two things : Unlock the value of the land , give some of it back to the state coffers , and make sure that the price-discovery mechanism works , so that no one runs away with the benefits of the real estate price . I could not tamper too much with the old laws , but I did try to modify it.Q : What particular challenges did you face in dealing with the bureaucracy in the state ? <p> Chavan : The other thing I did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers and postings will be , as far as possible , on merit and not by some extraneous consideration , and went about building the coalition . The crackdown on the real-estate nexuses hurt many people , and they spread the canard that things have slowed down , and were not happening . I made it a point to concentrate on the policy level decisions that affect the maximum number of people in the state , decisions that were stuck for some time due to lack of consensus . The time taken to build the consensus was huge . Instead of that , you could do many individual projects , so I chose that . What came to the CM 's office was something unusual . Other things were settled at the lower level . People were chasing me all around for giving special treatment . I did not lay a great emphasis on these individual benefits - some of them were political , some of them were business , some of them were a close relationship between a political person and an MLA . When I cracked down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on transfer posting , and ensured that meritorious people went . I do n't claim 100 per cent success on that , but the framework was clear . <p> Q : But did all these divert your attention from implementing projects ? You have been often criticised on slow decision-making and project delays . <p> Chavan : The thing that many do n't realise is that because of the Right to Information Act ( RTI ) , things had slowed down , both in Delhi and here . Nobody was taking decisions in a hurry , they tried to push decisions up and were not committing themselves to decisions that were controversial or needed an application of the mind or a bold stand to be taken . ( Former Prime Minister ) Manmohan Singh was also accused of paralysis of the government and so was I. <p> But I did not worry about it . I had to deal with the real-estate issues , the bureaucracy , we had to handle major droughts in the state , which we handled very effectively . We gave Rs 12,000-13,000 crore for drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navi Mumbai airport , the metro and mono rail , we fast-tracked the land acquisition required . <p> Q : Certain projects , such as the metro and the monorail , have now been launched , but again , they have been pending for long . Could these have been taken up any faster ? <p> Chavan : Real estate projects are very difficult in a crowded city like Mumbai . We also made sure that part of the value unlocked in land came back to the state . One rule on fungible FSI gave Rs 3,000 crore to Mumbai corporation in one year . We changed the land lease rates upwards , simplified norms for converting land to non-agriculture use . We had a textile policy , a new industrial policy which made sure that backward areas are developed . We fast-tracked Delhi - Mumbai industrial corridor in the Aurangabad region . The metro , mono rail , the Eastern Freeway , the cross-connectivity between Santa Cruz and Chembur , the new T2 terminal at the airport , the connectivity to the terminal , 17 overbridges , plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of projects got completed , and another Rs 10,000 crore worth of projects are ongoing . Then , we have Rs 36,000 crore worth of projects on the drawing board . For instance , the Colaba to SEEPZ underground metro ( Rs 23,000 crore ) with loan of Rs 13000 crore from Japan will be fast tracked . Navi Mumbai airport environmental clearance is done , and land acquisition is happening . All this will make Mumbai a truly world class city . <p> Q : Your critics have raised issues about your leadership in the coming assembly elections , but now it seems to have been sorted out . Would you be leading from the front in the elections ? <p> Chavan : Of course , I will be leading from the front without a doubt . The opposition parties have not been able to clearly identify how they want to go ahead . We are going ahead with the alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party ( NCP ) , and we will be the senior partners in the alliance . We are waiting for the Shiv Sena - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't project a clear leader for the state , the Congress would then have an advantage . Modi is not going to be CM here . BJP got seats projecting him as a PM candidate . That is not going to happen here . I will stand on my record . I have been able to clean up the administration to the extent possible , I will continue to do that further and work on continuing to keep Maharashtra No. 1 . <p> Q : The dissent within your party has caused you much concern . So has your alliance partner , NCP ... <p> Chavan : There have been problems . My style of governance - to keep meritorious people in the job , to bring in transparency , not supporting private interest over public interest , has , perhaps , upset some people . Within the party also , there have been some murmurs . But the moment people knew I was transparent , and acted without favouritism , and worked for the party , I got support . The Congress party decided that we will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumblings here and there , but they have finally accepted the fact that they have to go under my leadership . I wo n't say all issues have been sorted out with the NCP , though . We will still have to go through the seat sharing issues . <p> Q : The Modi wave swept over the country in the Lok Sabha elections , and totally decimated the Congress-NCP alliance in the state . Is that threat continuing ? Chavan : Modi 's converting the Lok Sabha elections into a US presidential type of election , projecting himself as the leader , and the Congress not joining the issue with him , appeared to be a mismatch of possibilities . There was anger against the Union government because of taxation policies , perceived scams that contributed to inflation , but we failed to explain what we had done . The slow decision making was necessitated by alliance pressures . But people only remembered the scams . It was indeed a period of growth , with policies like Bharat Nirman , Food Security Law , the Right to Education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate that to people and they realised that they wanted a change . Corruption , inflation and the anger of the youth stuck to the people . We are cautious about it and the election campaign will have rich technology content , will do micro-level booth management , and fight it with all our strength . <p> Q : How do you evaluate the first two months of the Modi government ? <p> Chavan : People will get disillusioned with the Modi government . Look at the tokenism that was done in the Union Budget . They have announced 100 cities with a budget of just Rs 7,000 crore . How are we going to complete that ? Even planning the design for these cities is going to cost more . Similarly , 10 IITs and IIMs have been planned , and the allocation is just Rs 500 crore . Inflation is a big challenge already . People are overburdened in the government , we will see how they expand it . Also , there is no vision in the budget . The bullet train is a nice sounding idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : There are reports that Priyanka Gandhi will take up greater organisational role in the Congress . Will it offer a fresh vigour to the party ? Chavan : It is entirely her personal decision to enter the party . It will help the party is she comes in . It all depends on whether she will take an active role in the running of the Congress party . As of now , it is a hypothetical question . Any leader who has a basic Congress ideology and wants to promote the Congress party is welcome . I am sure she will take the right decision . <p> Q : A recent UNICEF report has commented the government on bringing down the rate of malnutrition in the state . How can other states replicate this ? Chavan : Under the Rajamata Jijau Mother-Child Health &amp; Nutrition Mission , we concentrated on 1000 days for expecting women - nine months before child birth and two years after . The battle against malnutrition is won or lost in those 1000 days . We concentrated on expecting and lactating mothers by offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are proud we were the first to launch this mission in the country . <p> Q : There is a move by corporate leaders to create Mumbai as a separate entity to make it world-class . How feasible is the idea ? <p> Chavan : We have a plan to develop Mumbai 's infrastructure , to develop it as a financial centre . But to develop Mumbai as a separate political entity is not acceptable to us . Mumbai is an integral part of Maharashtra , it is a crucial city for growth of the state . There is a holistic relationship between Mumbai and the rest of the state .

To confront the Islamic State storming through the villages of eastern Syria and western Iraq , an international coalition sanctioned by the United Nations would need to be set up , analysts in and outside the Gulf region said . <p> The jihadist army , whose ambition for a cross-border caliphate between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers was not initially taken seriously by their opponents , is now brimming with confidence , emboldened by blood and treasure .

The political struggle exposed the treacherous political quicksand Obama now faces . <p> Dr Hisham al-Hashimi , a Baghdad-based researcher into Iraq 's and the region 's armed groups , said the Islamic State has found ways to compensate for its initial lack of manpower , estimated by most analysts at between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters before its rapid advance from Syria into Iraq .

The hardline pro-Shi'ite policy of Iran and Maliki and those around him led to this Sunni extremism .

The conservative Sunni kingdom was so concerned by the Islamic State 's advance in June and July that it moved tens of thousands of troops to the border with Iraq . Yet , Saudi officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of posing any military threat to the mighty Saudi armed forces . By contrast , they regard Iran and its Shi'ite allies across the region as posing a far more sustained and dangerous threat to the kingdom 's position in the Arab and Islamic world . <p> Saudi Concerns <p> Since the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam 's Sunni-dominated rule , Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have not accepted the rise to power of the Shi'ite majority in Iraq . Saudi Arabia has a strategic rivalry with Iran over the control of the Gulf but its Wahhabi version of Sunni Orthodoxy has always depicted Shi'ites as heretics and this has a huge resonance inside the kingdom and across the Gulf . Beyond any strategic rivalry the royal family is careful about contradicting the Wahhabi clerical establishment that underpins the monarchy . <p> The Islamic State 's victories against an Iraqi army run by a Shi'ite government , and against ethnic Kurdish forces seen as having encroached on Arab territory , have engendered a degree of sympathy and admiration among some Saudis , the analysts said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fighting the Shi'ites .

" <p> However , most analysts agree that token US air strikes are unlikely to turn the tide . It will be very hard for Washington to succeed unless the new Iraqi government radically addresses Sunni grievances by granting them a real share in power and persuading Sunni tribes to set up a new Sahwa to fight the IS . Otherwise , the Islamic State will further expand and grow in numbers as it seizes more territory . For the moment , it is the militants who are pulling in the recruits .

For youths without work , salaries offered by the Islamic State are one of the few sources of income . <p> The movement seems keen to sow its ideals among the young ; one video distributed by the Islamic State features a preacher called Abdallah al-Belgiki - " The Belgian " - who says he travelled from Belgium to the caliphate with his young son . Against a background of black jihadist flags , he asks the child , aged about 8 , whether he would like to go home : " No , " he replies . " I want to stay in the Islamic State ...

@@2734231 <h> How Assam-Nagaland border dispute became a people versus history problem <p> Shops , offices and educational institutions are open in Assam 's Golaghat town as it limps back to normalcy after witnessing major clashes between civilians and police on 20 August resulting in the death of three people and many injured . <p> Ironically , the clashes happened during a protest against police excess . At the core of these clashes was the Assam-Nagaland border turmoil which got sidelined because the attention shifted to police violence rather than on the contentious border issue . <p> Today , 780 families of 16 villages at Sector ' B ' at Uriamghat in Assam 's Golaghat district , whose houses were burnt down allegedly by NSCN-KK cadres who illegally crossed over to Assam , lead an uncertain life at the ill-equipped relief camps . They stare at a bleak future as the state government provides no solid assurance to secure them , and their homes have already been destroyed . As of now , they do not have the courage to return to their homes because they fear being targeted by Naga insurgents . <p> In their latest wave of attack , 16 people lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its people to Naga miscreants . In two big attacks in January 1979 and in June 1985 , Naga militants . allegedly with support from the Nagaland Police killed nearly 100 people in the Golaghat district including Assam Police personnel . <p> Shops get opened after curfew was relaxed from 6 am to 12 noon in tension-gripped Golaghat on Friday . PTI <p> Officially , Assam and Nagaland share a 434 km boundary after the latter was carved out as an independent state in 1963 . However , Nagaland has been allegedly encroaching on vast swathes of land in the upper Assam districts of Sivasagar , Jorhat and Golaghat since then . Over 60,000 hectares of Assam forest land has been reportedly under the occupation of Nagaland where schools , health centres , churches and other facilities have sprung up with the direct help of the Naga government . Violence is used a method to scare away the residents after which a methodical occupation begins . Helpless in front of the aggressive Nagas and owing to Nagaland 's refusal to accept the constitutional boundary , Assam has also knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still awaited . <p> " Both the Centre-appointed Sundaram Commission ( 1971 ) and the Shastri Commission ( 1985 ) had ruled in favour of Assam . But Nagaland rejected the recommendations of both these panels . For administrative convenience , the Britishers had way back in 1925 demarcated a boundary between Assam and Nagaland . But Nagaland started behaving aggressively after the state was formed in 1963 . The first clash happened at Assam 's Kakodonga Reserve Forest in 1965 , " professor in Sociology , Tezpur University Chandan Kumar Sharma told Firstpost . <p> Different bodies in Nagaland often refer to history to fortify their claim on the land that officially belongs to Assam . But the reference to history is hotly contested . <p> " The Nagas are seeking a historical boundary but there is no evidence to prove it . On the other hand , the Ahom kings gave land to Nagas for agriculture ( Naga khats ) but the ownership of the land belonged to the state . During the Ahom rule , the Nagas were entrusted with the responsibility to look after peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ahom state . However , it is to be understood that border in those days was soft borders which was converted into hard or fixed borders only during the colonial rule , " Sharma said . <p> In a memorandum submitted to the Supreme Court-appointed Local Commission on Assam-Nagaland border issue on 20 August 2007 , the All Assam Students ' Union ( Aasu ) also came down heavily on the historical " distortion " of boundary the Nagas were carrying out . It said : " Every year the Naga chiefs with large revenue came down to the Ahom capital to pay tribute . It was then only the Nagas would enjoy products of the khats ( land ) . Unless they came and paid tribute in kind to the Ahom kings , the Naga chiefs were not entitled to enjoy the khat and fishing lake . A refractory chief was not allowed to come down and thus he forfeited the products of the khats . According to the British records , there had been some 25 khats along the foot of the Naga Hills but within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nagas have distorted this historical fact by explaining the khats as " taxes " paid by the Ahom kings , whereas the khats were landed estates , granted by Ahom kings to certain villages or clans of Naga in consideration of services . The khats were cultivated by a class of men called paik who were subjects of the Ahom kings . Even during the British period , the khats were treated as valid revenue grants and were still cultivated by tenants . However , these were managed by the Katakis . These katakis were employed by the British officials as intermediaries in their dealing with the Nagas . In the Ahom period , the Katakis were appointed by the Ahom king . During the British period , the Katakis were appointed by the British . All Katakis were Assamese , not Nagas . " <p> Assam 's border plight is not limited to Nagaland alone . Clashes are also common on the Assam-Meghalaya and Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border . On 29 January this year , armed groups from Arunachal Pradesh attacked Chauldhuwa village at Behali Reserve Forest village in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major clashes also occurred at the Assam-Meghalya border in January 2011 . The state also shares its boundary with Manipur , Mizoram and Tripura . <p> Border conflicts that Assam has with most of its neighbours is due to the fact that all these new Indian states belonged to the erstwhile Assam Province . It was created by the British in 1911 after the partition of the Eastern Bengal and Assam Provinces . Shillong was the Assam capital before Meghalaya became a separate state . Assam was first separated from Bengal in 1874 as per the ' North-East Frontier ' non-regulation province by the British . Then it became a part of Eastern Bengal in 1905 and became an independent province in 1911 . <p> " Before these hard boundaries were created , the natural resources along the border areas were all common , " Sharma said . <p> " The Britishers began tea plantation in a massive way by destroying vast forest areas . The tea gardens stifled the traditional routes of communication between the hills and plains . The plantations also brought an end to the commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Assamese , " he said . <p> Interestingly , the tea plantations along the border have become sites of conflict in recent times . The Nagas ransacking these tea plantations , especially the newly emerging small plantations , has been quite frequent . There has been also a new aspiration among a section of the Nagas to begin plantations for which vast amount of land is required which is available only in the foothill border . The issue of land thus has become a source of conflict between Assam and Nagaland in the inter-state border areas . Besides , the Nagas have engaged not only ex-tea garden workers as labourers in their agricultural land but also immigrant Muslim population . The latter especially act as cheap labour for the Nagas . <p> Security personnel patrol in the streets of tension-gripped Golaghat town after curfew was extended till 6PM on Friday . PTI <p> But this practice has come up with its own set of problems . Now the population has gradually swelled in the area leading to confrontations between them and the Nagas regarding ownership of land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History and Archaeology , Nagaland University , said , " The real ( or indigenous ? ) people of Assam and Nagaland living in the region do not have any differences on the boundary . It is the increasing number of Bangladeshi migrants and Adivasi immigrants that is causing the problem . Earlier these Adivasis were tenants of the Nagas but now that they have started claiming the land as theirs . Some unscrupulous elements took advantage of the situation and made it an Assam-Nagaland border dispute , " Venuh told Firstpost from Lumami in Nagaland 's Zunheboto district . <p> He also blamed the Assam government for allegedly indulging in electoral politics . <p> " They want these people to settle there and take electoral benefits out of them . They actually want to protect these people at the expense of the original Assamese and Naga people who are the original inhabitants of the region . The real people are very clear about the boundary . The border dispute has been enforced upon us for political reasons . No one from Nagaland is encroaching . In 2007 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagaland had toured the entire region and found that there is no dispute on the ground , " he said . <p> However , Sharma does not agree with Venuh that there is no encroachment from the Nagaland side . <p> " The demand for a Greater Nagalim seems to find favour from successive state governments in Nagaland . It is a fact that the NSCN cadres roam freely with weapons and the Nagaland government conveniently looks away . Unless Assam embarks upon effective policies to protect its borders from encroachments , this would continue unabated , " Sharma said . <p> It is obvious that both the states are using the circumstances on the border as per their convenience . Sharma , however , believes that for a sustainable solution to the border conflict states must eschew a space-centric juridico-administrative approach . He argues that such a solution is possible only by involving communities and civil society organisations from both sides . <p> " If both the governments are sincere to resolve the dispute and if they take the real people into confidence the problem should be solved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

For that and that alone , the navy has , till date , been unable to get going on the desperately required MLU where Selex ES , a part of Finmeccanica was to supply the Russian Original Equipment Manufacturer ( OEM ) Rosoboronexport with brand new radars to fit them on naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters , nation 's biggest warship , INS Vikramaditya remains a sitting duck for the kind of advanced submarines India 's enemies posses . Informed sources point out that a desperate navy even got a CBI clearance for proceeding on its MLU contract but to no avail . <p> In the absence of political authority , ' play safe ' was the objective . Towards this , anything , even remotely connected to Finmeccanica , was to be kept at arm 's length . As one has reported in the past , it simply did n't matter how urgent or critical the requirement of national security was . <p> Only last week , while commissioning the Anti Submarine Warfare ( ASW ) corvette INS Kamorta in Vishakapatnam , responding to a question from yours truly , Defence Minister Arun Jaitley signaled that efforts were on to bury the ghosts and that we shall hear from him sooner than later .

Beyond that , things get into the sphere of interpretation and decisions taken henceforth will further clarify the implementation of this decision . What is also interesting to note is the ministry 's pragmatism , cleverly closing the door but not completely . Those in the services say this indicates that if such a situation does arise where anyone among Finmeccanica Group companies emerge as L1 , procurement wo n't be necessarily stalled . <p> Finmeccanica will be treated differently , make no mistake . Where there is an option , the ministry will dump Finmeccanica . When there is none , a considered decision will be taken .

A giant conglomerate is literally omnipresent . In trying to hurt the giant , we should n't let our armed forces suffer , " said an MoD officer . <p> For the record , this exercise culminating in the notification was undertaken even by the previous administration and opinions were sought from the then Attorney General ( AG ) as well as the Law &amp; Justice ministry . However , nothing came out of it . Following the election results , the new leadership also sought fresh opinions before framing this policy . <p> What is still not known is how the MoD views the developments in the Italian court where the prosecution has dropped its case against top AgustaWestland officials over the VVIP helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Meanwhile , the final clause in MoD 's notification permits Finmeccanica to participate in every defence deal in India as long as it remains a sub-contractor to a contracting party to the government of India . <p> Navy 's and the men who operate the Kamov28 ASW helicopters can finally smile . <p> ( Works as a special correspondent with Headlines Today &amp; reports on defence and internal security )

@@2740232 and power of crowdfunding <p> If you are anywhere on social media -- Facebook , Twitter or any other forum of your choice -- you could n't have escaped news on the " ALS ice bucket challenge " . For the few who may have , the idea is a simple one . You take a bucket of ice cold water , dunk it on your head , and pledge to donate money for research into a progressive neurodegenerative disease called ALS ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , but more commonly known as the Lou Gehrig 's disease ) . You then nominate three other people to do the same . Of course , since we live our lives on social media , you also post a video of you completing the challenge and up your coolness quotient ! <p> The campaign has gone viral . Needless to say , the celebrity A-listers are all in on it but its gone far beyond that . George W. Bush has done it . Barack Obama refused to dump water on his head but donated to the cause nevertheless . Bill Gates has done it and so have Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . According to a 27 August article in The New York Times , the chief executives of Jefferies , UBS and Wells Fargo have all gone under the bucket and donated towards ALS research . Thanks to social media , the challenge has spread across borders quickly . People in African countries , China and now even back home in India , are all rushing to throw ice water on their heads , post the videos online and presumably follow that up with a donation . <p> According to the latest update ( 27 August ) on the ALS Association website , " ice bucket donations " have collected $94.3 million since 29 July . That 's a $100 million in less than a month . Convert that into rupees -- it 's Rs.600 crore . That 's the kind of money some Indian companies hire expensive bankers to raise via qualified institutional placements and initial public offerings . <p> Which brings me to the reason for writing this piece : the ALS ice bucket challenge is a lesson in the potential of crowdfunding . Over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs globally to raise funds . Have a good idea ? Take it to the World Wide Web , market it well and you 'll at least get the attention of potential investors and probably their money . Finding accurate statistics on how much has been raised through crowdfunding is difficult but according to an article in the Forbes magazine earlier this month , which quoted statistics portal Statista , global volume of crowdfunding platforms rose to $2.8 billion in 2012 from $530 million in 2009 . That was in 2012 and while data for 2013 or 2014 was n't available , it 's safe to assume that those numbers would have risen . <p> In India , again , accurate data on how much money has been raised via crowd funding is not available but in June this year , capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) floated a consultation paper on crowdfunding and its costs and benefits , suggesting that it has become big enough to catch the regulator 's eye . <p> There are two basic forms of crowdfunding -- community crowdfunding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the ice bucket challenge , while the latter involves investors contributing money in return for a financial pay-off or , in some cases , equity . <p> It 's the latter that needs to be regulated appropriately to ensure that fly by night operators do n't dupe investors . Detailing the risks in the model , the capital markets regulator cautioned that the risk that is typically taken on by institutional investors while funding start-ups may get transferred to retail investors , who may have lower risk tolerance . Sebi also flagged off the risk of default as funds solicited on online platforms may not be accompanied by legally binding offer documents . Then , of course , there is the ever prevalent risk of fraud . <p> Keeping all this in mind , Sebi proposed that only " accredited investors " be allowed to participate . This would include qualified institutional buyers , high net worth individuals and retail investors who receive advice from an investment adviser and have a minimum annual gross income of Rs.10 lakh . <p> Retail investors can not invest more than Rs.60,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth through the crowdfunding platform , proposed Sebi . Other safeguards , such as ensuring all investments are made through demat accounts , have also been proposed . <p> Predictably , voices from the industry have said that tough regulations may kill this nascent avenue of raising funds but some regulation would be welcome to stem any possibility of misuse . Hopefully , the final regulations , which are pending , will find a way to harness the power of crowdfunding effectively without throwing cold water on the concept . <p> But let 's not throw cold water on all the excitement over the ice bucket challenge with talk of regulation . For now , if you have a nomination , a bucket full of ice water and a desire to donate to the cause -- go ahead and do it . And do n't forget to post a video !

This is the first time in over a decade that retail pump prices are almost in line with imported cost of the nation 's most consumed fuel .

Mahatma Gandhi had also called the social reformer as Pulaya Raja . This status is also related to the connection of Pulayas with Chera dynasty ( hence the name Cheramar ) . <p> The history of the Pulaya community is scantly recorded . The story of the downtrodden was never a topic of interest for historians until the 20th century . Therefore , it is not surprising that the life of a king of the Pulaya community , who lived some 200 years ago in the city , never got recorded , authentically . But the memory of Kalipulayan , the last Pulaya Raja of Pulayanarkotta , nevertheless remains through fables . A shrine dedicated to him has also surprisingly survived the ravages of time and remains tucked away , right in the middle of the city , in Attakkulangara . <p> There are several indications that the Pulaya community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Travancore State Manual , opines that such a past remained till 700 CE . Bishop Caldwell remarks : " Perhaps the best representatives at present of the earliest race of inhabitants are those long oppressed tribes , now considered the lowest in the social scale " . <p> Anantha Krishna Iyer in Cochin Tribe &amp; Castes ( 1909 ) refers to a Pulaya chieftain called Aikkara Yajamanan . Krishna Iyer C.A. in Travancore Tribes and Castes ( 1939 ) mentions that a Pulaya princess named Kotha is said to have ruled over Kokkothamangalam in Nedumangad . <p> Pulayanarkotta on the banks of the Akkulam lake was also , arguably , home to a Pulaya chieftain . ' Pulayanarkotta ' literally means ' the fort of the Pulayas chief or king ' ; the " nar " at the end of Pulayanar indicates some kind of superior social status . <p> Samuel Mateer in his Native Life of Travancore ( 1883 ) is one of the scholars who refer to Pulayanarkotta . He first sketches the social condition of Pulayas . " They belong to the very lowest grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded as education and civilization have not yet largely affected them , and their former masters do not wish them to rise to independence or full liberty .

" In the neighbourhood of Trivandrum , Pulayars are accustomed to boast of having once had a chieftain or rajah of their own , who resided in a fort not far off . There certainly are some remains on the summit of a hill near Vely of a mud wall and ditch , some 60 or 70 feet square , enclosing a small level plot of ground now overgrown with shrub and having a deep well inside .

Ramachandran Nair has also recorded oral history about Pulaya Raja of Pulayanarkotta . He also points to the oral tradition that Anayara was once the elephant stables of the Pulaya king . <p> There is no clear indication about the period of reign of the last Pulaya Raja , we can only infer that he lived during the late 18th century or earlier . The fable that remains today about Kalipulayan comes to us through the members of the Viswakarma community , the community which traditionally worked as carpenters , blacksmith , goldsmith , sculptors and so on . Parameswaran Achari , a member of the community , who has been running a goldsmith shop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the story of Kalipulayan close to his heart . Parameswaran 's fable has obvious elements of fantasy in it , but hidden somewhere is an indication that , much like Ayyankali who forced entry into a ' Vidyalaya " ( school ) , Kalipulayan sacrificed himself by entering a ' Devalaya ' ( temple ) , in an attempt to declare his equality with the Maharaja of erstwhile Travancore . <p> Kalipulayan and his wife are believed to have reigned over Pulayanarkotta and they were well known for their magical powers . In a fit to reassure the pride of his community , the Pulaya Raja is said to have declared that he being a king , he was entitled to enter the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple . The Pulaya connection of the temple is well known . <p> Samuel Mateer , in his work titled ' Land of Charity ' ( 1870 ) refers to it as follows : " The place where Trivandrum now stands was formerly a jungle , called Ananta Kadu . In the centre of this desert dwelt a Pulayan and his wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their hut .

As soon as she had retired a five headed cobra came , removed the infant to a hole in the tree , and sheltered it from the sun with its hood . It was an incarnation of the god Vishnu . While there , the Pulayan and his wife used to make offerings to the babe of milk and conjee in a coconut shell . Tidings of these things reaching the ears of the sovereign of Travancore , orders were issued for the erection of a temple At the place .

Only one shop remains in the area -- Chembonippura in Aryasala that still makes brass pieces . All other brass making units have either vanished or morphed into shops which sell brass items brought from elsewhere . <p> S. N.

Kalipulayan had a way out . He invoked his magical powers and produced an oil called ' Unni thailam ' , which was said to have the powers to make people invisible . Kalipulayan applied oil on his forehead and boldly walked into the temple . Not only did he enter the temple and offer prayers , due to his sense of being equal to the Maharaja , he walked into the room in the temple complex where the Maharaja was having his supper . He sat beside the Maharaja and shared the rice porridge ( kanji ) that the Maharaja was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king that his kanji was diminishing at a faster rate than he was consuming it .

The steam from the kanji made the invisible Kalipulayan sweat , and he took his towel and wiped his face and removed the magical oil on his forehead , making him visible to the Maharaja . The cruelty of caste system in Travancore ensured that Kalipulayan was hanged for breaking the caste rules . It is possible that the settlement in Pulayanarkotta was also consequently demolished . <p> The fable does not end here .

It is said that Kalipulayan gave up his vengeance and never again troubled the brassmiths and thereby the king and temple .

@@2758240 partial deallocation of coal blocks flawed <p> NEW DELHI : The Centre and a clutch of industry associations have pleaded with the Supreme Court not to deallocate 46 coal blocks that are already under production or are about to start production , but a closer look at their proposal to levy a penalty of Rs 295 per tonne on coal mined reveals several flaws . <p> When the apex court resumed hearings after declaring allocation of all 218 coal blocks since 1993 illegal , the government also recommended that power producers with captive coal blocks be allowed to henceforth sell power only through longterm power purchase agreements ( PPA ) and not in the merchant market . <p> However , the question arises as to whether the proposed penalty and the long-term PPA can redress the skewing of competitive advantage towards those with captive blocks , one of the biggest fallouts of the captive coal block approach followed by successive governments . <p> " The matter is sub judice , " said a spokesperson of Jindal Steel &amp; Power , declining comment on the matter . <p> According to observers , though , there are three problems with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in terms of the grade of coal and the relative ease of mining ) . And so , a common benchmark may not work , " said Dipesh Dipu , an associate professor at the Centre for Energy and Infrastructure Development at the Administrative Staff College of India . <p> Then there are other questions about the proposed penalty . Sudiep Shrivastava , one of the key lawyers who argued against the captive coal block allocations , said , " While Rs 295 might be a suitable penalty for the coal mined till now , for coal mined in the future , the penalty should not be Rs 295 per tonne . It should be linked to royalty - or to the existing price charged by ( state-run miner ) Coal India . " <p> Not only is a common proposed penalty an imperfect solution , the government has not suggested an equivalent requirement like long term PPAs for iron and steel players with coal blocks . <p> Shrivastava said , several of these 40 companies have been given far more coal than they need . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million tonnes ( MT ) of coal , has been given a coal block ( Gare Palma IV/4 ) with coal reserves of 125 MT . In contrast , Prakash Industries , now the subject of a CBI investigation like Jayaswal Neco , needed 1 MT a year but was given a block with 34 MT . Or take Electrosteel Castings . It needed 0.58 million tonnes a year but was given a block ( Parbatpur ) with geological reserves of 231 MT . <p> Turn to the state utilities given coal blocks and the suggestion against deallocation can create an even more complicated mess . These companies , Dipu said , given their poor record of developing captive mines , " depended on contract miners or mine developers and operators ( MDOs ) " . <p> These have been contentious models , Dipu said , adding , " The contractor is left wholly in charge of these blocks with very little supervision . And we know how much scope there is in coal for theft . " <p> Indeed , each of these state utilities in the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprises . For instance , while Damodar Valley Corporation has entered into an agreement with EMTA , Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam has signed up with Adani Enterprises . These are 74:26 agreements where the state utility forms a joint venture or JV with the private company such that the JV company is in charge of mining . The private party holds a 74% stake in the JV company . These JV companies sell coal to the utility at a price that is linked not to the JV 's cost of mining but to the prevailing Coal India price . Now , in its judgement , the SC has declared another JV model , the 51:49 one where the state utility held 51% in the JV but management control vested with the private party , as illegal . This has raised another question about the 74:26 model . " If the 51:49 JV is illegal , then how can the 74:26 JV be legal ? " asked Shrivastava . <p> That is not the only issue . Even if the court does not deallocate these 16 blocks , Shrivastava asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector unit ) has no capacity . So , even if you save these leases , what is the way forward ? " Besides , he added , " Given that the lease is in the name of the PSU , are they in a position to pay Rs 295 per tonne of coal mined till now ? If not , who will pay this Rs 295 ? " <p> In that sense , India has a chance to fix its inefficient and corruption-riddled coal sector . Indeed , even within the 40 blocks that started mining , Dipu said , several have not reached peak production - even though all of them were allotted in the 1990s and the early 2000s . " They did not have the expertise . They somehow developed their blocks after poaching people from Coal India . But somehow developing a block is not the same as scientific mining , " he said . Even auctions can not fix this problem if end-users are allowed to participate . " What if a company finds that its erstwhile captive block has been acquired by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Shrivastava . <p> According to Dipu , there should be full deallocation . Even if the country 's import bill on coal goes up for a couple of years , he said , India should take this time to create a more modern coal industry .

@@2775232 <h> Comment - Sanath Jayasuriya , The Scourge Of Indian Cricket <p> The greatest irony of my cricket-watching journey has been that I became a fan of it because of a player who rarely gave me a moment to enjoy an Indian victory against Sri Lanka . Never ever did I have such a polarised affection for a player when he bashed other opposition 's vis- ? -vis the Indian cricket team . <p> If they say that no matter how much you move on in life with relationships , you never forget your first love , I guess that 's exactly the same sentiment I hold for Sanath Jayasuriya when it comes to my list of favourite sports stars . <p> Throughout the late 90s , ever since I have started following cricket , this one gentleman gave me as much as joy as he caused agony with his performances . <p> While most of my friends were Sachin fans for his picture perfect strokeplay , I somehow admired the sense of unpredictability and daredevilry which Sanath would display during his batting . <h> The Year that Was -- 1996 <p> My first recollection of watching Jayasuriya on TV was in the 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission at the Feroz Shah Kotla as he overshadowed Tendulkar 's masterclass 137 as Sri Lanka chased down a mammoth 271 by India ( though such a score is not a big deal in today 's era ) . <p> What angered me was how could anyone so effortlessly steal an Indian hero 's show in the wink of an eye , but he did it . How I hated him that particular day . <p> Yet a couple of weeks later I saw him decimating the England bowlers in the quarter-finals to enable Sri Lanka to storm into the semis . I was shell-shocked with admiration . Somehow the Sachins and the Azhars of India looked too boring and one dimensional to me . <p> Yet when it came to the semi-finals I jumped with joy when I roared in my living room with the Eden Gardens . I could not understand my own psychology as to how could I be so fickle a supporter as to hate someone for his craft which I was watching in admiration just a couple of days ago . <p> If I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong my prophecy was , as out of nowhere he came back to take three wickets in India 's innings thus ensuring that my dream of watching India win a World Cup would be shattered . I thought to myself ' how could a guy whom I thought to be a hero do this to his young fan of 10 years ? ' . <p> That World Cup shaped the very ethos of my player-fan relationship with Jayasuriya . There were days when I loved to hate him and there were other days when I just loved loving him for what he was . <p> In the end Sri Lanka had won the World Cup . Though Sanath hardly did anything of note in the final game I was happy that the team with Sanath had won . <h> Superman Sanath <p> Hardly had the World Cup hysteria died down that I heard on the radio that Jayasuriya had smashed the fastest century in ODIs in a match against Pakistan in Singapore . I remember how angry I was with my parents that they still had not got cable television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deprived the right to watch my new-found hero live on television blasting his way through an opposition that was not India . <p> The next game in that series was against India and how I feared that night as to what fate would await for those innocent Indian bowlers who would be bowling against this freak of a player . And behold , the next day Sri Lanka fell short by 13 runs , with Jayasuriya falling for a measly one . <p> Only God knew my happiness . Even I was beginning to find this Dr. Jekyll-Mr.Hyde like fanship for this Sri Lankan magician amusing . <h> India 's Nemesis <p> India-Sri Lanka matches had become a routine affair in the late 90s , having the same stale script match after match . <p> Script 1 : India batting first would lose early wickets . Sachin Tendulkar would consolidate and lead a fightback and India would post a competitive total in the 220s . <p> Jayasuriya would come to bat on a completely different pitch , hammer the daylights out of bowlers and finish off the match in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form throughout the tournament , the moment he saw Indian bowlers , all his technical defaults and diseases which had doomed him to failure against other oppositions would vanish . <p> He would bat like a man possessed who would get peace only after having torn the Indian bowlers to smithereens . <p> I hated him when he scored those 340 runs against India in 1997 on a batting paradise . It was not only the Indian team which had suffered for two continuous days under his assault . Countless number of fans including me had our patience and devotion tested in front of television screens during which not a single wicket fell . <p> This story followed year after year in the one-day games too . He always reserved his best for playing against India whether it be his 151 at the Wankhede in 1997 , his 189 in Sharjah in 2000 or his 123 in the Asia Cup in 2008 in Karachi . <p> The background was always the same . An out-of-form Sanath who just had to see the faces of Indian bowlers to spring him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India ? " <p> Jayasuriya tested my devotion as a fan like no other player did . His favourite opposition was India . I was a fanatical supporter , but somewhere down the line there was a sports fan who just loved his sheer style , irrespective of who the opposition was . Putting a teenager in such a dilemma in my opinion was highly unethical on the part of my favourite sportsmen . <p> Yet , unknowingly , my evolution as an observer of sports had started , whereby I could segregate my fanatical like devotion to the Indian team separate from the appreciation I had learnt to develop for an opposition player . Hopefully in the years to come this would stand me in good stead . <h> Jayasuriya -- My Hero <p> Somehow my admiration for Jayasuriya was not only for his style of playing but also for the timing of his innings . As both my parents were working and I did n't take after-school tutorials , being back home was quite an arduous task . <p> Honestly speaking the Indian team of the 1990s did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and take notice of them . On such occasions my friend Sanath would act as my savior . <p> Perhaps my favourite innings of his would be the 253 he scored at The Oval in 1998 against England . Since England had batted for most of the previous two days , it had somehow skipped my mind that Sri Lanka would be batting too . It was a lazy Saturday afternoon and there was no one at my home . <p> It would not be before 6:00 PM my parents would be back home . As I switched on the television trying to find some solace through cartoon network I suddenly came across Star Sports where the match was on and Jayasuriya was coming into bat . What followed that afternoon was sheer splendour . <p> No matter what the English bowlers threw at him the ball had only one place - that was the boundary . No one would dare say Test cricket was boring . <p> In fact that day made me believe it 's the purest form of cricket as it gave the freedom to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never even realized when it was 6:00 and my parents were back . <p> The ungrateful soul I was , I had been calling them up frantically to be back home early and now that they had come back , I hardly took notice of them . This was perhaps one such instance when Jayasuriya became my friend , when my other friends were busy with personal chores . <h> He instilled hope in the team he played for even if it looked impossible . <h> His presence kept the opposition on their toes as they feared that he could achieve the impossible . <p> During the 1990s when Sharjah was still a popular cricket hub , I really looked forward to those mindless triangular series featuring Sri Lanka , Pakistan and a third team ( other than India ) . It was a joy not getting enrolled in an ethical dilemma as to whether I should support my cricket team or my favorite sportsman . <p> Outsiders would find it hard to believe to have watched the way I cheered for Sri Lanka . I am thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against uncles and friends . The winner ( which was usually me ) would get an ice cream or a chocolate treat which was a huge deal for a boy like me . <p> When as children we were asked to write essays on our favorite sport stars , Sachin Tendulkar was the popular choice followed by Saurav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid ( who were the new sensations in the making ) . <p> My choice of Sanath Jayasuriya was unique and it raised many eyebrows too especially amongst friends . <p> How could I consider a batsmen who has shattered so many dreams of an Indian victory as a favourite sports star ? But that was the admiration for Sanath . <p> He was never the perfect cricketer . Perhaps he was the best example of an anti-hero . He was human . He had his grey shades when he massacred the Indian bowling . I realise it was these facets of this great batsman from Sri Lanka which fascinated me as an armchair cricket freak . <p> In fact I almost got admission to one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exams simply for the way I justified Jayasuriya being my favorite sports star in my interview . He had almost helped me to pull off a miracle . <h> Sorry for Sanath <p> Somehow the World Cups have always served as a platform for the best of my polarised affections for Sanath Jayasuriya and the Sri Lankan team . If , in 1996 , I hated them for boxing India out of the semi-finals , my heart went out to Sanath and his team when they got massacred in the 1999 World Cup in England . <p> Though it was sweet revenge for the Indian team as I saw Ganguly and Dravid smash them in Taunton , I felt a slight lump in my throat when Javagal Srinath mercilessly ran out Jayasuriya through a direct hit in that game . <p> History repeated itself again in the 2003 World Cup game when Sri Lanka got ransacked by India getting shot out for 107 . For most part of that innings Jayasuriya had seen a procession of Sri Lankan batsmen coming and going . There was a great fight within me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised to pulp and the Jayasuriya admirer who wanted his hero to remain not out . <p> However , this time the tables turned in the 2007 World Cup , where India , having lost to Bangladesh , were at the mercy of Sri Lanka as they tried to qualify for the Super 8s . <p> Though Jayasuriya did not play a major role in that victory , I again ended up having bitter feelings for him and his team for once again having shattered India 's dreams . <p> I knew my team did n't deserve to qualify given their atrocious performance in the league games , but Sri Lanka could have been a bit more considerate . However , when Sri Lanka qualified for the finals , I was again rooting for a Sanath performance in the finals . <p> Despite Australia once again having posted a mammoth total , I knew as long as the Superman of the Sri Lankan batting was at the crease even the Aussies would have been quaking in their pants . <p> However , the moment he got bowled after scoring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field knew the game was over . That 's why I admired Jayasuriya since my childhood . <p> He instilled hope in the team he played for even if it looked impossible . His presence kept the opposition on their toes as they feared that he could achieve the impossible . Ultimately Sri Lanka lost the finals and this would be the last time I saw my hero on the World Cup stage . <h> A dream comes true <p> As a college goer the first time I saw a match live in the stadium was an India-Sri Lanka Test match in 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotal . Though it turned out to be a dream match from the Indian perspective with Sachin Tendulkar breaking Sunil Gavaskar 's record of 34 centuries , it had been a bit of an anti-climax as Jayasuriya was not a part of that team on account of poor form . <p> I had to wait as long as four more years to see my hero play live in front of my eyes . <p> This was in December 2009 when I was already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already won the series and there was nothing much at stake . Yet even at that age when most cricketers call it a day , I saw Sanath playing the Indian bowlers with aplomb skill on that brute of a wicket . <p> It was only after he had got out for 34 runs , was a hue and cry raised about the condition of that wicket . <p> While he was at the crease , never as an on-field spectator did I feel that wicket was not suitable for cricket . While most Delhites regret having gone to that match , I feel proud of having braved the December cold as after that game Jayasuriya did not get to play another match until June 2011 . <h> The last innings <p> It was in the summer of 2011 , that Jayasuriya had officially declared that he would be retiring from the game . A lot of hue and cry had been made with respect to his selection for the tour of England , with some Sri Lankan players making their displeasure quite evident in their public speeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept my mind as I read that news . <p> I was 25 , already two years into the professional circuit . For most Indians their childhoods have been encompassed by the presence of Sachin Tendulkar . But no doubt a part of my childhood ended on 28th June 2011 , a couple of days before his 42nd birthday when his trademark square cut off Tim Bresnan landed straight in the palms of Eoin Morgan . <p> No doubt times had changed . <p> Those cuts which flew over third man for six had flown straight into the hands of a point fielder who normally would have just stood gazing at the ball as a mere spectator .

Photo : Bloomberg <p> Bangalore : The 12 ports run by the central government have violated rules by not setting rates for stevedores and shore cargo handlers , although their activities come under the purview of the tariff regulator , a committee of port trust chairmen appointed by the shipping ministry said . <p> " The Major Port Trusts Act 1963 makes it clear that all operations in a major port ( owned by the Union government ) with regard to unloading/loading of cargo and subsequent operations in the port may be done either directly by the port , but if these operations are assigned to agents , such assignment by the port shall be with the previous sanction of the Central Government , and that TAMP ( Tariff Authority for Major Ports ) needs to notify rates for these operations , and that the agents so authorized shall not charge in excess of these rates for the port operations , " the five-member panel headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its 21 July report on regulating stevedores and shore handling agents . Mint has reviewed a copy . <p> The shipping ministry has n't given any reason for not setting the rates for these service providers who handle about 124 million tonnes ( mt ) of cargo a year out of the combined 555 mt handled by all the 12 ports . <p> Worse still , overlooking this statutory requirement , the shipping ministry issued a stevedoring policy in June 2009 , 12 years after TAMP was set up , allowing stevedores to collect charges directly from exporters and importers and leaving such charges to be decided by the parties based on market forces . <p> As a result , one set of cargo handlers selected through an auction are regulated by TAMP while the other who load and unload cargo manually from non-mechanized berths are allowed to charge market rates . <p> " This needs to be rectified as it is a statutory necessity under the major Port Trust Act , " the committee said . <p> " The rates of stevedores and shore handling agents are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( common user facilities ) where they do n't have monopoly , while BOT ( build , operate and transfer ) operators construct their own berth and since they have monopoly in cargo handling , their ceiling rates are notified by TAMP , " said B.K. Mansukhani , promoter of Kandla-based stevedore and shore handling agent Rishi Shipping Pvt Ltd . <p> Stevedores , who handle cargo manually , are just one link in the maritime logistics chain . After the cargo is unloaded from a ship and put on the wharf , it has to be taken to the stockyards and from there to railway wagons and trucks for transportation to end use customers . This work is done by onshore cargo-handling agents . <p> More than 90% of the shore-handling agents undertake stevedoring of ships also . This had led to demands for appointing stevedores and shore-handling agents in major ports through auctions and tenders on a revenue-sharing basis , as is the case of **26;640;TOOLONG ( PPP ) projects , to increase competition and bring revenue to the ports . <p> Demanding a revenue share from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in an increase in the transaction cost at these ports and lead to further diversion of cargo to the other ports which are already growing at almost five times the rates of the government-run ports . Policy prescriptions based on premises of monopoly of the so-called major ports , when they controlled 91% of the cargo in 1994-95 , are bound to backfire if they are applied today , when there is a vibrant private sector controlling 43% of the market . <p> " The committee is , therefore , unable to agree with the suggestion that ports must appoint stevedores and shore-handling agents by tender-cum-auction with the bidding parameter being royalty/revenue share . Instead , it favours the statutory solution of getting TAMP to notify ceiling rates within which competition can be brought in among the different agents as a more sustainable solution , " the committee said . <p> Even accepting the argument that revenue share or royalty can not be a cost item in the tariff of the operator , it does not mean that the cost of such outgo is not factored in when doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a helplessness on the part of major ports to ensure that the TAMP-approved rates are collected by the stevedores and shore-handling agents without charging anything extra , says Ramakant Burman , general secretary , Haldia Dock Officers ' Forum . <p> " Going by this logic of the committee , the private cargo terminals operating at major ports on royalty or revenue share basis would have resulted in driving away cargo to non-major ports by raising the cost to the trade , " said Burman . " The argument that royalty imposition will increase cost of cargo handling is highly misplaced and not based on facts . "

Yet the British Empire was crucial to Scotland 's place in the Union , and it could be argued that the first big step towards Scottish independence came with the independence of India and the other colonies . A thwarted desire for empire was why Scotland had assented to the 1707 union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current referendum seeks to end . And the Empire the British offered then was the glue that got them to stay in it . <p> It is a story that starts , like many Scottish stories , with disaster and drink . The disaster was the Darien scheme , an ambitious attempt for Scotland to grow abroad as other European countries were doing in the 17th century . Scotland was technically independent then , only joined to England by a common monarch , but in practice found itself marginalised by powerful English interests , like the East India Company ( EIC ) which managed to restrict Scotland 's access to borrowing funds from abroad . <p> The EIC was then rapidly expanding its control in India and perhaps this persuaded Scottish leaders they needed their own colonies . Without access to foreign funds , they raised what they could within Scotland and picked the Gulf of Darien in Panama as the place from where to build a Scottish empire . But the expeditions that sailed , in 1698 and 1699 , almost instantly failed in the hot , malarial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland 's wealth . This dire financial situation pushed the Scottish elites into considering an offer of union with England . <p> The English offer came from the events of 1688 when the strongly Protestant country deposed King James II for being Catholic , and put his daughter Mary , and her Dutch husband William on the throne . James 's supporters , the Jacobites , kept plotting to regain control and since the royal family was Scottish ( James 's grandfather , James VI of Scotland , succeeded Elizabeth I as James I of England ) one logical way would have been to invade Scotland and claim its throne . When Mary 's sister Anne became Queen in 1702 the English government decided to secure the throne by merging the kingdoms -- and the nearly bankrupt Scottish leaders agreed . <p> Ship to India <p> Some nobles benefitted from the Union , but it was very unpopular with most Scots -- and the current campaign shows that some of that passion never died . Edinburgh was demoted from a capital to a provincial centre . Scotland 's merchants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminated against them . And for the staunchest Jacobites the only option was exile , especially after a last attempt to retake Scotland failed in 1745 . <p> The English at first mostly ignored Scottish discontent , but events like the tax riots of 1725 forced their attention . The tax was on malt , the basic ingredient in beer and whisky , which was hitting Scots where it hurt . The furious reaction made Sir Robert Walpole , the Prime Minister , realise appeasement was needed -- and India was the answer . " It was to be bribery , but there were few lay or ecclesiastical preferments in Scotland to spread around . Only the abundance of EIC favours saved the day , " writes George K.McGilvary , in his paper ' The Scottish Connection with India , 1725-1833 . ' <p> It worked neatly . Walpole and his successors pushed the EIC to absorb as many Scots as it could . For the Scottish elites this was an ideal route on which to push younger sons and brothers , and in return they gave Walpole parliamentary support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes could be made , but since no one wanted to settle there -- unlike with America -- it meant that these fortunes would be invested back into Scotland . India became , as Sir Walter Scott said , " the corn chest for Scotland where we poor gentry must send our younger sons as we send our black cattle to the South . " <p> The EIC , at first dubious about all these Scots , soon realised their benefits . Jacobite exiles , for example , could be recruited to serve in colonial wars with the chance of making good far away from England . As McGilvary notes , the British were fine with this because " should they die there -- as many surely would -- what was the loss ? " One example of these global Scots was David Ochterlony , born in Boston to a father who had left Scotland for America . He joined the EIC army in 1777 and became its leading general and a famous " White Mughal ' , living a life halfway between British and Indian worlds . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full-time EIC employees , even more operated on the profitable margins of official life . They acted as agents , buying opium , indigo and cotton for the EIC , ran ships sailing between home and colonies and set up as merchants dealing with both Westerners and Indians . <p> As the EIC 's power grew it was increasingly criticised in the UK , requiring the occasional tactical withdrawal -- and the Scots would step in . For example , in 1787 when the EIC banned officials from personal commercial activities , " EIC officials now switched funds to those free merchants ( an overwhelming number of them Scots ) who had set up as Houses of Agency , " writes McGilvary . <p> These Scottish merchant firms include many names still known today : Andrew Yule , Forbes Forbes &amp; Campbell , Balmer Lawrie . McGilvary estimates that between 1725-1833 around 3,500 Scotsmen ( and they were mostly men ) worked in India , and were remitting from ? 500,000 to ? 750,000 per annum back home , " a colossal stimulus to life in Scotland . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions , built bridges and railways , were lawyers and accountants . On November 30th , 1932 , the St.Andrew 's Day article in ToI noted that the 1931 census found 12,697 Scots ( including 2,529 women by now ) in India , a big figure for a sparsely populated country ( and this would not include the many Anglo-Indians of Scottish parentage ) . <p> Special Relationship <p> In later years , during the endless speeches at St.Andrew 's dinners -- all reported in full in ToI , whose journalists must have dreaded the event -- many would expound on their special relationship with India which came , essentially , from not being English . Scots claimed to be more democratic , meritocratic and understanding of the bonds of clan or community , which better suited them to dealing with Indians . <p> But as Elizabeth Buettner points out sharply in ' Haggis in the Raj : Private and Public Celebrations of Scottishness in Late Imperial India ' such claims ignored the fact that the dinners excluded women -- one patronising toast was always made " To The Lassies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in the jute mills . And far from supporting Indian interests , most of the attendees opposed nationalism and its threat to their business , and attacked the government for any concessions . <p> Real Scottish support for Indians came from Scottish missionaries , and some officials like A.O.Hume , who helped start the Indian National Congress . They had been educated in the open , rational and questioning tradition of the Scottish Enlightenment in which men like David Hume and Adam Smith used their distance from centres of orthodoxy like London and Oxford to make Edinburgh an independent minded intellectual powerhouse . Religion was also a fiercely debated subject in Scotland , and while this could result in fundamentalism , it also lead to more tolerance and interest in different beliefs than was evident with the staid official Anglicanism of England . <p> One example was the engagement of Scottish missionaries in Bombay with the bhakti poet Tukaram . Philip Constable has written of the connection Protestant missionaries felt between Tukaram 's use of colloquial Marathi and intense advocacy of a direct connection with God , unmediated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant faith . <p> They also loved his poetry where imaginative language combined with simple , everyday subjects , a hallmark of Romantic poetry which lead the Reverand Dugald Mackichan , principal of Wilson College in Bombay to call him " the Robert Burns of Maharashtra " , the highest possible compliment from a Scot . <p> Other Scottish missionaries studied the Jains , who were little known to Western scholars then , and often considered a Hindu sect . The Scots , whose ultimate aim was , of course , conversion , were fascinated to discover Jain critiques of Hinduism , which some hoped to use to convert Hindus on an intellectual level , while bhakti traditions could be used for more mass appeal . <p> How much they succeeded is questionable , but they left a lasting educational legacy in Western India through schools ( Bombay Scottish , Cathedral ) and colleges ( Wilson , named after John Wilson who became Moderator of the Church of Scotland and Elphinstone , named after a Scottish aristocrat who was Governor of Bombay ) . <p> Full Circle <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements that were invoked in one of the last St.Andrews dinners before Independence . This was in Madras in 1938 and in recognition of what was clearly coming the Scots finally invited an Indian leader , C.Rajagopalachari ( Rajaji ) . <p> Rajaji was a good guest -- perhaps it helped that he was Tamil , a community once called the Scots of India -- making a witty speech , telling his hosts " It is very pleasing to see a strange ceremony of another people , with the various odd names of dishes and the strange unreadable poetry you have written ... I assure you it is more curious than a Hindu marriage . " He did draw the line at trying the haggis though " the components of which after enquiry from the Surgeon General did not much encourage me ... " Clearly no vegetarian version was available then . <p> But then Rajaji got to a more sensitive issue . The Scots , he acknowledged , had contributed much to India , and some might feel they deserved to continue running it . This Indians could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand our ambition to be a denial of what you have done . You have done very well and you wish to do well in this country . But there is a pleasure in being left to serve one 's own country ; that is all we ask of you .

Section 2(1) ( ja ) of the Act defines " inventive step " to mean " a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art " . <p> If an invention lacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered as valid grounds for opposition for the grant of a patent , under section 25 ( 1 ) ( e ) and 25 ( 2 ) ( e ) and for revocation under section 64 ( 1 ) ( f ) of the Act . <p> This case can be considered to be the most important case in interpretation of inventive step in the Indian jurisdiction . Though the case was decided in 1978 , the principles laid down in the case are followed even today and have been codified in the Indian Patent Act . <p> The plaintiff ( Hindustan Metal Industries , a registered partnership firm carrying on the business of manufacturing brass and German silver utensils at Mirzapur ) in this case claimed to have invented a device and method for manufacturing utensils , introducing improvement , convenience , speed , safety and better finish , in the old prevalent method which was fraught with risk to the workers , in as much as the utensils used to fly off from the headstock , during the manufacturing process . The plaintiff got the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Designs Act , 1911 on May 6 , 1951 with effect from December 13 , 1951 . In September 1952 , the plaintiff learnt that the defendant ( Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam , a concern carrying on the business of manufacturing dishes and utensils in Mirzapur ) was using and employing the method under the former 's patent . The plaintiff served a notice upon the defendant asking him to desist from infringing the plaintiff 's patent and further claim damages for Rs. 3000 . The validity of the patent was challenged by defendants on the ground of lack of novelty and inventive step and also filed a counter claim praying for the revocation of the plaintiff 's patent on the same ground . A division bench of a district court of Allahabad started its analysis of inventive step and after considering the prior art in the case , stated that the patented invention was merely an application of an old invention , known for several decades before the plaintiff 's patent , which was no more than a workshop improvement . The court as a result had issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made appeals to a division bench of the High Court , where the appellate bench concluded that the method of manufacture did not involve any inventive step or novelty . Furthermore , as the invention was publicly used by the patent holder before the date of filing of the patent application , the Court observed that the novelty of the invention was negated . In the light of its analysis , the court concluded that the invention lacked novelty and inventive step . <h> ASSESSMENT OF INVENTIVE STEP <p> If , a product or a process is novel , the next question that arises is " Is the approach obvious and if it not then what is the depth of the inventive measures taken by the inventor " . To determine obviousness is to find out whether the person , with ordinary skill in the art , would have come up with similar innovation for the technical problem under similar circumstances without being provided with the solution . <p> Since the Patents Act ( 1970 ) was brought into force , there have been a few cases in India that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court held that obviousness has to be strictly and objectively judged . The Supreme Court further recognized that obviousness is something that is a natural suggestion of what was previously known . <p> A test to determine whether a document can negate the existence of inventive step is as follows : <p> Had the document been placed in the hands of a competent craftsman ( or engineer as distinguished from a mere artisan ) , endowed with the common general knowledge at the ' priority date ' , who was faced with the problem solved by a patentee but without knowledge of the patented invention , would he have said , " this gives me what I want " . To put it in another form : " was it for practical purposes obvious to a skilled worker , in the field concerned , in the state of knowledge existing at the date of the patent to be found in the literature then available to him , that he would or should make the invention the subject of the claim concerned ? " <h> Novartis v. Union of India case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of patent for chemical compound called Imatinib Mesylate which is a therapeutic drug for chronic myeloid leukemia and certain kinds of tumours and is marketed under the names " Glivec " or " Gleevec " at the Chennai Patent Office on July 17 , 1998 . In the application it claimed that the invented product , the beta crystal form of Imatinib Mesylate , has more beneficial flow properties better thermodynamic stability and lower hygroscopicity than the alpha crystal form of Imatinib Mesylate and further claimed that the aforesaid properties makes the invented product novel . The patent application had attracted five ( 5 ) pre-grant oppositions in terms of section 25(1) of the Act . The Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs heard all the parties , on December 15 , 2005 , as provided under rule 55 of the Patent Rules , 2003 , and rejected the appellant 's ( Novartis ) application for grant of patent to the subject by 5 ( five ) separate , though similar , orders passed on January 25 , 2006 on the opposition petitions . The Assistant Controller held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication , i.e. , the Zimmermann patent ; that the invention claimed by the appellant was obvious to a person skilled in the art in view of the disclosure provided in the Zimmermann patent specifications . The Supreme Court of India rejected Novartis patent plea on April 1 , 2013 <h> Person skilled in the art <p> Obviousness is judged based on the hypothetical construct of a " person of ordinary skill in the art " . The person of ordinary skill in the art must : <p> belong to the relevant field . <p> look at the prior art from a position of his personality , considering his/her interest in risk taking . <p> be well aware of the fact that even a small structural change in a product or in a procedure can produce dramatic functional changes . <p> The person of ordinary skills in the art must be given the problem and asked whether he can solve it . This is what is referred to as the ' Hindsight Element ' . Obviousness is not established by drawing a line from the solution to the problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is not permissible to look at the invention and try and figure out the logic behind it and then look for prior art documents which support disclosures throwing light on such logic . Therefore , the person of ordinary skill in the art would constantly be conditioned by the prior art and , before taking action , would carefully ponder any possible modification , change or adjustment against the background of the existing knowledge . <h> CONCLUSION <p> India has been witnessing an increase in patent enforcement activities . Going forward , one can anticipate much more refined tests for determining the presence of inventive step in inventions . It is recommended that patent practitioner keep themselves educated about this fascinating topic of " inventive step/obviousness " and provide informed opinions . <p> About the author : Hemanth Puttaiah has extensive experience in delivering patent consulting services in the software engineering domain .

@@2865233 <p> Bombay HC : What every junior counsel needs to know ... So you want to become a litigator on the Original Side of the Bombay High Court ? Are you dreaming of becoming the next superstar Bombay counsel like Fali Nariman or Janak Dwarkadas ? <p> As you 're beginning your career , here are a few things you might want to know : <h> 1 . It 's all about appearances <p> If you 're a counsel in Bombay , you have to make yourself seen in court . On the Original Side of the Bombay High Court , that means that you have to sit in the library on the 2nd floor , and visit the Bar Association room on the 3rd floor , ever so often . You have to become a familiar face , so that solicitors recognise you and eventually give you work . <p> In fact , it 's said that you should sit in the Original Side library all day during court hours . <p> Now , here 's the catch -- you wo n't actually get any work done in the Original Side library . <p> There are no plug points where you can plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , but it does n't work . <p> It 's too noisy with too many distractions . <p> There is very little place on the tables for you to keep your papers . <p> In fact , to a very large extent , the Original Side library on the 2nd floor is meant to be nothing more than a waiting room , where lawyers sit , wait and often socialize until their cases " reach " , i.e. , until their cases get called out before the judge . <p> As a junior counsel , though , you have to act like you 're working in the library -- you have to be seen ordering books there and reading . That will give solicitors the impression that you 're busy , and so you will get work , or at least that 's the idea . <p> There is one more thing you need to know about the library though -- it has a many books that you might not find in your senior 's chamber , and so it 's important to be able to know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange place <p> As alluded to above , the Original Side library on the 2nd floor of the Bombay High Court is quite a strange place . <p> First of all , there 's an informal system of assigned seating . <p> Everyone recognizes that there 's one table ( at the far end of the main room as you walk in ) which is the " Tulzapurkar " table , where the Tulzapurkar brothers sit . Another table , in the center of the room , is the extended Chagla table -- where Iqbal Chagla and others from the Khursetjee Bhabha chamber ( including the likes of Janak Dwarkadas and JP Sen ) sit . <p> If you 're a junior to one senior counsel , it would be considered very odd if you sit at another table in the library without good reason . <p> So , for example , a Chagla junior would n't be caught dead sitting at the Tulzapurkar table , if he can help it . Of course , it goes without saying that you have to give your seat to a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library . <p> Second , the manner in which you have to order books in the Original Side library is a bit odd . While seated at your table , you have to raise your hand , snap your fingers loudly to catch the attention of a librarian , and then yell out the name of the book you want . <p> It all looks a little colonial to me . I can imagine some white British lawyer sahib yelling out in 1875 in the High Court library , " Eh , coolie , Contract Act laao " . <p> Can you imagine sitting in the library at Oxford or Yale , and ordering librarians to get you books like this ? <p> Third , it 's very hard to identify who the librarians are in the library when you 're starting out . <p> That 's because many lawyers ' peons also sit and wait in the library where the librarians sit . So when you raise your hand , snap your fingers , and call for a book , do n't be surprised if the librarian you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ librarian at all -- he might be some lawyer 's peon. <h> 3 . No attorney-client privilege <p> There 's another thing you 're likely to notice when you start your career as a counsel . <p> There 's almost no attorney-client privilege at the Bombay High Court . <p> Lawyers often conduct conferences in the library on the 2nd floor , or in the Bar Association room on the 3rd floor . These can be heard by anyone who 's sitting nearby . I find it extremely strange that lawyers discuss strategies with clients in open areas like this . It 's also sometimes embarrassing to conduct a conference when your friends are nearby . <h> 4 . You will start slow <p> No matter who you are or what your family background is , you will get very little work in the beginning . <p> On the Original Side , you will get few or no chances to appear and argue ( even less so if you do n't belong to a " legal family " ) . <p> Your senior at the Bar will pay you no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- it ensures that you 're not an employee for your senior , and that you can take outside work as well . <h> 5 . There are many entry barriers to litigation <p> You will often see that there are two kinds of lawyers who become counsel : ( i ) children of lawyers or judges ; or ( ii ) children of business families . <p> There are a few reasons why this is so : <p> First , counsel practice is a big risk . <p> You make little or no money in the beginning . If you have to pay rent or earn money to provide for your family , counsel practice is not for you , because you wo n't make enough money for at least a few years . <p> As a consequence , it 's only if you come from a reasonably well-off family and if you have a flat to stay in without paying rent that you can afford to become a counsel . It 's only the sons/daughters of lawyers/judges ( or those from business families who are reasonably secure financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Second , getting a position in the chamber of a senior counsel is very hard in Bombay . <p> There are reasons for this . When you join a senior in Bombay , you join that senior for life . <p> The senior does n't pay you anything , and that means that he ca n't fire you . He 's stuck with you for the rest of his life . <p> That means that a senior will be very cautious before taking someone on as a junior . If law firms like Amarchand , AZB or J Sagar hire newbie nobody lawyers from a National Law School , and then do n't like their work , they can always get rid of them . <p> Not so for a counsel , which is why it 's so hard to get into a senior 's chamber in Bombay . <p> As a result , it 's usually only the sons/daughters of the well-connected -- again , children of lawyers/judges or businessmen ( businessmen who have hired senior counsel in the past and so know them well ) -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moot courts were a joke <p> If you enjoyed mooting as a law student , and thought that you would get into litigation because of it , you 're in for a rude shock . <p> First of all , moot courts were all about the law , but litigation is about facts . <p> In moots , students often skip the facts by saying something like " if your Lordships are conversant with the facts of the case , I will come to my arguments in law ... " <p> This is unheard of in counsel practice on the Original Side of the Bombay High Court . In fact , it 's often said that law schools teach you to apply complex law to simple facts , whereas in litigation , you apply simple law to complex facts . <p> Second , preparing memorials for moot courts does not train you for preparing pleadings on the Original Side . <p> Memorials are like written submissions , which come only at the end of a heavy case . Preparing pleadings , on the other hand , is nothing like writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where you have to respond to each and every paragraph of the pleadings made by your opponent ( the process is called making " para-wise denials " ) and you have to " deny and dispute " everything which goes against you . <p> On a lighter note , you will learn to use redundant repetitions while drafting in counsel practice . For example , you will write phrases like " deny and dispute " or " repeat and reiterate " often . <p> Third , you will never get the luxury of only preparing for one case for several months , like a moot court . Often , the papers will come to you only a week before the case comes on board . Often , you will have many matters to work on such that you ca n't give all your time and thought to just one case . <p> Oh , and one last thing . <p> When someone asks you for your " number " in court , do n't give them your cell number . They 're only asking what your number is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at @VakilBombay and is a Junior Counsel of the Bombay High Court . Learning to count only in gms .

But how is Vishal Kanade allowed to practice in the same court in which his father is a sitting judge ? ? ? It reminds me of the controversy of Justice D.B. Bhosle sometime back ! <p> The Bombay HC senior does n't pay you anything.Seniors in Delhi HC do , and some of them pay their juniors pretty well.If the Delhi litigation market has gradually evolved little liberally towards juniors , why cant the same happen in Bombay ? <p> And Wadia Ghandy also think that they have become senior counsels .

Some infor on AS would also be useful . ( Not in this article : if the author chooses to focus on the OS , that is his prerogative . So this isnt a criticism of this wonderful article , but just some thoughts which LI may wish to follow up on ? ) <p> The OS has a lot of trial matters : the bulk of the work on the appellate side consists of second appeals and WPs . In second appeals , one comes the closest to a moot ( where the facts are more or less admitted and specific questions of law are framed prior to the final hearing ) . / The Appellate Side Bar has much less " glory " than OS practice , but arguably contributes more to the development of the law as such . It has also produced excellent advocates : Justice Gajendragadkar is an illustration . On the AS , juniors are paid by seniors and are also allowed to take up matters on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : people do filing as well as appearing themselves ( though some have now begun a more ' pure counsel ' practice ) . The OS Bar is dominated by Parsis and Sindhis , the AS by Marathis ( perhaps because the OS has a lot of work from the solicitor firms of Bombay , while the AS has all its work from the " mofussil " of old times and cities outside Bombvay where the solicitor culture was not at all dominant ) . In the AS , it is not important to " be seen " in the right places : most work for juniors comes from direct referrals from the senior , or from matters where the junior appears and argues in the absence of a senior . It is easier to argue and appear as a junior on the AS than the OS . The work isnt as " glamorous " : there are not as many hard commercial disputes ; but the work involves optically less glamorous areas ( which , IMHO , have more legal nuances ) such as property , family laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comfortable with working at " LAW " as opposed to running around for interim reliefs , the AS Bar in Bombay is an excellent place .

He also used to file vakalatnamas earlier ( either through himself or through his juniors from the same office ) . Other than Anturkar , Mr Thorat had a large practice . Mr. Apte is a leading counsel , so is Mr. Kumbhakoni . Inamdar in income tax was designated senior a couple of years ago .

Bulk of AS judgments are final disposals in Writs , Family Court appeals and Second appeals . Bulk of OS reported judgments arise out of Notices of Motion and Chamber Summons : again indicating the different type of practice . On the OS , considering the commercial nature of most disputes , the focus is on motions etc. rather than final hearings in suits . ( I am ignoring the Income Tax final judgments : as I said earlier , all ITXA are filed on the OS , whether the ITAT Bench is in Mumbai or in Pune ) This is quite natural : as a court of first instance , the focus will be on factual disputes as pointed out in the article also . The law points are argued at an interim stage , or at stages of pleadings for amendment , return of plaint etc ; hence the bulk of reported judgments are in final hearings of interim motions rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend of the bar is Mr.Iqbal Chagla .

They deplore any comparison between the kingdom 's execution of convicted criminals and Islamic State 's extra-judicial killing of innocent hostages . <p> But rights activists say they are more concerned by the justice system behind the death penalty in the kingdom than by its particular method of execution . And critics of the Al Saud ruling family say the latest wave of executions may have a political message , with Riyadh determined to demonstrate its toughness at a moment of regional turmoil . <p> Saudi royal guards stand on duty ( Getty Image 's Photo ) <p> Saudi Arabia beheaded 26 people in August , more than in the first seven months of the year combined . The total for the year now stands at 59 , compared to 69 for all of last year , according to Human Rights Watch . <p> " It 's possible the executions were used as intimidation and flexing of muscles .

" <p> A spokesman for Saudi Arabia 's justice ministry was not immediately available to explain the upsurge in executions in August , or to answer other questions about the kingdom 's use of the death penalty . <p> ' Particularly egregious ' <p> Whatever the reason for the timing , the wave of executions at the same time as jihadis in Iraq and Syria were beheading captives has brought new scrutiny to the practices of a country whose values are so different from those of its Western allies . <p> While Saudi Arabia has joined US-led air strikes against Islamic State in Syria and has deployed its senior clergy to denounce militant ideology , its public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like adultery , apostasy and witchcraft , is anathema to Western allies . <p> " Any execution is appalling , but executions for crimes such as drug smuggling or sorcery that result in no loss of life are particularly egregious , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch . <p> Some diplomats have said the increase may be only a quirk of timing , as the appointment of more judges has allowed courts to clear a backlog of appeal cases , and as the rise began after the end of Ramadan , when fewer executions traditionally occur . <p> But the interpretation of it as a show of strength appeared to be reinforced last week by the sentencing to death of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr , a member of the Sunni-ruled kingdom 's Shi'ite minority who had backed protests in 2011 . <p> Two other men , one of whom was younger than 18 at the time of the protests , have also been sentenced for their part in the demonstrations and were convicted of having thrown petrol bombs . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced for , instigating sedition , it shows they want to make sure they stop any form of activism , " said Mai Yamani , a Saudi-born political analyst in London . <p> More than a dozen people convicted of terrorism or Sunni Islamist militancy have also been sentenced to death this year . <p> Black magic , adultery and apostasy <p> Under the Saudi Sharia legal system it can actually be harder to avert execution for crimes without a specific victim , like drug smuggling , than for murder . <p> Of the 59 people executed by Oct. 16 , 22 had been convicted for smuggling drugs , according to figures compiled by Human Rights Watch from Saudi media reports . <p> One Saudi man , Mohammed Bakr al-Alaawi , was put to death for sorcery so far this year , the third such case since 2011 . Although such cases are even rarer , judges can also demand execution for adulterers or Muslims who abandon their faith . <p> In Saudi Islamic law , charges of violent crimes like murder are usually brought under the system of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an eye . <p> While a murderer would normally be sentenced to death , the victim 's family is permitted to accept " diyya " , or blood money , instead of execution . The lives of women are worth half those of men , and non-Muslims a fraction of the value of Muslims . <p> Convicts from less wealthy backgrounds , or without tribal connections who might intercede with the family or tribe of the victim , are more likely to die because it is harder for them to arrange a blood money payment . <p> For other crimes , the punishment is usually up to the judge , employing his own interpretation of ancient Muslim texts . When there is no victim , there is no victim 's family to offer mercy at a price . Saudi Arabia has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules , and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases predictable based on past practice . <p> Bassim Alim , who defended 17 men who were sentenced to up to 30 years jail in 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , said judges saw no need for many protections seen as fundamental in the west , like ensuring defendants had legal representation . <p> " The judge actually told one of the accused to my face : ' Why do you need a lawyer ?

@@2865240 <h> Is the proposed restructuring of MNREGA desirable ? <p> MNREGA is primarily an employment guarantee programme with an equally important objective of creating durable , productive assets for the local communities . Photo : Mint <p> The present central government of India rode high into the office , promising development with good governance . This certainly was a welcome signal to organizations like ours working at grassroots who experience , day after day , that good-intentioned social policies get stuck in ill-designed programmes . There is a huge governance deficit in the delivery of social development programmes . Hence , we have been closely following the announcements of the ministry of rural development to look for desirable changes in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MNREGA ) . However , some of the recent developments have left us feeling disenchanted about the development and governance ideas of the government . <p> MNREGA is for the entire rural , adult population without any criteria for getting employment . As long as one is ready to do hard manual work , one can demand and get work at the notified wage . Since state governments needed to build administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to provide specific benefits to selected beneficiaries as per the criteria of particular schemes ) , the programme was unfolded in three phases . The first phase consisted of the most needy , backward 200 districts across the country . <p> Restricting MNREGA <p> Now there is a move that the programme be scaled back to just these 200 backward districts . This will translate to fewer people and villages benefitting from the programme , and to a reduction of fund requirement . However , there are serious , multi-dimensional consequences of this decision . <p> One , the need for MNREGA is the need of all those rural people who have been deprived of public investment in roads , agriculture-related basic infrastructure ( example , water bodies , land development , irrigation capabilities and soil and water conservation treatment structures ) . It is the need of all rural people that are entirely dependent on kharif ( single season ) crop and hence , on rain . <p> Education and health services rendered to their regions are abysmal ; hence , public investment in human capital is lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed these backward regions , were never utilised and hence , the populace is either unemployed or underemployed for a major part of the year . <p> These people need meaningful employment . Otherwise , the only option is forced or distress migration , which is obviously not a solution but rather a more dreadful response to an unjust situation . In general , migration of choice may lead to better prospects , but not a move out of the frying pan into the fire . <p> Given this situation , what can the rationale be for restricting the programme to 200 districts ? How can any government use districts as the unit of selection , and not blocks or gram panchayats ( village councils ) or households ? If we agree , in principle , that there are people who are in this situation , then all those people need MNREGA employment on demand . What is the rationale for providing it to people in some districts and not others ? <p> Administrative boundaries do not define poverty and need . Demand by the people can be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data clearly shows that the uptake of jobs has been in non-kharif seasons and primarily in non-irrigated and non-industrial regions . If there is agriculture and industrial growth , then MNREGA demand will decrease on its own . Hence , restricting it does not make either economic or governance sense . <p> Second , the identification of targeted beneficiaries has been found to be a problem in the delivery of all other social development programmes . MNREGA addressed this problem creatively by making the programme demand based -- whoever is ready to do unskilled manual labour at the notified wage can demand work . <p> This automatically transcends the hurdles and hassles typically involved in becoming a beneficiary of other social programmes . In the case of MNREGA , one may need work in a particular month but may not in the next month . This essentially gives the beneficiary a choice and as a result , there is no fixed beneficiary base of the programme . <p> Typically , natural calamities like drought or heavy rains that directly affect agriculture production influence MNREGA uptake in the affected regions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such situations , people have to wait for the government to recognize the problem , address it with some scheme and provide relief in due course . We are well aware of what happens to such relief support . <p> In addition to providing work during stressful periods , MNREGA also enables rebuilding infrastructure that may have been destroyed due to the natural calamity . Again , how can any government decide who needs MNREGA in any particular period ? Is n't it best left to the people to decide ? <p> Third , the proposal to restrict MNREGA to just a few districts can create an administrative nightmare . MNREGA districts might start getting migrants from adjacent districts that are in need of work . This will increase the burden on resources including administrative capabilities of already backward districts . <p> Wage component <p> The other forthcoming policy change that is of significance is the change in ratio of expenditure on labour ( unskilled wages ) and material components . So far , it has been 60:40 ; a ratio of 51:49 is being proposed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less on unskilled labour for whose benefit the scheme has been formulated . <p> MNREGA is primarily an employment guarantee programme with an equally important objective of creating durable , productive assets for the local communities . Spending less on the wage component for unskilled labour undermines the primary objective with no assurance that it can qualitatively impact the durability and utility of assets produced . <p> Under MNREGA , water bodies have been created that have helped provide irrigation in rain-fed areas , and land development activities have been undertaken to bring more land under cultivation . These are basic requirements for agriculture growth . And these structures do not require more material but more technical input in terms of better designs . <p> Moreover , calculating the ratio at the district level instead of gram panchayat level is also problematic . It implies that the material and unskilled wage component may get spent in different regions of the same district . In all likelihood , the politically strong panchayat samitis will keep more of the material component , leaving the unskilled wage component for the less politically vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rationale of spending more on material so as to create better assets ? How can the government ensure that this is rationally determined ? <p> Keeping the promise <p> Administration of a massive programme like MNREGA is complex by its very design . Yet , it has shown quite a few firsts in its implementation with novel accountability and transparency measures . Now , the same can be used in all other social development programmes of the government . Yes , there are reports of leakages , diversion of funds and inefficiencies in administration . But the more important concerns are the delays in wage payments and suppressed or unrealised demand for work . <p> Addressing these implementation issues is a challenge that we have been grappling with over the years . But the fact that the challenge exists and that it is difficult to address it , should not be a reason for shirking responsibilities . Instead , the response should be to take on the challenges and find ways and means of improving governance of such programmes . <p> This Act was passed by the parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment made by the State . And this government has come to power with the catchphrase of good governance . Now is the time to make a breakthrough with better governance practices so as to implement this programme to realise its full potential - and not to scuttle it . <p> Ashwini Kulkarni is a member of the National Consortium of Civil Society Organisations working on MNREGA <p> Published with permission from Ideas for India , an economics and policy portal .

@@4853233 <h> Addressing patriarchal entitlement is more crucial than teaching women to be safe . <p> I am writing this a day before an unfortunate second anniversary , December 16 , a day etched in our collective memory as signifying the horror and pain so many women experience for no other reason than that they are women . <p> But before going into the grim reality of how little has changed since that winter evening in Delhi in 2012 , there is some good news . After my last column about a woman taxi driver , who incidentally worked for one of the new taxi aggregators that have now been banned in some cities , there is some encouraging news . The Mumbai transport department has issued 200 licenses exclusively for women taxi drivers ; Hyderabad is launching a women 's service ; in Chennai , a non-government organisation is training women drivers , and a taxi aggregator has announced that they will encourage more women to be hired . <p> This is good news . But let us not confuse this with women 's safety . While women taxi drivers would be reassuring for women passengers , particularly late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , like Delhi , women drivers are not safe . The mere sight of a woman behind a wheel seems to trigger primitive instincts in men who proceed to harass them by chasing them , trying to push them off the road and generally making life hell for them . Given these attitudes , who will guarantee the safety of the women taxi drivers ? How can we be sure that male passengers will not harass them ? Or will they have to stick to women passengers , an unsustainable business model . So , even if more women taxi drivers would be welcome , this can not be viewed as a quick fix to deal with women 's safety . It is important because it gives women a livelihood option , one that carries with it a sense of dignity and self-worth . <p> The bad news is that despite a renewed focus on women 's safety , triggered by the December 6 rape in a private taxi in Delhi , the underlying issue has once again been overlooked . While no one disputes that the new app-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruption that allows serial rapists and offenders to buy character certificates from the police must be checked ; this alone can not guarantee women 's safety . <p> What is the other option ? The safety of a prison ; one where women are told when and if to step out ? Or the example of those two plucky Rohtak sisters , Pooja and Aarti , who chose to thrash their tormenters rather than sit back and tolerate ? We already know how that story has played out . From being celebrated , and even promised a special commendation by the Haryana government , suddenly the victims have become the villains and the men are being projected as victims of a game of blackmail . <p> I happened to be in Delhi recently when Pooja and Aarti spoke to the press . They faced a room full of journalists , the majority sceptical and even slightly hostile . The girls were remarkable in the calm way they answered all questions . To me , they came across as straightforward and gritty . In a state , where the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where girls are simply not wanted , where every girl grows up in a highly sexualised atmosphere particularly when she enters the public space , the spirit of these two girls has to be lauded . They travel each day almost 35 km to their college and have to change two buses to do this . Their mother has backed them fully in their desire to study , as has their father . Coming from such a family , these girls have been encouraged not to take so-called ' teasing ' by being quiet . <p> Without going into the minutiae of this controversial case , we should look at the issues it raises . Given the reality of constant harassment by men of women , particularly in north India , should we train our daughters to fight back as did Pooja and Aarti ? Even as I applaud their courage , I fear for them because they are greatly outnumbered . More so , because no one supported them on the bus and since then there is a clear strategy to discredit their evidence . Such a battering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If these two sisters survive and win their case , it will be all the more remarkable . <p> Instead of seeing women 's safety as a technical issue to be fixed by putting in place ' safer ' transport -- both private and public -- or training girls to fight back if harassed , we need to realise that ultimately there is no shortcut to dismantling the institution of patriarchy , an institution that gives all men a sense of entitlement to beat , harass , rape , kill , injure those women who dare to question their authority . <p> sharma.kalpana@yahoo.com <p> The views expressed in this column are that of the author 's and do not represent those of the newspaper .

@@4853235 <h> Corey Anderson out of first Test <p> New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson will miss the first Test against Sri Lanka , which starts in Christchurch from December 26 , due to a groin strain .

But I 'm not sure you are watching the same Ross Taylor - Test average around 46 suggests he 's pretty useful . His ODI average of 42 is also pretty good . He may not be the most graceful player around , but his record speaks for itself - cricket is at least as much a head game as technique , which is why both his ODI and test averages a far superior to McCullum 's . Taylor has earned the right to be called " quality " , unlike Mohammad Irfan , who it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast bowler " - his record does n't show that , and he has n't really played enough games yet either . Taylor has also scored hundreds against all the major test nations both in NZ and abroad . Watling is a good player , but NZ is looking for a fast scoring keeper to bat in the middle order , so he 's not suitable . <p> twistatwistaa on December 23 , 2014 , 6:34 GMT <p> @ leo - watlings last performances against india , westindies and pakistan he played like a fighter and won Nz matches . mccullum scored 300 + but if watling would not have stood by his side it would have been different story . yes he has been given chance in past but now he has Matured . do nt you think so ? and also his wicket keeping skills are immaculate . your right his only problem is his strike rate . maybe thats why Nz select ronchi over him . but that is no reason to leave a quality player like him out of the side its not t20 but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family mem that i keep praising him but he promises so much and values his wicket . Kiwis are not minos but if they keep selecting n mcullum j neesham l ronchi etc they for sure will remain minos and they only have to blame themselves for it . <p> Crickleo on December 23 , 2014 , 1:54 GMT <p> Rutherford and Bracewell should not be welcomed back to BLACKCAPS selection , Rutherford is absolutely useless and Brownlie is a far more competent batsman , selecting Rutherford would ruin the progress NZ cricket continues to make . Bracewell is n't as bad as Rutherford but he is inconsistent and bowls low 130s , whenever he bowls he loos nonchalant and uninterested and the basic fact is that Milne and Henry are just superior bowlers in every aspect of bowling , same story with Wager . People need to stop assuming that just because a name has been around NZ cricket for a while does n't mean they have the rights to a spot , If Neesham fails again throughout this series then i would think he would n't see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful team , Fulton is an abysmal cricketer who is way past his useby , and a Latham/Watling opening stand would score far to slowly . Watling has been given his opportunity at ODI cricket and his numbers suggest he could n't make the step up . <p> weaselzapper on December 22 , 2014 , 23:41 GMT <p> No way Wagner should be dropped , he 's been awesome and averages 33.8 which is pretty good for a 3rd seamer . Has taken wickets at key moments and stepped up also when Southee and Boult have perhaps been a bit off the boil . I get that Henry and Milne are awesome young talents but ODI and FC form do n't always translate to Test form , and in Milnes case pace is n't everything . Tests are obviously the pinnacle but with the WC coming up this takes precedence at the moment and it would be great to see these guys firing for that as opposed to running the risk of injury/loss of confidence by chucking either in the test team . <p> I guess the juries still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to see him at home . Really like how the guy goes about things though , been great with the bat , a real competitor ( his reaction to his poor shot to get dismissed towards the end of our mammoth innings in Sharjah tells you alot about the bloke I think ) , and good pair of hands . <p> StevieS on December 22 , 2014 , 11:04 GMT <p> kiwiinauz it is early days for henry and they probably do n't want to risk him just before a world cup , Milne is injury prone and they wo n't risk him and McClenaghan is a white ball bowlers , his first class average is n't very good . Bracewell has been in reasonable form and can move the ball and in seaming conditions he is pretty good . <p> how many world cup kiwis have won ? none . its their golden chance but with mcullum opening and going with 2 allrounders i could so well see newzeland getting eliminated again . mccullum is better of at num 3 . num 3 is where all the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low down the order ? he allong with watling could make the perfect opening for newzeland no chance for ronchi and his flukes. even for test matches watling should be promoted up the order and please please please no more allrounders get ish sodhi in he will very well suit australlian conditions <p> twistatwistaa on December 22 , 2014 , 9:39 GMT <p> belive me watling is better player than williamson or taylor . taylor has got a wrong stand . he falls onto the wicket where as he should be standing still and not falling like he does . he bends down too much . which makes it impossible for him to play quality fast bowlers like irfan or other . sachin use to stand b mccullum does the same and all the batsman stand still when bowl is getting delivered and than they alter their position . plus he is a hitter and nothing more than that . neesham never performs with bat so its wrong too call him allrounder . and balls the medium pace ball even does nt seem around . it would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CGKK on December 22 , 2014 , 9:15 GMT <p> The ' Incumbent Opener ' .... or the ' Incumbent third seamer ' . How often do we hear that the so called incumbent player has first rights to any debatable position in the team . Good Lord , what if the incumbent is absolutely ' incompetent ' ... is it his right to be in the team then ? I 'm not saying Rutherford , Bracewall or Wagner are incompetent , they can obviously play . However , what is more obvious to just about every NZ blogger on here , is that Henry or Milne , even at their young age , would be the obvious choices to back up Boult or Southee . I see some people have written ... ' we need Wagner to grind out long spells ' , .. ' someone to bowl the hard yards ! ' Bugger that ! ! .... I will take Henry to take his usual 2 wickets in his first spell or Milne sending down 150k red kookaburras anytime thank you . Is it unpatriotic hoping certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I waited way too long for Tom Latham .... surely not the same for these too boys . <p> Min2000 on December 22 , 2014 , 7:11 GMT <p> Does anyone know anything about the Hagley Oval pitch ? I 'm assuming it will be fairly typical - some pace and bounce , turn on days 4/5 , win the toss and bat first ? <p> SameOld on December 22 , 2014 , 6:39 GMT <p> I ca n't see too much to complain about here . Sodhi is the future , but they ca n't drop someone who just took a 10-for and has a batting average of 40+ , that would be madness . It 's likely Neesham will play in place of Anderson , and Wagner and Rutherford will come back in . While it 'd be harsh on Wagner , I 'd be happy to see Brownlie &amp;/or Bracewell play , too . Both have shown pretty good form recently . With Craig batting so well , maybe they could run Bracewell in place of the out-of-form Neesham , but I doubt they 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , and many young players struggle overseas . I think the selectors will back him to come good . <p> I get that wagner does n't deserve to be dropped , he 's performed very well but its not about that , a better player has come along , someone that is far more likely to take test match wickets in bags , saving henry for the world cup , surely not , surely the more bowling he does at international level in any format is going to improve him as a player , you could save him from the tests and he could get injured in the first one dayer , you do n't know so just pick the best side , if an unlikely injury occurred we actually have the depth to cope , i want henry at the world cup as much as anyone but he should n't miss out on a test spot because of it , he 's earned it and i bet if you asked henry he 'd want to be in that test team . I 'd play 4 seamers in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the srilankans . Test xi 1. latham 2. brownlie 3. williamson 4. taylor 5. mccullum 6. neesham 7. watling 8. bracewell 9. southee 10. wagner 11. boult . <p> youfoundme on December 22 , 2014 , 4:18 GMT <p> I like this squad , and I like the idea of trying Henry and Milne after the world cup . Also , any calls for having Ronchi replace Watling are just silly . Watling is the incumbent , and will be till he finishes because he has cemented his spot . I would be more inclined to say that Watling should take Ronchi 's spot in the limited overs sides , as the latter is an inconsistent batsmen and has been throughout his career . <p> pauln2 on December 22 , 2014 , 3:50 GMT <p> Would have like to have seen Matt Henry in there - he 's building an impressive ODI record and already has good first-class figures . @Moss Kyle - what do you mean , why risk him in test cricket ? Test matches , not World Cup , are the top form of the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner , short of being a left-armer , but we already have a very good one in Trent Boult . I 've only seen Henry go round live once at international level , and he looked very impressive . Wagner can bowl long spells , yes , but he 's hardly likely to rip through a test lineup . Not fast enough to bowl the length he does and does n't swing it . Also a risk to chuck wickets away with no-balls , which is a problem Bracewell has as well . I 've seen Bracewell win two tests - Bulawayo and Hobart - with fourth innings bursts and he can play . If his head 's right , a good choice . No worries about Sodhi missing out , as he wo n't scare the Sri Lankans on NZ pitches . <p> kiwiinauz on December 22 , 2014 , 2:41 GMT <p> I 'm a bit out of the loop here in Aussie , but why no Henry or Milne or McClenaghan ?

With what Watling has done for his country in tests it is his job for a long time yet . Fulton has never had a problem with scoring big runs domestically but has not taken his opportunity against the better quality bowling the next level at 36 is there any point giving him another go .

You need someone who can grind out long spells like Wagner and if you are playing 4 seemers why not the pace of Milne . @SamRoy 10 of 18 of Bracewell 's tests have been on " unresponsive pitches " . <p> on December 21 , 2014 , 21:18 GMT <p> What planet are you on Samroy ? Craig is fresh off the best bowling figures ever in Sharjah by any bowler and that list includes players like shane warne shoaib akhtar mcgrath waqar younis so i guess he is clearly not international standard pretty rubbish with the bat aswell at an average of 42 . Clearly Matt henry is in calculations for the world cup so why would you risk him for the test matches . <p> StevieS on December 21 , 2014 , 20:59 GMT <p> SamRoy you should be glad Matt Henry is n't in the team , well at least until the world cup is over , would n't want him injured . My feeling is the went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is going to be a seamers wicket so spinner may not play a roll . Yes Patel is our best spinner but I think he blew his chance when he turned down the request to play in the WI over county cricket , pride in playing for your country is very important to Hesson . <p> iceaxe on December 21 , 2014 , 18:50 GMT <p> What is Rutherford still doing there ? I 'd shift Latham up the order . Neesham also has to show some form too . Sensible decision though to keep McCullum middle of the order . <p> twistatwistaa on December 21 , 2014 , 17:37 GMT <p> i think peter fulton will never get his chance because he is not an allrounder . <p> on December 21 , 2014 , 11:48 GMT <p> Peter Fulton should have been given a last chance considering his recent form . <p> LALITHKURUWITA on December 21 , 2014 , 11:06 GMT <p> I need Kumar to score anther couple of centuries in this series so that he can close Sachin 's record .

This is another test series that New Zealand can cement their continued improvement and should look to win . <p> ptpt on December 21 , 2014 , 7:30 GMT <p> A lot of discussion on here about the current NZ pace bowlers , at the end of the day you have to ask yourself out of the great talent of bowlers have at the moment in Southee , Boult , Bracewell , Milne , Wagner , and Henry , who is in the best of form currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing really well . Would go on balance with Southee , Boult Milne and Henry , only because Henry had a great last ODI tour and Milne 's pace , but he has also had a good ODI tour . Give these two guys a crack in the test squad while they are young and fit . <p> Crickleo on December 21 , 2014 , 7:12 GMT <p> Very frustrating selection , why persist with Rutherford after so many failures and why persist with Bracewell when we have so much more talent on offer like Henry and Milne .. Craig had a good UAE tour but i still would rather persist with Sodhi as he has the ability to bowl the magic ball . I also think based on current form Ronchi should get the gloves ahead of Watling also , he has a good first class average at a terrific test strike rate . Including injuries the strongest side for the first match would be 1 . Latham 2 . Brownlie 3 . Williamson 4 . Taylor 5 . McCullum 6 . Neesham ( this series should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronchi 8 . Southee 9 . Sodhi 10 . Wagner 11 . Boult . Obviously Craig will play ahead of Sodhi which i do n't agree with . If Rutherford gets the go ahead of Brownlie i will be very frustrated . <p> SamRoy on December 21 , 2014 , 6:13 GMT <p> And Mark Craig is not an international quality spinner . In fact I doubt whether he is first class quality or not . Sodhi also is not international quality . Jeetan Patel is bowling well in county cricket . If Vettori is finished then Patel should be the first choice in tests as he is a much improved bowler . <p> SamRoy on December 21 , 2014 , 6:09 GMT <p> If I was Matt Henry I would be disappointed to not feature in the squad . He bowls good lines , has more pace than Boult and Southee and swings the ball late and can also get some seam movement like Wagner . Looks a terrific prospect at such a young age . Wagner is a hard worker and everyone likes his work ethic . Bracewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful conditions and neither has he done the hard work ( i.e. bowling on unresponsive pitches ) . <p> 4seamers on December 21 , 2014 , 5:27 GMT <p> I hope to see Bracewell in the third seamers role . He is back in form . Was the most influential player when we beat Oz in OZ . <p> I suspect that Craig also got the nod because of his batting . Runs from the lower order will be needed in these conditions . Craig , Southee , Bracewell and Boult are a pretty handy tail . <p> I do n't mind seeing Rutherford or Brownlie opening . They both have potential . Hopefully whoever gets a crack starts to deliver . Ditto for Neesham . <p> At least we have talented players waiting in the wings if things go pear-shaped . <p> Number8Dave on December 21 , 2014 , 5:20 GMT <p> It 's great that there is now the depth in NZ cricket that we can be having this conversation , instead of the case which so often prevails of having half a dozen truly international-quality players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True , there 's still a problem with the openers , but I think Rutherford shows enough promise to be persevered with , and McCullum would be better down the order . Sodhi has that x-factor and I hope he continues to develop in his consistency , but it would be tough to drop Craig after his performance in the Emirates , and his batting ca n't be ignored ( test average of 42.71 ! ) . I too would like to see room made for Henry , but Wagner is really useful for putting in those hard yards . <p> Muruparamadness on December 21 , 2014 , 5:14 GMT <p> I 'm guessing they 're saving Milne and Henery for the wc . Hesson and co have been very clear about wanting to manage players work loads heading into a big tournament . that 's exactly why we have n't seen southee / boult in the pak odi 's and that 's why we wo n't be seeing Milne and /or Henery in the whites until post wc . As much as i cant wait to see milne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with this thinking ... <p> GRJVPR on December 21 , 2014 , 5:10 GMT <p> Sri Lanka always perform well compared to other sub-continent teams in overseas conditions . Will be an exciting series ! <p> CGKK on December 21 , 2014 , 4:38 GMT <p> So often you hear respected cricket commentators say ' do what the opposition least want you to do ' . I wish the NZ selectors would apply this thinking when picking our team . Who would the Sri Lankan batsmen least prefer to face . Henry and Milne ..... or Wagner and Bracewall ? Duh .... appears the NZ selectors think the laters 135k medium pacers will strike fear into the Sri Lankans . How long did we have to wait until Latham replaced Fulton when it was so obvious that his young talent far outweighed Fultons talent as a second slip fielder . Ho hum now we again have Rutherford showing us how to give slips catching practice .... at least the gum he spits out after being dismissed early always hits the middle of his bat . <p> Jordanious77 on December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a leg spinner . In any case , I agree . <p> Tbh we have too much depth . Normally players like Henry or Milne would be almost guarenteed spots in a team . But because Boult and Southee are automatic selections and people are hesitant to play 4 seamers it means theres room for only 1 more bowler . And because Southee/Boult both rely on swing Wagner gets in ahead of a lot more talented bowlers because he grafts hard and picks up wickets with aggressive bowling rather than swinging it . Which is where my problem with the team selection lies .. Who are our best 5 bowlers ? Southee , boult , wagner , henry and Bracewell . And yet , we only play 3 of them because we want to squeeze a spinner into the team when we already have Williamson . I understand why , but I disagree with it regardless . Subcontinent pitches , maybe . But on NZ pitches in the middle of summer where Wellington just got bowled out for 58 by Southee and Boult ? Its a seamer paradise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 21 , 2014 , 4:00 GMT <p> I think Brownlie should get a game ahead of Rutherford and Sodhi should have been picked ahead of Craig too . Sodhi was unlucky not to pick up more wickets in the UAE ( missed stumping , dropped catches etc ) but despite this he looked more threatening . Take away the last test vs Pakistan and Craig 's numbers were pretty poor . Wagner deserves the third seamer spot based on his recent performances when he actually made up for some lackluster spells from Southee and Boult on occasion . My team would be Brownlie , Latham , Williamson , Taylor , McCullum , Neesham , Watling , Southee , Sodhi , Wagner and Boult . More balanced attack than the current team , especially with Williamson being able to bowl his offspin again . <p> Winchester666 on December 21 , 2014 , 3:58 GMT <p> Just thought I 'd at that I 'm not totally against Craigs selection , he 's been picking up wickets and Sodhi has n't . Sodhi needs to get down to business and start studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2014 , 3:52 GMT <p> Agree with my fellow Kiwis here , poor , poor couple of selections &amp; frustrating . Imagine a pace trio of Boult , Southee , &amp; Henry going at it . All are under 26 and could drive NZ to many test victories over the next 6,7 years . Sodhi is also a hugely talented spinner skill-wise , he just does n't know how to set batsman up . They need to force Sodhi to study old tape of Warne so he can learn how to manipulate a batsman . Having said that , this team is still well capable of beating Sri Lanka at home . <p> Snowbadger15 on December 21 , 2014 , 3:47 GMT <p> I would have prefered Sodhi to craig as well but as soon as craig took his 7 wicket haul against pakistan , it was obvious craig woukd be prefered to Sodhi . Agree with @kiwicricketnut , why are the selectors making henry a short format specialist when is in great form at the moment and his first class record is as good as his list a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go . He literally could not do worse than Rutherford and there is n't anymore options for opening in the country , except Latham whose already there , in better form . I would prefer redmond to Rutherford of Brownlie to be honest . I know i will cop some flak for this <p> kiwicricketnut on December 21 , 2014 , 3:14 GMT <p> What does henry have to do to get a test spot , he deserves it , he is the best bowler in the country i reckon , certainly ahead of bracewell and wagner , ca n't make sense of it , hugely dissapointing selection . I know craig had a good last test but he 's better with the bat than the ball , sohdi is the better spinner he 's not just the future of nz spin bowling he should be the here and now , im glad neesham will get a crack in more fimilar conditions , he is n't the first player to be found out on the sub continent , a chance for him to prove his worth and his test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whats the obsession with brownlie lately , he has a couple of good tons i suppose against the best teams in the world but strangely im still not convinced , still rather guptill or even michael bracewell , strong squad but not our strongest thats for sure <p> Sexysteven on December 21 , 2014 , 3:06 GMT <p> Yea just as a opening pair was making some decent starts they are putting mccullum back to the middle order sure mccullum is n't a opener but he 's got to be better then brownlie or Rutherford and even if they do go for adifferent opener I would of thought some new would of been abetter idea I know there 's not a lot of openers around but the chances of Rutherford and brownie failing are very high or maybe wattling to open and ronchi to come in to keep maybe another option if all else fails mark Craig I guess he deserves to keep his place but i still need to be convinced I hope do n't discard Sodhi he 's young and hopefully he will eventually come good Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depth in the pace bowlers I hope Milne gets to play test cricket eventually cos we need his pace that 's for sure <p> CGKK on December 21 , 2014 , 2:54 GMT <p> Oh goodie !

In scheduled areas the eligibility has been fixed at Class V pass . <p> Even as the ruling government argues that this will check embezzlement of funds at the hands of illiterate panchayat level representatives , opposition groups alleged that the move is discriminatory to a large section of the rural population , particularly women among whom the literacy rate is the lowest . In rural Rajasthan , the literacy rate stands at 76.16 percent for males and 45.8 percent for females . <p> Defending the state government 's move , BJP spokesperson Kailash Nath Bhatt told Indian Express , " The Center is spending crores of money on panchayats and this goes directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund embezzlement against these elected representatives in the state and the standard excuse is that ' I am illiterate and put my thumb impression on whatever papers were given to me ' . <p> Earlier the audits were managed by the state government so the accountability was not with the sarpanch but now with funds to the tune of crores coming in for projects like MNREGA and others , there has to be better accountability .

" Dey said that as for embezzlement of funds the accountability should lie with government employees who are trained and qualified for the job . " Be it MPs or MLAs , they do not sign cheques then why do sarpanches have to do so ? Financial accountability should not lie with the sarpanch .

@@4857239 Of 2014 <p> by NDTV Correspondent , 22 December 2014 <p> There have been hundreds of smartphone launches since January 2014 , and as with all product categories , some have been more noteworthy than others . This year , we saw a lot of action especially in the budget space , with products launching at unbelievably low price points and changing all our expectations . At the other end of the spectrum , companies have also dutifully refreshed their flagships ( sometimes more than once ) and set new set of standards for top-end performance . <p> With so much activity , it was almost impossible to choose only ten phones for our list of the most notable phones of the year , but that 's just what we 've done . These cover the gamut from practical to gimmicky and budget-friendly to downright indulgent . Here are the 10 smartphones that made the biggest impact in 2014 . <p> 1 . Sony Xperia Z3 CompactIn a sea of oversized smartphones , the Xperia Z3 Compact stands out , and it proves that you do n't have to deal with a 5-inch ( or bigger ) screen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battery life , this was perhaps our favourite Android smartphone of 2014 . <p> 2. iPhone 6 PlusNot everyone will be pleased with this stretched-out iPhone , and even we had some concerns about its software . That aside , the iPhone 6 Plus ( Review Pictures ) has perhaps the best camera of any smartphone we 've tested this year , and its optical image stabilisation results in unbelievably good low-light performance . <p> 3 . Xiaomi Mi 3Motorola and Asus set the stage for affordable smartphones , but Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi redefined disruptive pricing with its flagship smartphone , the Mi 3 . The Xiaomi Mi 3 ( Review Pictures ) offered powerful specs at just Rs. 13,999 , rivalling a few smartphones that cost more than twice as much . Xiaomi relied solely on word-of-mouth and social networking to promote these phones and still wound up causing virtual stampedes week after week . <p> 4 . Oneplus OneNicknamed the " flagship killer " , the OnePlus One ( Review Pictures ) made a lot of noise when it launched in India . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's USPs , would not be available in India . OnePlus is now working on its own Android fork based on Android 5.0 Lollipop . Adding to the frenzy , OnePlus launched the phone through a single e-commerce channel and in very limited quantities . We liked the OnePlus One and think that it gets really close to being a flagship killer , mostly thanks to its unbeatable price . <p> 5 . Blackberry PassportModelled around an actual Passport , the Blackberry Passport ( Review Pictures ) smartphone had one of the most unique and distinct personalities of any phone we tested this year . The only problems we had with it were its bulkiness and inconsistent third-party app support in the Blackberry 10.3 OS . The conclusion of our review of the phone still sums up our feelings perfectly : " After many , many long years , BlackBerry might finally have done something completely right . " <p> 6 . Motorola Moto EAt face value , the Motorola Moto E ( Review Pictures ) might look like a normal smartphone with no noteworthy features . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India this year because it ushered in a wave of budget smartphones with great performance . It can do a lot of things that only high-end smartphone could do before , and that too without breaking a sweat . Even so , the Moto E does n't have a very good camera and the ' small ' 4.3-inch screen might put off some prospective buyers . <p> 7 . Asus ZenFone 5 : Asus has had a spotty history in the smartphone market but it is back full-strength now with the ZenFone series . All three siblings offer exceptional performance at their price points and are very easy to recommend . The ZenFone 5 ( Review Pictures ) stands out in particular because of its good camera and smart positioning . <p> 8 . Samsung Galaxy Note 4Of all the phablets we 've reviewed , the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 ( Review Pictures ) stands out thanks to its impressive combination of hardware and software . Samsung has really worked on ways to let users get more out of the big screen and stylus , going well beyond the capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery life make it an all-rounder . <p> 9 . Yota Devices YotaphoneWe have to give Yota Devices credit for thinking of something radically different , and the secondary e-ink screen is exactly that . In practical terms , the YotaPhone ( Review Pictures ) is a bit too bulky and expensive , and not enough apps can take advantage of the e-ink screen . We hope the second-generation Yotaphone , already announced internationally , is an improvement . <p> Both operating systems , Firefox and Sailfish , are fresh new takes on what a mobile operating system should do for the user . It will be an uphill battle against Android , and these bold new operating systems have a long way to go . <p> These were the ten phones which made the strongest impression on us in 2014 - they are n't necessarily the best phones of the year , but in many ways , these handsets broke new ground , and helped make the year more interesting .

A case has been registered against Aziz at the Aabpara police station on Friday , three hours after protesters had gathered outside it demanding the cleric be arrested for supporting Taliban . <p> Aziz is known sympathiser of Taliban and al-Qaida and has even named a library in the madrassa after Osama bin Laden . <p> The Red Mosque had had a series of run-ins with the authorities in Pakistan .

Honeymoon is an aspiration for all the newlyweds , but it in most of the times is an experience that goes sour , so why not go on the honeymoon on one 's own , enjoy the life and then come back as it has been done in QUEEN , where Kangana decided to go on her honeymoon all by herself . <p> Kangana Ranaut could be amongst few girls in the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors from small towns trying to make their mark in the world of Hindi cinema through innovative content , through her performance in QUEEN she indeed is sending a strong message to these new directors to capitalize on the opportunity and experiment with their story ideas . <p> There is always a very thin dividing line between going overboard in executing the role of a small town girl and delivering with panache ( normally it so happens that such enactments so far have gone totally overboard ) , but if one has the sensibilities and the experience to draw from , which Kangana Ranaut is in an envious position to do , the performance that is delivered is scintillating . Kangana Ranaut indeed would be the QUEEN to watch out for and 2014 is the year that for sure would give her career a real push .
