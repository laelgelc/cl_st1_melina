@@104850236 <h> Zulu king braced for royal battles <p> The death of longstanding traditional prime minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi , and a series of court challenges over the recognition of MisuZulu kaZwelithini as isilo of the Zulu nation being overturned , marked a dramatic 2023 for the Zulu nation . <p> This year promises to be equally dramatic , as the monarch fights in court to retain his throne , and control over the Ingonyama Trust , in the face of challenges from his half-brother , Simakade , and other members of the royal family . <p> MisuZulu will also have to appoint a replacement for Buthelezi , who served both his father , Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu , and his grandfather , Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon , as traditional prime minister of the amaZulu . <p> On 16 January , Judge Norman Davis is due to hear an application for leave to appeal against his judgment setting aside the recognition of MisuZulu as the king of the Zulu nation by President Cyril Ramaphosa in March . <p> Both the monarch and the president want the Pretoria high court 's permission to challenge the ruling by Davis early last month , which declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and set it aside . <p> Davis made the ruling in a consolidated application by Simakade , his uncle , Mbonisi , and a number of other members of the Zulu royal family , who went to court to have the recognition set aside . <p> At stake , along with the throne , is a R79-million-a-year stipend from the KwaZulu-Natal government and millions of rand collected each year by the Ingonyama Trust Board ( ITB ) on behalf of the king from commercial tenants on land falling under the province 's traditional leaders . <p> Davis set aside the recognition and ordered Ramaphosa to appoint an investigative panel , in terms of the Traditional Leadership and Khoi-San Leadership Act , to look into claims that the process in the royal house to nominate MisuZulu as king had been flawed . <p> But the court did not rule on the validity of MisuZulu 's claim to the throne , saying that it could not sit as a court of appeal on the earlier finding by KwaZulu-Natal judge president Mjabuliseni Madondo that he was the rightful heir . <p> Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved the way for MisuZulu 's recognition by Ramaphosa , nor ignore it in making his judgment . <p> But the king 's legal team argued in their notice of intention to appeal that the court had erred in not adopting the same approach to Madondo 's earlier finding on allegations by members of the royal house of a flawed internal process . <p> They said Madondo had made " conclusive " findings in his earlier ruling that there was no evidence and allegations placed before the president that could have compelled him to appoint an investigative panel in terms of the Act . <p> Madondo had found that the meetings which were held to identify a new monarch had been properly constituted , and process followed , and that there was " no genuine dispute " with regard to MisuZulu 's right to be appointed as king . <p> The judge had found " complete compliance " by the president in recognising the king and that the court had erred by failing to take this part of his judgment , which was binding on both Simakade and Mbonisi as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> The president 's legal team said in their application that there were reasonable prospects that the appeal would succeed before another court because the court had " misdirected itself " in finding that the recognition was unlawful . <p> " The court ought to have found that the recognition decision was lawful and valid , " they said . <p> The court had also misdirected itself in making a finding that the president should appoint an investigative panel because this issue had already been determined by Madondo , who found MisuZulu 's claim to the throne was legitimate . <p> They said the matters they sought to appeal were of importance " not only to all the parties to the litigation , but to amaZulu as a whole " . <p> " The decisions sought to be appealed involve important questions of law and the administration of justice in these cases requires the appeal to be heard , " they said . <p> The appeal will delay any attempt by Mbonisi and Simakade 's lawyers to secure a declaratory order forcing the presidency and the province to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier asked the court to do . <p> It will also delay a second court application by Mbonisi in the Pietermaritzburg high court to stop MisuZulu exercising his authority over the ITB and the province 's amakhosi . <p> In that application , Mbonisi has accused the king of trying to profit from the land under the ITB , which raised more than R90 million in commercial leases and mining rights during 2018 . <p> Mbonisi has asked the court to stop the ITB from funding MisuZulu 's legal battles and from supporting his " lavish " lifestyle , accusing the monarch of being a drug addict and alcoholic and of being under the control of " drug mules " . <p> The exchange of court papers in the matter has given a first glimpse into the financial workings of the ITB , the books of which have never been subjected to public scrutiny , and revealed decades of abuse under former chairperson Jerome Ngwenya . <p> Ngwenya was fired by MisuZulu earlier this year over a dubious R41 million investment , exposed by the Mail &amp; Guardian . Mbonisi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the court . <p> In his responding papers , ITB chief executive Vela Mngwengwe blew the lid on multimillion-rand payments made on behalf of the late king Goodwill , including a R2.8 million SUV and several settlements made to the South African Revenue Service on his behalf . <p> The king 's court battles do not end there -- the Madondo judgment in MisuZulu 's favour is also being contested and is destined for the supreme court of appeal during the course of the year . <p> In addition to his legal battles , MisuZulu will also be hard-pressed to overcome the damage done by his public fallouts with Buthelezi , who was one of his strongest backers in his fight for the throne . <p> Their relationship soured when MisuZulu fired Ngwenya and the ITB was dissolved , sparking a public and private schism between the two . <p> Buthelezi attempted to mobilise amakhosi against the king 's decision , but the move failed and a new board chairperson , Thanduyise Mzimela , was appointed by the king . <p> Buthelezi 's family went public about the clashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , blaming MisuZulu for their father 's death . <p> Buthelezi 's son Zuzifa has been installed as the new inkosi of the Buthelezi clan at Mahlabathini , but is not favoured by MisuZulu , who has his own advisers , to take on the role . <p> Zuzifa could himself face a legal challenge to his appointment to succeed his late father as there are already rumblings within the Buthelezi clan that this was done irregularly . <p> While the legal process plays out , the king remains in place and continues to carry out his duties . <p> His spokesperson Africa Zulu said in a statement that the monarch remained on the throne and would continue with his duties . <p> Zulu said it was important to note that the court had not made any ruling on the legitimacy of the king 's right to be monarch , which was a matter of birthright and not court process . <p> Ramaphosa 's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said that although the appeal processes were underway , " his majesty King MisuZulu remains the identified heir to the throne " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all members of the royal family to continue working for the unity of the institution and to " prioritise the interests of his majesty 's subjects " . <p> " It is vital that all due processes are allowed to reach their natural conclusion without inflaming tensions , " Magwenya said . <p> A delegation from the MK party allegedly met Ngrayi Ngwenya on Sunday to convince him to join the party <p> This content is restricted to registered users and subscribers . <h> Get Your Free Account <p> The Mail &amp; Guardian is committed to providing all our readers with the best possible experience .

Where they differ is in the pressures and form of the outputs . This means that quality can be defined differently on different platforms , but professionalism is judged to the same exacting standards . <p> This applies whether you are using social media for research , reporting , publishing or interaction with others .

Social media allows us to talk to our readers on multiple platforms , and opens up new audiences for our content . The network effect means that our core readers disseminate our content to their followers . <p> On social media platforms , M&amp;G reporters can source breaking news and story ideas . We can also break news , as well as use social media to verify news .

Be aware that you are part of a community , and subject to the dynamics of that community . <p> Do not misrepresent yourself on social media . Be upfront about being from the Mail &amp; Guardian . Do not use subterfuge to obtain information , and do not use underhand technical methods ( such as subverting security protocols on websites ) to obtain information . Although social media are public platforms , and in general in the public domain , be mindful that some people might not fully understand this . If in any doubt , check with people that they are aware that they are , de facto , commenting in the public domain . In cases where public interest is the overriding factor , the expectation of privacy is not as relevant . <p> TheirsThe internet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of this , and make sure you are thoroughly conversant with your subject and source before accepting the validity of information received online . As with traditional reporting , take notes . Take a screenshot of any page you are using in your research -- pages can be removed from sites , and then you have no proof . This is especially important when using information sourced via social media . Take a screenshot of Twitter conversations or social network pages . As these are private accounts , they can be deleted by their owners . <p> AttributionInformation on social media is still owned , despite the illusion of a liminal free-for-all . Always attribute your source , be it a person or a platform . Readers ascribe different values to different sources , so they need to know , for example , when something comes from a user on Twitter as opposed to physical investigation . <p> From time to time , your tweets will be aggregated on to mg.co.za . This means the M&amp;G might , in certain circumstances , be legally responsible for what you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairness , as you would on any other of our platforms . This is not just about the law . If you make a comment that is aggressive or nasty , this can taint our reputation , as well as your personal name in the industry . <p> Online , the distinction between the public and the private is blurred . Inevitably , your private persona will be conflated with your business persona . If the M&amp;G feels that your private online persona adversely affects your ability to work in your professional area , we may change the area in which you work , or discipline you if this is deemed necessary . <p> Also , remember that data can be mined in various ways . You might inadvertently betray a source , or leak an upcoming scoop , by a seemingly unrelated series of tweets or posts that tell a revealing story when parsed together . Be vigilant at all times . You are responsible for what you say on social media . Social media are not lesser media : you are judged by the same standards as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for what you write . <p> Respect copyrights and fair use . Always give people proper credit for their work , and make sure you have the right to use something with attribution before you publish . This is particularly tricky with retweeting , and editing those retweets for space . If you edit someone 's tweet , mark it as a partial retweet ( PRT ) . <p> Remember to protect confidential &amp; proprietary info . You are obliged , contractually , to protect the M&amp;G 's confidential or proprietary information . Employees who share confidential or proprietary information do so at the risk of losing their job and possibly even ending up a defendant in a civil lawsuit . At the very least , companies will seriously question the judgment of an employee who shares confidential or proprietary information via social media . <p> AuthorityThe bedrock of our authority as a publication is our impartiality . Your profiles , retweets , likes and postings can reveal your political and ideological affiliations . Be very sure that your audience either understands that you are professional enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliations will not be construed as having an effect on your ability to do objective journalism . <p> A simple example : If you join a particular Facebook group for research purposes , it would be politic ( as well as good research policy ) to also join whatever group holds a contrary viewpoint on the same subject . <p> Exercise good judgment . Your comments will be open to misinterpretation and malicious repostings . Always think before you hit enter . Your comments will be monitored -- that 's the nature of social media -- and will be passed on to your employer . As our reputation is predicated on dealing with controversial subjects , this will always be a contested area . We have to take a standpoint , but be aware that your standpoint has to be defensible according to the Code of Ethics of the Mail &amp; Guardian . <p> As with our other publications , our social media are judged on the value we provide to the user .

" <p> Be aware that people will still elide the two , so make sure you say nothing that will damage the Mail &amp; Guardian 's name . <p> PublishingShould you break stories on social media ? The general rule is , if you do n't do it , someone else will . You do n't want to scoop our other relevant platforms , but social media platforms are as important in terms of building a news reputation . Where possible , we would prefer to break news with a link to a solid piece of content on our other platforms , but there will be many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If possible , check with a senior editor on the wisdom of your decision . Generally , the ideal would be that someone checks your social media update before you post it . This will seldom be possible , but make it happen if you are in any doubt . <p> There 's a delicate balance between whetting our audience 's appetite with teasers about work in progress , and handing a competitive advantage to other news organisations . Here , there are no guidelines possible except those of your professional acumen and common sense . In principle , the Mail &amp; Guardian is committed to as transparent a news agenda as is possible within the constraints of business sense . <p> ( Note : Many of these points are a variation of those found on the excellent Reuters social media guidelines ) .

@@104984231 <h> RGS abandons Tongaat bid , claims business rescue is rigged <p> In another dramatic turn of events , RGS Holdings has withdrawn its business rescue plan for Tongaat Hulett Limited ( THL ) ahead of Wednesday 's crucial creditors vote , claiming the process has been rigged in favour of Robert Gumede 's Vision consortium . <p> RGS and Vision had both submitted rescue plans to business rescue practitioners Metis , which were set to be voted on by creditors of the troubled sugar giant on Wednesday , but it is understood that the vote will now go ahead with only one bidder . <p> Tongaat entered voluntary business rescue in November 2022 after losing 95% of its value in a R3.5 billion accounting scandal over which former chief executive Peter Staude and a group of managers and accountants have been charged with fraud . <p> The process has seen both RGS and Tongaat 's creditors -- including the South African Sugar Association and RCL Foods -- turn to the courts ahead of Wednesday 's vote , which has been postponed several times . <p> On Tuesday , RGS executive chairperson Aquil Rajahussen wrote to Metis , informing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its plan , which had , like Vision 's , been amended several times during the process . <p> Rajahussen said they had previously written to Metis expressing " serious concerns " about the way in which they had conducted the business rescue process at Tongaat Hulett . <p> The process had been repeatedly postponed , both over legal issues and to allow time for Vision to secure funding for a proposed buyout of Tongaat 's bank debt from a group of lender banks . <p> " In the RGS view the BRPs business rescue practitioners have not conducted themselves appropriately in accordance with their duties and obligations as business rescue practitioners , nor in the interests of THL and its stakeholders , " he wrote . <p> Rajahussen said that the BRPs had " consistently taken steps to place impediments in the way of RGS 's proposals and have been patently biassed in favour of the proposals put forward by the Vision Parties " . <p> " The RGS board simply does not trust that the BRPs are honest independent professionals in this process as they should be and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the RGS plan were to be adopted , " he added . <p> Rajahussen said the BRPs had used confidential information in an amended RGS bid to assist Vision in addressing deficiencies in its rescue plan , and had also leaked information to the media to try to discredit RGS and its proposals . <p> In the face of this " hostile " action by the BRPs , the RGS board could not " risk " paying R2 billion to the group of banks holding R8 billion in Tongaat debt , prior to the conclusion of the transaction . <p> Because of the risk of Vision going to court if RGS was successful -- and the likelihood of the BRPs " actively working " to assist Vision or to delay the implementation of the RGS plan -- the company would not make any payment to the banks before the transaction was concluded . <p> Given that the banks would not accept this , it was " more appropriate " that RGS withdraw at this point , he said . <p> Rajahussen said RGS believed that it had presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stakeholders and that it would have been a better partner for the local sugar industry . <p> " Had the process been run fairly and independently and in the interests of the THL and its stakeholders , RGS is firmly of the view that the RGS BR plan would have been the only one of the two plans up for consideration at the meeting , " he said . <p> A spokesperson for Metis denied the allegations that they had rigged the process in favour of Vision . <p> " The BRPs strongly refute the baseless allegations made in the letter that was directed at them .

In all these societies , whatever political party comes to power , whether on the left , centrist or right , adheres to the consensus . <p> The society-wide consensus in South Africa forged after the ending of apartheid in 1994 , has now collapsed because of corruption , dishonesty , breakdown of basic moral standards , breakdown of the rule of law , competing governance systems to the Constitution , state failure , tribalisation , the exclusion of large numbers of South Africans based on colour , gender and where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the pillars of a new consensus be for South Africa ? <p> The Constitution has to be the apex governance system in the country and no competing governance system should be allowed , whether customary law , township or village communal culture , gang culture or liberation party culture . <p> Building a democracy as the universal system for all South Africans should be a key part of it . In this context , the best way forward for South Africa is not Afrikaner or African nationalism , but what Michael Ignatieff described as " civic nationalism " , in which the glue that holds communities together is equal rights and shared democratic cultures , values and institutions , rather than ethnic nationalism , whether isiZulu , Indian , Afrikaner or coloured . Citizens of all ethnic , racial and religious groups must embrace democracy , democratic institutions and democratic values and behaviour . <p> South Africa 's diversity must be accepted by all as a pillar of the country 's identity . Many South Africans appear to think that the country 's diversity is an obstacle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and leveraging South Africa 's diversity is crucial to lifting economic growth , inclusive development and maintaining societal peace . <p> A professional , merit-based , non-politicised public service not aligned to a governing party is a critical pillar of a new consensus . A professional public service is not only key for delivering public services , for a functioning economy and building a common identity , and , therefore , plays a key role in uniting South Africans across race , class and politics . <p> An accountable , effective and honest public service allows citizens to accept the state -- especially in the context of SA 's apartheid state , where many black South Africans saw the state as illegitimate . The public service is critical in diffusing and normalising good moral , democratic , responsive and accountable behaviour , or not , to citizens , and , therefore , helping to install a democratic culture or not society . <p> The rule of law has to be a central pillar of a new consensus . And everyone , including the politically connected must adhere to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new consensus will have to be to tackle racism , tribalism and xenophobia . Because of South Africa 's historical legacy of race-based discrimination , a new consensus must also have redress or social justice as a central pillar . There has to be solidarity for the vulnerable across ethnicity , colour and political affiliation . <p> However , the redress strategy has to be reimagined . It can not be on the basis of the current BEE policies which have mostly empowered the politically connected . It will be critical that empowerment policies focus on genuinely uplifting not only the poor , but the widest number of people at the same time , whatever their race , colour or political affiliation -- rather than a small elite , whether white or black or both . <p> Empowerment will have to deliver skills , quality education and entrepreneurial opportunities , business finance and home ownership to ordinary people , not just the politically connected . In the immediate period , South Africa needs a basic income grant , but one which is linked to an ecosystem of skills development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual agency . <p> This must also target South Africa 's unemployed youth , including those unskilled , unschooled and graduates . For youth in particular , grants should also be linked to technical training -- skills the economy needs , such as plumbing , early childhood development and adult basic education . <p> Conditions for grants could include compulsory democratic citizens education which would include understanding the Constitution , democratic moral behaviours and gender equality . Recipients could also be asked to volunteer in their communities , whether cleaning streets or guarding schools . <p> There has to be a social pact between government and business -- not misguided failed attempts at social pacts . But a new social pact must include a jobs pledge to get millions of post-school youth into getting technical training , entrepreneurship skills , access to business finance and job opportunities , in partnership with business . <p> There has to be a national consensus to tackle apartheid-induced mass trauma . Mass trauma leaves individuals , families and communities so broken that many struggle to engage fully in the life of intimate relationships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace . It leaves many with pervasive , deep-seated and persistent feelings of angst , insecurity and with inferiority complexes . <p> Crucially , it destroys the agency of individuals : the ability to act on one 's own will , despite the constraints of belief systems one has grown up with , others ' perceptions of one and a limiting environment . <p> Unless state-building , development , empowerment and workplace development programmes tackles the deep-seated insecurity trauma leaves victims with , it will not only impact the individual , undermining their health , bringing toxicity into their personal relations , impairing their decision-making , it will also bring toxicity into the state , development and empowerment programs and the organisations traumatised individuals work for . <p> Anti-poverty strategies must be multidimensional in that it must include self-esteem , self-love and self-care .

Critically , the state must treat citizens with dignity , care and efficiency . <p> Finally , there has to be a new consensus to change the country 's national culture , the way citizens engage with others , what is seen as acceptable social norms , values and behaviour -- many of these have been corrupted . Many South Africans often do as they please , behave selfishly , irresponsibly and ignoring the well-being of others . <p> This ranges from people playing loud music and hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public parks , without any care for neighbours ; or smokers mindlessly smoking in public places , causing harm to non-smokers ; or simply , somebody littering in public spaces . <p> Similarly , often those who protests in defence of their " rights " -- whether it is the Fees must Fall protests , strikers demanding wage increases or communities demanding better public services -- often deliberately harming others , whether innocent bystanders or opponents , destroy private property , such as factories and public assets , such as libraries . In exercising their " rights , " they destroy the rights of others . <p> To ensure mass behaviour changes there has to be greater enforcement of duties , responsibilities and accountabilities by the authorities .

From there , Herodotus went on to the city of Tyre and then to Babylon , possibly via the Euphrates River . <p> The unflattering epithet Father of Lies derives largely from passages such as the following , in which he lists the annual tribute in gold the 20 provinces of the Persian Empire paid to their ruler , Darius . <p> " Twentieth : the Indians , the most populous nation in the known world , paid the largest sum : 360 talents of gold-dust . " <p> So far , so good for readers , ancient or modern . But soon the eyes fall upon this : " These are the most warlike of the Indian tribes , and it is they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region there is a sandy desert . There is found in this desert a kind of ant of great size -- bigger than a fox , though not so big as a dog . Some specimens , which were caught there , are kept at the palace of the Persian king . These creatures as they burrow underground throw up the sand in heaps , just as ants in Greece throw up the earth , and they are very similar in shape . The sand has a rich content of gold , and this it is that the Indians are after when they make their expeditions into the desert . " <p> ( The quote comes from the classic Herodotus translation by Aubrey de S ? lincourt . Readers might also want to try the excellent new version by the superb classicist and historian Tom Holland . ) <p> The story of the gold-digging ants is Herodotus as alert traveller , reporter on the look-out for tales of interest and practical anthropologist millennia before the disciplines of physical and cultural anthropology were born . But , you ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will direct you to further but briefer reading , the rebuttal of charges against Herodotus for being fantastical and ahistorical that is Stephen Dalley 's article , " Why Did Herodotus Not Mention the Hanging Gardens of Babylon ? " It 's to be found in Herodotus and his World : Essays from a Conference in Memory of George Forrest , edited by Peter Derow and Robert Parker ( 2003 ) . <p> A similar question of why not was asked by Frances Wood in her book Did Marco Polo Go to China ? ( 1996 ) . Central to the argument here is why Polo makes no mention of the Great Wall of China . Embarrassingly for Wood , at the time head of the Chinese section at the British Library , as well as her editors and publishers , the answer was and is simple : it had not yet been built . <p> Accusations of Polo inventing it all are not new . Earlier readers and critics pointed out that surely so observant a young man would have had something to say about tea , printing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book . Those and other popular and specialist quibbles are neatly addressed in Marco Polo : From Venice to Xanadu by Laurence Bergreen ( 2008 ) . <p> Blending biography , travel and narrative history , Bergreen gives us an absorbing and engaging book , but nothing is as wonderful and thrilling as the original text itself : Description of the World by Messer Marco Polo . <p> The book is , of course , better known in English as The Travels or The Travels of Marco Polo , but its original Italian title , Divisement dou Monde , speaks to the ambition and scope of the work . It 's essential to note that Marco did not write the text but dictated it . <p> The prologue , with its curious style placing Marco in the third person , lets readers know on the very first page : " Let me tell you , then , that to gain this knowledge he stayed in these various countries and territories fully twenty-six years . Afterwards , in the year of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ 1298 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy his leisure as well as to afford entertainment to readers , he caused all these things to be recorded by Messer Rustichello of Pisa , who was in the same prison . But what he told was only what little he was able to remember . " ( From the best English translation , RE Latham 's 1958 version for the Penguin Classics . ) <p> What 's this , then ? Two jailbirds concocting a non-fiction fraud to perpetrate on an early reading-public ? No -- Marco was a prisoner of war , captured by the Genoese from the Venetian galley he commanded at the naval Battle of Curzola on 6 ? September 1298 , a disaster for the Republic of Venice . <p> Rustichello , from Pisa , was similarly a captive of war , at the Battle of Meloria in 1284 when Genoa trounced the Pisan fleet . <p> More significantly , Rustichello was a renowned writer of Arthurian romances , so much so he attracted the favour of no less a reader than King Edward I of England . <p> One can see how Marco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimagined lands , strange beasts and awe-inspiring landscapes , and novelty with its sleeping partner horror , would have instantly appealed to Rustichello 's imagination and literary skills . <p> Here was a young man from a merchant family on a " fabulous " journey requiring enterprise , resourcefulness and endurance , an analogue to Rustichello 's knights going on hazardous and challenging quests . <p> Marco had been entrusted with missions by the Great Khan , Kublai himself . One of the great writing partnerships was born and it remains fascinating to this day to see where Rustichello embellishes the closely observed recollections of Marco . <p> There 's a slim and subtle novel that speculatively explores the authorship of The Travels , called Myself and Marco Polo by Paul Griffiths ( 1989 ) , a delightful exercise that shows postmodernism and " the death of the author " begin rather earlier than devotees of those like to think . <p> To set the timeline : Marco was born on 15 September 1254 and died on 8 January 1324 , 700 years ago this week . His story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , is still a marvel today . It shows a young man travelling with his father Niccol ? and uncle Maffeo and absorbing all he sees , hears , smells , feels and intuits around him . <p> South Africans no longer have to fly to Europe to enjoy MSC 's Splendida , which will be sailing out of the new terminal in Durban <p> This content is restricted to registered users and subscribers . <h> Get Your Free Account <p> The Mail &amp; Guardian is committed to providing all our readers with the best possible experience .

@@105432237 <h> Everything We Know About Suicide Squad : Kill the Justice League <h> Get ready to break bad . <p> Nine years after Batman : Arkham Knight , Rocksteady 's jumping back into the DC universe with Suicide Squad : Kill the Justice League . The same universe , but totally different gameplay ; Suicide Squad is an open-world co-op looter-shooter . For those on the fence about Rocksteady 's latest , or for those who want to absorb every bit of information about the world , characters , and how it all works , here 's everything we know about Suicide Squad : Kill the Justice League . <h> What 's the Story ? <p> Set five years after the events of Arkham Knight , Kill the Justice League has us leave Gotham City for the first time , instead taking us to Superman 's stomping ground of Metropolis . If you 're remotely familiar with the Suicide Squad concept , you know the basic drill : shadowy government agent Amanda Waller has tasked a handful of DC villains to save the world in exchange for a reduced prison sentence . Any squad member who dares step out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience , courtesy of a bomb planted in their necks . <p> And the stakes could n't possibly be higher this time around ; after being deployed into Metropolis ( which developers say is twice the size of Arkham Knight 's Gotham ) , our ragtag group of mercenaries finds that the city is under siege from a mighty intergalactic force in the form of Brainiac and his endless purple armies . Even worse , he 's brainwashed the Justice League , including Batman , Green Lantern , The Flash , and even Superman . The only way to stop Brainiac ? You 'll never believe this , but ... somehow , some way , you have to kill the Justice League . <p> Credit : Rocksteady/WB Games <h> Which Characters are Playable ? <p> Suicide Squad releases with four characters that , in single-player mode , you can freely swap between . Or , if you know only one of them appeals to you , Rocksteady says you can play the full game as just that one character . Player expression is a core tenet of Suicide Squad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wield guns , you 'll have plenty of room to shape and mold them to your preferred playstyle . <p> The most recognizable face is undoubtedly Harley Quinn , the **29;649;TOOLONG jester acrobat with a thing for explosions . She packs her signature baseball bat , but manages to nab two of Batman 's gadgets as well -- the bat drone and grapnel gun . With these she can swing like Spider-Man from pretty much anywhere and even rain down bullets while suspended in the air . Given her particular affinity for explosives , we can expect her talent tree to give plenty of buffs to her grenades . <p> Next up is Deadshot , the gunman who never misses , making his Arkhamverse debut , well kinda . The expert marksman named Deadshot that you saw multiple times in past Arkham games is totally unrelated from the expert marksman named Deadshot that you 'll be taking control of in Kill the Justice League . Rocksteady has seemingly implied that the sniper assassin from past games was an impostor all along . In any case , Deadshot is built around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . His jetpack gets him a vantage point from virtually anywhere and you 'll find lots of critical hit and counter talents in his talent tree . <p> Then , we have King Shark , the quintessential tank you 've got to have in any group . He 's the best at absorbing damage on the starting roster and specializes in dishing it out even more . Shark is highly reminiscent of Hulk from that Ultimate Destruction game you loved renting in 2005 , complete with incredibly high jumps , multiple air dashes , and earth-shattering ground slams . If you can look past his enormous strength and taste for blood , he 's also naive and relatively good-natured compared to those he rolls with . In other words , he 's a lot like Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy . King Shark 's talent tree will generally boost his melee attacks , such as causing enemies to bleed for an additional 50% damage or sacrificing damage for extended close-quarters range . <p> Finishing off the launch roster is Captain Boomerang , who Rocksteady has described as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauntlet he yoinked from the Hall of Justice he can throw a boomerang to effectively create a point in space for him to teleport to , allowing him to excel at dashing in for close-range hits and zipping back out for ranged shots . Combined with double jumps , he can spend a good amount of time in the air , but seems best suited to keeping most of his combat grounded to get the most out of his speed . <p> Credit : Rocksteady/WB Games <p> Post-launch , Rocksteady will be expanding the Squad with DLC characters as well . First up is confirmed to be the Joker . You might be thinking that he died in 2011 's Arkham City , and you 'd be right . There is a lore reason for that , but we 'll get to it later . You 'll float through the air and skim across skyscrapers using his rocket-powered umbrella , deliver punchlines with his grappling hook crowbar , and even get to peel back the emotional and psychological layers of this clown prince of crime . <p> Rumors also point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katana potentially showing up as well , but as always with rumors , please hype responsibly . And if we can get speculative for a second here , corporate synergy might nudge the roster to include even more characters from the DC movies and TV shows , like Polka-Dot Man , Peacemaker , Ratcatcher , or Bloodsport . <p> Whether you like it or not , Kill the Justice League is a live service game , so the idea is to get you to want to play for as long as possible . While characters can level up infinitely , once one of them hits level 30 , you unlock Squad Talents . In essence , these are upgrades for the team , not just for individuals , and you get more of them as you pile on the character levels . Once again , you 're free to pick a main character to play as while ignoring the others , but spreading out your playtime will get you more squad talents more quickly . <p> It bears repeating that much of the spirit of Kill the Justice League is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your talent trees at almost any time you want and can save eight loadout slots , so experimentation is very much encouraged . The Social Squad feature even lets you import character builds made by other players , like friends or even streamers . If someone else uses your hero , you 'll earn a slice of the loot they earned in that other player 's session . <h> Will There Be Loot ? <p> Speaking of loot , the weapons you earn from completing missions will play a major role in how you make your character your own . After a year-long effort by Rocksteady , the controversial gear score system has been removed , so rest assured that neat weapon you found early on wo n't become totally obsolete deeper into the game . <p> Early on , you 'll forcibly recruit none other than the Penguin to be your resident arms dealer . Through him , you 'll purchase new assault rifles , pistols , sniper rifles , shotguns , SMGs , and heavy weapons , with each squad member being proficienct in three of those gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like STAR Labs , AMERTEK , LexCorp , and the Gotham City Police Department with each coming with unique aesthetics and " feels " to their weaponry , once you unlock them . <p> Gear scores may be gone , but gear tiers are still in the game with rarity classes being ranked common , uncommon , rare , epic , legendary , notorious , and infamous . According to a Discord Q&amp;A with Rocksteady , " common through epic increase in power in the number of possible augments available , but Legendary , Notorious , and Infamous is when we really turn up the heat . " Legendary weapons come with unique augments that set them apart from the lower tiers in a meaningful way . For example , The Cooler is a sniper that freezes enemies on crits , Combo Meal guns let you use your combo-locked talents as soon as you land a crit , and BAAANNNG trades all your grenades for a single one that basically functions as a mini nuke in terms of damage and blast radius . <p> Notorious and Infamy weapons are themed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , but through gameplay as well . For example , this gun themed after Bane spawns powerups on critical hits that give your other weapons with Bane 's Rage . These will refocus the way you play and if you want to maximize their capabilities , you 'll probably want to consider making them the focal point of your character build . Again , you 're free to mix up your talents without any kind of risk , so do n't be afraid to swap out your skill sets to really get the most out of that cool gun you just found . <p> Guns are one thing , but you 'll of course be able to give Brainiac 's minions a smack all up close and personal-like . What Penguin does for guns , Toyman will do for melee weapons . And Ivy , when you unlock her as a support character , will imbue those weapons with up to two simultaneous Afflictions . Afflictions seem to be your standard elemental effects , like fire , ice , electricity , and poison , but named after different DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diablo Blaze ignites enemies for continuous damage , Deep Freeze will turn them into solid ice for extra bullet damage , Livewire Bolt looks like it temporarily stuns them with electricity , and so on and so forth . <p> Just because you can zip around the city on foot with respectable agility does n't mean that vehicles wo n't have their place , though . Gizmo will be your go-to for anything from a toy car that grows into a full-sized one ( probably using tech borrowed from The Atom ) to a flying gunship complete with rockets and turrets that makes wiping out interdimensional threats that much easier . <h> How About the Endgame ? <p> I do say " interdimensional " pretty intentionally here because Kill the Justice League 's endgame will revolve heavily around it . With " Elseworlds , " you 'll jump to different alternate universes which have all been torn asunder in their own ways . Briefly shown are versions of Metropolis ravaged by tornadoes , ice , and even the Joker . Yes , the playable Joker mentioned earlier actually comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact while letting Warner Bros. cash in on any character they want anyway . <p> The Joker represents the model Rocksteady wants to follow for their DLC in the future : each season of content will be heavily themed after a DC villain and will consist of two story " episodes . " For those of you tired of the FOMO aspect of live service games , fear not ; episodes are not time-limited events , but rather permanent additions to the game that you can go back and replay any time you want . <p> When you 're not jumping through the multiverse , you can take on new mission types . In Incursion , your squad is brought to Brainiac 's turf to fight through his armies and his ship 's tentacles . These are designed for relatively quick play sessions in comparison to the other mission type , Killing Time . These will be a lot like the classic horde modes you 've seen in other games . As you clear out bad guys , they 'll become increasingly frantic as Brainiac 's ship continuously beats down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shield replenishes , promoting an " attack in the best form of defense " mindset . <p> But what would character customization be without some cosmetics thrown in for good measure ? Some costumes will be exclusive to the in-game store , but rest assured that the only additional paid content currently planned starts and ends with cosmetic features with all future characters and missions coming completely free of charge . <h> Happy Hunting <p> So , Suicide Squad : Kill the Justice League is aiming for a different audience than the game series it repeatedly reminds us it shares a connection with . But with so much detail poured into the world , characters , story , and player expression , maybe those willing to keep an open mind will find this a worthy return to the Arkhamverse . Or , looter shooter fans might fall in love with Suicide Squad immediately without concern for Rocksteady 's past games . A multiverse of possibilities lies in store when Kill the Justice League launches on February 2nd ( or January 30th if you 're paying for early access ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hype level currently lies .

@@105432240 <h> Palworld Early Access - Xbox/PC Game Pass Version - Review <h> This version of Palworld is n't nearly as polished , but it is still a ton of fun . <p> Note : This review is specifically for the version of Palworld available on Xbox and through the Microsoft Store on PC . If you have n't seen our review of the Steam version , go check that out first ! Nearly everything we said there still applies to this review , which will instead focus specifically on what 's different with this version . <p> Palworld has taken the world by storm ! And with good reason : shooting cartoon animals with assault weapons then forcing them to mine ore for you all day is alarmingly fun . But those playing on the Xbox and Microsoft Store versions that are widely accessible through Game Pass have been treated to a noticeably different experience -- one I 've seen firsthand after playing over 50 hours on Xbox since wrapping up my time with the far more polished Steam version . Unfortunately the Xbox build has quite a few additional bugs and performance issues , a missing feature here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four players with no option for dedicated servers . Those blemishes are expected from an Early Access game that 's still very much under development , but it definitely feels like a significantly less complete package . <p> The most immediately noticeable way this version of Palworld differs is that it consistently performs worse . While graphical bugs , pop-in , and framerate dips are certainly present on Steam , they 're much more glaring on Xbox , and flying around the world for any length of time is bound to lead to extremely blurry textures that sometimes never fully load even when you get really close to them . In a few instances , a weird lightning-like light started flickering and did n't go away until I went back to the main menu . The worst among these discrepancies , though , are the sound effects on Xbox , which are all over the place in terms of quality . Some noises are extremely low quality and sound like you 're listening through an old walkie talkie , while other sound effects are just missing altogether . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from playing way too much Palworld , but they certainly made that marathon less enjoyable . <p> There are also some especially nasty bugs present in the Xbox version that I did n't encounter on Steam . The most painful of these is that , when flying around on the back of a Pal ( especially in higher level areas like the snowy mountains or fiery volcanoes where lots of stuff is going on ) sometimes parts of the world do n't load correctly and become intangible , which means you 'll fly right through them and land under the terrain . On more than one occasion I actually found myself stuck under the level flying around to look for pockets where I could float through the ground again to get on the right side of the map . This happened enough times that I started to take note when certain surfaces had blurry textures , since it seemed to indicate I could go right through them . That level of jank can be really hard to bear , and is n't something I experienced at all on Steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are also some small features on Steam that are n't available on Xbox , like the fact that you ca n't name your character or give any of your Pals a nickname . That becomes a little confusing when your characters are named " Player 916 " instead of your Gamertag and makes communication with your friends a bit touch and go . Missing details like this did n't ruin my fun , ( after all , I did n't want to name any of these poor animals I was about to treat very poorly anyway , given I was likely about to harvest their organs ) , but they definitely contribute to a decidedly less premium feel . <p> All of these issues are cause for some concern , but collectively they only impacted my enjoyment a small amount . There 's still dozens of interesting Pals to chase , hilarious hijinks to get up to in the open world , and some truly mesmerizing survival mechanics to get completely lost in . That 's all very much the case even with a lower framerate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my recommendation a little less enthusiastic for now . If you are n't one to tolerate a few rough edges and some grime with your survival games , it might be best to wait it out a bit before jumping in . <h> The Verdict <p> The version of Palworld on Xbox and the Microsoft Store might not be nearly as polished as the Steam version , but that does n't mean it is n't still a ton of fun . Performance is obviously worse , the audio issues are glaring , you wo n't be able to nickname your beloved Pals , and you 're limited to a much smaller group of friends . All of that adds up to an experience that is indisputably worse , but I was at least able to look past the vast majority of these bumps in the road with relative ease , because underneath it all is the same awesome survival game that I have n't been able to put down . Given time , I fully expect the Xbox-specific issues to get cleaned up as this Early Access dark horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a solid game on their hands .

@@105616237 <h> Conversations about coal 's future is at a critical juncture <p> IN the dialogue on energy sustainability , coal often finds itself at the centre of a contentious debate . As economies navigate the intricacies of climate change , economic development , and energy security , a refined understanding of coal 's place within the global energy portfolio is imperative .

@@105689234 <p> Although best known nowadays for his investment prowess , Corion co-founder David Bacher also possesses a deep cricketing pedigree . In this month 's analysis of the markets , he applies analogies from the sport -- and concludes by posing pointed questions to Cricket South Africa 's hierarchy over its " firing " of national Under19 captain David Teeger , because of threats from local activists linked to the Israel/Hamas war . <p> Watch here <p> Listen here <p> Edited transcript of the inteview <p> Alec Hogg : Every month , we enjoy exploring the Corion Report , but with the ongoing buzz in the cricket world , we have David Bacher , the author of the Corion Report , joining us today . David , with your extensive history in cricket , let 's dive into the Corion Report cricket-style . <p> David : Thanks , Alec . At Corion , we aim to innovate in our investment decisions and reporting on the markets . We have a deep passion for cricket and believe it 's our responsibility to address issues that go against fair play . In this month 's report , we 've taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the controversies in South African cricket . <p> Alec Hogg : Your background in cricket is certainly noteworthy . Could you share a bit about the Bacher family 's connection to the sport ? <p> David : Certainly , Alec . While I share a love for the game with my father , it 's essential to note that my views are my own . I have n't consulted my father on this matter . Being a Bacher may add significance , but this perspective is solely mine . My father , Ali , has put forth his own statement . I 'm also a distant relative to David Teeger , but that 's not pertinent here . This is about accountability . <p> Alec Hogg : For those unfamiliar , your father , Ali Bacher , has played a significant role in South African cricket . Now , let 's delve into the content . Talk us through the slides , David . <p> David : Certainly , Alec . In line with the cricket theme , we 've labeled global markets as a " subdued innings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the US markets outperforming . The S&amp;P rose by 1.7% , while emerging markets faced challenges , with China experiencing a 6% decline . In the US , it 's been a good time for investors , reaching record highs . <p> Alec Hogg : South Africa seems to be out of form in the markets . How do you interpret the Piet versus Magnus challenge , and what 's happening in our stock market ? <p> David : Indeed , Alec . Last month 's underperformance in the South African markets is attributed to the struggling resources sector , facing issues like weak commodity prices and production challenges . Our stock market , with significant weightings in basic materials , faced another downturn . <p> David : The dollar had a remarkable start to the year , leading all major rivals . This strong performance was fueled by a bullish stance from the Fed , diminishing the likelihood of an early interest rate cut in March . Positive US data and optimistic remarks from Fed officials further strengthened the dollar . <p> David : Certainly , Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase the top order , highlighting countries and selected shares . Notably , the market dynamics reveal interesting insights . For instance , Japan 's stock market is almost equivalent in size to Apple . Similarly , Microsoft 's weight in the MSCI is 4.2% , while the UK market is at 3.5% . Big companies are dominating the global stage , akin to developed market economies . <p> Alec Hogg : The comparison between Japan 's entire market and Apple is striking . Any concerns about the valuation of these large companies ? <p> David : Last year , we rang the bell on this one . Despite our view that these companies may be overvalued , they continue to thrive for now . <p> David : Global property faced a tough month , but locally , South African property shares performed well , up around 4% last month and 15-16% over the last three months . Despite its small weighting , local property anchored the innings for our market . <p> Alec Hogg : Interesting contrast between global and local property performance . Now , let 's dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> David : In slide six , we present the top performers among larger caps in our all-share market . Retailers like Mr. Price and Rand Head shares , especially Richemont , stood out . There 's speculation about a Richemont and LVMH merger , but hurdles in the luxury market might complicate the deal . <p> David : Certainly in the South African context , with some stocks trading at compelling valuations , we anticipate more M&amp;A activity . Whether through management buyouts or external companies , shareholders are likely to seek value realisation . <p> David : In this familiar scenario , resource shares , including Implats and Anglo-American , faced significant challenges again . Pressures on commodity prices , particularly in the diamond and beer stable , are impacting results . The resource sector as a whole continues to underperform . <p> Alec Hogg : Let 's discuss MTN 's recent decline and its potential ties to the chief rabbi 's allegations . Is there a connection , and how do you interpret it ? <p> David : I do n't believe the allegations helped MTN 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency can impact the share price , in this case , it 's compounded by Nigerian macro headwinds and foreign exchange concerns . The Nigerian market , crucial for MTN , continues to pose challenges . <p> Alec Hogg : Now , shifting gears to Cricket South Africa , David . This seems to be a focus area for you . What 's your perspective on the recent developments ? <p> David : Absolutely , Alec . It might be risky to speak out , but we believe it 's the right thing to do . Two main issues stand out for us . Firstly , yielding to threats of violence sets a dangerous precedent . It undermines the rule of law and suggests decisions can be dictated by force . Our concern is with the decision to remove David Teeger as captain , which , in our view , lacks democratic reasoning . <p> Alec Hogg : You 're calling for transparency from Cricket South Africa . What specific questions are you posing to them ? <p> David : We 've captioned it a bit edgy , urging Cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transparency is crucial , especially for a non-profit institution . We pose three questions , emphasising the importance of disclosing details around the decision-making process . The first question revolves around the security report . Cricket South Africa received an alarm from NetJoints , a government agency . We want them to disclose the contents and assess whether there was a genuine threat . The second question involves Cricket South Africa 's security advisor , Rory Steyn . We want to see both reports -- NetJoints ' and Steyn 's -- to understand the nature of the threat and the ongoing investigation . Transparency is key , and these questions need clear answers . <p> Alec Hogg : Your call for transparency raises valid points . What are you hoping to achieve by taking this stance ? <p> David : My aim is to enhance credibility in Cricket South Africa , its leadership , and its franchise . I have personal connections to the game through friends and family , including a son who aspires to play for South Africa . I genuinely want the organisation to thrive . Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and journalists like you , Alec , can play a crucial role by seeking responses from Cricket South Africa 's Chairman . Sponsors should also raise these questions to ensure the strength of Cricket South Africa . The current actions and explanations provided are not reassuring . <p> Alec Hogg : Absolutely , David . It 's time for cricket to follow in the footsteps of successful sports like soccer and rugby . Your bold stance will prompt us to reach out to Cricket South Africa . Graham Smith , a respected figure , might have valuable insights . However , I find it perplexing that credible board members , like Andrew Hudson , are n't addressing these straightforward questions . It should n't be challenging for them to provide answers . <p> David : Indeed , Alec . It 's essential to get these questions answered for the sake of Cricket South Africa 's integrity and the sport 's future .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving on the other side of the globe . Joining us is Ettienne Brandt , and we appreciate your presence , thank you for joining us . <p> Ettienne Brandt : Thank you , Bob . Good to see you . <p> Bob Skinstad : Likewise . Although I 'd prefer an in-person meeting , let 's dive into it . Your career trajectory in the telecom industry is impressive , working with giants like Orange , EE , and BT in executive roles . Managing a $10.5 billion P&amp;L and leading 8,000 employees at BT in the UK is no small feat . Just over a year ago , you transitioned to Frontier Communications in the U.S. as an executive vice president , residing in Dallas , Texas , and spearheading the business division to establish Gigabit America . There 's much to explore , but first , thank you for being here . <p> Bob Skinstad : Absolutely . Our conversation revolves around individuals who relocate from one place to another . We 've heard from Kiwis , South Africans , and Irish folks , all contributing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Town-born founder of Alexa , your journey is parallel to theirs . Could you share your story of how a South African ended up on the other side of the world ? Feel free to be as concise or detailed as you 'd like . <p> Ettienne Brandt : Certainly , Bob . I grew up in Port Elizabeth and attended Stellenbosch University . As graduation approached , my dad offered a unique gift , asking what I wanted . I expressed a desire to travel , having never left South Africa . He provided ? 700 , a one-way ticket , and covered the visa application . Arriving in the UK , I started by crashing on a friend 's sofa , securing my first job in temporary finance work . Joining a major cable company as a temp , my career gained momentum with three promotions in the first year . The company sponsored my visa , leading to naturalisation and British citizenship . I transitioned from cable to wireless with Orange , spent time in South Africa 's private equity sector , and returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades , I made the unique decision to join Frontier Communications , embarking on the challenge of building Gigabit America . Living in Texas for the past 18 months , the journey has been transformative , echoing the fearless spirit of my younger self who boarded a plane with just a one-way ticket and a dream . <p> Bob Skinstad : Indeed . Let 's delve deeper into those aspects . You touched on various points in your journey , particularly within the UK telecom sector . Given your extensive experience with different telcos , what were the key factors influencing your transitions from one role to the next ? In a field as competitive as telecoms , how do executives discern between a good and bad business strategy ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Certainly , Bob . Having begun my career as an accountant and spending the initial decade in finance roles , I eventually shifted to business management and overseeing business units . Drawing parallels to sports , much like a rugby coach needing expertise in scrums and lineups , telecom executives require a keen understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex industries demands clarity of thought and direction . It 's about identifying positions of strength , understanding market-winning strategies , and navigating complexities . <p> In the corporate landscape , creating structures within the team is vital . I often use the analogy of a soccer game where , in times of crisis , people tend to rush towards the ball , lacking structure . Establishing a clear strategy and breaking down the complexities , akin to analysing a team 's offence , allows for effective leadership . It 's crucial to avoid the chaotic approach where everyone chases the ball , and instead , get individuals to play in their designated positions . In essence , success lies in clarity of thought , strategic planning , and achieving a high hit rate . <p> Bob Skinstad : A compelling approach indeed . Now , considering your evolution from finance roles to managing significant business units , can you elaborate on the principles that guided you ? How did you develop a successful strategy for reducing churn in a high-profile telecom business ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transition to business management , provided a unique perspective . Much like a rugby team needs a playbook , a strategy is not merely a PowerPoint presentation but a dynamic playbook . In the case of reducing churn at BT , we set a vision termed the " 1% churn plan , " aiming to bring the churn rate down from 1.8% to below one within 18 months . Breaking down this ambitious goal into smaller , achievable milestones , and creating a clear playbook , allowed us to succeed . The methodology of fast-fail , repeated at a rapid pace , proved effective in achieving seemingly improbable objectives . <p> Bob Skinstad : Impressive achievements indeed . Moving on , in the corporate world , individuals often reach a stage where they question whether to continue as CEOs or transition to different roles . How does one navigate this dilemma , and is it a matter of character , corporate support , or a combination of both ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : It 's a delicate balance of character and corporate dynamics . Having a resilient mindset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to problem-solving are essential traits . Fast-fail methodology , not as a license for mistakes but as a strategy of rapid experimentation and adaptation , proves beneficial . Individuals must continuously seek opportunities for growth , adapting to new roles , and evolving to meet the demands of leadership at different levels . The ability to overcome headwinds , embrace change , and focus on continual improvement contributes to success in corporate endeavours . <p> Bob Skinstad : Well-articulated . On a personal note , being an expat comes with its challenges , especially when moving from a place like Port Elizabeth to regions with different climates and lifestyles . How do you balance staying connected with your roots while embracing new experiences and making the most of your time in diverse locations like the UK and the U.S. ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Maintaining connections with friends and family in South Africa is crucial , facilitated by advancements in technology . While it 's essential to remember one 's roots , my approach with my wife and kids involves making the most of opportunities for adventure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating a sense of excitement and variety in our experiences . We 've adopted a mindset of enjoying life wherever we are , turning each opportunity into a chance for exploration and discovery . <p> Bob Skinstad : Great insights , Ettienne . Now , let 's touch on a more personal note . Moving from South Africa to the U.S. , your kids had to adapt to a different school system and lifestyle . How has this transition impacted them , especially in terms of sports and entertainment ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Adapting to a new school system and lifestyle has been challenging , especially for the kids , aged 10 and 7 . While sports like rugby and cricket were common in South Africa , the shift to the U.S. introduced them to a variety of sports and entertainment options . It 's not an easy adjustment , considering the presence of established friendship groups . However , sports have played a crucial role in helping them integrate . My daughter has taken up basketball , and my son has embraced soccer , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've explored various sports through summer camps , finding their preferences along the way . <p> Bob Skinstad : That 's fantastic to hear how they 've adapted and embraced different sports . Now , let 's switch gears a bit . In Texas , the climate and outdoor culture differ from South Africa . How has the family adjusted to the Texan lifestyle ? Also , being a South African who loves to braai , how do you handle the outdoor social scene ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Adapting to the Texan lifestyle has been enjoyable . The warm climate , although occasionally too hot , provides ample opportunities for outdoor activities . We 've explored different states , making the most of every opportunity for adventure . When it comes to the outdoor social scene , being a braai enthusiast , I 've brought a South African touch to Texas . I have three grills -- a Traeger pellet smoking grill , a Green Egg , and a gas grill . Whether it 's barbecuing or braaiing , I 'm armed for any outdoor cooking situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration and making the most of every moment . <p> Bob Skinstad : That sounds like a delicious combination of South African braai culture meeting Texan outdoor living . Now , let 's shift focus to your current role at Frontier . As a major player in laying fibre and connecting homes and businesses , how do you navigate the vastness of the U.S. , especially considering the diversity among states like California , Texas , and New York ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Navigating the U.S. requires understanding its unique dynamics , somewhat akin to Europe , where each state functions like its own country . Operating primarily in states like California , Texas , Florida , and New York , we concentrate on major business centres . The challenge arises when dealing with larger businesses that have offices across multiple states . Connectivity solutions become more complex when expanding beyond on-net capabilities . The goal is to build Gigabit America , digitising businesses and consumers by expanding fibre infrastructure . While each state presents its own challenges , focusing on key business hubs helps streamline our operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse states requires strategic planning . Finally , on a broader note , considering your extensive experience in the telecom sector , what 's your perspective on the development of fibre infrastructure in Africa ? Is it viable , or does the prevalence of wireless technologies dominate the landscape ? <p> Ettienne Brandt : Africa offers an interesting case study in technological progression . Unlike the traditional path of fixed-line development followed in Western countries , Africa experienced a leap to wireless technologies . The proliferation of cell phone networks and 3G happened rapidly . While fibre infrastructure is crucial for supporting wireless networks , Africa has , in many cases , skipped the initial phase of fixed-line development . The continent is now adopting fibre more directly , presenting opportunities without the burden of legacy systems . Fiber is foundational for supporting high-speed connectivity , and in Africa , it serves as the backbone for advancing technology . <p> Bob Skinstad : A fascinating perspective on Africa 's technology journey . Ettienne , thank you so much for sharing your experiences , insights , and a glimpse into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a pleasure having you on the show . We wish you continued success in your endeavours , both in Texas and beyond . Thank you for your time . <p> Ettienne Brandt : Thank you , Bob . It 's been a pleasure .

Register here . <p> By Colleen Goko <p> February , when South Africa releases its annual budget , can be a terrible month for the rand , and this year will be no different , many investors expect . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ South Africa 's budget forecast . And in February 2019 , it slumped 5.9% after the finance minister unveiled the highest budget deficit in a decade . All in all , data show the rand has endured an average 2.9% loss in February over the past five years , while the EM currency index slipped 1% . <p> The pattern of February weakness does n't hold over the longer-term , however , and the rand also ended the month flat in February 2021 and 2022 -- years when the budgets were applauded by investors . It all suggests the currency 's fortunes are closely tied to the budget , which this year will be unveiled on Feb. 21 . <p> " The budget is the largest contributor to rand weakness in February , " said Peter C. Earle , senior economist at the American Institute for Economic Research . " The deeper in debt a nation becomes , and as its government shows either an inability or a lack of interest in controlling its budgets , the more the currency will tend to suffer . " <p> The rand has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar , compared to a 0.7% average loss for the EM currency index . It could still find its feet if upcoming US interest rate cuts encourage an investor rush back into developing nations . But the signs -- for February at least -- are not promising . <p> For one , South Africa holds a national election later in 2024 , with the ruling African National Congress at risk of losing its majority for the first time since the end of White-minority rule in 1994 . That will up the pressure on politicians to spend on vote-winning giveaways . <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa hinted last month at introducing a basic income grant , saying there is a " strong case " for it despite fiscal constraints . <p> " The Ramaphosa administration has n't been able to restore confidence in the rand among institutional investors since the last election , " said Piotr Matys , senior FX analyst at InTouch Capital Markets . To retain power , the government could resort to a budget that exacerbates its fiscal problem , hurting the rand , he added . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget statement to announce a borrowing increase . He 's committed in particular to extending a Covid-era monthly payment for low-income citizens until March 2025 and to fully implement previously announced pay increases for 1.3 million state employees . <p> The announcements are unnerving investors , whose holdings of South African bonds are already at a record low , following a slew of corruption scandals , crises at Eskom and state-run rail and ports operator Transnet SOC , and the government 's ever-widening financing needs . The consolidated budget deficit should widen to 4.8% of gross domestic product this year , and remain at 4.6% in 2025 , Fitch predicts , a major overshoot of official estimates . <p> " Will a wider budget deficit come as a surprise to investors ? No , it really should n't . But , perhaps some might still be hoping that the government does more to reign in spending , " said Carmen Altenkirch , an analyst at Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd . <p> A moderate budget that does n't compromise too much on the fiscal side should support the rand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For South Africa , the challenge is that it 's more than just the budget deficit . It 's the financing requirement , which includes Eskom . This is likely to gain even greater focus than just the headline deficit , " she added .

Instead , it was eventually revealed that Jackpot is an identity used by two different women - genetic researcher Sara Ehret and her admirer , Alana Jobson . It was reported in August 2018 that a Jackpot movie was in development , and in 2020 further news came that Marc Guggenheim was writing the screenplay .

@@106078240 <p> Advertising agencies are faced with shorter consumer attention spans , plummeting budgets , an ever-evolving media channel dynamic and the pressure to deliver faster than ever before . This , coupled with clients ' growing concern over their return-on-investment , has resulted in issues in the relationships advertising agencies have with their clients . <p> An unspoken issue in this relationship is the opportunistic behaviour by both parties , to the deliberate detriment of each other . Beneath the glamorous award ceremonies , witty campaigns by our favourite fast food joints and jumping on the latest Instagram challenge bandwagon are deceptive behaviours . A case in point is the Wimpy-McDonald 's scandal . After pitching an idea to McDonald 's , employees of advertising agency OwenKessel Leo Burnett began working at a new advertising agency , ' The Odd Number ' . There , they pitched the same idea that they had pitched to McDonald 's . In the end , the competing fast-food chains released the same advert . <p> A recent study exposes how clients ( i.e. , marketing managers at firms ) and advertising agencies in South Africa act this way . This is confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opportunism happens , blame the other , yet recognise the existence of opportunism on their part as well . <p> The study directs attention to client -- agency opportunism by describing how it happens . It concludes with a discussion on how today 's client -- agency dynamics can be improved . One suggestion , for example , is a simple two-way communication . Both advertising agencies and clients should clearly state what their objectives and available resources are . This will set the expectations of the relationship , to avoid misunderstandings , assumptions or tit-for-tat behaviour . <p> We interviewed account managers at leading advertising agencies , representing the advertising agency , and marketing managers at established firms , representing the client . <h> Opportunistic behaviour <p> The research shows that advertising agencies and clients act opportunistically both before and after the signing of a contract . Based on verbatims from the key account managers and marketing managers , the following findings were obtained . <p> Pre-contract , advertising agencies over-promise and withhold information . Often , the senior executives who pitch to the client are promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up working on it post-contract . Other advertising agencies list clients on their website who they have done menial , or no , work for , giving a misleading impression of their credibility . <p> A particularly unique trait of advertising agencies is their prioritisation of winning awards , rather than doing what is best for the client 's return-on-investment . They might suggest , for example , the client pays R150 000 ( about US$8990 ) for a television commercial , with the intention of using the campaign to win an advertising award . The client in this case would have benefited more from spending the money elsewhere . <p> Clients act opportunistically pre-contract by exploiting advertising agencies and withholding information . They might promise to pay the advertising agency for 80 hours of work , yet intend to subtly ask the advertising agencies for 10 more hours of work during the process without extra pay . Some clients steal the creative ideas that advertising agencies have pitched to them . <p> Once the honeymoon phase is over , the opportunism grows . Both parties continue to withhold information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcharge by misrepresenting their actual hours working on the campaign . They also mislead their client to believe that the work undertaken is strenuous . This type of behaviour was prevalent with the advent of digital marketing . Clients overpaid for setting up websites or Facebook campaigns because it was unfamiliar territory to them . They did not know how few hours it actually took to create a Facebook advert . <p> Some agencies neglect , or stall , smaller client work to meet the demands of larger clients . Other agencies create separate entities , to work with competing brands from the same industry . For example , Entity A works with ' Betty 's Burgers ' and Entity B works with ' Bob 's Burgers ' . In the case where allocated human and financial resources are agreed in advance , some agencies fail to disclose to the client when an employee has left their agency . This leaves the advertising agency with more money to distribute among their staff . <p> Post-contract , clients primarily use their power advantage to illtreat advertising agencies . This includes calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to demand work for 8am the next day . Some clients also send vague WhatsApp messages as briefs and expect the agency to deliver an outstanding campaign off that . In some cases , marketing managers may blame advertising agencies for ' poor work ' . This is done to encourage their board to hire an alternative advertising agency with whom the marketing manager has a personal relationship with . <p> That said , favourable working relationships can be fostered by two-way communication , accountability from both parties , seeking an appropriate culture-fit early on , being fair and realistic when charging and paying , embodying reliability and adapting to changes in the environment as partners .

There are no cost orders in criminal cases , after all . This means that if the state fails to prosecute someone , the parties will pay their own costs . <p> I felt offended when this was revealed to me .

And yet , even if the system determines that the accused was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not pay the accused 's costs . <p> I can not see how this principle survives in the modern day , when notions of ' justice ' and ' fairness ' dominate the public discourse . <p> The fix is painfully simple : if the state fails to prove someone 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , the state ( regrettably the taxpayer ) must bear the full cost of the accused 's defence . This is an inherent implication of the principle of innocent until proven guilty . <p> Without this reform , the process is the punishment , which assumes guilt before any verdict on the facts has been delivered . <h> Justifications <p> In the magisterial Constitutional Law of South Africa ( CLoSA ) , Adv Michael Bishop outlines some of the justifications for this inequitable principle . One is that : <p> ' ... we would not want to discourage the state from bringing bona fide prosecutions because of the fear of costs . There is always some unpredictability in prosecuting a case : a prosecutor never knows how witnesses will perform on the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the state risked an adverse costs order every time it lost , then it might be inclined to prosecute fewer cases . ' <p> This justification can not under any circumstances be accepted . <p> The entire Western legal tradition is built on the notion that it must be difficult for the state to prosecute people . This is why the principle of the presumption of innocence is proven beyond a reasonable doubt is so deeply entrenched . <p> But more than that : in any other kind of litigation , a judge is meant to be impartial -- even the appearance of partiality must lead to recusal . But in criminal litigation , the common law requires judges to be partial in favour of the defendant . This is the principle in favorem libertatis -- that any benefit of the doubt shall be for the person whose liberty is in jeopardy . <p> The criminal justice system is set up for the state to lose , and rightly so . <p> Only those who are clearly and unambiguously guilty on the objective facts should face criminal sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The state 's ambivalence about how expensive criminal prosecutions might be to it should therefore be entirely irrelevant to the courts . Prosecution should be expensive for the state . <p> The second ' justification ' found in CloSA , is baffling beyond measure : The state should not be liable for the defence 's costs , because ' the vast majority of criminal defendants do not in fact pay for their defence team . ' <p> Well , golly-gee , I wonder why that is ! As CLoSA rightly notes , this justification ' does not provide a sufficient explanation in cases where the accused does indeed pay for her own defence ' , as opposed to using legal aid . <h> Reform right now <p> My fellow liberals would balk at me saying this , but I have long considered Australia , on paper a liberal democracy , to be a country that verges on being a totalitarian police state . Nonetheless , despite my deep concerns with that legal system , it has this principle right . There , the prosecution -- the state -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an acquittal . <p> South Africa has an incredibly violent crime problem that puts some low-intensity war zones to shame . There are many reasons for this . And there are solutions , but giving the state free rein to prosecute the innocent in a reckless fashion is not one of them . <p> Taking violent crime seriously also means defining the scope of criminality appropriately , and ensuring that those who are innocent are not pursued by our prosecutors . And when they are so pursued , they should be compensated . <p> South Africa should not be outdone by the likes of Australia when it comes to the rights of those wrongly accused . Either Parliament or the superior courts should urgently go about the necessary reforms to ensure that the principle of innocent until proven guilty is given substantive , not merely formal , effect .

@@107306238 <p> On Saturday , scores of people and their doggies celebrated one of Simon 's Town 's most famous residents , Just Nuisance . <p> The Great Dane , who died 80 years ago this week , was the first dog in the world to receive an official Royal Navy rank . To celebrate and honour the life of this extraordinary hound , humans and canines flock to the naval suburb to eat cake , go on walkies and listen to a pipe band . Last year , about 80 dogs turned up for the event . <p> Just Nuisance , as the dog was to become known , was born on the 1st of April in 1937 in Rondebosch , a suburb in the south peninsula of Cape Town . As a pup , he was sold to owner Benjamin Chaney , who moved to Simon 's Town to run the United Services Institute ( USI ) . Many Royal Navy sailors frequented the USI as they headed the Simon 's Town Naval Base at the time .

Apparently , Just Nuisance got into the habit of riding the train to Cape Town with his sailor friends who , in Sisson 's words , " did not bother to buy him a ticket " , which peeved the officials to no end . <p> At first , the sailors tried hiding the " Hercules of Dogdom " , as Sisson coined him , under the seats but this did not work .

His trade was given as ' bonecrusher ' and his religious denomination as ' scrounger ' . Once enlisted , the British Admiralty " paid for a season ticket that allowed the dog to ride to Johannesburg if he so wished " , writes Sisson . <p> The sailors probably thought of him as too human because all the beer they gave him caused him to damage his hind legs while under the influence .

After May , the 29 other talented people who are likely to grace Parliament for the first time later this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's number one in his new party . <p> 00:00:38:07 -- 00:01:04:18Alec Hogg : It 's called the Xiluva , you know , on that list we 've got ANC veteran league chairs . Snuky Zikalala , number 90 on the ANC national list . Herman Mashaba and Athol Trollip . One two on ActionSA . Gayton McKenzie Velenkosini Hlabisa . Mmusi Maimane Ace Magashule even Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Songezo Zibi topping their party 's national list . They could be in SA parliament . <p> 00:01:04:18 -- 00:01:30:09Alec Hogg : It 's going to be an interesting place in the future . Two people who are going to make it so are , Kathy Berman , who 's number four on the Build One South Africa with Mmusi Maimane , national list and , Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi , who is number seven on the IFP national list . So both of them pretty certain of going to Parliament for the first time . <p> 00:01:30:11 -- 00:01:45:09Alec Hogg : Ladies first . Kathy . Why now ? We 've known each other for many years . You 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there entrepreneurial activist . Why join Mmusi and why indeed are you going to Parliament ? <p> 00:01:45:11 -- 00:02:17:16Kathy Berman : Alec , we go back a while . 30 years , although I still identify as thirty . Yeah . Yeah . So I think , Alec , I 've been through any number of changes over the years , but the primary thing that 's always driven me is social justice and democracy in the fullest extent . And so you knew me in my journalist days . I went on into all sorts of forms of business and worked a long time in government as a consultant or full time with Pravin at SARS . <p> 00:02:17:16 -- 00:02:46:20Kathy Berman : And , in , in the early 2000s , and I just reached a point where I was always a supporter of the ANC from the 80s , which was UDF in those days . And I reached a point where during Covid , where I could n't anymore , my beloved ANC no longer held the same values that we all bought into . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 00:02:47:00 -- 00:03:11:14Kathy Berman : I worked with the Nelson Mandela Children 's Hospital , I worked in various informal settlements , and I just felt that I did n't have any impact . There was little me trying to get funding from wherever , and I started looking around . I was working with civil society organizations and something clicked . I had an exhibition at Conhill , and heard Mmusi speaking at an event , and I would never have supported him in his former role . <p> 00:03:11:14 -- 00:03:38:04Kathy Berman : And suddenly it resonated for me . And after 1 or 2 meetings , I just felt it 's time to step up . I would never have done this in my other life , but it was time , and it 's felt absolutely right . There 's so much that I know that so many of us can now do as civil society people , because the politicians forgive me , but the politicians have just really I do n't think they worry about the people . <p> 00:03:38:10 -- 00:03:59:08Kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community to step up in whichever way we can , whether it 's in Parliament or whether it 's simply making sandwiches for people on the side of the road . Whatever it is , we 've got to make a difference . This country 's full of amazing , incredible people . It 's up to us to step up so that that 's me . In short , I do n't want to take over . <p> 00:03:59:10 -- 00:04:24:22Alec Hogg : Prince Buthelezi your father , Mangosuthu Buthelezi , is an icon in my home province of KZN and around the world as well . And you 've stayed out of politics . I 'd see from , one can see everything now on the national , on the parliamentary or potential parliamentary list . So we know you turning or just turned 69 . So you 've managed to stay away from , politics for a long , long time . <p> 00:04:30:02 -- 00:04:56:04Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : Thank you , Alec , thanks for the opportunity . First time on the platform , We go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , many years back as well . But to your question are absolutely correct . really , Kathy will attest , never wanted to be anywhere near politics . I was more into business , I suppose . Maybe it was mainly to the pressure and expectation But you know what they call the burden of expectation . <p> 00:04:56:06 -- 00:05:20:03Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : I think it 's better , you know , they define your objectives and they start marking you against those objectives , which you never say to yourself . And I mean , of course , if you talk about the table and space in terms of politics My father was at the very table and space in terms of for as long as I 'm sure you 'll also attest to that Alec . I 'll admit , now finding myself in this position , I 'm wondering . <p> 00:05:20:03 -- 00:05:46:08Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : Sometimes I ask myself how much of this is by me wanting . Now you 're asking me why now ? Now , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here or just being fate because you know , this expectation ? Also , there were expectations from my father as well you know , I need someone who can take over the helm carry on so really I found myself being nominated . <p> 00:06:58:21 -- 00:07:24:18Alec Hogg : And what about the IFP itself ? When one looks at the pollsters , they appear to give a very different picture to the one that I 'm hearing from Mr. Hlabisa , or indeed from the by-elections where it was interesting that we had the latest polls coming out just around the time of the BizNews conference , and it put the IFP at maybe 2 or 3% . <p> 00:07:24:20 -- 00:07:38:04Alec Hogg : And yet you won three by-elections that day , against the ANC . But with seismic increases , do you think the polls are getting it wrong or are you guys just overestimating ? <p> 00:07:38:06 -- 00:08:02:11Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : Alec , I do n't think that . I think really it 's a mixture of what is trying to be appointed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depends who 's looking at them . But I think that maybe people have been a bit superficial in assessing the impact of the IFP . I mean , if you this is a party which had a long time when the IFP was formed if you are left with three municipalities . <p> 00:08:02:13 -- 00:08:28:20Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : Now , I my father always said , you know , I 'd rather have good people on the ship . You know , the story of being inside the tent rather than being outside you know , so really there 's a lot of effort that has been put in putting the IFP back to where it was . But I found it fascinating when you look at how the polls are fear propping and they are saying different things . <p> 00:08:28:20 -- 00:08:52:18Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : And it says to me one must too much to be led by polls but they are important of course they always will be . But I think that in terms of the IFP is , there are other questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalitions was always a question of whether it is advised to decide before the election the results of the election because what if the partner you choose is nowhere to be seen , is not on the horizon at all . <p> 00:08:52:20 -- 00:09:15:23Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : So really , there are certain compelling things which other parties are dealing with right now . Like as I said , coalitions which are I do n't think one can escape them . I think by is how we do them . There are countries where they are powerful , they are doing well . But South Africa will have to go through a learning curve of coalitions . And then on day one , whatever pain will come with that we shall see . <p> 00:09:16:04 -- 00:09:17:10Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : We shall see . <p> 00:09:17:12 -- 00:09:23:04Alec Hogg : How many municipalities does the IFP now govern or govern in coalition ? <p> 00:09:23:06 -- 00:09:44:12Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : I really would n't be drawn to speak to me either , but it 's a lot . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what I said about me in politics . But anyway , I know that it 's a lot of municipalities , definitely three times a lot because it was left with three . I 'm sure it can be three times five of the of where they think it 's . <p> 00:09:44:18 -- 00:10:15:11Alec Hogg : I was looking at the good governance Africa numbers just over the weekend , and it was interesting to see how the municipalities , where the IFP governs , have improved in those ratings quite significantly . But I guess that 's a story for another day . Kathy , from your perspective , we 've been following Mmusi 's journey now in BizNews for a couple of years already , and he 's been hard at work in communities , really in the rural areas as well . <p> 00:10:15:12 -- 00:10:20:06Alec Hogg : What are you guys saying about the polls , where many of whom do n't even give you a single seat ? <p> 00:10:20:10 -- 00:10:47:23Kathy Berman : You know , Alec , I 'm one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody 's talking about the science , the polls , but , I 'm one who I remember going into a voting booth and looking and trying to be strategic and my heart taking over . And I voted for the ANC for the last time . So I always wonder what people are going to do once they 're faced with that piece of paper . <p> 00:10:48:01 -- 00:11:15:10Kathy Berman : What I can only respond to is how I see what people how people respond to Mmusi . Because I have absolute faith in Mmusi as a politician , as a man of integrity , and as a man who knows how to frame things , how to see things . And he 's a man of compassion . And what I love is going onto the streets of the cities and seeing people who are in police uniforms , etc. , running up and wanting these selfies . <p> 00:11:15:15 -- 00:11:43:10Kathy Berman : When I was putting up posters , people would literally in Sandton would stop their cars and say , is that Mmusi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , again , this notion of can the sciences be accurate . And I do n't want to be skeptical . People put their lives into it . But I 've got to believe that we 've got an incredible group in our top tier , and that certainly the call for Mmusi is a big one . <p> 00:11:43:10 -- 00:11:53:15Kathy Berman : But we 've got amazing . We 've got Ayanda , we 've got Nobuntu to add I do n't have much recognition out there , but I think that those are the things that probably will work in our favor . <p> 00:11:53:17 -- 00:12:15:10Alec Hogg : There 's no doubt a video that we republished of Ayanda 's recent . You got more than 100,000 views . So a lot of people who kind of get it that Mmusi is getting around him . It seems many strong woman maybe you need to elevate the profiles of the strong men that are around you . But it 's going to be a great place . <p> 00:12:15:16 -- 00:12:35:23Alec Hogg : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince Buthelezi Parliament , from what I 've been told , can be a very boring place , especially if you 're in a party that is n't running the place . How are you going to overcome that boredom or or how indeed are you positioning yourself for the next five years ? Maybe . Start with you , Kathy . <p> 00:12:35:23 -- 00:12:54:08Kathy Berman : So for me , it 's easy . I 've decided exactly which committees I want to sit on . So I 'm in there and , you know , we are in there . We 're certainly getting four seats in there because I 'm sitting at number four right now . But I 've decided exactly which portfolio committees I want to serve on . There are certain areas that I 'm absolutely passionate about . <p> 00:12:54:08 -- 00:13:13:03Kathy Berman : The areas I know a lot about . I worked in the PPP unit and things like that . I worked at SARS but I would n't want to hog those seats . I really feel strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etcetera . I mean , right now I work in the children 's hospital where we ca n't get organ donors for our young kids with kidney issues . <p> 00:13:13:05 -- 00:13:36:22Kathy Berman : So there 's a simple private member 's bill that I 'll work on , which is to ensure that we have an opt-out versus an opt-in solution . I have a son , my instant son , who grew up in the township , who to this day has n't got an ID book . He 's 27 years old . So you can see again that the human rights , the justice issues are what absolutely float my boat . <p> 00:13:37:00 -- 00:13:55:23Kathy Berman : And so I 'm not one who 's going to sit there and play Candy Crush . And I do n't want to go shopping for shoes . And I really do n't want ta blue light brigade . So for me , we going to work damn hard . I do n't think it 's going to be boring . I think it 's so exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen the light of day . <p> 00:13:56:01 -- 00:14:06:05Kathy Berman : We have to be bringing people in who are going to be assisting the committees and not fall asleep . So I 'm there for working hard . So it 's not going to be boring . <p> 00:14:08:03 -- 00:14:29:04Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : Alec , I think that I 'm somehow aligned with that , with what Kathy has said . The thing is that one of the reasons why nothing turns me on about Parliament . I wonder when we talk about young people . I think I remember my father was in Parliament when they were sitting in the gallery . Why do I call this the , you know , throwing missiles across the hall ? <p> 00:14:29:06 -- 00:14:49:22Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : That is this example , giving those young people up there . Because really , at the moment , the perception of Parliament is very bizarre . That also really weighed in for me to say , do I want to go to that place where you have a mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse and as temperatures are getting higher and higher , I mean , and I said , these are adults . <p> 00:14:50:03 -- 00:15:24:00Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : And I thought I have struggled to see myself sitting there . But then I 've said I 've sat on many boards and I 've checked many on this , and I think you are more effective when you are in a committee , just like , I mean , if I compare report to your committee rather than sit there . So I also will pick . I mean , when you sit down to say where we believe , as the IFP we can contribute most , we definitely point out very clearly where I like to contribute , but I prefer the back room in terms of a small space committee . <p> 00:15:24:02 -- 00:15:44:05Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : I think that this brought to being and I was just saying that it 's always been my belief that when a thing is no longer effective and I go that I 'll be very , very clear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my energies to , but not to what we see on TV and people falling asleep and snoring that . <p> 00:15:44:06 -- 00:16:05:16Alec Hogg : Yeah , I think many people in South Africa will be cheering that , comment . And , and nice to know that they 'll have people like you guys helping them or representing them in Parliament . But why the IFP Prince ? Was it just a foregone conclusion ? Did you ever think of any of the other parties I like ? <p> 00:16:05:16 -- 00:16:25:23Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : You know , I was born and bred in the IFP my father from the time I did n't even know I. By the way , he was not always IFP . He was in the political space from when I was a baby . So how did it define itself going forward ? It was a different matter altogether because he became many things . He became he served as the Minister of Home Affairs . <p> 00:16:26:01 -- 00:16:53:07Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : In a way , this role as a prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no argument there already know . But then I think what I always tell people is that I bought into the man who happened to my father rather than the party , because , you know , I 've always said , my father , if there 's one thing I always really admired , is that whatever he did , he defined it , made it clear what he want . <p> 00:16:53:07 -- 00:17:30:18Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : We all know that a family is a microcosm of the community . So if you are a leader , if you fail to be a leader in your own home , as a husband and a father , I think that there 's no way that you can be phenomenal.as a leader out there so that 's really the picture I bought into the man , really . But then as I grew up , they are policies I 've liked to the difference he has made and certain characters in him as a man , a minimum wage , which I 've really admired and respected in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of IFP , we must look at those characters that no , no tolerance . <p> 00:17:30:20 -- 00:17:51:20Prince Zuzifa Buthelezi : I mean , actually , very high tolerant behavior , parties . And this is why he ended up being defined as a , as a Statesman a great way to answer you . It 's not so much , you know , it 's like being someone defined my father as a phenomenal human being who happened to be a politician . <p> 00:17:51:22 -- 00:18:16:06Alec Hogg : And from your side , Kathy last word . Are you , when you look back as a hard-boiled , dyed-in-the-wool ANC supporter , you now joined in with the archenemy , or certainly was when he was leading the DA . Yeah . Why Mmusi Why , why with Mmusi 's lot . Why not ? Maybe Songezo Zibi . If you wanted to make a difference or indeed even actually say . <p> 00:18:16:12 -- 00:18:41:03Kathy Berman : Well , ironically , the ANC , are the people you keep saying to me , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fortuitous . Rise were , organizing at that point , but they were n't yet a party when I had this drive to make the change . and I believe that , you know , the thing with Mmusi is he 's been there . <p> 00:18:41:03 -- 00:19:13:18Kathy Berman : He knows the space . And I had an opportunity to work closely with them . I invested a year of my life working with them before we launched into campaign phase . And so , being there , being able to to have a strong role in it . and so it 's , it 's fitted perfectly there there 's been a lot of robust debates and they 've been certain positions that I would n't necessarily adhere to , but it would be the same with the ANC . <p> 00:19:13:19 -- 00:19:35:08Kathy Berman : it would be the same with . But it certainly I mean , it would have I mean , if there were any choices that would have been rise or , or build one South Africa . But ANC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 'm looking forward to building and I 'm looking forward to working with dynamic , charismatic , intelligent , I mean super intelligent people . <p> 00:19:35:13 -- 00:19:50:07Kathy Berman : But most excitingly , when we talk coalitions , I 'm really excited about being working alongside all the people you mentioned because we as a group are going to make a difference . I ca n't wait to be working with so many amazing , amazing people . <p> 00:19:50:12 -- 00:20:09:04Alec Hogg : Kathy Berman and Prince Zuzifa for Buthelezi . It 's been great talking with you . I think the whoever 's watching this is going to be feeling a little bit more uplifted about South Africa 's political future . but I guess there was only one way for us to go roll on May the 29th.

Could you unpack more about the Western Cape before we talk about the national scene ? Because people were shocked when they heard Gayton say it 's definitely not going to be a DA victory . <p> Corn ? Mulder 00:00:32 <p> Let me start about the tactical voting . Do n't tamper with the electoral system when you 're about to defeat the ANC . I tried to convince people not to go there . The ANC wo n't amend the system unless it 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , nothing to do with independence , but to steal . The electoral system itself is going to be difficult . In the past , there were two ballots , now three . Parliament consists of 400 members . You have the first ballot to elect 200 members directly , only party names . The second ballot is for the other 200 members , including independents . Latest rumors say there may be 16 independents . Then there 's a third ballot strictly for the provincial legislature . People sometimes vote tactically , preferring one party provincially and another nationally . If you look at the Western Cape , for example , ACDP voters are loyal provincially but vote differently nationally . My strategy this election is to say , vote for your choice on all ballots . <p> Alec Hogg 00:03:38 <p> How do you recommend people vote ? <p> Corn ? Mulder 00:03:54 <p> People more readily vote for us nationally because they see our role in Parliament . We make a difference by being there . In the Western Cape , the focus will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Freedom Front Plus .

This shows the resilience of African banking groups , led mostly by South African , West African , and Northern African banks , who are determined to maximise the available opportunities . <p> As Africa is currently poised to be the second fastest growing regional economy , with more than 10 African countries experiencing substantial Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth , the local environment and available expertise coupled with global knowledge play an important role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent is where the banking sector is looking more for insights to succeed , " says Claude-Nguetsop . <p> The survey showed that the expansion across the continent over the coming years will be driven primarily by opportunities in Corporate Banking , Investment Banking , and Transaction Banking followed by retail and wealth management -- with Southern , Eastern , and West Africa presenting the biggest opportunity . Expansion strategies are a key priority area for financial institutions located within Africa -- driven by digital and collaboration-based approaches . <p> Artificial intelligence ( AI ) and digital innovation <p> Artificial intelligence models have the potential to transform businesses and everyday life profoundly . In line with our analysts ' assessments , financial institutions are looking towards combining a " build and buy " strategy to enhance their AI and digital innovation skills and portfolios . <p> The information technology spend on AI and digital innovation is a testament to the 38% of participants who confirmed that between 21% and 30% of their IT budget is devoted toward these priorities . <p> Similarly , however , 54% of survey participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and digital innovation lies within budgetary constraints . <p> Interestingly , 50% outlined that they had , or intended to , deploy AI technologies to reduce the costs associated with compliance .

@@107713240 <h> Average match data shows the number of penalties given for high tackles almost halved at the end of the competition . <p> SA Rugby expressed their delight with the positive approach from coaches and players in the Varsity Cup to the new tackle height law introduced to the community game in South Africa this year . <p> New laws to make rugby safer at school and club level were approved at a SA Rugby general council meeting in 2023 , relating to the lowering of the maximum legal height at which a tackle may be made while also outlawing potentially dangerous ball-carrying actions and techniques . <p> The Varsity Cup was the first prominent competition in South Africa to use these laws and according to detailed averaged match data , the number of penalties for high tackles decreased from 14.5 per round to 7.5 towards the end of the league phase of the competition . <p> Furthermore , ball carriers were more aware of dipping their heads lower than their hips with penalties in this area declining from three in the opening round to zero during the past two rounds . <p> " As our Springbok head coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'd like to thank and congratulate all coaches and players who have actively worked hard on correct , safe , and effective tackle technique , " says SA Rugby CEO Rian Oberholzer . <p> " In the same breath , I would also like to thank all the match officials for enforcing the changes . Projects such as these do n't come without teething problems and although we are aware of issues in some provinces , these are by far in the minority . <p> " All involved in the Varsity Cup have shown what can be achieved with a positive approach . Apart from fewer penalties for high tackles , and without having properly interrogated all the data yet , preliminary observations are that there appears to be fewer concussions in this year 's tournament , which is exactly what we were hoping to achieve . " <p> Oberholzer reiterates SA Rugby 's commitment to ensuring a safer game at amateur level . <p> " We did n't take the decision to implement these law variations lightly and months of very hard work went into the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season is in full swing , and we would yet again like to urge referees to apply these new laws as per the tackle-height framework , while coaches and players must make the effort to familiarise themselves with these new laws and coach and play accordingly . <p> " This is work in progress , and we are learning as the season progresses . If all the involved parties come together and do what they can to make it a success , we will see even more positive results in the coming months , as these new laws gain momentum . <p> " We would like to see referees continuing to penalise tacklers that are in upright body positions . Ball carriers leading into contact with their bodies horizontal and heads lower than hips make it impossible for tacklers to tackle low and is penalisable . Finally , zero tolerance must be applied to tacklers diving at the limbs of ball carriers with leading shoulders and no clear wrapping of the arms . All these must be penalised with the applicable card depending on the level of danger . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting it spot on , but there has been a marked improvement , and we are very happy to see that .

@@107739235 <p> In this world , nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes . The now famous words by Benjamin Franklin , quoted in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy in 1789 , touched on two of humanity 's biggest heartaches : dying and having to fork over your hard-earned money to SARS . <p> But taxation is nothing new , so any possible argument we can muster against paying our dues has been made for thousands of years . So instead of crying about tax , perhaps some history on the subject can act as a salve to soothe our bleeding pockets . After all , misery loves company , and this is one misery that has been shared through the ages as much as death . <p> The word ' tax ' first appeared in English in the fourteenth century and stems from the Latin word taxare , which means ' to assess ' . Initially , English used the comparable word ' task ' , and for a time , the terms ' task ' and ' tax ' were interchangeable , with the first referring to effort and the latter to money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean something tedious or difficult ( sounds about right ) , so words like ' duty ' were adopted to make it sound more appealing . Political spin has , after all , as long a history as taxation , and neither is going anywhere soon . <p> China , which has one of the longest of all written records , was the first to create a ' bureaucracy ' to collect and administer taxes , which was used to establish the Empire . In Egypt , the Pharaoh 's scribes were charged with raising funds in any way practical , including taxes on household cooking oil . This ' oil tax ' was also the first-ever recorded instance of tax avoidance as primitive audits revealed subjects were recycling oil in order to avoid paying the tax . <p> The Pharaohs even claimed divine rights to their share as supported by The ' Book of Genesis ' in The Bible , which suggested that a fifth of all crops should be given to the Pharaoh . <p> Ancient Greece soon imposed eishpora on their citizens to pay for wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , however , any surplus eishpora had to be refunded . Perhaps the first recorded tax refunds ? <p> Rome ran with the tax idea and Julius Caesar introduced a 1% sales tax while Augustus eventually instituted an inheritance tax to provide retirement funds for the military . Human bondage however remained the most lucrative form of tax for both Greece and Rome . <p> Political taxes were soon coining it for governments of the day , so the religious institutions quickly jumped on the bandwagon by implementing a ' tithe ' , or a tenth of what the faithful produced , usually paid to the Church in kind . Islam eventually introduced the ' Islamic Tax ' , the khums , or ' one twentieth ' , which was far better than the tenth of the Christians at the time . <p> India took on the jizya , and the Aztec , Olmec , Maya and Inca cultures claimed their fair share with the terrifying-sounding ' ritual observance ' , while Hindus and Buddhists sustained their temples and monasteries with contributions of time , skill and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , and soon everything from beards , boots , beehives , candles , nuts , hats , horses , chimneys , and water were taxed -- mostly thanks to ' The Great ' Tsar Peter of Russia who used tax to establish the Red Empire . <p> More modern systems of taxation soon followed the expansion of imperial Europe , together with towns and cities , where tribute in kind was less useful , and cash became the currency of choice . But handing over cash is always harder , and in 1629 , a dispute between the British Parliament and King Charles I eventually led to civil war . <p> The fight against taxes began and even fuelled the French Revolution between 1789 and 1799 . This revolt against taxation levied by imperial Britain also fuelled the formation of the United States , but by then , no state could operate without taxes , and so , to skip ahead a few centuries , it remains as certain as death until today . <p> Governments all over the world have over the centuries implemented all kinds of strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society can not function without some sort of tax system in place .

@@107786231 <p> In the Western Cape High Court , a Cape Town woman 's successful attempt to compel her husband into involuntary drug rehabilitation was invalidated due to his lack of legal representation , as ruled by Judge James Lekhuleni on Monday . <p> According to News24 , the woman had originally sought to have her husband committed for six months in a bid to address his excessive marijuana use , along with issues of excessive sleeping , irritability and an inability to perform household tasks or hold employment . <p> The judgement revealed that she applied to the magistrate 's court for this intervention , citing her husband 's chronic marijuana consumption , depression , and occasional psychotic episodes . <p> The woman , who described her husband as a qualified engineer with above-average intelligence , expressed her inability to manage both her responsibilities and her husband 's condition any longer . She hoped that the structured support of a rehabilitation facility would benefit him . However , past attempts at shorter voluntary treatment had ended with relapses or early departures . <p> In response , the husband argued that his marijuana use was a cost-effective alternative to medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . <p> He expressed a preference to be committed for a duration not exceeding three weeks . <p> During the proceedings for his commitment , the magistrate inquired if he had any queries for the social worker who had presented her findings to the court . At this juncture , he voiced his concerns regarding the length of time he would be separated from his home . <p> Initially , he had waived his entitlement to legal representation . However , during the proceedings , he addressed the magistrate , expressing his unease with the intense legal interrogation . He requested a postponement until he could secure legal counsel , fearing that his lack of legal expertise might lead him to say something regrettable . <p> He added , ' I have got experts , doctors who could testify to my condition and to my needs , and right now , I feel as if I am in danger of having myself incarcerated for six months or a longer period . And I did not realise that I would be putting myself in that kind of a danger when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did not express a desire to represent himself . <p> Subsequently , a conversation ensued with the magistrate , during which he learned that the initial rehabilitation period would span a minimum of 42 days , which further unsettled him . <p> Despite his concerns , the magistrate proceeded to issue an order for his involuntary commitment to rehabilitation , treatment , and skills development for six months . This decision was based on the magistrate 's determination that he met the criteria outlined in the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency Act , being deemed dependent on substances and posing a risk to his own welfare and that of his family . <p> The case underwent automatic review by the high court . In Judge Lekhuleni 's judgement , he highlighted Section 35(3) of the Act , which guaranteed the individual certain rights during the inquiry process . <p> These rights included entitlement to legal representation , the ability to cross-examine witnesses , the option to present evidence personally or through legal representation , and the opportunity to present reasons against the order being made . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive procedural fairness , asserting that intelligence and verbal proficiency should not preclude these rights from being upheld . <p> ' All the more so , when the issue raised in the hearing relates to the deprivation of personal liberty of a person , ' Lekhuleni added . <p> Judge Lekhuleni invalidated the order and directed that the process of involuntary commitment be restarted . Despite the magistrate 's thorough explanation of the rehabilitation duration , the court overlooked his plea for legal representation . <p> Additionally disregarded was his plea to present experts who could attest that he was not addicted to substances , but rather used them as a more affordable form of medication . <p> ' It must be stressed that the right to legal representation is ensconced in the Constitution and should not be lightly dispensed with by courts , ' he said . <p> Judge Constance Nziweni concurred with the decision . <p> To safeguard their privacy , the individuals involved were not identified in the judgement .

" At a meeting with Khumalo on March 13 , Nel and his team expressed their willingness to work with the police . Regrettably , Khumalo has since terminated all communication with the unit and refuses to update Ndlovu 's widow and family on the investigation 's progress , despite the police 's obligation to do so . " <p> According to the statement , Nel sent a letter to Khumalo on March 19 , to voice his dissatisfaction . Nel summarised the nature of the above meeting as follows : " Your seeming unwillingness to foster a relationship of co-operation to solve this callous assassination is disappointing ... Despite our indicating that we may be able to assist in the investigation because we have access to information from persons who distrust the police themselves , you have shown no interest .

These successes include the arrest of 175 hitmen , she said , adding that 110 are still on trial . <p> Mathe said the task team is probing two cases involving DA members : <p> The first is a murder and attempted murder investigation involving DA councillor Michael Buthelezi and his family .

Mathe says the investigation is continuing . " Further information can not be divulged to anyone , including AfriForum 's Private Prosecution Unit , until the investigation is finalised and the perpetrators are brought to book .

Is it leaving for ' portfolio management ' reasons or because it thinks South Africa is a corrupt disaster where investors are bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all fossil fuels will be replaced with " green energy " ? Are electric vehicles ( EVs ) going to replace internal combustion ( IC ) vehicles ( petrol and diesel ) ? Will South Africa shut down all its refineries and rely on imported finished fuels ? What is more important : to have a car with no harmful emissions or to have a car that can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph in under 3 seconds ? Do you want your car to save the planet or to beat everybody from the traffic lights ? <p> Last month , when BHP made a bid to buy the non-South African assets of Anglo , there were some similar questions . Was this because BHP thought any investment in South Africa would fail , or because it so happened that South African assets were not part of its " strategic vision " ( or whatever is the correct jargon ) ? Strangely enough , in 2015 , when BHP itself quit South Africa , it also hived off its local assets , which then formed S32 . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notably in platinum , are still highly strategic -- but that will be discussed with EVs below . <p> Shell has cited problems with its BEE partner , Thebe Investment Corporation , which owns 28% of its South African branch . ( Thebe has close ties with the ANC . ) BEE is , of course , just a form of legalised corruption . When you want to do business in most African countries , you have to give a big bribe to the relevant ruling politician . That 's just part of the cost of doing business in Africa . When you want to do business in South Africa , you have to buy a BEE partner . You do n't expect anything of them except to take your money and complain that they want more . Is this high cost worth it for international companies ? More and more say " no " . President Ramaphosa says , ' BEE is here to stay ' . In that case , overseas investment is there to stay away . <p> Both the Shell departure and the BHP bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning EVs . The future for Shell and the other big oil companies is limited , say some silly people , because in future all cars and trucks will be electric . The future of platinum is limited , say other silly people ( often the same silly people ) because platinum 's biggest market is for catalytic converters in the exhaust pipes of IC vehicles and soon they will all be phased out in favour of EVs . ( The catalytic converters complete the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide , turning them into harmless water and CO2 , and break down dangerous nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) into nitrogen and oxygen . They can not reduce sulphur oxides ( SOx ) , which damage the converters . ) In the mass media and from all the politicians we hear that electric cars will save the environment , are outselling all others , and that by some date all IC vehicles will be banned . It 's nonsense . <p> The reality is that electric cars are very expensive , very heavy and very inconvenient ; they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to burst into flames . In Greater London in the 2017-2022 period , there were a reported 507 battery fires from a number of EV types ; there were 219 such fires in 2022-23 alone . The electric motors are fine , but the batteries are not ; they are made of extremely toxic materials , do n't last very long and are very expensive to replace . Electric cars seem worse for the environment than IC cars . Governments have tried to seduce or coerce customers into buying EVs with tax-breaks , subsidies and mandates , but customers are losing interest . <p> Sales of EVs are falling , resale values are dropping , and complaints are rising . Thanks partly to Elon Musk 's manufacturing genius and slick salesmanship , the rich elite were persuaded that EVs represented high fashion and environmental virtue at the same time . So they bought them for second or third vehicles in their Beverley Hills mansions . But that market now seems saturated . Ordinary people are not interested . I see a very limited future market for EVs , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IC vehicles and hybrids are here to stay , and so we shall need lots more oil and lots more platinum . The ANC 's dithering about policy to encourage EV production here was a good thing , although more by default than design . <p> Of course , the backdrop to all this discussion is the anti-science nonsense of dangerous manmade climate change caused by rising CO2 . It 's true we have caused CO2 to rise by burning oil , coal and gas . But it 's the best thing we have ever done for the planet , with little or no effect on the climate and a wonderful effect on plants . How long will the nonsense prevail ? I do n't know . There is an enormously powerful vested interest , ideological and financial , demanding we must reduce CO2 to save the planet . It is pure baloney but so was witch-burning in the 17th Century and that did awful harm . <p> Shell wants to get rid of its " downstream operations " in South Africa , meaning its retail operations , meaning its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations " mean extracting the raw materials , which means drilling for oil and gas . Although there are potentially big gas fields in South Africa , onshore and offshore , Shell has been stopped from exploration for bogus environmental reasons . To convert the raw material , crude oil , into a finished product requires oil refineries . South Africa had six , but none seem to be operating now . The refinery takes the crude and separates out its constituents , using distillation and other processes . Each constituent has a different boiling point , and so each boils or condenses at a different temperature . The lowest boiling point is for liquid petroleum gas ( LPG ) , a mixture of propane and butane . This is a wonderful fuel , very convenient to handle since it liquifies at low pressure . Then come petrol , paraffin , diesel , heavy fuel oil ( HFO ) and finally waxes , asphalt and lubricating oil . Our refineries did this separation in the past but now do n't . This is just another step in our deindustrialisation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to our raw materials -- or in this case imported raw materials . <p> The reasons for the demise of our refineries are complicated and contradictory . International pressure , especially from Europe , required our refineries to improve the quality of our fuels to very high standards -- to unreasonably high standards . Their sulphur content had to be very low . ( It so happens that Sasol produces diesel with no sulphur at all , the purest in the world . ) The octane rating of our petrol had to be very high . This was absurd . In a petrol engine , the higher the compression ratio , the more efficient the engine . But if the compression is too high , you get pinking in the combustion chamber , which can do very serious damage to valves , pistons and cylinders . Petrol engines use spark ignition , where a spark produces a single flame that spreads through the whole cylinder , greatly raising temperature and pressure to drive the piston down . If the compression ratio is too high , you get pockets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ruin your engine . <p> In the past , lead was added to petrol to raise its octane rating , meaning its resistance to pinking . High octane does not raise the energy in the fuel , it just raises the pressure at which pinking occurs . But lead was found to be polluting , so it was removed and replaced with chemicals such as MMT . For old cars , with cast iron cylinder heads , the lead served as a lubricant to protect the valves , and so they can not have completely lead-free petrol . But all cars after 1995 have aluminium heads with hardened steel valve seats , and do n't need lead . ( Diesel engines use pressure ignition , which means a multitude of little fires throughout the cylinder . In a sense , diesel engines pink all the time but for some reason I do n't understand are never damaged by it . They can have very high compression ratios . ) <p> Our refineries were required to be upgraded to make fuels with very low sulphur and very high octane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow and vague . Moreover , it was silly . The only reason for having very high-octane petrol is to produce short bursts of very high power , such as when you are racing away when the lights turn green . ( It was probably the motorcar manufacturers who asked for it . ) Otherwise , existing octane levels were just fine . So the refineries were not upgraded . In fact , they were shut down . Shell would have been part of this dismal experience . <p> On the one hand , the motor industry must cater to environmentalists , on the other to boy racers . The car manufacturer must be mindful of our fragile planet , but it must also be mindful of the need for men to own cars faster than anything else on the road and to be able to attract the prettiest girls . ( British motorbike magazines refer the latter ability as pulling power . ) Otherwise the car wo n't sell to rich young men . In the editorial sections of our newspapers , you read solemn arguments for environmentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motoring sections you read about staggeringly expensive cars , with massively powerful engines , that are as fast as Superman . <p> In Business Day of 9 May 2024 , Peter Bruce has a column in the op-ed pages entitled , ' Any more obfuscation and we 'll never know why Shell left ' . In the motor section , there is an article entitled , ' New Ferrari 12Cilindri has roaring V12 and 340km/h ability ' . This car has only two seats but 12 cylinders and an engine capacity of 6,500cc . It produces 610kW and 678Nm . It can go faster than 340km/h and can ' blitz the 0 -- 100km/h in just 2.9 seconds ' . It costs R8.65 million . Business Day finds it adorable . <p> I must boast about my own car . It is a 1984 Suzuki SJ410 : 4 cylinder , 970 cc engine ; 35 kW , 0 -- 100 kph in about two minutes , if it gets there at all ( not if the wind is blowing against it ) .

No doubt when President Ramaphosa said that ' BEE is here to stay ' , he would have been proud to point to Thebe Investment Corporation and to Edwin Sodi . You can imagine Ramaphosa 's big , charming smile as he proclaimed , " BEE works : just look at Edwin Sodi 's Ferraris ! " <p> Whenever a big international company declares , " We have every confidence in South Africa " , you can be pretty sure that they are just about to get out .

They all hate the West and support any country , such as Iran , Cuba or Russia , that attacks it , they all condemn white monopoly capital , they all hate business , they all believe in compulsory BEE , which deters investors , they all support nationalisation and expropriation without compensation . They all love capitalist products such as BMW , Mercedes and Ferrari but hate capitalism itself . General Motors departed , BHP departed , Shell is departing and I feel all the big oil majors will follow suit . International mining investment in South Africa is shrinking towards nothing .

If it had served the ANC to create an advert pouring scorn on the DA by burning the flag , it would surely have used it . <p> Clearly the problem is that it ca n't , because it ca n't accuse anyone else of burning the country to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not strictly my cup of tea : I probably would have gone with advertising that aimed at the ' positive ' , for those who desperately need an alternative to what the ANC and its tripartite alliance have offered in the past 15 years . <p> Anyway , maybe there is some distinct marketing sense in such ' inflammatory ' ( pun intended ) advertising , and presumably it will resonate with its target market . <p> But its brilliance lies in its ability to - again , pun intended - fan the flames of pomposity with which the DA 's critics express their disgust . <p> The DA could n't have asked for better exposure - the opinion-makers rose to the bait . <p> Zizi Kodwa , the Minister of Sport , Arts and Culture ( the ministry to which political careers are sent to die ) is considering taking ' further steps ... against the abhorrent and unpatriotic political advertisement by the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , which shows the burning of the South African flag ' . <p> It should n't be necessary , Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here goes . <p> First , ' abhorrent ' is an opinion , not a basis for action . You 're absolutely entitled to feel the burning of our flag to be an abhorrent act . However , burning a curated image to make a point is not the same as burning the an actual flag . <p> Even if it was , which it was n't , if anyone wants to burn a flag , their freedom of expression must allow it . After all , it is a symbol , and a potent one at that , of dissatisfaction with the ANC 's governance . It 's not unlike the burning of , say , the Israeli or American flags , which currently is often meant to communicate a desire to destroy actual countries or citizens . <p> Second , in his press release , the Minister said : ' The desecration of national symbols should not be part of election campaigning and should not be tolerated in any instance . We are taking steps to ensure that there are consequences for such actions . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are a product of our hard-earned democracy ' . <p> Seeing this coming from the minister of the party that has single-handedly ruined the economy of this country and the prospects for its people , I am shocked ! <p> But Kodwa ca n't resist virtue signalling , in misperceiving a curated version of a symbol , which rises from the ashes ( so to speak ) at the end of the advert to signal that the DA can reverse the rot . Hyperventilating over the symbolism hides the reality that what the advert represents is the hard truth that we face in this election . <p> Third , the ' desecration ' of symbols is n't actually true -- the flag was n't literally desecrated . But the reference to ' desecration ' is an example of the socialist desire to replace symbols of religion with symbols of the revolution . Flags are identifiers ; they are symbols to coalesce around but , conversely , they are symbols representing government and as such , ' desecration ' is also an expression of anger . <p> Finally , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel ' and ' patriotism is the virtue of the vicious ' , respectively . <p> Symbols can be the embodiment of all that a country represents , good and bad . I remember the pride I felt at international airports seeing our flag on South African Airways ( SAA ) planes in the early 2000s . <p> However , after SAA had been ruined by former President Jacob Zuma 's appointment of his sociopathic ex-lover Dudu Myeni , and Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan had trashed the SAA flag by insisting on repeatedly bailing it out of ANC ruin using our hard-earned taxes , the flag was well and truly soiled . <p> Gordhan archaically views our national carrier in the way once described by someone as ' an embassy with wings , transporting culture , cuisine , commerce and goodwill around the world ' . <p> Stuff and nonsense ! National airlines are not a necessity nor is it the government 's duty to run them . Given the reputation of much of our diplomatic corps , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personally , I find the sight of the national flag on SAA planes today evokes a sense of severe embarrassment and sadness arising from Gordhan 's persistence in eating public money to advance socialist symbolism . <p> In 2020 there were 61 state-owned airlines and this list of worthies included India , Romania , Zimbabwe , and Pakistan , most of which were deeply indebted . <p> Of a list of 150 flag-carrying airlines , the following privatised or minority government-owned airlines are still identified with their country - Air Canada , Qantas , Lufthansa , British Airways , Air France , Aer Lingus , El Al , Aerom ? xico , Japan Airlines , Korean Airlines , China Air ( Taiwan ) , Austrian Airlines and Biman Bangladesh Airlines . <p> No one would be able to tell what their ownership status was , other than by the fact that they are still flying . Presumably branding played a part in their retaining that identity when they were privatised : this would surely do so for SAA , which was established in 1934 and was once regarded as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reason so many countries cling to their flag carriers is that they regard them as part of their national infrastructure and identity ; they consider them a necessary point of pride , and use their control of the industry to their advantage . <p> But let 's be honest . In 2024 , airlines are just airborne bus companies . And bus companies are not regarded as infrastructure . <p> Pride in a flag is associated with success . No one , to my knowledge , burnt the South African flag when South Africa won the 2023 World Cup - not even Les Bleus , the British , or the All Blacks .

South Africa , vast and diverse , can not thrive under the ANC 's outdated ideologies and corrupt practices . It 's time to embrace home rule , empowering local leaders to govern effectively . From municipalities to provinces , decentralization fosters accountability , efficiency , and stability .

No matter how much its state-monopolies plunge the country into darkness , or how the national South African Police Service ( SAPS ) fails to address local gangsterism , the ANC insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . <p> But South Africa is far too large and unwieldy go be governed from the top-down . Especially by a party that has a track record of endemic corruption and incompetence . Not to mention an obsession with outdated and morally bankrupt ideology in the form of Soviet-style communism and Marxism so impractical that Lenin himself would have squinted at it dubiously . <p> This country needs to be embrace home rule . That is , allowing local areas to be governed effectively by local leaders and governments . This exists in limited amounts today , with municipalities having separate elections to the national government . But there is no true municipal autonomy . Municipalities are still beholden to party loyalties , cadre deployment , and receiving bailouts and funding from the national government . <p> Provinces have an even shorter end of the stick . While provinces could serve as substantive and constructive governments for their localities , they functionally exist as figureheads -- having to beg the national government for the smallest concessions . <p> This all serves only to erode the energy and passion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their lives . <p> The closer to home a government or leader is , the more they can cater to the needs of that particular area . Rather than fall in line with stringent and nonsensical national policies , uniform across the country , local government should be allowed to determine their own legislation , while governing their own affairs -- with a focus on their area . Because the people doing the job also benefit from it , there is more of an incentive to succeed . <p> Local governments also benefit from having to serve fewer people . This means less strain on material and mental resources . Being able to focus on a finite area and population leads to efficiency . <p> Being from the area also encourages local government officials to cultivate a personal relationship with their constituents . These are their neighbours and friends . Not just suckers to extract tax revenue from . They have skin in the game . And this ensures accountability . Far more than any sort of accountability we can expect from the individuals in the Union Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of centralisation in general , is that it lowers the stakes of politics . There is far less money trapped in a single municipality or even province than there is in a centralised , national treasury . Not to mention the power one gains as the central government of the entirety of the country . <p> In a federal system , with home rule , there is very little power being held in any single office . That means that there is less incentive for the corrupt and power hungry to vie for positions . Without the incentive to seize absolute authority , political stability also rises , as the incentive to commit violence to achieve ultimate political power is mitigated . <p> Federalism is what South Africa needs . And it starts at home . The ANC deplores federalism and will not support it . But that does n't mean we ca n't embrace it already . The constitution already stipulates that South Africa is functionally a federal system . The ANC has just refused to acknowledge this . <p> Local leaders , councillors , municipalities and even provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is a problem in a local area , the national government does n't care . Fix it . Do n't wait for Pretoria to come flying in to help ( unless you live in Pretoria , that is ) . Local businesses , communities and politicians need to work together , excluding national government as much as possible . Only then will we see progress . <p> We may not have formal federalism until a new government , or the ANC miraculously grows some sense , but we can solve many of our issues on the ground if we stop apathetically accepting centralised control , roll up our sleeves , and embrace home rule in a practical sense .

Amidst scandals and internal strife , opportunistic politicians are flocking to the opposition , sensing victory on the horizon .

The defections are a strong indicator that , after 14 years , the era of Tory hegemony is at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tory press rage against the traitors , but their barbs hardly sting . Many Conservatives are honest opportunists -- they joined the party of the establishment that 's run the country for two-thirds of the past century to get on in the world -- whereas Labour MPs have enjoyed the consolations of ideological purity mostly in opposition . <p> Less-dogmatic politicians , a generic type common to most democracies , find it less of an emotional wrench to switch sides , especially when backing a clear winner . Many companies , and the public relations outfits that facilitate their access to power , arrived at the same conclusion long ago -- it 's time to suck up to Labour . <p> In the 1990s , as Tony Blair 's rebranded " New Labour " advanced on No. 10 , John Major 's Conservative government was battered by sex and financial scandals , accompanied by high-level defections as the party 's former communications supremo and a minister jumped ship . Both men served happily under Blair and his successor Gordon Brown . Meanwhile , trouser-dropping Tories became a staple of TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as grubby but the deserters are less elevated . <p> The most recent defector to Labour , Natalie Elphicke , held political views that were -- until Wednesday at least -- so right-wing that several members of Labour 's shadow cabinet team have briefed journalists off-the-record about their personal distaste at their party 's embrace of her . Former party leader Neil Kinnock spoke for his anonymous brethren when he said that Labour is " a very broad church but churches have walls and there are limits . " <p> Labour 's high command calculates that the voters will only notice that another Tory MP has washed her hands of her bickering party , not her curious pedigree . Besides , quantity matters as much as quality -- Labour promises more defections to come . Keir Starmer , once dubbed " Sir Softie " by Elphicke for his stance on immigration , can weather a little turbulence in the ranks . The latest YouGov poll for the Times newspaper puts Labour a whopping 30 points ahead of the Conservatives -- the party 's largest lead since Prime Minister Rishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office amid market chaos 18 months ago . <p> The prime minister 's misery , meantime , has no end . Ben Houchen , the only Tory mayor to have survived last week 's cull in the local elections , unhelpfully told the BBC on Thursday that his party " are fighting each other like rats in the sack , " although the responsibility " ultimately lies with Rishi . " The PM deserves better than this from his party -- Sunak has brought back a modicum of stability and decorum to government after the chaos under Boris Johnson and then Truss . Figures released Friday showed that the UK economy grew a respectable 0.6% in the first quarter , while consumer confidence has recovered and inflation has slowed sufficiently for the Bank of England to be contemplating a rate cut as early as next month . <p> The most significant Tory defectors to Labour are n't sitting in Parliament . A clutch of former Conservative MPs who were kicked out of the party for fighting a guerrilla war against Brexit after losing the referendum on European Union membership are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the establishment . <p> Nick Boles , a former minister who helped craft David Cameron 's modernizing message when he led the Tories back to power in 2010 , is now advising shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves . Anna Soubry , another Cameron minister who also lost the party whip over Brexit , is backing Labour , as is Claire Perry O'Neill , who endorses Starmer 's " fact-driven , competent political leadership . " Cameron 's pollster , Andrew Cooper , who wrongly predicted the day before the referendum that the Remain campaign would win by more than 10 points , has joined them . Perhaps he 's called it correctly this time <p> George Osborne , Cameron 's former chancellor , is by no means a defector but still knows which way the wind is blowing . He 's anointed Reeves as the " heir to Cameron-Osborne " , just as Cameron-Osborne once claimed to be heirs to Blair . Reeves has accepted innovations championed by Osborne , including austere fiscal rules , oversight of fiscal policy the Office of Budget Responsibility and lower levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tory Party 's right wingers , as he doubtless intended . Their leading lights already argue that their prime minister has been feeble on immigration , lowering taxes and standing up to interfering European judges . The Tory house magazine , the Spectator , denounces " Starmakism , " a blend of policies adopted by both Sunak and Starmer . <p> By switching sides , opportunistic politicians are wholly in tune with the voters . Fifty years ago , around an eighth of British voters switched parties between elections . According to Edward Fieldhouse , a political scientist at Manchester University , the majority of the electorate were swing voters at the last election ; in 2019 , Labour had its worst result since 1935 . Later this year the pendulum may swing just as violently away from the Tories .

@@108522230 <p> Makhanda residents ' right to a clean environment , clean water , health , and economic development have been trashed by sewerage infrastructure failure . ActionSA chairperson Michael Beaumont , who made a stop in the town during the party 's recent ' Shitty Tour ' of broken infrastructure across South Africa , said failures across the provinces were depriving citizens of their constitutional freedoms . He described the combination of road , water reticulation and sewerage degradation as a " trifecta of infrastructure failure " . <p> Beaumont was accompanied by ActionSA provincial chairperson Athol Trollip , and local ActionSA activists as they visited some of the town 's most foul sewage leaks . <p> First up was the junction of Currie , Irving and Albany roads where resident Richard Alexander showed them a long-running sewage spill that had combined with a freshwater leak . The two have combined to form a more or less permanent pool below Mary Waters Secondary School , destroying the road in the process . <p> En route to the hellish spot , the group experienced Ghost Town 's roads , which Trollip described as " completely impassable " . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Trollip explained to Beaumont . " This has been going on in Makhanda for years and years and years : the systematic degradation of road , sewerage and water infrastructure . <p> " That leak coming out below Mary Waters Secondary School has been there for years but the Department of Education , the Department of Public Works , the municipality -- nobody gives a continental damn . " <p> Earlier this month , it was reported that this flows all the way down Albany Road and into a concrete drain , diverted down to the boundary of the Oval sports field at Blackbeard Street . " At night , when the water supply is turned off and the pressure subsides , sewage from Albany road flows directly into the broken pipe and hence into Makana 's water system , " Makana councillor Geoff Embling reported to Ward 4 residents on May 8 . Rhodes University Water Testing Laboratory had found high levels of e.coli in water samples from Blackbeard Street the previous week . <p> Via the other long-running sewage leak under the bridge near Kuyasa Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dr Jacob Zuma Drive ( Raglan Road ) bridge crossing the Matyana River . <p> " What we 've got here is a perfect storm , " Trollip said . " Over there is the old sewerage system that is overflowing and pouring into the river . Right next to it the stream itself you 've got a river of raw sewage . And here right-hand-side of the stream is the new pipeline that has been built to take sewage from Hooggenoeg into the waste water treatment plant . But it 's not working . " <p> Approaching the Kuyasa bridge earlier , the tour had driven past a large sewerage maintenance hole . The missing cover meant it was possible to see that no sewage was running through it . <p> " This can be fixed , " Trollip said . " You can understand why Makhanda residents have had e.coli in their drinking water , because this sewage infiltrates everywhere . " <p> Trollip also holds the party 's portfolio on land and agriculture . <p> " Not only does it infiltrate people 's drinking water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a major tourism destination . There 's also a lot of important export agriculture that takes place along this river . <p> " What 's happening here in Makhanda in this Matyana River is a complete disgrace and it can be fixed .

Every official in this municipality gets a salary at the end of the month . The politicians and administration of Makana have failed the residents of this town and this municipality dismally . That is why it is so important to vote for political change , " Trollip said . <p> Describing South Africa 's municipalities as broken , Beaumont added that the sewerage infrastructure failure that they were seeing in many provinces on their tour was a fundamental municipal function that was n't being delivered . <p> " Having municipalities like Makana under administration for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Beaumont said . " It 's the soft kind of administration that allows councillors to continue to exist and be remunerated . " <p> Beaumont said a dysfunctional municipality could not be turned around under administration unless the resources are allocated for that turnaround to happen . <p> He said another problem was the " buddy-buddy relationship between a provincial government and a municipality led by the same party . " Because actually it 's all about the internal harmony of the ANC , not about the residents of this municipality . We need a new provincial government that kicks the butt of the people who are governing this municipality . <p> " Everywhere we go , we 've seen these sorts of sewage infrastructure failures , and we must call them what they are : a deprivation of the constitutional freedoms of South Africans , " Beaumont said .

Mayor of the DA 's flagship municipality Chris Pappas addressed 100-odd Makhanda residents in the Albany Bowling Club on Thursday May 9 , explaining the nuts and bolts of turning around a municipality from being severely dysfunctional to a star act . <p> " It is possible to take something broken and change it , " was Pappas 's message of hope to an audience weary of worsening road infrastructure , widespread sewage spills , financial distress and a water crisis now approaching a decade in duration . <p> The processes Pappas spoke about could in theory be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn around the declining state of any small town in South Africa . <p> But with the national and provincial elections less than three weeks away the DA is n't bringing out its rock-star mayor for nothing . Pappas emphasised the party 's key election message : " The harsh reality is that if you want to make things different in your town , you have to change the government . " <p> Pappas explained to the audience why the DA 's victory in Umngeni was momentous and how it was achieved . <p> The party successively gained ground each local government election cycle and in 2021 won by a slim margin of 43 votes -- a point he used to stress the importance of every individual making sure that they vote . He said that within two years , the DA-led municipality had turned around . <p> " Within seven months of taking over the government we had our first unqualified audit in many years , " Pappas said . He also said that 12 months after the party moved into the hot seat , the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 , including 200 kw.h of free basic electricity . <p> Equipment to maintain and service the town 's infrastructure had been bought , to the tune of R33 million , including R7m-worth of machinery required to effectively manage the town 's landfill . Like Makhanda , Howick and Mphophomeni had suffered the detrimentasl effects of poor management of that facility for many years . <p> Alongside getting the basics of service delivery right , Pappas said , was tackling the roots of corruption within the administration . <p> Instead of calling it a " hit list " ( actual hits are a terrifyingly frequent reality in KwaZulu-Natal politics ) Pappas dubbed it the " You 're not invited to Christmas " list . <p> Cadre deployment had to be tackled before any real changes could be made to the way a municipality is run . <p> " You start with the HR department , " he said . Then supply chain management . Once you tackle those two key departments , you can begin to break down those entrenched systems of patronage . <p> Using the term ethical compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pappas described how the Umngeni turnaround had systematically focused , in turn , on compromised departments and processes . <p> " The evidence of illegal activities is everywhere if you are on the inside , " Pappas said . " Follow the numbers , because numbers do n't lie . Be robust , but without breaking the government . " <p> The first requirement was a strong civil service that is independent of the governing party . Citing the example of the City of Cape Town , he said the reason it was so functional was because citizens respected the administration . <p> " They respect it because there is a clear separation between party and state , " he said . <p> Alongside a strong civil service and separation between the prty and the state , Pappas said , citizens ' active involvement in government at all levels was crucial . <p> " Stop just talking about what 's wrong , " he said .

Coping with disappointing grades The final high school exam is water under the bridge . Not all will have attained their desired success , that 's for sure . But there are still ample reasons to remain optimistic about the future . First , let 's discard the term " fail " from our vocabulary . Your current marks may limit your acceptance into your preferred field of study , but they do n't dictate your overall success in life . They do n't limit your career prospects . <p> It is essential to step back emotionally and to approach the experience logically . Everyone encounters both successes and setbacks and this is entirely normal . If your results fall below expectations , view this as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development , and for exhibiting resilience in rapidly changing and uncertain times . <p> In the face of disappointment , sadness , anxiety , or even depression following your exam results , dwelling on what might have been serves no purpose and offers little benefit . Instead , consider for example the fact that your parents , guardians or caretakers cherish you as precious and love you unconditionally . Foster open communication with them . Share your feelings with them through conversation or text , and actively listen when they express their thoughts . They are crucial pillars of your support structure . <p> It is crucial not to fixate on a preferred university , college or training institution . While research indicates that individuals with degrees often find employment more easily and earn higher salaries , university is not the only path to success . Non-university study holds its own value , and each study discipline and tertiary training institution should be evaluated on its merits . <p> Consider specialised diplomas and certificates , such as those in information technology ( for instance , cyber security ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine service ) . These qualifications can be personally enriching and offer diverse career opportunities , often making students highly employable . <p> Do n't hesitate to seek career counselling from a qualified psychologist ( career counsellor ) . <p> 2 . What to do if grades fall below expectations You may have secured decent grades -- but not good enough to secure admission to your preferred course of study . There are several avenues to explore . Some examination boards entertain requests for a reevaluation of exam papers , supplementary exams , or even repeating classes or specific subjects . These options call for diligence and dedication . <p> I always encourage determined learners to translate their aspirations into actions . For example , you could explore the option of pursuing your favoured field of study at training levels or institutions other than university . Consulting with a career counsellor in this regard is essential . Seek advice from individuals who have successfully navigated similar situations -- and from those who were unable to do so . <p> Consider the inspiring story of a student aspiring to study medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mathematics or physical sciences in high school . After completing high school , the student enrolled in mathematics and physical sciences at a post-school training institution , subsequently pursuing a general degree at a university . Achieving excellent results , the student gained admission to study medicine and is now a final-year medical student . This illustrates that diverse routes can lead to a successful career . <p> The significance of high school subject symbols diminishes over time . You are encouraged to reflect on your short- , medium- and long-term goals and understand the purpose of your studies . It should not primarily be about pleasing family or outperforming others . Instead , focus on becoming the best version of yourself . Competition with others serves no meaningful purpose . <p> 3 . Discovering a sense of meaning and purpose It is imperative to ensure that students cultivate a profound sense of meaning , hope and purpose in their lives . This is to say that you get a clear understanding of life 's purpose , why you are pursuing your studies , and what serves as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study that supports financial stability is crucial , you should also consult a professional , such as a career psychologist , to uncover and enact your central life theme(s) . This helps you identify what you genuinely wish to achieve in life ( for instance , helping others that have been bullied ) , beyond the numerical goals you aim to attain . Furthermore , you need to be instilled with the belief that you possess the capacity to reach these goals and bring your dreams to fruition . <p> 4 . Identify your key life themes Once you have identified your key themes , you gain the ability to articulate your career-life purpose , addressing existential questions such as " Why do I live ? " " Where am I headed ? " " Why am I on this planet ? " and " Is life worth living ? " <p> For example , one female high school graduate said to me : <p> I lost my father due to cancer , and I love helping people with cancer . More than that , I want to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This evolves into a vision statement , revealing the social significance of her work . <p> Another shared her story , stating , <p> I fell pregnant before completing high school and was compelled to give my child up for adoption . I subsequently studied social work . Today , I use my profound understanding of the challenges faced by young girls who become pregnant while still in school to help them navigate their pain and trauma . <p> A common thread weaving through these real-life stories is the transformative power of turning personal pain , hurt or " suffering " into triumph and social contributions . In essence , it is about converting passive suffering into active mastery . The eminent Swiss psychologist Carl Jung once said : <p> Be grateful for your difficulties and challenges , for they hold blessings . In fact ... ( Humans ) need difficulties ; they are necessary for health , personal growth , individuation , and self-actualisation . <p> By assisting others who have overcome challenges similar to their own , individuals actively confront the pain they themselves have experienced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town is the weekly newspaper of record for the community of Ndlambe and serves readers in and around Port Alfred , Kenton on Sea , Bushman 's River Mouth , Alexandria , Kleinemond , and Makhanda.

Yet , a glaring imbalance persists : while strides are made in the EU and US , the Global South remains largely excluded .

South Africa is a case in point . A powerful " big data " analysis was recently published about online attacks on women journalists there , raising the alarm about escalation around -- and after -- the election on 29 May . <p> A number of groups working with data are attempting to monitor hate speech and disinformation on social media ahead of South Africa 's national and provincial polls .

They were all monitoring text on social platforms . Some were monitoring audio , while a few were looking at " synthetic content " such as material produced with generative AI . <p> About half of ten initiatives were tracking followers , impressions and engagement . Nearly all were checking content on Twitter ; at least four were monitoring Facebook ; three covered YouTube ; and two included TikTok . <p> WhatsApp was getting scant attention .

It provides a far greater number of options than has been reflected in most analyses published to date . <p> To help navigate that complexity , the IRR has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In all elections since 1994 , it has never been in doubt that the ANC would win a majority of the votes . Thus , it was certain that South Africa would have an ANC government and that its policies and actions would shape South Africa 's outcomes .

With less than a week to go until the elections , a daily tracking poll from the Social Research Foundation ( SRF ) shows support for the ANC at below 50% and trending down . A below-50 result accords with surveys conducted by other polling companies in prior weeks and months . But even so , a majority is still within reach for the party . With a small increase in support in the final days , a bit of help from the margin of error in the polling , and low voter turnout , it could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should the South African public expect ? In anticipation of the elections we explore 12 key election scenarios . These scenarios are plotted on a matrix that considers the volatility and disruption of the outcomes on South Africa 's policy and business environments . <h> Scenarios <p> Scenarios placed on the left-hand side of the matrix will result in policy continuity or business as usual . Scenarios placed towards the right-hand side will result in high impact or disruption : reforms , changes of direction , or a radical intensification of existing policies that changes the status quo . <p> On the vertical axis , scenarios placed at the bottom reflect stable governments that last a full five-year term . Scenarios placed towards the top indicate volatility and a higher likelihood that a government will not last a full five-year term , for instance because a coalition collapses , a vote of no confidence is called or parliament votes to dissolve itself , triggering an early election . <p> Scenarios are represented by circles , where the size of each circle reflects the probability of the scenario , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order of probability , from most to least likely . <h> Scenario 1 : ANC + small others <p> In this scenario , the ANC garners between 45% and 49% of the vote and forms a coalition with one or more smaller parties such as the Patriotic Alliance , GOOD ( the leader of which , Patricia de Lille , has already been serving in the ANC government , making it likely option ) , Al Jama-ah , Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) , or others . <p> This arrangement would bring relative stability and largely business as usual in terms of policy , as smaller parties are relatively easy to accommodate and are unlikely to force the ANC to alter its policy direction significantly . Policy differences between the ANC and these smaller parties are generally not great . This scenario is therefore likely to have minimal impact on markets and the currency , ensuring business as usual . Economically , there is likely to be very little change , with supply chain issues persisting , growth hovering around 1% to 1.5% , and minor volatility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " government of national unity " ) <p> Here , the ANC drops significantly below 50% . Rather than picking a partner from a range of unpalatable coalition options , it extends a broad invitation to political opposition parties in general to join it in salvaging the country . The GNU agreement would allow power-sharing and would keep the GNU parties tied up in committees and talks . While likely reducing the efficiency of the state , this arrangement would prolong the ANC 's involvement in governance over several years , buying it time . This scenario is marked by medium volatility and policy continuity , with some policy shifts possible as different parties bring their influence to bear . <h> Scenario 3 : ANC-DA ( " grand coalition " ) <p> In this scenario , the ANC wins less than 45% of the vote and decides to strike a deal with the DA , which has been the biggest opposition party for 25 years . There would be significant pressure on the ANC and DA to collaborate , especially from the business sector . Such a coalition holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour and procurement policies , property rights , law enforcement and anti-corruption measures , and international relations . Given the ideological differences between the two parties , a highly volatile political environment should be expected . There is a slight potential for higher economic growth , but it would likely not be sufficient to reduce unemployment meaningfully and this coalition might not last a full five years . <h> Scenario 4 : ANC minority government <p> In this scenario , the National Assembly would elect an ANC MP as president , with some opposition MPs voting with ANC MPs to do so . The president would then , as is his prerogative , form a government by bringing ANC MPs into the cabinet . This ANC minority government would have to seek support from smaller parties to pass budgets and legislation . Such a scenario is likely to lead to moderate volatility and mostly business-as-usual policies . However , the process of making laws would become fraught with delays and uncertain outcomes , and the government would have little protection against votes of no confidence . The stability of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where an opposition party such as the DA would agree not to support votes of no confidence in the president , as well as undertaking to supply the votes necessary to pass budgets . <h> Scenario 5 : ANC-MK <p> An alliance between the ANC and MK would generate significant internal tensions and policy uncertainty as the former president , Jacob Zuma , would be keen to assert his influence within the ANC . There would likely be minimal policy impact as the parties have considerable common ground on the policy front . However , a fierce battle for resources , positions , and patronage is likely to emerge , leading to high volatility and conflict . <h> Scenario 6 : ANC-EFF <p> In a scenario where the ANC secures around 40%-45% of the vote it could choose to turn to the EFF for a coalition to secure a majority in the NA . However , the EFF would demand a high price for its contribution , including key leadership positions in the new government . EFF leader Julius Malema has already indicated that he would insist on Floyd Shivambu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high for the ANC to consider . <p> In an ANC-EFF alliance , the EFF would command some cabinet positions and likely push the ANC further left on the political spectrum by prioritising policies like make-work schemes at state-owned enterprises , the expropriation of land , and the nationalisation of banks and industries . Increased fiscal strain , particularly because of increased government expenditure , would accompany the shift to the left . High political volatility would result in major disruptions to business and an overall more adversarial relationship with private enterprises . It would discourage private investment , weaken the rand , and feed higher inflation . <h> Scenario 7 : ANC 50+ <p> Here , the ANC secures over 50% of the vote and forms a majority government . In this scenario , another five-year term for the ANC would mean a continuation of poor service delivery , low economic growth , and feeble increases in employment . However , it would produce great policy continuity and government stability -- essentially maintaining the status quo . The ANC would continue pursuing its policy agenda without needing coalition partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Scenario 8 : ANC + MPC <p> This scenario involves the ANC forming a coalition with the Multi-Party Charter ( MPC ) , an alliance of opposition parties . The probability that the parties involved in the MPC could come to a joint agreement to partner with the ANC is highly unlikely . However , should such a coalition take government , high levels of political volatility should be anticipated as the points of difference between the ANC and the MPC parties are considerable . <h> Scenario 9 : ANC + EFF + MK <p> Another low-probability scenario involves a coalition between the ANC , the EFF , and MK . An ANC-EFF-MK coalition would create a highly unpredictable and contentious political environment , with potential for major disruptions and challenges in both government and business operation . The ANC would have to make many concessions to bring its two disruptive partners on board . The relationship would be fraught with tensions and unlikely to last a full term . <h> Scenario 10 : DA minority government <p> It is unlikely but not inconceivable that the DA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in government . During voting in the National Assembly , disruptors such as the EFF and MK could decide to put their support behind the DA 's candidate for president to spite the ANC and discomfit the DA . Once elected , the DA president would then form a government by appointing members of parliament to the cabinet -- conceivably all DA members . But passing legislation and budgets would require building a majority each time , and the government would be at constant risk of being ousted through a vote of no confidence . Such a scenario would result in high volatility and little policy change because the government would not last long enough to make its mark . <h> Scenario 11 : MPC + MK <p> Another highly unlikely scenario entails the MPC assembling a majority with MK to form a government . The numbers for this are just barely conceivable -- the scenario would require the MPC to get over 35% of the vote and MK , over 15% . Such a coalition government would introduce enormous volatility because aligning the MPC parties with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as MK into the mix . The distaste among the MPC members for former President Zuma may also be too great to make this an option . <h> Scenario 12 : MPC government <p> The prospect that the MPC members would obtain a sufficient share of the vote to form a government outright -- the basis of the MPC pact -- must be considered fanciful at this stage . <h> Conclusion <p> As has been the case on local level , South Africa is entering an era of both provincial and national coalitions , likely characterised by volatile politics and the possibility of governments not serving full terms . The political class is increasingly preoccupied with its internal dynamics , leaving more space for non-state actors to play an increasingly important role . <p> As the bargaining power of the state diminishes , businesses and civil society will likely become the primary anchors of stability . This shift will lead to involuntary decentralisation , with local and provincial politics gaining greater importance .

To minimise their risk , landlords can put proactive measures in place to ensure a more stable and predictable rental income . <p> According to Adrian Goslett , Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa , proactive management , clear communication , and fostering good tenant relationships are key to minimizing financial risks and maintaining a successful rental property business . " This is why it is so crucial to involve a reliable rental agent who can help you manage your tenant relationships well , " he notes . <p> To help landlords avoid some of the pain points of collecting rent on time every month , RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares some best practices to implement across your rental portfolio : <p> Regular and prompt communications <p> Send the monthly rental invoice a week or two before the payment is due .

The premise is deceptively simple but unquestionably brilliant:There 's a bomb on a bus and it 's set to go off if the bus drops below 50 miles per hour . What do you do ? What do you do ? <p> Directed by Jan de Bont and starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock , Speed marks a perfect marriage of concept , cast and execution . The proof of its success is that even though it may feel like it 's been left behind by time , action flicks today owe an undisputed debt to what the movie achieved . <h> Speed Origins : Less ' Minimum , ' More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speed sprang from a spec script by writer Graham Yost in the early ' 90s , just before he took on a short-lived staff job writing for the ABC sitcom Full House and about a decade away from creating such groundbreaking TV dramas as Boomtown and Justified . <p> It all began with a mistaken recollection of Runaway Train , a 1985 Golan-Globus joint starring Jon Voight and Eric Roberts ( featuring a story by Akira Kurosawa ! ) about ... wait for it ... a runaway train . Revisiting the film , Yost immediately realized having a bomb on there as well would have heightened the tension and made it even more intriguing story-wise . <p> Turn the train into a bus , add a terrorist plot ( as was common during that era ) , and thus was born Speed . Or , as he first titled it , Minimum Speed . ( He smartly ditched " Minimum " in subsequent drafts , along with upping to 50 his initial idea of the bus not going below 20 miles per hour after a friend 's suggestion . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upping to 50 his initial idea of the bus not going below 20 mph . <p> The action landscape of the 1990s was a very different beast than it is today . Notwithstanding the occasional Batman or Darkman , superheroes were few and far between . Star Wars was a distant memory . And CGI effects , still in their infancy , were far from the ubiquitous presence they are now . Instead , action flicks relied on pyrotechnics , one-liners and the ingenuity of artists pushing the envelope of practical effects . Ah , it 's a bygone era . <p> Yost 's spec script -- the entirety of which took place on the bomb-rigged bus -- initially landed at Paramount ( mere days after the writer had quit his Full House gig , as it happens ) . While a young music video director named Michael Bay tried desperately to get the job , the studio courted John McTiernan -- fresh off the first Jack Ryan opus , 1990 's The Hunt for Red October -- to direct . At that time , McTiernan was one of Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Die Hard in 1988 . <p> The latter 's out-of-the-blue success laid in place a sturdy template of diabolical terrorists taking over an enclosed space replete with hostages and a plucky average hero tasked with saving the day . This formula led to a whole slew of summer spectacles in a similar vein : Under Siege ( Die Hard on a naval vessel ) , Passenger 57 ( Die Hard on a passenger plane ) , Air Force One ( Die Hard on the President 's plane ) and so on . <p> Speed fits very comfortably within that formula , which certainly helps explain why McTiernan turned it down . It was too similar to Die Hard for Die Hard 's director but not too similar for Die Hard 's cinematographer , Jan de Bont , whom McTiernan recommended to Paramount and who swiftly signed on when given the offer . <p> At this point , despite a strong script and a promising new director onboard , Paramount passed on the project , failing to see how a film set entirely on a bus could work . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramount did n't . They picked up the project and swiftly gave it the green light once they had an assurance that more action sequences would be added . <h> Casting : From Bill &amp; Ted to Keanu &amp; Sandra <p> While very much indebted to the " Die Hard on a ... " template , Speed benefits from , and withstands the test of time due to , the multitude of ways it leverages that formula , leaning into its tropes when necessary but just as often subverting them when practical . <p> Foremost among those subversions was the man cast in the lead role of LAPD SWAT member Jack Traven . While Tom Cruise , Tom Hanks , Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson were all offered the plum role , it went to Keanu Reeves at de Bont 's recommendation . While his greatest claim to fame at the time was as lovable doofus Ted " Theodore " Logan in the Bill &amp; Ted franchise , he 'd played a cop previously in 1991 's Point Break , which is what won de Bont over . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reeves saw an opportunity to do something different with the tried-and-true harried cop archetype . From the closely cropped hair ( a far cry from Ted 's mop top ) to his polite demeanor , Reeves ' Traven is almost the anti-John McClane , carving a sturdy niche in this crowded subgenre . Indeed , it 's no exaggeration to say Speed would n't work the way it does if not for Reeves in the lead . <p> Meanwhile , the role of Annie Porter , erstwhile passenger-turned-driver who serves as Reeves ' love interest , went to relative newcomer Sandra Bullock after being turned down by Halle Berry ( much to her regret after the fact ) . Bullock , who had been bouncing around the industry in minor roles for years before Speed , was promptly catapulted onto the A-list following the film 's success -- a position she retains to this very day . <h> Production : Pop Quiz , Hotshot <p> From the moment he signed on , de Bont immediately saw the visual possibilities in Yost 's premise . However , both he and Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To broaden its scope , de Bont added an inciting incident in the first act : an elevator in a highrise office building rigged to explode by mad bomber Howard Payne ( Dennis Hopper ) . <p> With passengers trapped and panicking , Traven and his partner Harry Temple ( Jeff Daniels ) defuse the bomb and execute a daring rescue . The sequence remains incredibly tense and gripping even this many decades later because of how relatable the scenario is . Anyone who 's ridden in an elevator has at least once pondered the possibility of it getting stuck or plummeting down the shaft . It 's a communal fear that de Bont himself experienced while lensing Die Hard and finding himself and other crew stranded in an elevator in the Fox Plaza building ( doubling for the film 's Nakatomi Tower ) . <p> In addition to dropping us into the world of the film with a shot of adrenaline , the opening sequence introduces the buddy cop interplay betweenTraven and Temple and sets up the central antagonist , the demoralized ex-cop Payne . The story then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus , after which Yost added the third act action sequence on a subway , where Traven and Payne have their final showdown . <p> Speaking of Payne , as initially envisioned , the character would have been merely the second banana baddie , with the big twist partway through seeing Traven 's partner revealed as the chiefantagonist . Hopper 's casting scrapped this idea . An intimidating screen presence on his own , the Easy Rider and Apocalypse Now veteran did n't need to play runner-up to anyone , which in turn gave Daniels the chance to make a distinctive mark as Harry , the prototypical " doomed partner . " <p> Dennis Hopper as the demoralized ex-cop Payne . <p> With regards to the script , it 's impossible to overstate the importance of the uncredited work by Joss Whedon . The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator ( this was just after the feature film but just before the TV show ) was an in-demand script doctor for his ability to punch up dialogue and character beats , and he performed an essential service for Speed . Per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for nearly 99% of the dialogue , including the iconic " Pop quiz , hotshot , " which became a runner throughout . <p> Another important service for the film was provided by composer Mark Mancina . A student of the Hans Zimmer style of film scores , Mancina 's thematic material melds orchestral and synth sensibilities for a sound that 's uniquely evocative of this film and the era that produced it . The central motif plays over the opening credits and establishes the movie 's identity while layering in the themes that will be utilized throughout to considerable propulsive effect . <h> The Legacy of Speed <p> " A good movie is three good scenes and no bad scenes , " said legendary producer/director Howard Hawks in 1970 , and Speed exemplifies the adage . From its taut opening to its gripping finale , it draws audiences in thanks to a tightly coiled plot that never forgets to put character first . <h> A project like this rises or falls on the strength of its leading actor , and Reeves ' casting was an absolute inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is Annie . The actors ' chemistry is immediate and palpable . Of course , it 's just as important to care about the riders stuck on the bus . We want to see them survive . We 're saddened when one of them does n't . Rather than lapse into stereotypes of the country bumpkin or the overheated musclehead , they feel like real people , which makes their struggles easier to empathize with . <p> That said , a project like this rises or falls on the strength of its leading actor , and Reeves ' casting was an absolute inspiration . It 's easy to take for granted in a post-Matrix , post-John Wick world , but Reeves in the early ' 90s was the furthest thing from what came to mind with the phrase " action hero . " This is what made him so effective in the role . Eschewing rat-a-tat witticisms , Reeves instead displays determination and frustration , but ultimately empathy . He plays Traven as a man who cares deeply about saving as many people as possible . <p> When Speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed it was special . While there 's no doubt it was part of the wave of " Die Hard on a ... " movies proliferating during the decade , Speed made a mark thanks to its efficiency and originality . Coming in at just under two hours , it 's lean and tight even as it caroms from one remarkable set piece to another . Produced for a relatively meager $30 million budget , it took in more than $350 million worldwide , a remarkable return on investment . <p> Unfortunately , as is so often the case in Hollywood , rather than appreciate the success they achieved and leave it at that , Fox immediately developed a sequel . But while de Bont ( who directed the successful Twister for Warner Bros. in the interim ) was contractually obligated to return , the two stars were n't . <p> As such , Reeves begged off in favor of touring with his band Dogstar and starring in The Devil 's Advocate . Meanwhile , Bullock was lured back to headline the sequel with the promise of her passion project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It was and did pretty well upon its 1998 release . ) <p> Jason Patric stepped in for Reeves , with Willem Defoe as the new baddie . The result was 1997 's execrable Speed 2 : Cruise Control , a remarkable debacle most notable for making as many missteps as the original Speed did n't . With no involvement from Graham Yost , the sequel swapped the elevator-bus-subway trifecta for an out-of-control cruise ship , losing most of the thrills in the process . Costing an eye-popping $160 million , it barely crested that total worldwide . Thus ended any franchise dreams for Fox and Speed . <p> It 's worth noting that Speed 2 is barely a blip when considering the original 's cumulative impact . While it 's been a long time since it commanded the zeitgeist ( and de Bont sadly never quite matched what he achieved here ) , there 's no denying how effectively the movie embodied its particular moment while also transcending it . <p> The practical effects remain a marvel of engineering and execution , but what truly makes the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregrounding relatable characters and an engrossing story , even in an action blockbuster . Especially in an action blockbuster . <p> It may have taken an unlikely journey to the screen , but from concept to casting to completion , Speed is about as close to a perfect movie as possible .

Register here . <p> Watch here <p> Listen here <p> Extended transcript of the interview STEADYPAYWALL <p> Chris Steyn ( 00:01.171 ) <p> South Africa remains in the grip of post-election drama . We speak to Dr. Michael Louis of the Independent Candidates Association . Welcome , Michael . <p> Michael louis ( 00:10.476 ) <p> Thank you , Chris . It sure is a drama , is n't it ? <p> Chris Steyn ( 00:15.219 ) <p> Never ending . What are your views on the new Government of National Unity , Michael ? <p> Michael louis ( 00:22.38 ) <p> Well , Chris , I think all of us definitely from civil society point of view have been praying for this moment , you know , to see a united country , to see people joining hands . And this is not something new . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1994 . And it really was an uplifting , cohesive , reaching-out period of time . And I think there 's a lot of tests . It 's definitely not going to be easy . The leaders are going to be tested , but do n't underestimate we as civil society are going to be tested . Are we going to keep on shooting missiles or are we going to see how we can join hands and be arm bearers ? A wonderful time , I must say . <p> Chris Steyn ( 01:09.395 ) <p> What do you think the Cabinet composition will reflect , Michael ? <p> Michael louis ( 01:16.268 ) <p> Well , I think that 's going to be really a test . As you know , there 's a lot of powers given to the President to nominate his Cabinet . And we know that it 's going to be a Cabinet made up of a Government of National Unity , which is made up at the moment of the parties , the ANC , the DA , the IFP , and GOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so we definitely know that that 's what 's going to happen . <p> I think the wishes of most of all of us will be that the Inkatha Freedom Party leader will be the Vice President . But I do not believe that that 's going to happen . I believe that the President will keep Paul Mashatile as the Deputy President . And the only reason for that is he has to still show his own party that they are a credible party and that there is consistency . <p> So I think that 's what we 're gon na see tomorrow , whenever he announces his Cabinet . But I do believe we would have seen from the KwaZulu-Natal cabinet today , where there was a nomination of a Multi-Party cabinet , that there was four MPs from Inkatha , there was three from the IFP , and the DA had two , and then they , and they split it quite nicely amongst all the different parties to show a multi-party democracy . And we 're going to definitely see that in the announcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me personally is that the Minister that 's nominated and the Chairperson of the Standing Committee will not be from the same political party , that there is true legitimacy , accountability and responsibility . And so I think while we 're going to see a broad nomination in that , I think it 's going to be very interesting . <p> I think the last statement I wanted to make is that we all know that Naledi Pandor did n't actually make the list to go to Parliament . And I think he 's going to bring some , maybe two outsiders coming in . Naledi Pandor in the portfolio of International Diplomacy , which she 's well versed to that portfolio . <p> Michael louis ( 03:37.324 ) <p> And then he might just bring an outside Minister of Finance that could be very interesting . So let 's hope there 's a lot of creative thinking and we all eyes on his nomination . <p> Chris Steyn ( 03:50.291 ) <p> Now you 've described South Africa as a speedboat country , not an oil tanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political situation going forward ? <p> Michael louis ( 04:01.196 ) <p> Well , the whole issue about the speedboat and the oil tanker was that I was very privileged in the years of 1994 to 1999 to be part of Government . And I could n't believe it that in 1996 , I had the privilege as a constitutionalist to help draft the Western Cape Constitution as well as contribute to the Constitution nationally , but really very intricately involved in the Western Cape Constitution . <p> And then I was made a Minister in 1998 of Asset Management and Public Works . And there they handed over the portfolio to me and they did n't have an asset register . And I said , because how do you run a portfolio without an asset register ? And then started creatively taking over a portfolio of new innovative ideas that I learned in the private sector . And then started winning my portfolio of Development Planning , doing biosphere reserves from UNESCO . <p> And so , when you 're in a very fluid situation , like we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative . And that 's what a speedboat nation can do . Because if you were in Sweden or Norway or China , to change an electoral system or to change any portfolio is impossible . And so I still believe , I honestly still believe that the new ministers coming in could be very creative , innovative and to really look at their portfolios with enthusiasm and you know a new broom can always come really and clean quite nicely . So we 're looking forward to seeing how we as civil servants and civil activists can also stand next door to them to be created . <p> Chris Steyn ( 05:50.867 ) <p> Talking about the opposition in Parliament , former president Jacob Zuma has now joined the Progressive Caucus led by the Economic Freedom Fighters . What can we expect from them in Parliament , Michael ? <p> Michael louis ( 06:06.188 ) <p> Well , I think they 're going to play a very important role because Section 195 talks about a participatory democracy . And a participatory democracy , you must be able to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , for the last 30 years that I 've been on the playing field , I truly respect the voices of a multi-party democracy . And sometimes ... <p> You know , I remember in my years in 1994 , the individuals that taught me the most of their viewpoints were actually the Communists . And I never thought that they would actually be able to educate me . So I think this whole thing of MK and the EFF are a very important voice . I think they need to be there . Forming the Progressive Caucus , they 're now about 14% of the total capacity of our 400 members of Parliament . <p> And they 're going to bring an interesting dynamic . The only thing is that I think they need to be cautious about is always to be constructive in their criticism and not destructive . And I think that 's where sometimes I have , there 's a gray line to be a destructive force and not a construct . <p> Chris Steyn ( 07:25.299 ) <p> Former President Jacob Zuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral Court regarding the non-recording of more than nine million votes . How likely is that to succeed , Michael ? <p> Michael louis ( 07:37.388 ) <p> Yes , well , I looked at the papers and I 'm really just so disappointed in the sense is that it 's really extremely weak papers . So when we as legal people look at applications , we always look at the remedy first , you know , because what are they asking for ? Because you could say anything , but what is the remedy ? And what they 're asking for is the putting aside of the elections because they do n't believe it 's fair and free , and then also putting aside the announcement by the IEC that the elections were irregular and not fair and free . And then lastly , in terms of Section 49 , asking the President to call for a new election . And looking at their papers , I actually ca n't believe what I read because as we all know , there were 16 million people that went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if you put the 9,366,000 votes that they say are unaccounted for , it means that it 's more than 25 million individuals that went and voted , giving over a 90% electoral outcome of voter support , which is absolutely an impossibility . <p> So I also looked at the papers and I can tell the viewers now there 's no speciality reports , there 's no audits . The affidavit that is supporting this application is only by virtue of the national organiser with annexures of just stipulations of how they came to the 9,366,000 . But there 's no specialist audit reports , there 's no specialist electoral support , just a lot of speculation . <p> And so I honestly believe on all four of their accounts , for their remedy , they wo n't be a success . <p> Chris Steyn ( 09:35.699 ) <p> As a system specialist , what are your views on the current state of the Electoral Act and election results ? <p> Michael louis ( 09:44.972 ) <p> Well , when you talk about a systems specialist , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for instance , the banks have got a system in which they operate . Family businesses operate in a certain system . The elections and the election results operate in a certain system . I definitely still have the ardent belief that our electoral system is not right . And that we would have seen by virtue of the civil activists , organisations that have always shown that we do not believe the Electoral Act comes to the muster of one vote is equal to one seat . And also we 've seen from the opposition parties , they did n't vote this Electoral Act in . So we honestly believe that our Electoral Act totally needs to be revitalised , and even with the very important extra added condition that we need to get to the direct election of the President . <p> And let me say why that is important . Because we 're all going to work extremely hard to make this Government work . And the Parliament has now elected the President . And by the way , I still do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President on behalf of 26 million people . But that 's my personal view . But Parliament has now voted in their President . What happens now if the President has already got an impeachment application by the EFF on him , and he does n't hold his party in the centre , and he does n't hold . Now he does n't , he is not the President of the ANC . Now what happens to the Government of National Unity , the whole hard work that everybody 's done falls apart , because the power vests in the President to nominate his Cabinet , and the chances are that the Deputy President and the Government of National Unity , might not , I 'm not saying they will , but they might not accept the new President nominated by the ANC . So this inconsistency causes inconsistency in the economic markets , the stability of the people . And so that 's why to create that stability , I think we need to get to the direct election of the President . <p> And then the last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely want to elect our representatives directly . And that 's why we want a constituency based system where we , the political parties , because political parties are always there to stay , but where political parties and independent candidates can stand in their constituency , we know their faces , their capabilities , and we as the electorate can directly nominate our elective representatives to Parliament and not via a political party . <p> So I would say the constituency-based system , I would say direct election of the President , and then last but not least , in the 400 members of Parliament , that 300 will be divided to have directly nominated to Parliament , and only 100 which will fulfill the proportional representation criteria , which is compulsory in the Constitution . <p> Also , just regarding the election results , even although I do not believe that the MK will be successful in their application , Chris , I do believe that a vote is sacrosanct . Every vote counts . And that it is very important that the voices of the MK are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to reach out to the IEC to say to them , for the credibility of these elections and yourselves , go out and personally do an internal audit or a public audit to prove that the election results are valid because we 've done our internal audits , and I 'm just wanting to say , you might know for many years about the last five years , I 've been working with Michael Atkins , who is a well-known and respected electoral specialist . We 've been going through a lot of numbers . And even although that is not my specialty , but he 's , but we believe in total , there 's a discrepancy only of about 200,000 seats . And it could be give and take because sometimes they over-exaggerated the seats and sometimes under-exaggerated . But we honestly believe that if we do all the hard work and they do the audit , there 's not going to be a difference of a maximum of one seat . And that the elections are fair and free , but it needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not afford this new Government to have any grey marks on its legitimacy .

The DA could even push to allow itself legislative independence , being able to strike damaging policies like BEE from affecting the province . <p> Additionally , the DA needs to demand a greater share of the budget . More tax money produced in the Western Cape should be used to uplift the Western Cape .

Its complacency highlighted the disconnect between political elites and the public interest .

A shock-and-awe big bang reform programme is the only way that these can be pushed through , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless discussions , opposition , and trading by the politicians . <p> Gradualism in the name of consensus building would be fatal for reform . <p> Big bang reform would mean bundling all the required reforms together and implementing them with speed . <p> The list of reforms required to boost growth and confidence is well known , although not yet fully agreed upon by the coalition . <p> Much of our euphoria is justified , as two questions about the future have been answered for the time being . We now know that the ANC is prepared to face loss and that , for the time being at least , it will not be replaced by a radical populist government . But we still do not really know whether the ANC has the heart to take the risk of a political pushback from much of its patronage and support network . <p> Any serious reform package would include measures to boost the economy , cut government spending and red tape , end black economic empowerment , and scrap the National Health Insurance project and Expropriation Without Compensation . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors to run Eskom 's coal power station fleet , allowing the private sector a greater role in the management of ports and railways , privatisation , streamlining government with a smaller cabinet and making the state fit for purpose . Another measure would be the long-delayed easing of the visa regime , so that qualified foreigners can work in the country . <h> Fiscal deficit <p> There would also be cuts in state spending to reduce the size of our fiscal deficit and ever-growing public debt . The big bang reforms would also have to include an end to cadre deployment in the civil service , and labour policies that push the minimum wage across industries far too high to ensure rapid jobs growth . <p> It is unclear what sort of deal can be done between the ANC and the DA on the issue of Black Economic Empowerment . Would the ANC accept it being scrapped after a certain date , or wound down ? <p> The Statement of Intent between the ruling parties says that civil service appointments will be merit-based . But how will this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cadre deployment ? <p> The ANC and the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) have been actively talking up reform prospects , and this has boosted the markets . But the real test will not come with talk , but implementation . <p> The use by Fikile Mbalula , the Secretary General of the ANC , of a quote from Deng Xiaoping , the Chinese leader who engineered the country 's reform in the 1970s seemed to seal the hope of our great turning point . Deng spoke of the colour of cats ( ideology ) being irrelevant , and what mattered was whether or not they caught mice . <p> " To us , it does n't matter whether the cat is black or white . Fundamentally , the question is how do we move the country forward , " Mbalula said last week . <h> Clear dividing line <p> There is a clear dividing line now between the parties in the coalition that say they are open to reform and the newly formed Progressive Caucus of the radical Comrade parties , including the Economic Freedom Fighters and uMkhonto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GNU , President Cyril Ramaphosa has made enemies of the factions in the ANC that did not want the DA in government and are against reform . The communists objected to a coalition with the DA on the basis that the party is supported by " capitalist forces . " And the other part of the ANC 's Tripartite Alliance , the unions , objected to a deal with the DA on the grounds that it is not in workers ' interests . The Black Business Council , which represents empowerment interests in government and the private sector , charged Ramaphosa with " splitting the revolution " by doing a deal with the DA . <p> Ramaphosa must have known full well that the opponents inside the ANC and part of the Progressive Caucus in Parliament did not have the power to stop him forming a GNU with more centrist parties . Now that the President has split the revolution , he has the political space to go for reform in a big and sudden way . <p> But the ANC might still want reform to be far more gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Statement of Intent signed by members of the GNU is about shared principles and goals , and far from a commitment to a package of big bang reforms . It talks of the need for " structural and transformational change , " which the ANC is likely to view very differently from the DA . The ANC thinks structural change is about a more limited reform agenda than the DA , and views transformation as all about empowerment measures . <h> Lekgotla <p> The shape of the power-sharing arrangement between the coalition partners might not be agreed upon for weeks . It is not yet clear , but it is likely the GNU will wait for many of the senior appointments to be in place before it stages its lekgotla strategy session to decide on a programme of action . After that , the Statement of Intent says there will be a National Dialogue , involving a wide range of players . <p> The longer the process takes , the greater the risk that the reforms will be watered down or scrapped . What is the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , have a Parliament in place , and many of the issues are technical in nature and not appropriate for a public consensus-seeking dialogue . <p> Implementing reforms after an election is among the best times to undertake what could otherwise be a politically difficult exercise . Easing the costs of reform among particular groups would be made easier if our economy was buoyant . But it is not buoyant , precisely due to the absence of reform , so the GNU does not even have the option of waiting for better times . <h> Partial turnaround <p> A study by the International Monetary Fund has found that positive results from reform can take around 18 months to feed through . That sort of time frame would allow at least a partial turnaround by the time of the local government elections in 2026 . By changing the investment story , we can tell the world that there might be large and early positive results . Good election results for the reform coalition parties would show the rewards and allow more changes . <p> To show a fuller commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have added another quote from Deng Xiaoping about the measures that allowed billions to emerge from poverty .

@@109506235 <h> Differences over the allocation of Cabinet positions have the potential to erode public confidence in the Government of National Unity . <p> As the fight for Cabinet positions threatens to collapse the Government of National Unity ( GNU ) , President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday urged the united parties to put aside their ' narrow interests ' and channel their efforts to the creation of an ' inclusive government ' . <p> This comes as GNU negotiations have deadlocked over the number of Cabinet seats that parties are entitled to . <p> In his newsletter published yesterday , Ramaphosa said differences over the allocation of Cabinet positions have the potential to erode public confidence in the GNU . <p> " The formation of the second GNU is a momentous development in South Africa 's democracy . Every effort must be made to ensure that the GNU remains true to its founding spirit of collaboration in good faith , to drive a programme that improves the lives of all South Africans , " said Ramaphosa . <p> According to sources , the power-sharing dispute has resulted in Ramaphosa holding back on the announcement of the GNU Cabinet .

Further , the DA demanded being granted a bigger say in the appointment of director-generals who will be serving in departments under the party 's control . <p> In the event of the DA being unable to participate in the GNU , the party said it would also be compelled to withdraw from the KZN government of provincial unity . <p> Network News offers you a selection of stories of national importance , handpicked from over 50 Caxton Local News sites that represent more than 100 print newspapers .

As a proud South African , I feel like I disappointed the nation . Such a betrayal of a loved food item is akin to treason -- worthy of my citizenship being revoked , at least temporarily . <p> The stakes for redemption were high . <p> My colleague and food hero , Tony Jackman , threw me a lifeline and asked me to make *dombolo , a traditional South African steamed bread . I spiralled emotionally as mini anxiety attacks followed in succession before responding to Jackman 's challenge . " Great ! Another opportunity to screw up another staple food item in many homes within the country . This time , I 'll be lynched , " I said in my mind . <p> I accepted Jackman 's challenge , agreeing to make Dombolo . My game plan involved going back to the basics .

Doing this apparently gives you control over the quantity and choice of ingredients . <p> So , at the weekend , with no pressure to follow the intense political news cycle ( government of national unity stuff ) , I assembled ingredients including self-raising flour ( any kind of flour works ) , salt , instant dry yeast , and sugar . These ingredients were mixed with lukewarm water and oil . The full ingredients list and method are below . <p> The beauty about dombolo is that the dough to make it can also yield amagwinyas .

I 'm aware that there are several names used to describe steamed bread . Other people call it dombolo or uJeqe ( the isiZulu version ) . The difference between the two is in the cooking method . Idombolo is usually prepared separately in a pot of steaming water . <p> Meanwhile , uJeqe ( or the dough ) is often cooked on top of or together with a stew in a pot . It all depends on where you come from . I am from Soweto , Johannesburg .

@@109617236 <h> Having heard how jubilant she was about all the current gnus , we asked Tannie Evita to share a recipe with us . She chose a koeksister with a GNU look , and threw in some Reconciliation Bobotie for good measure . <p> We all know and love Evita Bezuidenhout for so many things , not least her role as a diplomat through ( what seems like ) the ages , but also for her winning ways in the kitchen . <p> She is not always easy to pin down ( many have tried , as Pik Botha could attest were he still with us ) , but luckily a certain gentleman of her acquaintance , the satirist Mr Pieter-Dirk Uys , persuaded her to go through her ( inestimable ) drawers to choose a suitable recipe for us . <p> Evita came to mind when he ( Uys , not Evita , though for some reason they always seem to pop into one 's mind at the same time ) popped up in my inbox the other day . " Hi dear Tony J ! One Man Shows : The Mbeki HIV Renaissance -- the third volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy the adventure . Feel free to share it . Much love from Darling and thumbs up for the GNU ! " ( Find more links at the end of the story . ) <p> I do n't know if PDU is any good in the kitchen , but Tannie Evita is another story . I seem to recall that she even cooked for former US President Ronald Reagan once , and what Nancy made of that is anyone 's guess . <p> Legends abound . Is it true that Henry Kissinger kissed her under the mistletoe at the White House ? Neither of them is here to deny it , and Tannie E never talks about these things . And the Denis Thatcher incident , well , let 's not talk about that . Skande ! Of course , there 's most likely no truth in it . And our lips are sealed , those of us who were aware of the rumours at the time . And I was there right at the beginning , at the moment that Tannie Evita first stepped into our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now be " the advancing years " ( surely ? ) , dear Tannie Evita jumped at the chance of updating her classic koeksister recipe for us , with Certain Developments in mind . <p> She still has it . Evita Bezuidenhout today , showing scant evidence of the years . ( Photo : Hentie van der Merwe ) <p> Her triumphs in the kitchen are legendary , and no , we are no longer talking about Pik or Denis . In the many decades , sorry , years , that she has graced our national discourse , Tannie Evita has launched two cookbooks , with Linda Viquery . The first was Evita 's Kossie Sikelela , with a foreword by Sophia Loren ( who , incidentally , is also a lifelong friend of Mr Uys , but Tannie Evita knows everybody ) . The second book was Evita 's Bossie Sikelela , with a foreword by Charlize Theron . We decided it best not to ask whether Tannie regards herself as one of the 44 . <p> Instead , Evita writes : <p> " The best lesson I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a politician 's mind is not through his brain ; it 's through his stomach . That is why I cook for reconciliation . Put mortal enemies around a dinner table ; they ca n't fight . Too many knives and forks . They must listen and talk and realise that there is no need to fight for something they both love : South Africa . <p> " In the 1970s Pik Botha was the SA Ambassador at the UN and the person who suggested that I use my cooking art to fight sanctions and make friends for South Africa . Of course , we had no friends because of apartheid , so we invited our greatest enemy : Fidel Castro . Nobody on Manhattan would feed him , or let him use their toilets because he was a Communist from Cuba . I tested my bobotie on him ! If I poisoned him and he died , no one would care . He loved the bobotie and said if Afrikaners cook so well , we ca n't all be bad . He was on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veered to the left and ended up in Angola . <p> " I was also invited by Queen Elizabeth to accompany President Jacob Zuma on his first State visit to the UK . She also asked me for my bobotie recipe . What a thrill . Of course , Prince Philip called it moussaka , but what do you expect from an old Greek . <p> " And now , at last I can serve my special GNU koeksisters that Nelson Mandela so loved . He actually said : ' I was in jail for 27 years and every day I just stayed alive so that one day I could taste your koeksisters ! ' Such a sweet old fibber ! <p> " Usually the koeksister is a plait of three strips . Our present GNU will demand a collection of at least seven strips so that no party would feel left out . With Helen Zilla 's free entry to my Luthuli House kitchen , I 'm still not sure how it will all work out . Toemaar , boer maak ' n plan ! " <p> First prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stir until sugar has dissolved . Add the cream of tartar , cinnamon sticks and ginger and boil for a few minutes . Leave to simmer for 10 minutes , until it becomes syrupy . Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool . Refrigerate for at least six hours . <p> To prepare the dough , mix cake flour , baking powder and a pinch of salt in a large bowl . Rub in the butter , using your fingers , until it feels like breadcrumbs . Beat eggs and milk together and add to the flour mixture . Knead into a dough . Form into a ball and cover with wax paper for 2 hours . <p> Roll out dough to 1 cm thick . Cut into strips about 8 cm by 3 cm . Make two cuts , 1 cm from one end of the strip , so that you have 3 strips , attached at one end . Plait together and pinch to seal at the bottom . <p> Heat cooking oil in a pan and deep-fry koeksisters for 2 minutes , until golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then immerse in cold syrup until all air has escaped . Drain on a rack . <p> Tannie Evita 's Reconciliation Bobotie <p> Ingredients <p> 6 dried apricots <p> 6 dried apple rings <p> ? cup seedless raisins <p> 1 cup cold black tea <p> 2 large onions , peeled and sliced <p> 1 cup orange juice <p> 1 Tbsp curry powder <p> 2 tsp turmeric <p> 1 kg minced beef <p> 2 thick slices stale , white bread , crumbled <p> 3 ?

@@109617240 <h> The Waffle House and The Packshed . Two unique eateries 10 minutes apart . Both crowd-pullers and singular community gems . One a long-time landmark , the other a landmark in the making . Cool bananas , both . <p> It was a message about free-range chickens and a man who had travelled to the US to work on a chicken farm that got me writing aboutThe Waffle House , something of an iconic spot , as eateries go , in Ramsgate on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast . <p> AndThe Packshed , about 10 minutes away by car . An invitation to a memorial took me there for the first time . To be surprised by this unexpected " find " in the middle of nowhere , as it seemed to a townie bused in with a small group of the widower 's friends from Durban . <p> A most memorable memorial it was , put together by the husband when , as he put it , fond memories were increasingly filtering through his grief , so he knew it was time . <p> Time to raise many glasses of Bollinger Special Cuv ? e in absentia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favourite . <p> Similarly , time for him to curate a five-course lunch , each dish chosen to celebrate his late wife by way of the geographic trajectory of her life . Which had started in the Philippines , along the way included Germany , and ended in South Africa , fittingly recognised with a dessert she loved : a simply deliciousJackie Cameron apple crumble . All recipes agreed upon in collaboration with Packshed executive chef Brandon Bisset , who prepared them . <p> My Waffle House salted caramel avalanche , the vanilla ice cream locally made and served on a bed of macadamia praline and caramel crunch . Easy to see why it is a menu favourite . ( Photo : Wanda Hennig ) <p> Apropos The Waffle House . We 'll get back to the broilers in a bit and to Nemvelo , the organic farm the chickeroos free-range on . <p> For now , see my " salted caramel avalanche " . The wondrous vision of temptation and delight , pictured above . The mint on the top is from the farm . The vanilla ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts in the praline " bed " are locally sourced . And the waffles are made without sugar . It 's your choice to drench them in the maple-flavoured syrup offered and available on every table . Or not . And yes , this voluptuary avalanche is what I ordered . <p> And yes , drench the remaining bits of the waffle after relishing the ice cream , the casing of salted caramel and the crunchy " bed " is what I did . <p> Savoury waffle items are as popular as sweet options at The Waffle House , with the Nemvelo Farm free-range chicken curry waffle a firm favourite . This beef burger came with the farm 's organic beans and carrots plus onion marmalade made in the kitchen and sold in the deli . ( Photo : Wanda Hennig ) <p> It is an understatement to say the eatery is a long-time landmark . Also to say I had a few preconceptions that were misconceptions . Sugary waffles , for example , was my expectation . But no sugar is used in the waffle mix , sweetness being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppings . And wow , waffles made from stone-ground flour . And served with organic veggies grown on their own organic farm . <p> The chicken in the popular chicken curry waffle , served with a papadum , sambals and fresh banana slices ( on the South Coast , expect a cool bounty of bananas ) , is free-range , from their farm . As is the chicken in the chicken ? la king ( now there 's a blast from the past ) and the chicken mayo waffles . These being among the savoury selection , which of course has some vegetarian options ( there are vegan too ) including a roasted butternut and beetroot waffle with feta , lentils and pecan nuts . <p> Meat ? There 's a bobotie waffle . And I shared a beef burger waffle with Pauline Lee , a partner in The Waffle House , initially from Ireland but so long here that there is barely a hint of the brogue . <p> Oh yes , another surprise . Salad or basmati or brown rice are offered as alternatives to waffles . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free-range . <p> The place opened in 1957 , not as the Waffle House but as the Tea House of the Blue Lagoon . I learn from Lee that Doreen Gaze , the founder with her late husband , John , turns 98 this year and lives in Ramsgate , directly across the winding , narrow and what was **28;2136;TOOLONG , the main South Coast road . <p> John and Doreen , says Lee -- and I find versions of the story in old newspaper articles posted on aMargate nostalgia Facebook group -- ran the place for 19 years . Then they went to the UK for 15 years and rented it out . <p> In 1991 they returned , refurbished and reopened as The Waffle House , modelled on two eateries of this name , also featuring Belgian waffles , that their son had recently opened in the UK . All three remain in the family and now that I am following theNorwich andSt Albans branches on Instagram , I can report that , same as their KZN South Coast counterpart , they are waffling along swimmingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally sourced , free range and organic ingredients " . <p> Mhlekhona ' Mhle ' Hlongwa , Nemvelo supervisor , clockwise , shows the first crop of macadamia ; sorts spinach seedlings ; inspects the bananas that will be bagged before they ripen ; and with Nemvelo free-range broilers , different from the layers he worked with during his year in Indiana . ( Photo : Wanda Hennig ) <p> So now , meet Mhlekhona " Mhle " Hlongwa , supervisor at Nemvelo ( which translates from isiZulu as " with nature " ) Farm , which came into being seven years ago when The Waffle House could n't find a suitable local supplier of free-range chickens . <p> " We found this 6.5-hectare farm , " says manager Clinten Peters , as we stand in the car park at the top of a hill , sun filtering through trees , looking down over a greenhouse and terraced veggie beds to a lake . <p> He gives me the rundown while we wait for Hlongwa , who is busy making sure things are running smoothly at the farm 's small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clucking , seemingly happily oblivious to their pending farm-to-plate fate . This " of age " group ( 43 days ) has been moved from one of three large chicken houses , each of which opens into a substantial outdoor plot with shrubs , trees , sand and shade where they have " enjoyed a short and healthy life in a pleasant environment " , as Peters puts it . <p> Walking the hilly paths ofNemvelo Farm with Hlongwa , who Peters has already told me is " amazing with chickens but his passion is vegetables and he 's always trying new and innovative ways of producing seedlings " . I get to experience his know-how first-hand . He shows me the macadamia nut trees , which are producing their first real crop . And the bananas , ready to be covered so they can ripen safely . <p> He shows me the microgreens and seedlings in the expansive greenhouse that 's his passion ; demonstrates how to thin them out to ensure a sturdy crop . Then we wander the organic produce fields . Talk about the worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges with no knowledge of regenerative farming , as in building soil health , eschewing pesticides and herbicides , and earth-to-earth composting . <p> Hlongwa , who was born and raised in nearby Gamalakhe , studied agricultural management through Unisa after he left school . He ran a seedling nursery at the Ramsgate-based food security nonprofit , Siyavuna , before joining the Nemvelo team as the farm was setting up . This led to a poultry internship by way of a US-based World Poultry Foundation grant , arranged by the Future Farmers Foundation in Howick , a nonprofit supporting young people from rural communities with a passion for farming . <p> The internship took him to the US for a year , toRose Acre Farms , one of America 's largest egg producers , in North Vernon , Indiana . " There I worked with layers , " learning a lot about hi-tech egg production -- and getting extremely chilly in winter . <p> While he appreciated the experience acquired , he was happy to return to subtropical climes , family , broilers and veggie crops back at Nemvelo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic produce and partners with community groups around seeds and training internships . Two years ago they opened a deli at The Waffle House as an outlet for the general public . <p> The Packshed . Sophisticated , unpretentious fine dining rooted in Swiss discernment and standards . Hands-on co-founder Daniel Kern is a graduate of the acclaimed Swiss Hotel Management School in Zurich . <p> The seductive ? la carte menu -- which has starters like wild mushroom potato dumplings , gin and beetroot gravlax , and " springbok carpaccio and blue cheese ( mousse ) feast " -- changes quarterly . It is complemented by harvest specials and reflects executive chef Brandon Bisset 's penchant for Asian and European cuisine , his KZN origins and experience , and his passion for seasonally inspired produce and ingredients . <p> The eatery 's name tells the story of the venue 's origins . It is a banana packing shed , transformed . Small wonder that with such down-home origins the vibe is fun and friendly . <p> I find it curious that the word " intimate " speaks to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , at times with Kern or Bisset , when I am aware that the place is cavernous . Perfect for the weddings and big events they regularly host . I put it down to someone 's ingenious design creativity with the wood and metal tables ( made by interns learning useful trades at an on-site skills centre that sadly languished during Covid ) , the velvet couches , the fireplace , the strings of lights , the many candles and cool monochromatic palette . <p> Then there 's the open-plan kitchen . In one corner a refrigerator for the pancetta and prosciutto , made in-house . An indoor , sectioned-off " farm stall " , calledSweet Gang &amp; Friends , run by Julie van Lille , renowned in the area for her chocolate brownies . It is a collaboration , which offers small producers and vendors an upscale outlet for gifts and produce . Also , for Packshed breads , including Swiss butterzopf , a knotted bread , chef Brandon 's sourdoughs , including one with salted caramel and chocolate , and daily special quiches . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also live music , is the Sweetdale Night Market , from 6pm to 10pm , held on the former banana farm alongside the eatery on the last Friday of every month . It is hugely popular with locals as a community gathering spot and fun social happening . If you have n't triedMpenjati Coffee , grown and roasted inland from nearby Munster close to Port Edward , it 's worth making a detour if you 're down that way . They have a great littlecoffee shop and will give you a tour . The Packshed brews Mpenjati Coffee , sells it in the " farm stall " and it is available at the night market . <p> The signature Norwegian salmon cooked on the open fire is a dish The Packshed dare not take off the menu . The steak tartare , behind , they dared to put on the menu . ( Photo : Wanda Hennig ) <p> When I go to meet Kern to chat , the weather , summery on my previous day 's visit , has turned overcast and chilly . I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs are artistically columned . <p> But no . A menu favourite , one of several they ca n't take off when they make changes , is the " wood board " Norwegian salmon , which is cooked on the open fire , lit specifically for this purpose and giving a comforting and exotic vibe , not to forget the enticing aroma . The dish is served with fondant potatoes , house-made pancetta , wild mushrooms , lemon and potato creams and a couple of other subtle side-tastes . <p> " We try to do local as much as possible . But guests want this , love it . Cooking it over the open fire , besides giving the smoky taste , makes for an experience for the guests . They like to watch it . That 's also the idea behind the open kitchen . " <p> Kern 's in-laws , Roland ( who before retirement was an airline pilot in Switzerland ) and Sibylle Wenger , bought what was a 120ha banana farm 20 years ago . " They wanted to do something different and meaningful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leadership and team-building camp . This followed by a skills centre , with a view creating employment options for young people , including in the hospitality field . They also import quality used bicycles from Europe , teach bike repair skills and donate the bicycles . <p> Early on they also opened up hiking and biking trails on the sprawling farm for the community at large . <p> Daniel Kern and his wife , Connie Wenger , who have two young children , were both involved in hospitality in Switzerland . " Our dream was to open our own restaurant . We came regularly to the South Coast to visit the in-laws and saw the potential for a good restaurant and also to do something for the community . " <p> They moved to the area seven years ago , as did Sam Wenger , Kern 's brother-in-law , currently involved in the creation ofSerenity Hills , an eco-focused estate they 're developing on the property conceptualised during Covid when everything involving people and community shut down . <p> " I love Switzerland , " says Kern , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , you know , the people are reserved . And everything is small . One is often shut inside . Here , on the other hand , the people are so welcoming and friendly . There is so much space . The outdoors . The wildlife . The culture . The diversity . The food and wine . " <p> A classic perfectly seasoned steak tartare , hand-cut raw fillet , with onions , mustard , cognac , cayenne , Worcestershire , caper berries , mustard and turmeric emulsion , the egg yolk arriving discretely nestled into half a shell , ready to drop on top and mix in to savour with the melba toast . " We were told we dare not have steak tartare on the menu down the South Coast , " says Kern . <p> But they went ahead . And unsurprisingly , given the quality and presentation ( and yes , I got to eat the one I photographed ) , it is a favourite . <p> An option is the Norwegian salmon tartare , which comes richly blended with smoked salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caviar , the same mustard and turmeric emulsion that comes with the steak tartare and that melba toast . <p> The yolk arrives nestled in half an eggshell on top of the tartare . Right , top , a Packshed springbok carpaccio pizza and bottom , Chef Brandon 's in-house-made slow-aged prosciutto photographed in the pizza corner . ( Photo : Wanda Hennig ) <p> There is a wood-fired pizza corner , wo-manned by Doreen Cele , who started at the leadership camp 15 years ago , moved to the kitchen , and now runs the pizza bar . She tells me about the 24-hour fermentation , rolling of the dough and pre-baking . <p> I try a slice of the springbok carpaccio pizza -- their game is provided courtesy the skills of a nearby hunter -- which comes , of course , with good mozzarella , has slivers of Parmesan , and is finished with a hint of truffle oil . I ca n't resist a second slice , encouraged by Kern , topped with the salsa verde , a tasty medley of capers , anchovies , parsley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of three condiments served . <p> I was taken by the idea , for when the days are chillier , of trying the oxtail ragu pizza . Never come across that before . Chef Brandon creates the wood-fired menu . Fermented dough . Inspired toppings . You know they will begood pizzas . <p> Sitting at a table next to a dancing ( inebriated ? ) EAT sign , imbibing the atmosphere , aromas and stories , watched solicitously by front-of-house manager Lincoln Majeke , I get to thinking how thisTGIFood article evolved . The Packshed . The Waffle House . Two eateries which at face value are apples vs oranges , but with similarities to chew on . An email from my friend in the US about a man who , like her , has an affinity for chickens . An invite from the widower to come celebrate the life of a remarkable woman . So much of what happens in life , seemingly randomly , evolves into story after the fact . <p> Both these stories became my story . And now they have become yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but both of them unique South Coast gems .

@@109975230 <p> Homeownership has stood as a beacon of achievement in the age-old narrative of success . But in this day and age , is the notion of renting for life -- or even for an extended period -- such a dire prospect after all ? <p> This choice , to rent or buy , bears weight not only on one 's immediate financial status but also on the trajectory of their long-term prosperity and lifestyle . And in times of economic uncertainty , the stakes of this decision are amplified , demanding careful consideration and informed judgement . <p> The idea of owning property , which has long been hailed as the pinnacle of adult attainment , remains deeply entrenched in our societal psyche . Property , undeniably , continues to represent one of the soundest long-term investments available . Yet , in today 's economic fluctuations , soaring interest rates , and pervasive uncertainties , many find themselves at a crossroads , grappling with the decision to defer homeownership or plunge into the market despite potential repercussions . <p> The merits of homeownership are manifold , with the foremost being the accrual of equity . Through mortgage payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forging a valuable asset over time . This sense of ownership affords stability and the liberty to personalise living spaces , fostering long-term plans devoid of lease expirations or rent escalations . Moreover , tax incentives sweeten the deal , offering deductions on mortgage interest and property taxes , thereby lightening the burden of taxation . <p> However , the path to homeownership is not without its hurdles . Initial costs loom large , demanding substantial upfront investments comprising deposits , closing fees , and potential inspection expenditures . Ongoing maintenance expenses further punctuate the financial landscape , introducing an element of unpredictability to homeownership . And in a volatile real estate market , the inherent risk of property value fluctuations exists , casting shadows of doubt over future returns . <p> On the other hand , renting presents a compelling alternative with flexibility and minimal upfront financial burden . Renters have the freedom to relocate without the encumbrance of property sales , making it an attractive prospect for those anticipating frequent moves . With lower initial costs and limited exposure to property value downturns , renting offers a semblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rental path too has its limitations . One is the absence of equity accumulation -- a stark departure from the wealth-building potential inherent in homeownership . Rent increases pose another concern , potentially undermining budgetary projections and eroding financial predictability . Additionally , renters contend with limited control over their living spaces , subject to the whims of landlords regarding alterations and renovations . <p> Navigating the split between renting and buying demands a nuanced understanding of one 's financial readiness , long-term aspirations , and prevailing market conditions . Financial stability , creditworthiness , and affordability form the bedrock of this decision-making process , alongside considerations of career trajectories and lifestyle preferences . <p> Property expert Richard Huxham-Hardie from Hardie Property shared his insights on the topic of renting vs buying . Here is what he had to say : <p> ' Renting is paying someone else 's bond off . Property has proven consistently that it is the best long-term investment to make . The sooner you can get on the ladder , do it . Also , you do n't have to live in what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream home and they either stay at home longer or end up renting whilst prices escalate . Buy what you can afford and start your property journey this way . If you can afford R1,500,000 , find a property for that amount and either live in it or rent it out . ' <p> Huxham-Hardie presents a good case study : <p> ' A popular area for families is Meadowridge in Cape Town . Two years ago you could buy a fixer-upper for R3,500,000 . The same property is now R4 500 000 with properties remaining on the market for less than a week . Imagine you are trying to save up for a dream home at R3 500 000 plus transfer duty and the price escalates by R1 000 000 in two years ? ' <p> Huxham-Hardie says that Cape Town in particular is only going to become less affordable for first-time buyers so it is important to get your foot on the bottom rung of the ladder now . <p> He adds : ' The real sting in the tail is that rental prices have also escalated post-Covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will feel like you are treading water . Those who bought during and right after Covid are the ones smiling like Cheshire cats . ' <p> Market trends must be meticulously analysed to seize opportune moments amid downturns . Additional costs and responsibilities must be weighed against the potential benefits , with prudent financial planning serving as a guideline . <p> Potential buyers are advised to conduct thorough research , crafting personalised checklists to align their needs with their budgets . Securing a substantial deposit not only bolsters bargaining power but also diminishes long-term financial liabilities . Shopping around for favourable mortgage deals and enlisting the aid of property experts are essential steps in this journey , ensuring informed decisions and optimal outcomes . <p> Whether one opts to rent or buy , the decision is deeply personal , with deciding factors such as financial considerations , lifestyle preferences , and long-term aspirations . <p> Explore Cape Town and its surroundings with these incredible deals on cars for under R100 000 .

Our first meeting was 7.5 hours long , and it was welcomed . I was welcomed , but the committee too was welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police as well . The national commissioner and his team were also there , and then of course the head of the Hawks , IPID , and PSIRA too . So it was quite a first meeting , and we can talk about the technicalities of that too shortly , but it was positive , as I said , uncontested and very grateful . <p> 00:02:47:12 -- 00:02:52:10Chris Steyn:So all the parties were in favour ? <p> 00:02:52:12 -- 00:03:15:16Ian Cameron:Yes . Of course , I mean , MK and EFF did push me a little bit during the sitting , but it was still positive and it was constructive from all parties . It was very interesting to see the dynamic , and I 've heard about it before , but it was really good to see the changing dynamics once you step into a committee . <p> 00:03:15:16 -- 00:03:45:15It 's almost as though a lot of the politicking disappears , and it becomes an issue of community safety , an issue of policing , an issue of accountability . There was not one entity or party or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important questions and that did n't mention valid and important points . The contribution from the police and the other entities that were there was quite good . <p> 00:03:45:17 -- 00:04:12:00I mean , they did their presentations and so on , but it was fantastic to see how a portfolio committee can actually work and can actually hold people accountable because I think it is something that kind of got a little bit lost . And I do n't say it as criticism , but it is something that a lot of South Africans lost interest in , portfolio committees , because I think they kind of felt it was just a presentation mechanism , whereas it 's actually an oversight and accountability mechanism . <p> 00:04:12:02 -- 00:04:47:23With something like police , I mean , the immense responsibility that we have and power in a positive sense that we have to really ask critical questions and to hold the relevant people accountable is spectacular . And it 's something that we need to take very , very seriously . <p> 00:04:53:21 -- 00:05:25:10Ian Cameron:So , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the scope is of this portfolio committee . It obviously includes the South African Police Service , which includes the Hawks , so DPCI , all priority crime investigation , etc . Then IPID , the Independent Police Investigative Directorate , then the Police Civilian Secretariat , and then of course , PSIRA , the Private Security Regulating Authority . <p> 00:05:25:10 -- 00:06:16:01Ian Cameron:So , those are all the bodies that basically fall under this umbrella . You can imagine it has a significant portion of union involvement , a significant portion of NGO and NPO involvement , and the whole non-profit sector plays a significant role in whistleblowing , combating crime , etc. , in South Africa . Therefore , my job to a large extent -- I 'll get to the parliamentary specifics now -- is to be able to give those entities a platform to hold the necessary people to account . <p> 00:06:16:03 -- 00:06:40:05Ian Cameron:It 's important to create those platforms for them to give their input on important decisions that are made . We have to consider legislation or bills that need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specifically for me as an individual , it 's important that I remain as objective as possible . <p> 00:06:40:05 -- 00:07:18:02Ian Cameron:You play an important role in not choosing sides . You do n't go and sit there and put on a political party hat or an NGO hat . You go and sit there not as an activist either , although in my heart , I think I 'll always be a little bit of an activist with regards to crime , especially . But once you sit there , everyone needs to have their fair chance to say what they need to say or ask what they need to ask , and then obviously give the relevant people the opportunity to answer those questions or comments . <p> 00:07:18:04 -- 00:07:44:21Ian Cameron:I 've summarized it very basically . A key part of this , as a simple example , and these are all questions that we are aiming to raise very soon -- the team is already busy doing the necessary work to send letters -- is to ask why specific murder cases have taken two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron:Soon I 'll share more details of those cases , but today we already sent several requests for letters to be sent within the next week or so to ask why these cases have taken so long . If the existing unit or detective working on that case is not doing an adequate job , then it needs to be transferred to someone who can do the job properly . <p> 00:08:14:09 -- 00:08:40:05Ian Cameron:Something we 're busy with at the moment -- this was a sitting yesterday -- is the budget for the coming year or two . We can clearly see the deficiencies in terms of resource allocation . It seems the government still does n't understand how important it is that we need more detectives or that IPID needs more investigators . <p> 00:08:40:10 -- 00:09:07:01Ian Cameron:IPID has almost 180 investigators for the entire country . It 's physically impossible . They 've got an average of 350 cases each in IPID , and it 's similar for detectives in the South African Police Service . The pressure is immense . The core issue for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and supporting them ... <p> 00:09:07:03 -- 00:09:35:17Ian Cameron : ... but something I feel we often miss is support for good police on the ground . Hardly anyone speaks about their psychological well-being , the stress they work under , the lack of resources , and the fact that they keep on going . I must tell you , the messages of support I 've received in the last 24 hours after the election from police members have been overwhelming , from cops I 've never spoken to in my life ... <p> 00:09:35:19 -- 00:09:55:12Ian Cameron : ... who somehow got my number . I 've been inundated with messages of support from them , thanking me for letting them be heard . That is one of the single biggest motivations for me to work harder because if they can hang in there , surely we can do more . <p> 00:09:55:14 -- 00:10:00:02Chris Steyn:What , as chairperson , will be your priorities ? <p> 00:10:00:04 -- 00:10:22:17Ian Cameron:Resource allocation is crucial for me . Obviously , the budget needs to be passed now . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments , and obviously , it 's from a previous executive . But we 're already indicating in our reports that will be released to the committee tomorrow . I think it will be public soon as well . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:10:22:19 -- 00:10:53:13 ) We actually just completed , or I just completed , the draft now from yesterday 's committee . We 've already indicated that in the near future , we would need to consider amending the budget to ensure that the police have the right resource allocation in the right places . One of the issues that came up was the constant appointment of senior officers where they are not necessarily needed . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:10:53:13 -- 00:11:24:20 ) We 've got an extremely bloated management in the South African Police Service , and I 'm not convinced that it is a priority . We could rather use that money to support members on the ground . So that 's one very simple example : resource allocation , and the same goes for IPID . Then , a core responsibility is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think have a national influence or impact . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:11:24:20 -- 00:11:46:16 ) So , if something has the potential to cause a negative trend nationally , for example , a question we 're already asking is , when are the arrests happening for the Philippi Training College corruption ? 114 million rand is unaccounted for , and the same commander is still in charge of the college . How is that possible ? <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:11:46:16 -- 00:12:10:13 ) How is it possible that this very commander tells police members that nothing will happen to him , and if it does , he will bring others down with him ? It is simply unacceptable . These types of cases play a significant role in causing the risk of a negative trend throughout the police . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:12:10:13 -- 00:12:48:02 ) Because if it 's happening at Philippi , the chances are it 's likely happening at other police academies as well . So those are some examples . And then the third one , I believe , is really being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to restore respect for Parliament and for a committee like the Police Portfolio Committee because it has an immense responsibility and it is something that needs to be used . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:12:48:02 -- 00:13:11:09 ) It 's constitutionally mandated to do what we are doing , and therefore we need to actually use it . If I go to a police station and I ask to see their occurrence book as oversight , they are not allowed to say no . It is my constitutional mandate to do that . They ca n't stop me from doing that . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:13:11:11 -- 00:13:33:05 ) It 's a very simple example , but it 's a straightforward way of doing it . And , obviously , Chris , we 'll have a more detailed strategic plan set up within the next three months . As soon as the budgets are done , we 'll start planning that and then get everyone together for a more detailed strategy for the coming five years . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:13:33:10 -- 00:13:42:13 ) We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's something we need to have patience for and tackle step by step . <p> Chris Steyn ( 00:13:42:15 -- 00:13:51:22 ) Now , you and the previous Minister of Police had a publicly hostile relationship . I sense that this will not be the case with the new Minister of Police . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:13:52:00 -- 00:14:18:02 ) No , and I must say , it 's still early days , but I think Minister Senzo Mchunu is a positive appointment so far . The way he speaks and conducts himself is significant in my opinion , and he 's very approachable . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:14:18:02 -- 00:14:42:05 ) He 's someone you can speak with , someone who listens , and someone who is interested in hearing opinions and advice . He wants to understand better . Just before you and I spoke , I was on the phone with him , and he immediately tells me that he 's desperately trying to spend more time with police management . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:14:42:12 -- 00:15:02:08 ) He needs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs to spend quality time understanding where discrepancies are , what good and bad things are happening , or not happening . So , I 'm excited about that , and it 's going to be very interesting to see what he does . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:15:02:08 -- 00:15:27:08 ) Something that stood out to me was the fact that I did n't get the impression that he was trying to be a commissioner . He allowed the South African Police Service National Commissioner to speak freely , to speak as the commissioner , as the CEO of the police . And that 's something that has been missing in previous years . It was as though ministers thought they were the operational commanders of the police , but they are not . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:15:27:10 -- 00:15:39:03 ) So it 's good to see that the function or the role allocations already seem to be better distinguished than what they were . <p> Chris Steyn ( 00:15:39:05 -- 00:15:47:06 ) What words do you have for a nation that has virtually given up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 00:15:47:08 -- 00:16:07:10 ) Sure , I think it 's a whole day 's worth of discussion . My motto , first of all , from a faith point of view , is Psalm 23:4 : " I will fear no evil . " The principle is just that even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:16:07:10 -- 00:16:34:12 ) because you are with me . So that 's my ultimate hope . But apart from that , on a more practical level , we do n't have another alternative . We need to make this work . We 've got one opportunity to do it . I wrote a piece this morning saying that it can never ever be accepted that 85 or more people are murdered every day in this country . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:16:35:08 -- 00:17:03:13 ) We carry on as though it 's okay . It 's just another 85 . What difference does it make ... three children per day ? I mean , it 's almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spoken about that case so many times and still no one has been arrested . It simply can not be . I was going through police reports earlier today and yesterday in the committee , and I look at crime detection rates ... at an all-time low . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:17:03:13 -- 00:17:32:03 ) They 're extremely low . Only 14.5% of murders are actually solved in South Africa . So that means nearly 80% of murders are not solved . This is war zone stuff we 're talking about , and we certainly can not accept that as the norm . Again , to me , and this is how I hope to encourage other ordinary South Africans , there are many good police members out there . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:17:32:03 -- 00:17:54:19 ) I give them my word , and I know there are a lot of problems in the South African Police Service . But trust me when I say I know hundreds , if not more , of them . I 've spoken to thousands of them , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the police , and we need to cherish them . We need to exhaust every single remedy at our disposal . <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:17:54:19 -- 00:18:24:00 ) If it is a portfolio committee , use that . If it is a civil rights organisation , do that . If it 's politically , do that too . Do all three if you can , but make sure you exhaust every single remedy at your disposal to cherish the good cops and to fight for your community because the remedies are there . To me , it 's a huge honour to be in a position where , with this committee of people who are really dedicated , <p> Ian Cameron ( 00:18:24:02 -- 00:18:34:06 ) we can ask questions that need to be asked , we can demand answers , and we can also support the relevant authorities .

My letter today is for the millions of Zimbabweans in the Diaspora , people who do get it , do understand . Most have left , not by choice but by necessity . They have left their families , their homes , their communities , their lifestyles and the very essence of themselves . <p> When I took to one social media site ( Facebook ) this week and asked people in the Diaspora to identify the things that they most love and miss about ' home , ' the responses were overwhelming . This was n't one of those social media posts where you can just click an emoji indicating like , love , happy or sad . This was a post where I was asking people to open their hearts and actually type a few words . <p> A huge outpouring of love and emotion and the most heartfelt comments followed . I spent hours reading hundreds of comments about why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled , laughed and cried and commented on as many as I could . <p> The overwhelming comments on what people love and miss the most , probably slotted into three categories : There are the Zimbabwean people : warm , smiling , friendly , welcoming and generous , always sharing meals , stories and memories and always finding humour regardless of their hardships . Then there is the Natural Zimbabwe , the wild and everything about it from the landscape to the bright blue sky in the day and the star-studded sky at night . The birds , the animals , the places , the climate , the rain , the purple clouds building before the thunder storms . The third category is the Zimbabwean lifestyle , a feeling of belonging and togetherness ; the slow pace and the realness of life . <p> We are so proud of all of you Zimbabweans out there scattered around the world . So many left with nothing . So many had lost everything , were traumatized , broken and brutalized and now you do us so proud , all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing skills in the medical and health fields , in education , sport , finance , science , technology , the arts , writers , singers , dancers , actors , legal professionals , architects , designers , engineers and so many more .

We know that you are as frustrated as we are at the ugly things that keep hitting us behind the knees -- the politics , greed , corruption , selfish , cruel , brutal , oppressive things . We know how much you miss home , and we know also how much we miss you . <p> There are so many Zimbabweans in the Diaspora who are quietly , without any publicity or headlines , helping us . They are maintaining , building or upgrading schools , clinics , hospitals and maternity units . Others are involved with orphanages and children 's homes , projects with girls and youngsters , with conservation programmes , charities and sports . There are millions who are sending money home for family members , friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimbabweans in the Diaspora to their families here reached an astounding US$1.8 billion , an amount equaling 25% of our annual export earnings . <p> I leave you with these images from our beautiful Zimbabwe this week : In the early evening the Southern Cross and two pointers are spectacular in the winter sky ; at 03:00am Scorpius is blazed across the night sky , stinger up , claws down and if you are out before dawn then Mars is there guiding your way . Dawn is peach and apricot , the spotted eagle owl humm- humming from high in the Masasa tree branches . Children laugh and sing as they walk past on their way to school . Heuglins Robins , Hoopoes , Babblers , Thrushes , Blue Waxbills and Doves are endlessly pecking for food in dry crackly gardens . The ladies at the markets are selling huge avocados , bananas and tangerines . The air is dusty and smoky and it all subsides into the most glorious sunsets and as you stand in the caramel glow of twilight , the nightjars swirl and chase each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> To all our Zimbabweans in the Diaspora , thank you ; Zimbabwe would be so much worse off than it is without you .

Those who detect sensationalism in the news assume journalists -- and news organization owners -- care more about making money from audience attention than the accuracy or quality of their reporting . <p> Journalism skeptics who have been observing the coverage after the debate have consequently concluded that journalists are trying to turn the public against Biden so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillmor , for example , recently wrote that The New York Times " has been on a campaign to make sure Joe Biden wo n't have another term in the White House .

Until then , journalists and the public alike had n't regularly monitored or covered Biden 's age , other than a few notable outlets , such as The Wall Street Journal . The debate offered a live opportunity for the world to see firsthand why there have been concerns about electing an 81-year-old to a second term . <p> Second , journalists depend on sources for their reporting .

And , of course , the ANC government 's failure to rein in real , violent crime must not be forgotten . <p> Let us leave aside for a moment that the ANC is itself a conduit for criminality , which I do not think will change even under the much vaunted ' Government of National Unity ' . <h> The Constitution <p> Section 12(1) ( c ) of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right to be free from all forms of violence , both private and public . <p> Speed-reading that provision would tend not to cause any deeper thought .

To my knowledge , no provision like this exists in any of the other notable written constitutions of the world . <p> That everyone has a right to be free from private violence speaks for itself . We have a right against crime that harms our vital interests . This is the basic raison d ' ? tre of the state itself and encapsulates the so-called ' social contract ' . <p> But everyone also has a right to be free from public violence . What could this mean ? <h> State coercion <p> It is well understood in political science that the state is violent itself -- to the extent that coercion is included in the very definition of the state . The state is established violently , and it is maintained violently . There is nothing about the state that is not coloured by the institution 's aggressive nature . <p> You may choose to cease paying for services you receive from a private entity , resulting in those services being discontinued ; but if you cease paying taxes , your state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , simply , be this : you are either to be imprisoned , or killed while resisting imprisonment . <p> There is nothing voluntary or peaceful about the state . <p> This is useful . <p> Violence is an inseparable part of human nature . Having an institution that is above all dedicated to minimising this violence is therefore essential , because violent force that has been initiated can only be minimised with violence . <p> Despite the usefulness of having an institution dedicated to this crucial social function , the obvious danger is that the state , being a violent institution , itself becomes the violent problem rather than its solution . That is why it is a necessity that the state be a legally limited institution . <h> Constitutional imperative to decriminalise <p> The state must be limited to using its coercive power only in answer to coercion -- whether coercion by a foreign power , or domestic criminal elements . <p> In all other respects , the Constitution tells us , everyone has the right to be free from public violence . ( This right may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What is this , other than a clear and unequivocal constitutional requirement for the South African government to decriminalise non-coercive conduct ? <p> If the state , for example , imprisons someone for ' inconveniencing a fellow passenger ' on public transport ( this is in fact a crime in South Africa ) , it has not utilised its coercive power in answer to coercion .

@@110697237 <h> Gun Free SA welcomes ISS call for government to prioritise gun control to reduce violent crime <p> An Institute for Security Studies ( ISS ) report ' Strengthening the SAPS for a safer South Africa : Recommendations for police reform ' launched last week calls on South Africa 's new government to prioritise gun control to reduce violent crime nationally . <p> According to Gareth Newham , Head of the ISS ' Justice and Violence Prevention Programme , " we have to get on top of our murder rate " which is " driven by firearms . " <p> With guns the leading weapon used in murder in South Africa , the ISS urged that firearm crime and violence be " the initial focus of SAPS . " Key priorities to recover illegal firearms and better regulate legal firearm stocks identified in the ISS report include : <p> * Mapping all gun-related crimes to ensure that police responses are better targeted , perpetrators are identified , and sources of illegal firearms are disrupted more effectively . In this regard the report calls for the establishment of dedicated firearm units with adequate intelligence support in all provinces . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Registry , which include rigorously addressing corruption in SAPS firearm management , fully digitising the system , and substantially enhancing oversight and accountability for lost firearms . <p> The report also calls on other stakeholders , such as the National Prosecuting Authority to prioritise the prosecution of firearm violence and other related firearm offences , and for parliament to oversee crime and violence prevention interventions . <p> Gun Free SA said in a statement that it welcomes the ISS ' recommendations . Says Ad ? le Kirsten , Director of GFSA , " gun violence in SA is at crisis levels : 34 people are shot and killed every day with mass killings becoming increasingly common . Addressing gun violence must be a priority for the whole of government . " <p> She notes that a key intervention to addressing gun violence in SA that was not included in the ISS report is the strengthening of South Africa 's gun law . " Since the Firearms Control Act was passed into law in 2000 a range of developments mean it is no longer fit for purpose e.g. loopholes are exploited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun ownership for self-defence is allowed despite overwhelming evidence globally and in South Africa that guns are not effective for self-protection , " Gun Free SA maintains . <p> " The power of the law to reduce gun violence is evident from South Africa 's own experience . In the first years of democracy SA 's gun violence levels were as high as today , with 34 people shot dead daily . As a result of effective gun control that focused on both recovering and destroying illegal guns and restricting licensed guns to stop their leakage and illegal use , the number of people shot dead almost halved in 10 years , " Gun Free SA said . <p> " SA 's own experience shows that gun control is crime control , " says Kirsten , a fact that was recognised by Newham , who said that controlling guns is an " immediate and short-term focus that will have the biggest impact . " <p> One of the big problems is not heavily controlled legal guns but illegal guns falling into criminal hands -- sometimes via the police . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SA Police Service reported 742 firearms stolen in the 2022/23 financial year with just a third of them -- 245 -- recovered , for example . <p> Criminals have also resorted to opening security companies to access firearms . <p> An earlier ISS report on multiple murders and gun crime found that rising firearm-related crime , often linked to the activities of criminal groups , partly reflects chronic dysfunction and corruption in the SAPS , including in crime intelligence and the firearm registry . These two components of the police should be vital to the control of illegal guns and organised crime , the ISS said . <p> Some suggestions for addressing these interlinked problems include a specialised firearms unit , or targeted police operations that confiscate illegal guns and ammunition . It is generally agreed that responses should include better intelligence gathering and analysis of crime data . <p> " These measures could be helpful , but a piecemeal approach will have limited impact . South Africa 's crime and violence challenge extends beyond firearms and organised crime to chronic problems such as gender-based violence , corruption and infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a strategic approach to strengthening the SAPS and criminal justice system . Until there 's a clearly defined programme for doing so , the state 's ability to deal with the deteriorating public safety situation is unlikely to improve , " the ISS cautioned .

@@110756234 <h> Future US policies and potential impacts of a Trump presidency on African security <p> As former President Donald J Trump has now secured the Republican Party 's nomination for the 2024 US presidential election , the potential implications for Africa , particularly in terms of conflicts and terrorism , is a hot topic . Given Trump 's previous policies and rhetoric towards Africa , it is important to consider how his return to the White House could affect Africa 's security dynamics . <p> Trump 's first term was marked by a strong inclination towards isolationism , prioritising America 's interests over international engagements . Experts like Etse Sikanku , a senior lecturer at Accra 's University of Media , Arts and Communication , highlight that Trump 's inward-looking policies could lead to a reduced American presence in African affairs . This potential withdrawal from the international stage may weaken the multilateral systems that many African nations depend on to combat insurgencies and terrorism . <p> Priyal Singh from the Institute for Security Studies ( ISS ) in Pretoria echoes this sentiment , suggesting that a retreat from global cooperation would be particularly detrimental to African countries facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa potentially facing a rollback in multilateral cooperation , which has been crucial in countering insurgencies across the continent . <p> On counterterrorism approach and regional stability , when he was president , his critics might describe Trump as having adopted a heavy-handed counterterrorism strategy , characterised by increased drone strikes and aggressive military actions -- targeted operations . While these tactics aimed at eliminating terrorist threats swiftly , they also risked fuelling further radicalisation among local populations . Researchers at ISS have pointed out that such an approach , if continued , could inadvertently serve as a recruitment tool for terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS . The prospect of heightened military interventions without a parallel focus on addressing underlying socio-economic issues may exacerbate instability , complicating the security landscape in North and Sub-Saharan Africa . <p> Any potential reduction in US engagement could exacerbate instability in regions like North and Sub-Saharan Africa , where local governments face significant challenges in combating insurgencies . The absence of robust US support might embolden terrorist groups , leading to increased violence and regional instability . This withdrawal could create a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might seek to fill , altering the balance of power in the region . The United States has historically played a critical role in supporting African countries ' security efforts , and its withdrawal could leave some countries vulnerable to the escalating threats posed by terrorist groups . <p> While the precise contours of a second Trump presidency remain speculative , it is clear that his approach to foreign policy and international engagement will have profound implications for Africa . The potential for reduced humanitarian aid , aggressive military tactics , and a retreat from multilateral cooperation could pose significant challenges for African countries .

@@110809232 <h> Sponsored Content <h> SPONSORED CONTENT <h> South Africa : A new chapter being written ? <h> Politics drove direction and sentiment in the South African government bond market in the second quarter of 2024 . <p> After a precipitous fall in ANC support at the May national elections ( with the ANC falling to 40% , well below the 43-47% base case many had expected ) , a government of national unity ( GNU ) path between the ANC and other parties tentatively began to be forged . This kickstarted what felt to investment market participants like a race against time , governed by the steady ticking of the procedural clock along Constitutionally laid out timelines , regardless of the hurdles different political parties attempted to throw in its path . <p> Given the tumult that SA investors have faced from political potholes in recent years , this steady ticking was somewhat comforting as this period of intense uncertainty was afforded only a limited timeline . Two material events culminated during the month of June -- firstly a statement of intent drafted primarily between the ANC , IFP and DA allowed for the election of the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitutionally prescribed 14-day period -- the first key hurdle passed . The second milestone was the ( eventual ) announcement of President Ramaphosa 's Cabinet at the end of June -- but only after a fortnight of intense negotiations between the ANC and DA and a public spat over positions to be held in the new administration . <p> These events created both euphoria and anxiety in the bond market -- yields initially weakened in early June as the ANC decided which parties to form an alliance with ( being initially a binary option of selecting a primary partner in either the DA or EFF , with markedly different potential outcomes for SA 's potential economic growth path and fiscal fortunes ) , then rallied strongly as the ANC 's centre held and a broad DA/IFP alliance instead initially began to take form . Bond yields had another leg of strength once it became clearer that the GNU partners would assume executive roles within the Cabinet . Heightened anxiety towards the end of June saw another shift weaker in the bond market ( as negotiations were beset by tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this weakness was unwound into the new month on the announcement of the finalised Cabinet appointments . <p> Looking at developments through a bond investor 's eyes , the rally ( move stronger ) in bond yields is fully justified when viewed through the potential virtuous circle of a continuation ( and possible acceleration ) in structural economic growth reforms , particularly with Operation Vulindlela ( OV ) remaining in the safe hands of both the Presidency and the well-respected Finance Minister ( with the reappointment of Enoch Godongwana to this role ) . Encouraging appointments to the Ministries of Home Affairs ( for visa reform ) ; DTIC ( a revitalised and well-crafted trade policy would be highly impactful on SA growth ) ; Communication ( another OV priority ) ; Electricity and Energy ( a more clearly defined and separated portfolio and key to continue the drive for SA 's energy security ) ; Police ( essential to erode the deteriorating crime and corruption backdrop ) and Transport ( important for the implementation of reforms in the logistics sector ) are all positive developments relative to the pre-election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stronger currency , improved inflation outlook , increase in domestic and foreign investor investment and portfolio flows , stronger economic growth and job creation , lower government funding costs , better fiscal revenues and a healthier government fiscal outlook -- this result would certainly sustain the current positive momentum in bond market sentiment over time . This effective virtuous cycle would also result in the long-held aspiration of inclusive growth , job creation and poverty reduction that has been the hope of all South Africans since the dawn of democracy . <p> There are of course many potential hurdles that could well result in this potential virtuous circle being either delayed or denied . With so many parties with such different political identities and personalities jostling for relevance , the most concerning near term obstacle could be ideological differences that abort the policy process and reform delivery from taking shape . The initial test of this will be the message received from the relevant parties as they emerge from the recently held Cabinet Lekgotla , which will form the basis of the State of the Nation address set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of priorities for the 7th administration will be guided by their alignment to the goals of the National Development Plan ( NDP ) ( Vision 2030 ) . Despite some commentators pointing to this as a stumbling block where conflict amongst parties over policy will play out we think this is likely overstated as the NDP is a broad vision plan we would expect the majority of parties to already largely embrace from a high level perspective . <p> The NDP was a thorough and comprehensive long-term national development document ( of almost 500 pages ) established more than a decade ago to advise the President and Cabinet on ambitious long-term development goals and was a product of the National Planning Commission led by former finance minister Trevor Manuel together with Cyril Ramaphosa . A refresh of the document is long overdue , but the plan 's key focus to lift economic growth , investment and employment to reduce poverty and inequality remains overarchingly relevant . The private sector is seen to play a major role in achieving these objectives and there is an important focus on building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lays out a vision for SA 's future , there is no need for Cabinet to craft new policy action plans to identify and implement the short list of urgent structural reforms required to grow SA 's economy . This is already in place under the enormously successful Operation Vulindlela ( OV ) -- a reform implementation task team set up as a joint venture between National Treasury and the Presidency which has already seen some key early successes in transforming our energy , transport and telecommunications sectors , with water infrastructure and visa reform also on its initial to-do list . <p> So , SA has already identified the ' what ' and the ' how ' necessary to fix the economy and create jobs . All that is now required is accelerated implementation -- and a refreshed GNU Cabinet with some healthy departmental competition may be exactly what is needed to energise policy reform and spur business confidence and investment , kickstarting the virtuous circle possible for a new South African chapter .

@@110809235 <h> An innovative health programme is making a difference in the lives of people in rural Eastern Cape communities . Spotlight spent time with the project , walking with ' nomakhayas ' from house to house and taking a ferry across the Xhora River . <p> In a thatched hut , halfway up a hill in the Wild Coast village of Nqileni , a young community health worker helps a frail , elderly man on to a portable scale . He suffered a stroke recently and has epilepsy , she explains , so it 's important to check on him regularly and ensure he 's taking his medication as prescribed . <p> While she assesses him , a second health worker speaks to the man 's wife , who is holding a baby . She pulls out a plastic bag , containing the family 's clinic cards , from beneath a mattress . <p> Another health worker unpacks a pile of toys from a backpack and invites the baby 's young aunt to join her on a mat on the floor with the baby . As they play , the health worker observes the baby to see how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives . Next , they weigh the baby , measure her height and check that her immunisations are up to date . <p> The sick often have to be transported in wheelbarrows to reach medical help . ( Photo : Black Star / Spotlight ) <p> There 's an air of familiarity and trust as we sit in the one-roomed home the health workers visit regularly . They conducted ante-natal and post-natal visits to the baby 's mother and monitored her mental wellness during and after her pregnancy ; they offered breastfeeding support and monitored the baby 's growth from birth . <p> We 've walked a good 20 minutes to this homestead , lying between rolling , grass-covered hills scattered with neat , colourful huts , past a small flock of sheep and across a stream . In the distance is the sea . From one perspective , it 's paradise here -- paradise minus jobs and basic amenities such as roads . <p> Community health workers , known as nomakhayas , on their home-based care rounds for the Bulungula Incubator .

We check that they 're adhering to medication . If we pick up that someone is unwell , we refer them to the Bulungula Health Point , " she explains . <p> The nomakhayas have also been trained to help people with disabilities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote community and have a " toolkit " to create awareness in the community about disabilities . <p> Nomakhayas and mothers at a village playgroup for toddlers which is held twice a week .

Earlier in the day , I joined the nomakhayas at a playgroup in the village , where mothers of children under three bring them twice a week for two hours . The children stack blocks and fit shapes together , sing songs and engage with their peers . <p> While the children play , the health workers talk to the mothers to check whether they have any problems , discuss health issues and keep tabs on the children 's development . <p> " These playgroups help build the relationship between mother and child . When they 're older , we want them to be able to tell their mothers what they are going through , " says Maleyile . <p> " These village children have been playing together since they were tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for numerous outreach programmes <p> The Bulungula Incubator 's main office is next to a preschool -- one of five managed by Bulungula . The bustling building is the hub of a number of the incubator 's local upliftment projects . Through a " preconception-to-career " approach , they run education and health and nutrition programmes , as well as promote sustainable livelihoods . <p> Amidst the buzz of adult activity around the hub , the sounds of children 's voices ring from the rondavels that serve as the preschool classrooms ; a smell of cooking comes from the kitchen in the main precinct -- Bulungula provides daily nutritious hot meals , including vegetables grown in their own gardens , to all children and staff . The children receive regular growth monitoring as well as deworming and vitamin A supplements . <p> Besides the health outreach , the early childhood development programmes and the five preschools , they manage a primary school maths programme , while Bulungula College -- with learners from more than 20 villages -- is the area 's first high school to offer matric as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts to over 100 villages . <h> Bulungula Health Point <p> The Bulungula Health Point .

Between 30 and 60 clients are seen at the health point per day . <p> Residents can access medical care , collect their HIV treatment or be tested for the virus and have other screenings . <p> It is staffed by two professional nurses and a mental health counsellor who are paid by the Bulungula Incubator with a contribution from the department of health . The nearest government clinic , Nkanya , is at least a two-hour walk from Nqileni and includes a ferry trip across the Xhora River , which can not be crossed after heavy rain . <p> Stories abound about the struggles patients faced before the Bulungula Health Point was set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls how , in 2021 , pregnant , she woke up feeling unwell and went straight there . <p> " They immediately picked up foetal distress and I was referred to Madwaleni Hospital , where I had an emergency C-section .

( Photo : Elliot Cousins / Spotlight ) <p> She continues : " Before we had the health point , it was not uncommon to see heavily pregnant women walking to Nkanya Clinic . Sometimes people would push them in wheelbarrows . It could take them a day to get there and back . <p> " A grandmother , who was HIV-positive , diabetic and on hypertension meds , had to walk to the Nkanya Clinic to get her medication .

Sister Bili stresses that the health point works " hand-in-hand " with the department of health on a range of campaigns . <h> A walk to the clinic <p> The next day , accompanied by a guide , we start the walk to Nkanya Clinic , which , for many years , was the nearest clinic for villagers on this side of the Xhora River . <p> The nurses at the health point have asked us to take some blood samples across to the clinic . We carry them in our backpacks and make our way down a steep pathway towards the river . <p> Guide Yonwaba Olo recalls how , when his grandfather became sick in 2009 , he took him to the clinic in a wheelchair . <p> " He could n't walk ...

With Olo translating , I ask him about some of his memories of rowing patients across the river . He recalls a time when a mother and a grandmother crossed the river , with the mother carrying a sick baby on her back . <p> " The baby was really struggling to breathe . I think the baby had asthma ... I wondered if the baby was even alive when they got off the ferry . <p> " Later that day , many hours later , they returned without the baby . They left the body behind . I felt very sad for that mother and grandmother . " <p> Once across the river , we walk in the heat through the hills , past many homesteads . After an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another stream with a small bridge over it and , a few kilometres on , we reach Nkanya Clinic . <p> Clinic manager Keka Soldati greets us warmly and takes the blood samples . She explains that Nkanya works closely with the Bulungula Health Point . " They 've taken a huge load off us , " she says . " The work we are doing together is saving many lives . " <p> Where it all started <p> Bulungula co-founder Dave Martin describes himself as a " general MacGyver " at the incubator . <p> Twenty-two years ago , after graduating with a Bachelor of Business Science from the University of Cape Town , Martin travelled on public transport through Africa to London and worked in the IT sector in the UK for three years , before travelling around Asia and South America for another two years . But all he wanted to do was return to South Africa and live in a Xhosa village . <p> As the head of a student-run NGO , the Students ' Health and Welfare Centre 's Organisation , in his final year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not finance but community development . <p> " In my holidays , I 'd jump on a bus and head north into east and central Africa . During those travels I realised my real love , where I felt most at home , was the rural African village life . " <p> On his return from his travels , in 2002 , he says he walked the beach , from Kei Mouth to Port St Johns on South Africa 's Wild Coast , looking for a place to call home and to start a community development enterprise . <p> " I had this idea to use tourism as a tool for community development in the rural areas , " he says . <p> Halfway into his walk , he found a derelict building and negotiated with the community , the local government and the then Department of Land Affairs for a permit to start a tourism lodge . <p> " The Bulungula Lodge -- a joint venture between the community and myself -- opened in 2004 . I ran it for 10 years , till 2014 , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Martin . <p> Not long after he moved to Nqileni , Martin met his wife Rejane Woodroffe in Cape Town . She is a financial analyst and economist who is also Bulungula 's executive director . <p> Bulungula Lodge expands to bigger projects <p> The Bulungula Lodge was doing well , creating jobs and winning awards for community development , but the couple soon realised there was more work to be done in Nqileni and beyond . <p> Woodroffe continues the story : " In 2006 , a third of the babies in this village died of diarrhoea . It was a very significant event . We had to do something , so we started raising money for water tanks . <p> " That same year , a local mud school , No-Ofisi Primary , collapsed , so we started raising money for a classroom . <p> " We realised we needed a non-profit entity to start doing all this work . I was still working in the finance industry and we put in some of our own money and registered a non-profit organisation . We raised about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We went from the crisis response to the water , to the education situation , and then we opened the first preschools . Then the home-based care came and as we were trying to solve the next problem , we encountered all the primary school gaps . Then there was no high school , so Bulungula College came . There was no grand plan ... it all just happened over time , " says Woodroffe . <p> Today , they have 130 permanent staff members and 50 interns -- about 180 people -- on the payroll , working on the various programmes on education , health , vibrant villages , sustainable livelihoods and farming . <p> " We cook almost 1,000 hot meals a day . It is quite an operation and our budget is around R20-million a year which we have to fundraise for . " <p> To raise funds , it is important to show the incubator 's impact . <p> Bulungula has implemented a tablet-based data collection system which the nomakhayas also use . All the information captured synchs with a database that helps measure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single individual can benefit from several of the incubator 's initiatives . <p> " A lot of people are interested in learning from our person-centred data model , " says Woodroffe . <p> ' Excellent relationship ' <p> Turning to the Bulungula Health Point , Woodroffe says it has been one of the real game changers for the community . The health point started when somebody donated a hut for them to run HIV support groups . <p> " The community loved what was happening so they built a small building using their own money and physical labour . We started running various health services and home-based care services , then eventually we hired a nurse , and added more and more services . Today it is fully renovated , has two fulltime nurses , an outreach nurse , mobile bus , a mental health component and a memorandum of understanding with the health department . " <p> " Our relationship with the department is excellent . They cover about 60 to 70% of the costs of our health programme now , " says Woodroffe . <p> " What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of the government . They come here and they give us free medication , even though we are not even an officially registered clinic ; they offer training for our nurses and our nomakhayas and they help us wherever they can . " <p> Martin is adamant that the success of the Bulungula Health Point would have been impossible without the ongoing support from local health officials , their " can do " attitude , and the strong bond of trust that has built up between Bulungula , the community and the department . <p> " A lot of the officials were once nurses ... I am regularly blown away by their passion to make a difference in these communities , " he says . <p> Defending government for not having built more clinics in the area , Martin continues : " How many clinics should there be in a place like this where it is just village after village after village , all needing roads ? The roads are a huge challenge . <p> " The challenge of the former Transkei is real in terms of the spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials who do n't care or incompetent officials who do care but ca n't do the job . <p> " The only way through it is to have this partnership approach where we realise there are limited resources and we 're all in it together . That 's what we 've got going in this part of the world and what we need on a national level , " he says . <p> ' Things are getting better ' <p> " I guess when you see progress , like we do , massively , here ... it makes one believe things are getting better . Even if one looks beyond one 's small community and looks further afield in the rural areas like ours ... as you drive around you see that in 2004 , the closest electricity wire to us was almost 30km away . That 's where the electricity grid ended . Now , as you drive through the villages , every single village has electricity . Similarly , taps and toilets . You see better schools , much better housing . <p> " Even looking at other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being na ? ve , and I know one can see the deterioration , particularly in some of the big metros like Joburg ... at the same time , the narrative that everything is falling apart is inaccurate . <p> " We need much more balanced reporting on what is happening in the country , " Martin says . " If one has that more balanced view , there are lots of reasons to be optimistic , " he adds . <h> DM168 <h> DM168 <p> We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits .

@@110809239 <h> Defend Truth <h> Opinionista <p> Sheena Swemmer is the head of the Gender Justice programme at the Centre for Applied Legal Studies , Wits University . <h> We contend that the inclusion of " consent " as a requirement for many sexual offences creates a disproportionate burden on the victims of sexual offences , the majority of whom are women . <p> When laws unfairly discriminate against a person or group of individuals , South African courts can declare them invalid and unconstitutional . In effect this means that the law is fixed , either by the court or by Parliament , ensuring it is constitutional and does not discriminate against anyone . <p> Discrimination occurs when a law or policy unjustifiably negatively affects an individual considered part of a protected group under section 9 of the Constitution -- the right to equality . The categories of protection under section 9 include race , gender , sex , and sexual orientation . <p> Discrimination can take two forms : direct or indirect . Direct discrimination includes laws or policies that explicitly impose burdens or withhold benefits from any person because the individual forms part of a protected group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the criminalisation of " sodomy " in the Sexual Offences Act from 1957 , where consensual sex between men was a crime in South Africa . The law , which was later found to be unconstitutional due to its discriminatory nature , was directly discriminatory as it criminalised consensual sex between men , as opposed to sex between men and women or women and women . <p> Indirect discrimination , on the other hand , occurs when a law or policy appears to be neutral but , in fact , adversely affects a disproportionate number of individuals from a certain protected group . <p> An example of this indirect discrimination would be in the recent case of Mahlangu v Minister of Labour , where the Constitutional Court found that the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act of 1993 was indirectly discriminatory as the act did not extend its protection to domestic workers . <p> As most domestic workers in South Africa are black women , their exclusion was not direct insofar as the act did not explicitly exclude black women from its ambit . However , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals who sat at the point of intersection of two protected categories , race and sex . <h> Disproportionate burden <p> On 22 and 23 July 2024 , the Centre for Applied Legal Studies ( Cals ) will argue before the Gauteng Division of the High Court in Pretoria that the definition of sexual offences , such as rape , are indirectly discriminatory . We contend that the inclusion of " consent " as a requirement for many sexual offences creates a disproportionate burden on the victims of sexual offences , the majority of whom are women . <p> Accordingto a study by the South African Medical Research Council ( SAMRC ) of cases of rape reported to the SAPS , 94.1% of victims were female , and 99% of perpetrators were male . <p> An issue that emerges along with women being the primary victims of rape is that in cases of rape , only 8.6% of cases are reported to the police resulting in the conviction of the perpetrator . Thus , in South Africa women are the primary victims of rape and will be exceedingly unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18.5% of victims who get to experience a trial against the perpetrator , the current definition of rape ( and other sexual offences ) will require them to give testimony of how they did not consent to their violation . <p> Because the current definition of rape requires " consent ' " to be absent for there to be a conviction , the absence of consent needs to be proven by the prosecution at the high threshold of being beyond a reasonable doubt . <h> Private spaces <p> Due to the nature of rape occurring in private spaces , often the evidence of the victim is the only testimony of the event ( often referred to as a " he said , she said " situation ) . Her evidence must show that the accused reasonably believed there was no consent . Thus , she must show how much she resisted the perpetrator so that he could understand that there was no consent . <p> Although our law does not explicitly require there to be physical resistance for there to be a guilty finding of rape , the requirement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt implicitly requires women to show the degree to which they conveyed to the perpetrator that they were not consenting to a sexual encounter . <p> The first prize would be if a woman physically fought off the man , as it would be less likely he could rely on mistakenly believing there was consent . <p> However , with the SAMRC reporting that victims physically resist rape in only 23.3% of cases of rape , many victims are being set up for failure by our criminal justice system , as proving resistance beyond a reasonable doubt rests predominantly on their evidence and whether the perpetrator reasonably believed there was consent . <h> Indirectly discriminatory <p> Why , though , is Cals arguing that the current formulation of sexual offences is indirectly discriminatory ? First , and as referenced above , women are disproportionately the victims of sexual offences , and so laws around sexual offences will disproportionately affect them . <p> Second , and most importantly , many other offences that do not have women as the primary victims of the crime do not require that the prosecution prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , of an assault , a man who is the victim of a physical attack by another man inside a bar does not have to show that he did not consent to being hit or punched . He is not asked if he physically or verbally resisted the attack . He is generally also not met with the response by the defence that his attacker was confused and mistook his lack of action as consent . <p> In crimes such as assault , proof of the lack of consent is not a requirement . The accused can raise it as a defence , yet bears the onus of proof , not the prosecution . <p> In conclusion , and as Cals will argue , when we have offences that do not have women as the primary victims requiring less evidence from the victim than offences such as rape , which disproportionately affect women and require inordinate evidence of a lack of consent , we have created laws that indirectly discriminate against women . <p> If we want to see laws exercised without discrimination and if we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement of consent in sexual offences is the correct avenue for achieving this outcome .

@@111112230 <h> A modern American gulag will remain standing , no matter who wins the upcoming election <h> Mass incarceration is now as much a part of the American landscape as Douglas firs or flowering dogwoods <p> All the way back in 1995 , when I was , as they say , FOTB ( fresh off the boat ) , a friend took me on a drive through the New York countryside . <p> I saw many new things : maple forests , riverside mansions , bright red barns . But what made the biggest impression was the jails . <p> We drove through one country town after another : Green Haven , Fish Kill , Beacon . On each town 's outskirts sat a vast , rectangular , concrete prison building , surrounded by electrified , barbed wire . <p> " Damn , this is a gulag ! " I told my friend . I was somewhat confused . I 'd fled apartheid South Africa for New York City , which felt to me , at the time , like freedom itself . But this place was much more " Sakhalin Island . " <p> Nor was my gulag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States imprisons 531 per 100,000 adults -- a similar rate to police states like Cuba , Rwanda and North Korea . <p> An outdoor exhibit at the Eastern State Penitentiary shows the shocking rise in the incarceration rate since 1970 , with only a slight reduction in the 2010s . ( Photo : Glen Retief ) <p> For context , this is more than double South Africa 's rate , either under democracy or apartheid . It is almost 10 times that of democracies like Germany or India . <p> Black Americans ' current rate is 1,156 per 100,000 adults . Statistically , we are a mere stone 's throw from Stalin , probably history 's most enthusiastic incarcerator , at about 1,500 out of every 100,000 Russians who were behind bars when he died in 1953 . <h> Why so many prisoners ? <p> Why so many prisoners ? Many Americans believe that the cause is high crime rates . Yet law-breaking in the US is n't particularly common , and most people who go to jail do so for minor drug infractions , like being caught on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most influential academic theory for mass incarceration has been offered by former Stanford professor and human rights lawyer Michelle Alexander . <p> In The New Jim Crow , Alexander notes that mass imprisonment in the US dates from 1982 , when then president Ronald Reagan declared war on illegal drugs . She links this to the deindustrialisation of US cities at the time , leading to unemployment and addiction , as well as a white backlash after the civil rights movement . <p> Alexander posits that mass incarceration is a way for white America to maintain its dominance , via biased drug laws and enforcement . For example , it is illegal to racially discriminate in jobs , housing , or voting . Yet some states deny former convicts the right to vote , and it is perfectly legal to refuse someone a job or flat based on a criminal record . <p> Some prisons even charge inmates for accommodation . A few years ago , I visited the Northumberland County Jail , around the corner from my house in small-town Sunbury , Pennsylvania . <p> This was the administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prison was designed with a hub and spokes format , to allow intense monitoring of the prisoners . ( Photo : Glen Retief ) <p> " How about a personal finance class ? " asked the warden , when I expressed an interest in volunteer teaching in the jail . " These guys have to pay the county back for their accommodation , you know , and they have no idea how to budget . " <p> Turns out that for their forced stays on thin mattresses in cramped , freezing cells , by law inmates owed Northumberland County $50 a night after they were released , which was about the same amount of money -- at the time -- as a midrange motel room . <h> Vast , Orwellian system <p> In 2023 , the journal of the American Bar Association detailed a vast , Orwellian system whereby US states and counties attempt to recoup from inmates ' families the costs of their imprisonment . <p> These range from prisoners ' salaries of $0.50 an hour , to $1 charges for emails , to extortionate commissary prices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick deodorant . <p> In practice , this means that prisoners ' families simply get pushed deeper into poverty , reinforcing , in the view of civil rights activists like Alexander , the hierarchies that have defined American history . <p> I wanted to better understand US incarceration , so I signed up for a tour of Eastern State Penitentiary . A vast , sprawling prison museum located on the outskirts of Philadelphia , when Eastern State opened in 1829 , this penitentiary was the toast of the global prison reform movement , and its design influenced thousands of later prisons . <p> Among its marvels : it was also the first prison ever built aimed at inspiring repentance , hence the name penitentiary . And second , it was the first prison that was dedicated entirely to what would later become one of the most severe punishments inflicted on US prisoners : solitary confinement . <p> Now I happen to be a Quaker , meaning that I am a member of a religious society that worships by sitting in silence , listening to one 's inner voice -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action based on gleaned insights . <h> Solitary confinement <p> Eighteenth and nineteenth century Quakers imagined that solitary confinement could , like prayer and meditation , heal and improve a tortured psyche . Therefore , from 1776 onwards , Quakers were one of the chief forces lobbying to make solitary confinement part of American imprisonment . <p> George Cruikshank 's 1818 engraving depicting the chaos at Newgate Prison , in London . The designers of Eastern State Penitentiary were trying to create a calmer environment more conducive to penitence . ( Photo : Glen Retief ) <p> Appropriately enough , then , I arrive on a Sunday morning almost exactly at the time my fellow Quakers are attending their worship meetings . My tour guide , whom I 'll call James , is a skinny , bearded hipster wearing a beanie . He starts us off at a poster of George Cruikshank 's famous 1818 painting , " Newgate Prison Discipline " . <p> " This is what the prison reformers were reacting against , " James tells us . " Chaos , fights , Lord of the Flies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's throats , while others dance on a table . It looks scary and disorienting . But it also looks decidedly human -- flawed , lively , and compelling . <p> The same can not be said for the cellblock we visit next , a stark passage with solitary cells on either side . Admittedly , these cells are decrepit . Chunks gape in the walls , the toilets are stopped up with dust , and the narrow overhead skylights -- a key innovation meant to direct inmates ' eyes to the heavens to facilitate spirituality -- are coated with muck . <p> Still , as I step inside , the claustrophobic enclosure is overwhelming . I ask a fellow tourist to bang the metal-grate cell door behind me , which he does . In the 1830s , aside from a single , ten-minute meeting a day with a prison official or chaplain , after I heard that door slam , I would have been here in silence , with only my own thoughts . <p> Food and water would have been pushed through an opening . Guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to catch prisoners talking or signalling . Even exercise was silent , in a solitary courtyard attached to each cell . <h> No meetings or communal work <p> There were no meetings or communal work of any kind . If a prisoner got taken anywhere , James now explains -- say , when they first came inside , or later to see a doctor -- they were hooded to prevent them from being identified , and therefore subject to discrimination after they were released . <p> Reading material was only a reward for good behaviour , and even then , consisted only of the Bible and a limited list of approved religious texts . <p> Charles Dickens visited Eastern State in 1842 . What he saw shocked him . He later wrote , " I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body ; and because its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh ... the more I denounce it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells fell into severe disrepair , and most remain that way today . ( Photo : Glen Retief ) <p> Upon release , inmates apparently stood , shivering , on street corners , lost and confused , incoherent and afraid when someone tried to talk to them . <p> A less extreme version of a related phenomenon : in our neighbouring town , Lewisburg , near a large federal jail , it is common to see newly released prisoners on the street , trying to make sense of cellphones , ATMs , and automated check-out counters . <p> It took decades for universal solitary confinement to be abandoned at Eastern State Penitentiary . Since the 2010s , the US prison population has shrunk only modestly , due mostly to the rise of electronic " house arrest " bracelets -- judicial penalties that still leave wearers with criminal records . <p> Religious organisations , including Quaker ones , have condemned solitary confinements , yet still , at any given moment , more than 80,000 US prisoners will be subjected to it . <p> What will it take to turn the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2024 elections suggest any real interest in the mass release of prisoners . <p> The former proposes only modest reforms like a scaling back of cash bail , while the latter calls for the government to " stop the migrant crime epidemic " , " crush gang violence " and " lock up violent offenders " . <p> As for the candidates : Trump promises to detain 15 million undocumented workers , while Harris , if nominated , is likely to run as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor . <p> Faced with all this , in South Africa , prisoners could at least cast votes from their cells , perhaps for a small party interested in restorative justice . <p> Here in the US , though , almost nobody behind bars can vote , no matter what got them there . And mass incarceration remains as much a feature of our landscape as Douglas firs or flowering dogwoods .

@@111112231 <h> Defend Truth <h> Opinionista <h> The return to respectability of the honourable profession of bank robbing <p> Ashwin Desai is Professor of Sociology at the University of Johannesburg and author of ' Reverse Sweep : A Story of South African Cricket Since Apartheid ' . <h> Tshifhiwa Matodzi , head honcho of VBS bank , went one better than Butch Cassidy , the Sundance Kid and Gayton McKenzie . He knew that it was better to start a bank than to rob one . The EFF and the SACP went one better than starting a bank -- they secured " donations " from VBS . <p> " Love God and sin boldly " -- Martin Luther . <p> In the 1970s , deep in Durban 's Casbah , movie houses dominated the narrow streets . Queues snaked around the Raj Cinema and the enormous Shah Jehan with its double headers on a Saturday . <p> Inside we left the playground streets and entered another world . Our hero was John Wayne , who we often saved by warning of cunning Indians lurking in the shadows . <p> But as we hovered on the edge of our teens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So taken were we with him that the phrase for someone smart and streetwise was " he is a Dillinger " . The scene in which Dillinger gets shot as he leaves the theatre haunts me till today . <p> Another movie that captured our ( im ) moral imaginations was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . How beautiful were Robert Redford and Paul Newman ? Strong but vulnerable . We urged them on in the front row as bugs bit our bums and those in the back rows slipped their hands over a date 's shy shoulder . <p> And , of course , in the papers we had our homegrown bank robber , Andr ? Stander . A policeman , he would rob a bank at lunchtime and return later to the scene as an investigating officer . <p> Convicted bank robber <p> I felt like I was back at the Shah Jehan 50 years ago watching Parliament on Mandela Day . There was Gayton McKenzie , convicted bank robber . A man who has sanitised criminality like no one before . The one-liner to Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Noahian gem . <p> Like puffed-up pastry , he took the platform to castigate ex-judge John Hlophe . Hlophe wants Roman-Dutch law consigned to the dustbin of history . But Gayton pointed to the hypocrisy . Before Hlophe was impeached as a judge , he carried out the diktats of the very law upon which he now spews venom . <p> More than that , Gayton , tongue firmly in cheek , wants to pay for the appeals of those whom Hlophe convicted because the former judge has now confessed that he sentenced them based on laws he does not believe in . <p> This leaves Hlophe in the unenviable position of apartheid 's hanging judges . Their refuge , after Mandela was released , was to intone that they were only applying the laws of the government of the day . <p> An ex-convict lecturing an ex-judge about the law . Teasing and humiliating him . It produced pandemonium in the House . Hlophe looked like he had just been impeached again . It was left to Mbuyiseni Ndolozi , the EFF PhD , to try to reclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the judge has written papers on it , " he proclaimed , but it was too late . <p> Behind him , resplendent in tailored red overalls sat other alleged " bank robbers " . Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu . They were apparently caught in a trap set by one Tshifhiwa Matodzi , head honcho of VBS Bank . <p> Reading his affidavit , you see a man who knew how to deal with criticism . He simply paid . Not only did his critics stop , they switched and sang his bankrupt praises . You see , Matodzi was one better than Butch and Sundance and Gayton . He knew that it was better to start a bank than to rob one . The Guptas knew this , too . <h> Surplus value <p> The SA Communist Party also split some VBS loot . The party , which likes to sing " my mother was a domestic worker , my father was a garden boy " , took money from those stealing from their parents . At the SACP conference , sponsored by VBS , resolutions piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they screeched , of capitalists who buy favours from politicians . <p> The EFF , they of superior logic , and the SACP , they of superior ideology , had it all figured out . They have gone one better than starting a bank -- they cottoned on to securing donations from banks . Like the construction mafia , they have seized upon the means of protection . <p> Gayton 's real Damascus turn comes atop the bony mare of life . He tells us that his change came from witnessing a teenaged white boy gang-raped by 20 inmates . The boy was placed there by corrupt warders . <p> " The next morning , as I was about to step over the teenager , he looked at me , asked for help and called me ' Sir ' ... from that time on life has never been the same . " <p> Many of us change because we read texts . We read from Marx that the gravedigger of capitalism is the working class . And so we become workerists . <p> And that is why , under adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into being accumulators of capital through the dispossession of the gravediggers . For us it 's a textual affair , justifiable in words . A lifestyle perhaps . A way to stand out from the better footnoted , escape our station , salve our neuroses and excuse our psychoses . <p> Gayton is a character out of a story older than Marxism in South Africa . He comes from the line of Nongoloza , who through the Anglo-Boer War and into the first decades of the twentieth century , pitted himself against government-fired lead and manacle steel . <h> Power relationships <p> Charles van Onselen reveals the link between Nongoloza 's Ninevites and the prison gangs of today . In a 1985 article , he tells us that " prison gangs may have the most crudely developed ideas about power relationships within wider society , but there is no denying they do manifest some degree of political consciousness ... " . <p> Prophetic . <p> Gayton comes from this tradition . The Number . In prison you are a 26 or a 28 . The 27 's are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the 26s and 28s . There 's also a numbers game in Parliament , and while Gayton knows how to roll the dice , the novice EFF and MK party fell short . <p> Unlike Nongoloza 's Ninevites , the EFF 's present leadership are not for the long haul . They 're textual revolutionaries . That 's why Hlophe 's supposed written critique of Roman Dutch Law could excuse him in sending black people down for property crimes or excuse him evicting them from African land in Ndlozi 's doctored view . No , the red overalls wear or show a sartorial slogan . Soon , washed over by common law , the red overalls will fade into orange , the camouflage uniforms fatigued by the hypocrisy of it all . <p> Then what for them ? <p> Except for the curiosity of advocates about each other 's fees , no other bunch of crooks are as interested in their colleagues ' work as prisoners are . " What are you in for ? " , is a question on the whole jail 's lips . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status <p> But on the other end of jailbird status , somewhere right near the top , are the bank robbers . They are seen as brave bandits who ventured the classic crime . Although they are criminals , there 's something frank about their violence . Storming in , bodies on the line , grabbing value that shareholders and insurers will lose . That 's why so many bank robbers are celebrated as bosses in jail . <p> However , much lower down the Order of Hoods , sharing showers with the kiddie-fiddlers , are the conmen . These are the cheats who swindle coins from their own grannies ' hands . Or even worse , the planted shills , who pretend all is above board while the crime unfolds . <p> Those who mock and expose Gayton are really angered that he is inside the Government of National Unity and they are outside . They are exposed outside . Not exposed as crooks , but as people without the guts to be really epic crooks . Conning villagers , not robbing banks . Unlike Gayton , their reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he owns his history . Even worse for them he has written books . There is the Hustler 's Bible ; Hustler 's Bible 2 : The New Testament ; and the latest titled From Prison to the Promised Land : Chapter and Verse . <p> The secret ingredient in his life may well still turn out to be crime . But if and when he uses politics to pull a heist , I have a feeling Gayton will do his Number proud . Maybe nationalise an industry , not cover up the theft of grannies ' pensions .

@@111112237 <h> The EU remains a key partner across the African continent , and the cost of straying too far into the arms of less savoury partners like Russia and China will not go unnoticed . We need a sober reassessment of what best serves our interests . <p> Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orb ? n paid a few hard-to-miss , high-level , surprise visits to celebrate the start of his country 's chairmanship of the European Union . <p> Flying first to Kyiv for a sit-down with UkrainePresident Volodymyr Zelensky , this was quickly followed by a visit to his political friends Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping of China . Orb ? n dubbed this obvious exercise of power-play diplomacy a " peace mission " . <p> The response from Brussels was swift and stern : anear universal distancing by member states of his antics , and a clear sanction . As a sign of no-tolerance by the European Union , the prestigious meeting of European Union foreign and defence ministers -- set to be held in Budapest at the end of August -- has been moved to Brussels . <p> Russia , the aggressor , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace terms . That Orb ? n lends himself to voicing Russia 's and China 's position on the war in Ukraine is not only wrong , it 's a mistake that harms Hungary 's interests . <h> European Union funding <p> Orban may walk away from his meetings in Moscow and Beijing with a few good photoshoots , but the vast weight of Hungary 's trade balance is European , and his country is a major recipient of European Union funding -- neither of which is likely to change . <p> There is a cautionary tale here for leaders of African companies and countries . The European Union remains a key partner across the African continent , and the cost of straying too far into the arms of less savoury partners like Russia and China will not go unnoticed . We need a sober reassessment of what best serves our interests . <p> If we consider the broader " African " position , if such a thing can be said to exist , our interests lie in the European Union . What we have , they need . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They face an imminent collapse of healthcare , and have a growing need for people and technology to meet that need . We have economic growth potential , in need of reliable capital , while the European Union exhibits low and slow growth rates and has capital looking for growth . <p> Finally , the European Union relies on African partners for the minerals to fuel their transition to a cleaner and greener economy . This joint interest means that African countries and companies should be relentlessly promoting the natural symbiotic relationship between the two regions . <h> Strategic perspective <p> China , on the other hand , has no need for our human capital -- it is dealing with its own youthunemployment challenge . So , from a strategic perspective , that sets us up for a win-lose situation , as we compete with China for jobs . <p> There are also long-standing questions around the lack of skills transfer to African labour in majorinfrastructure projects , potentially unsustainable debt levels , and concern regarding African countries being called to host Chinese defence and military posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " no limits " , some boundaries should be welcomed . Notably questions of human rights should always be respected , and partnerships that foster stability should be favoured over partisan and polarising global relations . <p> However uncomfortable the comparison might seem , we are like Orb ? n . Our interests lie in Europe . And while there needs to be a broader conversation and strengthening of those relationships , this will not be achieved if Africa is seen to engage with Russia 's and China 's courtship . <p> I was recently asked at a European Union policy discussion forum " why does n't Africa speak up " ? Look where things stand ; the US is distracted with internal wrangling and navel gazing . China is preoccupied with security in the region and squabbles with Nato . Russia is entangled in its unjust war . <h> Why does Africa not set the tone ? <p> So , the question is justified , why does Africa not set the tone and decide the direction of the conversation ? Why not invite the European Union to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , show leadership , and build a renewed partnership with greater vigour and engagement ? <p> It seems we are waiting , with the notion that Africa should be courted by the European Union , relationships should be fostered , kind words shared , and friendship bracelets made . <p> But if we want to be treated as equals , why not take charge ? The lessons from Orb ? n are that the European Union members are losing patience and are increasingly willing to act to show their disapproval . By essentially arranging for a boycott by ministers of Hungary 's foreign affairs summit , the European Union is critical in a very public way . <p> The message is clear , and we face a choice . Follow Orb ? n into the abyss , or build for the African future we want with the European Union as more reliable partners .

@@111112238 <p> I was late for a meeting with a client in Victoria Falls , a visit that inadvertently involved bumping into a friend from the Philippines -- who did n't know that he needed a second wedding ring -- and a jet boat over the rapids to a lodge on an island . Which might have had something to do with a search for a bird known as Schalow 's turaco . <p> To the disinterested , Schalow 's turaco looks much the same to the avifaunal-misinformed as the Knysna or Purple-crested turaco , a nevertheless beautiful creature with a distinctive call . <p> To birding enthusiasts however , this creature is a " special " -- as the bird location map below shows . <p> Birdlife on Chundu Island beach ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> I was on Chundu Island as part of a mission to design a safari highlighting some of the more exquisite parts of Zimbabwe 's Matabeleland North province -- a region that includes Victoria Falls and Hwange National Park -- and the only part of the country that most people think of visiting . <p> If we take the final safari as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final compilation make up the chapters . And the first one started at speed . <p> " You have to approach Chundu by jet boat " , said Jann Kingsley , co-owner Chundu Island lodge , fully aware that I have experienced many aspects of Victoria Falls over the years . So much for said experience , however , because I had never heard of the boat . <h> Upriver sprint <p> An aerial photograph of Chundu Island and the sundowner ferryboat on the Zambezi River ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> Eric Chisombi , one of Chundu Island 's two boat pilots , ferrying us to the mainland for our morning walk in in Zambezi National Park . Leopard spoor and warthog and baboon skulls were on the menu . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> 35 minutes later , departing from a short way from where the Zambezi plunges over the Victoria Falls , I knew a little more about it . <p> I knew it was an upriver sprint requiring the skill of the Mushamboza family of pilots , in this case represented by Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught the ways of the river by his father . <p> Apart from a great white-water expedition rafting rapids with names like Tumble Dryer and Washing Machine about 20 years ago ( which involved the requisite periods travelling upside down , i.e. under water ) , my experience of the river ever since has been pretty much of the large , lazy and languid type . <p> Even elephants crossing the river is a slow , almost graceful experience . <p> Jet boat pilots Arnold Mushamboza , pictured , and his father are among a select few with intimate knowledge of riding the rapids above the Victoria Falls . It is another way of getting to your chosen Zambezi island or riverbank accommodation . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> But this ride with Arnold was a little bit thrilling . <p> It 's obviously all relative , but even if you have much experience of this deceptively fast-moving river , cornering the rapids with Arnold -- a beaming grin wrapped around his face beneath the sunglasses -- gives a taste of what it feels like to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to navigate the river 's tricky rapids by his father -- he says they 've broken many propellers -- they are the team that delivers guests to the various camps upriver . <p> Ramping over rapids like salmon swimming upstream , we turn in broad arcs as we gracefully broadside from one country 's riverbank to the next . <p> Contemporary designer lodges and safari camps flash past on both sides of the river , Zimbabwe to the south , Zambia to the north , and the odd island in between . <p> Hippos wink , crocodiles slip off their spits of sand , and a squadron of African skimmers swoop past , with a bank of cumulonimbus clouds building behind as the sun starts to nod off . It is indescribably beautiful . <h> Africa 's appeal <p> For travellers who often emerge from a land where clouds and wet grey skies push blue-sky sunshine to the edge of the frame , Africa 's appeal is all too clear . <p> For travellers who often emerge from a land where clouds and wet grey skies push blue-sky sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all too clear . It spoke to me when I hopped off the boat at Chundu Island , about a kilometre in length and 400m wide , with Zambia on the northern bank behind and Zimbabwe in front to the south . <p> Dardley Tafuruka , the concession manager at Chundu Island lodge , has a big presence and a large voice . With a sweep of his hand , after waving goodbye to Arnold and his sidekick , he declares the island to be mine . <p> " At least for the next two days , all our guests checked out this morning . " <p> So the long pool was mine . I could even do my ashtanga yoga routines on the island 's beach , right in front of the lodge deck -- a highlight not found on similar island lodges . <p> The same beach where pelicans , skimmers , storks and knob-billed ducks line up for absurdly long sunning sessions in the morning , and where I saw a bushbuck dance the slowest , most curious tango around a long , corpse-like crocodile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of watching wild birds in their natural environment " . Stretching that a little laterally to the wingtips , a " special " means the bird is either endemic to the area , is rarely seen or is hard to see . Schalow 's turaco is that bird in these parts . <p> I heard it a lot , sometimes in mid-afternoon , but mostly in the early morning , when the light would kiss the riverine forest for the first time . On one specific morning when I went to look specifically for Schalow 's turaco , not all the hippos had returned to the river , with one in particular tearing metronomically at the grass outside my tent . <p> Easing the zip open ever so slowly , tooth by tooth , I tip-toed behind its backside ( the hippo ) , relatively relaxed in that I was n't between this riverhorse and its river . " Relatively " because the scene of one of them thundering into Zambia 's Luangwa river at about 40km/h from a few years previous was fresh in my mind . <p> Chundu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambia is to the left , Zimbabwe to the right , with hippos , crocodiles and elephant in between . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <h> Distinctive call <p> Regardless , despite hearing and following its distinctive call -- as soon as I reached the spot where I thought it to be , it was gone -- I could n't find the bird . Which was a bit disappointing , as I 'd had good fortune a couple years ago when seeking out Pel 's fishing owl on Tsowa Safari Island , a few kilometres upriver . <p> What I did have were first-light song contests between family flocks of southern boubous and palm-collared thrush , with a yellow-throated apalis and bearded woodpecker getting in the odd peep , all capped off by the baby-like crying of the trumpeter hornbill pair in the tree next to my tent . <p> I was having such fun ticking off this list that I momentarily felt that if it was n't for my tent , I could have imagined myself in the land that time forgot . That is until Christoph Ndlovu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chundu , strode past , heading for the kitchen with a stainless steel implement under his arm . <p> Crowned hornbills on Chundu island . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> That steel thread was carried through to the sundowner cruise , where Dardley used his tongs to drop the ice into my glass . <p> Just by dint of the number of years I 've lived , I have been fortunate to witness many unforgettable sunsets around the globe , the most memorable almost always in the bushveld and near significant bodies of water . Greece and Cape Town are right up there . But if I was pushed to declare my best , it would probably be the Zambezi River . With its " props " of statement afternoon storm clouds , flocks flying home just above the water , both riverbanks lined with towering trees , accompanied by the soundtrack of the clich ? d African bush , the ingredients are pretty much unbeatable . <p> Sunrise , in contrast , never invites one to linger , in a hurry to get on with a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that invitation on the second of my two mornings . Eric the boat skipper dropped us early ( to beat the late November heat ) on the Zimbabwean riverbank after coffee and a rusk , and we set off walking into the Zambezi National Park . <p> It was quiet on this particular piece of mainland , with bleached skeletons and bones in dark , hard-baked cotton-soil complemented by snap-dry fledgling mopane trees and the fresh , not-quite-cleaned skull of a baboon some way off from leopard tracks . Even the birds were quiet . <h> Solitude , quiet and wilderness <p> Being surrounded by such solitude , quiet and wilderness is an exclusive experience impossible to describe to a first-time safari client from a crowded world city , especially those in the Global North . <p> I thought of that when we passed a warthog waiting to cross the road as we entered Victoria Falls town , soon after we 'd passed a very young male elephant doing the testosterone dance while his family browsed on the bushes . <p> He made us late for my meeting , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Walk , a collection of standout galleries , workshops and people stories , all connected by wildlife . <p> This is where Obert Monga , an artist based at Elephant Walk shopping precinct , Victoria Falls , creates palm ivory pendants , and Moses Kalembela creates baobab magic on elephant dung paper . Where Joe Mutoko , the head silversmith at the Ndau Collection , leads his team , and where his daughter Tariro crafts jewellery from poachers ' snares -- an initiative known as Mopane Snare Wire -- recovered from the park we 'd just left . <p> Obert Monga and Moses Kalembela are two premium artists working out of the art precinct in Victoria Falls ' Elephant Walk shopping village . Palm ivory pendants with detailed inlays and scrimshaw and baobab magic on elephant dung paper are their respective fort ? s . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> When not creating his jewellery , Obert Monga is mentoring the young women creating jewellery from poachers ' snares recovered from the nearby national park . ( Photo : Angus Begg ) <p> And this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd previously shot documentaries in Mozambique and Hwange National Park , and Aaron had fallen in love with the country . So when I bumped into him and his wife , newly married , there in Elephant 's Walk , I knew they 'd love the Mopane story as much as the jewellery . The fact that they already had a ring did n't seem to matter . <h> Comments <p> Nice little expos ? Angus , the Zambezi , as you know , is a very special river -- I was just there a few weeks ago , and hope the tourism economy bounces back quickly ; I think it 's still reeling from COVID and a few other effects . However , no Southern Boubou 's to be found in those parts -- sorry you missed the Turaco but I 'm sure her auditory stimulation to your ears was as enticing as it was beautiful to hear ! <p> A new book by world authority Keith Barnes has recently been published titled Birds of Greater Southern Africa .

@@111397239 <h> E-commerce hubs drive up air pollution <p> An unexpected side effect of e-commerce is the increase in air pollution -- particularly nitrogen oxide -- around warehousing hubs . <p> This is among the findings a new study , funded by NASA and published in Nature , that aimed to measure the air pollution associated with proliferating e-commerce and warehousing industries in the US . <p> The study used datasets of warehouse locations , traffic , and satellite observations of the traffic-related pollutant nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) to evaluate the air quality and environmental equity impacts of these geographically-dispersed emission sources . <p> The net result is that the almost 150 000 warehouses in the US worsen local traffic-related air pollution with an average near-warehouse NO2 enhancement of nearly 20% . <p> Near-warehouse truck traffic and NO2 significantly increase as warehouse density and the number of warehouse loading docks and parking spaces increase . <p> The research concluded that there is a need for indirect source rules , incentives for replacing old trucks , and corporate commitments towards electrification . <p> uture ground-based monitoring campaigns may help track impacts of individual or small clusters of facilities . Introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for warehouse receiving , sorting , and fulfillment facilities1,2,3,4,5,6 . The transportation infrastructure needed to redistribute goods among these facilities and deliver them to retail centers or consumers is enormous . For example , in 2021 , Amazon , an industry leader in retail e-commerce , operated around 175,000 delivery vans and more than 37,000 semi-trailers in the U.S. , with increased fleet growth expected in the future . Warehousing and goods movement increase traffic-related air pollutants , including nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and fine particulate matter1,7 . These pollutants are associated with pediatric asthma development , cardiovascular disease , premature death , and other health impacts8 and disproportionately affect communities with relatively lower income and racial and ethnic minorities9,10 . Concerns about air pollution around warehouses in Southern California spurred the South Coast Air Quality Management District to issue the Warehouse Indirect Source Rule , requiring that warehouses greater than 100,000 square feet directly reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides ( NOX ) and diesel particulate matter11 . Similar rulings are being considered in other U.S. states such as New York12 and Colorado13 . Yet , no study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential environmental equity implications of warehousing on a nationwide basis . Shearston and colleagues1 observed increased truck traffic and small increases in air and noise pollution following the opening of a warehouse in New York City . A recent report examining the warehousing industry in ten U.S. states determined approximately 15 million people live within approximately 1 ? km of warehouses , and the Black , Latino , Asian , and American Indian populations are overrepresented among these fenceline populations2 . Here we provide a comprehensive nationwide study examining traffic , associated air pollution , and environmental equity near warehouses in the contiguous U.S. We colocated warehouse locations from a proprietary dataset , CoStar , with space-based measurements of the traffic-related air pollutant NO2 from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument ( TROPOMI ) , high-resolution NOX emissions estimates , traffic data from the Highway Performance Monitoring System , and demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau ( Section 4 ) . Results can enable policymakers at the local , state , and national levels to better understand and address the health-harming air pollution associated with this burgeoning industry . Results As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with nearly 20% of these warehouses located in just ten , or 0.3% of , counties : Los Angeles , California ; Harris , Texas ; Cook , Illinois ; Miami-Dade , Florida ; Maricopa , Arizona ; San Bernardino , California ; Orange , California ; Dallas , Texas ; Alameda , California ; and Cuyahoga , Ohio ( Figure S1 ) . Using a per capita measure of warehouses to make direct comparisons across counties , we found a large number of warehouses per capita in major urban areas but also in some rural areas ( Fig. 1A and Supplementary Data 1 ) . Several of these rural areas are colocated with gas and oil extraction , and warehouses per capita in these areas can be greater than in highly urbanized counties ( e.g. , Williams County , North Dakota , near the Bakken formation , has 127 warehouses per 100,000 compared with 65 per 100,000 in Los Angeles County ) .

Gray shading in ( B ) denotes the dates of U.S. recessions as inferred by a gross domestic product-based recession indicator57 . Full size image The number of new warehouses constructed annually has decreased over the last four decades , roughly consistent with U.S. domestic economic activity ( Fig. 1B ) . Warehouse construction accelerated in the 2010s as the U.S. economy recovered from the 2007-2008 financial crisis with an 117% increase in the total number of warehouses built between 2021 and 2010 . New warehouses built during this period were significantly larger in size , had a greater ability to handle traffic ( as indicated by the significant increase in the number of loading docks and parking spaces ) , and tended to be built in census tracts containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; Fig. 1C-F ) . Among the most dramatic changes between 2010 and 2021 was the 400% increase in the median number of loading docks at new warehouses . We created a composite of near-warehouse satellite-derived NO2 averaged over all warehouses in the continental U.S. in 2021 ( Fig. 2A ) . The near-warehouse area was defined as the ? ? 7 grid cells ( ? 7 ? km ) extending in each cardinal direction from the warehouse using the TROPOMI NO2 grid . To estimate the impact of warehouse-related activity on nearby NO2 pollution , we calculated the warehouse-related NO2 enhancement as the relative difference between wind direction-adjusted NO2 averaged over the upwind orthogonal edge of the composite and the maximum NO2 level in the composite , which is displaced ? 4 ? km downwind of warehouses on average ( Fig. 2A ) . Here , the upwind orthogonal edge refers to the fourteen grid cells on the upwind edge ( left side ) of the composite . Since the composite was formed with wind direction-adjusted TROPOMI measurements , we expect NO2 levels averaged over this upwind orthogonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach we find that activities near warehouses are associated with a 17.9% increase in NO2 on average across the continental U.S. The ? 4 ? km displacement between NOX emission sources ( i.e. , warehouses ) and peak NO2 occurs for other NOX sources14 and likely stems from most NOX ( 90-95%15 ) being emitted as NO and thereafter oxidizing to form NO2 generally within minutes depending on available oxidants and meteorological conditions16 . Although NO2 distance-decay gradients are small ( &lt; ? 1 ? km17,18 ) , peak levels of satellite-measured NO2 can occur several km downwind of NOX sources or source regions19,20,21 , consistent with our findings in Fig. 2A .

B Same interpretation and statistical analysis as Fig. 2B , but near-warehouse NO2 levels are binned by near-warehouse daily truck VKT for low , medium , and high population density environments . Full size image NOX sources and NO2 levels are inequitably distributed among different racial-ethnic groups10,22,23,24 , and we investigated whether warehouses and associated NO2 were consistent with these previous findings . Compared with national median demographics , tracts with warehouse(s) had a larger Hispanic population ( by 59.7% ) , Black or African American population ( by 69.5% ) ; Asian , Native Hawaiian , or Pacific Islander population ( by 50.9% ) ; and population identifying as some other race or two or more races ( by 31.5% ) in 2021 ( Fig. 4A ) . As the number of clustered warehouses increased , the proportions of racial-ethnic minorities also increased . In the top ten percent of tracts with the most warehouses , the proportion of the Hispanic population was nearly 240% higher ( 28.1% versus 8.3% ) and the Asian population nearly 290% higher than U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces , loading docks , and building areas were generally linked with a larger proportion of racial-ethnic minorities , although not for every population subgroup ; for example , the proportion of the Black or African Americans population increased with additional loading docks and greater building area but decreased with additional parking spaces ( Figure S8 ) . The nationwide disparities in Fig. 4A largely hold for individual U.S. states , although the proportion of racial-ethnic minorities in tracts with warehouse(s) is smaller than the state median in a few states ( e.g. , Idaho , Montana ; Figure S9 ) . These states are largely rural and historically tend to have fewer racial-ethnic minority populations , which both could contribute to these findings . We encourage future , state-specific studies that provide further context to demographic patterns of warehouse siting . Fig. 4 : Disparities in the racial-ethnic composition of the near-warehouse population . <p> A The relative difference in the racial and ethnic composition of census tracts containing warehouses and the overall U.S. median demographics . This difference is calculated for all tracts containing a warehouse or multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciles corresponding to the number of warehouses in each tract ( " Clustering decile " ) . Bars marked with " n " denote differences between demographics at warehouses and national median demographics that are not statistically significant using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test . B The relative difference in population-weighted NO2 averaged near warehouses for different population subgroups and the overall population-weighted NO2 near warehouses . Full size image The inequitable distribution of warehouse and warehouse characteristics , which we previously linked to increased NO2 , results in higher NO2 for racial-ethnic minorities living near warehouses relative to overall near-warehouse NO2 levels ( Fig. 4B ) . The Hispanic population and the population identifying as some other race or two or more races experience the largest difference relative to the overall near-warehouse NO2 ( by 29.1% and 28.0% , respectively ) . Despite the Black or African American population living in close proximity to a greater number of warehouses and associated loading docks and parking spaces ( Fig. 4A and Figure S8 ) , this population group , on average across the U.S. , faces lower NO2 by 2.1% than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African American population is exposed to higher near-warehouse NO2 than the overall near-warehouse population within 43 of the 49 states comprising the contiguous U.S. ( Figure S10 ) . If we remove these six states from our analysis and recalculate the relative difference in NO2 for the Black or African American population relative to the overall near-warehouse NO2 , we find that this population subgroup faces slightly higher NO2 than average near-warehouse levels ( 0.8% ) . While we demonstrated the association among warehouses , traffic , and traffic-related pollution , exogenous NOX-emitting activities could also influence near-warehouse NO2 . To understand the impact that other emitting sectors might contribute to the TROPOMI NO2 signal , we examined whether the signal persists across different ranges of emission intensities and different dominant emitting sectors using a high spatial resolution emissions dataset , the Neighborhood Emission Mapping Operation ( NEMO ) . We find enhanced NO2 near warehouses regardless of underlying levels of emissions and dominant emitting sectors ( Figure S11 ) , indicating that our results are not an artifact of warehouses being colocated with other NOX sources . The exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? 5-30% , with smaller enhancements generally observed near warehouses located in areas with lower-intensity emissions . While CoStar does not provide information on warehouse type or purpose , partitioning warehouses by underlying emission intensity might serve as a proxy . For example , the subset of warehouses located in areas with low on-road emissions ( Figure S11A ) might represent facilities intended for long-term storage warehouses rather than heavily trafficked last-mile facilities , and , accordingly , we observed a smaller NO2 enhancement at these facilities . Discussion This nationwide study substantiates growing concerns from fenceline communities and policymakers of increased truck traffic and traffic-related air pollution near warehouses . Local NO2 enhancements near warehouses are nearly 20% on average across the continental U.S. Given the early afternoon overpass of TROPOMI coupled with a mid-morning peak in heavy-duty vehicle activity25 , it is possible that this enhancement may be an underestimate . Warehouses with more loading docks and parking spaces-typical of warehouses built during the 2010s-attract the most traffic and are associated with the highest NO2 levels . Warehouses are also concentrated in communities with large racial-ethnic minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and socioeconomic burdens these populations experience . Our study also demonstrates that satellite observations of NO2 can identify warehouse-related pollution enhancements when aggregated at state and national levels . This study builds on several others that have documented higher NO2 and associated public health damages for marginalized populations26,27,28 . Previous work has also explored how specific sectors contribute to disparities in NO2 and other pollutants , finding inequities stemming from heavy-duty diesel vehicles22,23 , power generation and point sources29 , and freight transport30 . The warehousing industry-related to both heavy-duty and freight transport-is yet another industry that contributes to air inequality that we uncovered through this study . The small magnitude of the population-weighted near-warehouse NO2 level for the Black or African American population relative to the total population-weighted level ( Fig. 4B ) was one unexpected finding of this study and could stem from the large Black or African American populations in the southeastern U.S. , where NO2 concentrations are generally lower . Future work might use photochemical models to conduct source apportionment to understand the fraction of near-warehouse pollution stemming specifically from warehousing-related activity and provide surface-level pollutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , however , this type of modeling is hamstrung for two key reasons . First , the highest spatial resolution for nationwide model simulations is typically &gt; ? 10 ? km ? x ? 10 ? km31,32 , which is several times larger than NO2 distance-decay gradients27 . Second , emission simulators ( e.g. , MOVES33 ) only recently added the capability to spatially allocate off-network idling emissions at warehouses . At present , satellite data represent the most empirical means to surveil NO2 with complete spatial coverage and has been shown to capture observed surface-level spatial variations in NO2 concentrations34 . The relationships and warehouse-related NO2 proxies ( e.g. , loading docks and parking spaces ) reported in our results present an opportunity to further develop these emission simulators to account for warehousing activities . Future work might also leverage the recent launch of the Tropospheric Emissions : Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) satellite . TEMPO 's ability to surveil NO2 throughout daytime hours has the potential to increase our understanding of warehousing impacts on air quality and test whether the previously discussed hypothesis that TROPOMI underestimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heavy-duty traffic . The deployment of regulatory and/or low-cost air quality surface-level monitors near existing or planned warehouses1 is another exciting area of future research that would complement space-based observations . Since some warehouses are missing data on loading docks and parking spaces ( Section 4.1 ) , we tested whether these facilities are correlated with other variables included in our study in such a way that could bias results . We found that the correlation between missing warehouse parking spots or loading dock data with TROPOMI NO2 , race-ethnicity data , population density , and truck VKT was generally ? ? 0.1 ( the correlation between truck VKT and missing warehouse parking spots was the exception , r ? = ? -0.11 ) . Given that there is little correspondence with missing characteristics and pollution , demographics , and traffic , it is unlikely that the incomplete warehouse data would systematically bias our key results . Our analysis linking warehouse characteristics with truck traffic ( Fig. 3A ) assumes linear relationships . We explored whether this assumption was justified and found normally-distributed residuals ( Figure S12 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the linear approach ( i.e. , change in truck traffic per unit change in loading docks , parking spaces , or clustering ) is easily interpretable compared with more complex linear or non-linear models . One other potential limitation is our use of tropospheric column measurements of NO2 . There is a potential that NO2 may be present aloft rather than at the surface if a plume is transported from a large emitter ; however , we believe the ability for this potential to substantially influence our results is minimal , given the strong correlation observed between columnar and surface-level concentrations14 . Since ? 2000 , consumer reliance on e-commerce , and therefore warehousing , has increased35 , especially during the COVID-19 pandemic36 . Our results linking warehousing with increased traffic-related pollution represent 2021 , at which point commercial trucking activity near warehouses had not only rebounded from but increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic37 . The results come during a critical window of opportunity to inform zoning and transportation policy , environmental impact statements , and emissions standards to protect public health and equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting in 202738 will help reduce average NOX emissions ; however , given the aforementioned trend of increasing e-commerce35 , additional state and local policies and corporate action will also be important for reducing NO2 . At the state level , state energy commissions could direct utilities to devise plans to expedite permitting of charging stations in and around warehouses39 , and indirect source rules may help regulate and offset warehouse-related NO2 . Local actors may implement low-emission zones or environmental zones that target in-use emission reductions in specific areas40 . Corporate action replacing older trucks and commitments towards electrification may further protect public health and address inequities . Further research is needed to determine the utility of satellite NO2 data for evaluating the impact of individual facilities or clusters in limited geographical areas . Methods Warehouse locations and characteristics Information on warehousing comes from CoStar , which relies on staff , aerial , drone , field research , and public records to populate its database , which currently contains over 6.9 million commercial real estate properties . We searched CoStar for warehouses in the contiguous U.S. built through 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Property Type ? = ? Industrial , Secondary Type ? = ? Warehouse ) , which yielded ? 470,000 properties . We ultimately chose to only consider warehouses with a building area &gt; ? 20,000 ft2 as contemporaneous studies have also considered only larger warehouses41 , and CoStar 's limit of 500 properties per download would have resulted in a large number of separate queries and downloads . CoStar provides data on warehouse characteristics such as their square footage , number of parking spaces , number of loading docks , and year built that we use in this study . Here , loading docks refer to stalls level with heavy-duty truck trailers that allow inventory from the trucks to be loaded or unloaded , while parking spaces correspond to surface-level stalls generally intended as parking for light- or medium-duty vehicles . Some of the warehouses are missing data on these characteristics , such as the year built ( 9.9% ) , the number of loading docks ( 40.7% ) , and the number of parking spaces ( 31.1% ) . CoStar does not provide information on quality control or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution and characteristics of warehouses from CoStar as we know of no other comprehensive dataset-either publicly available or proprietary-that provides information on warehousing . We note , however , that CoStar is the most extensive commercial real estate database in the U.S. , undergoes vetting and updates by their team of researchers , and is commonly used in academic research36,42,43 . Remotely-sensed NO2 TROPOMI ( version 02.03.0144 ) measures tropospheric column NO2 at an unprecedented native resolution of 3.5 ? km ? x ? 5 ? km with an early afternoon ( ? 1330 ? h local time ) overpass time . We obtained daily TROPOMI retrievals over the contiguous U.S. from 2021 and increased their spatial resolution to 0.01 ? ? x ? 0.01 ? ( ? 1 ? km ? x ? 1 ? km ) through oversampling , discarding retrievals with quality assurance values lower than 0.7514 . We sampled daily oversampled TROPOMI NO2 at the grid cell nearest to each warehouse and ? ? 7 grid cells ( approximately ? ? 7 ? km ) in each cardinal direction , referring to this ? ? 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of the ? ? 7 grid cell buffer is arbitrary , we found that it captures the near-warehouse NO2 plume displaced slightly downwind of the warehouse ( Fig. 2A ) . We also tested how other near warehouse definitions impact our results by restricting the buffer to smaller extents around warehouses ( i.e. , ? ? 5 grid cells , ? ? 3 grid cells , and ? ? 1 grid cells ) but found that our key results do not hinge on the precise definition of " near warehouse " ( Figure S4 ) . Variations in the prevailing wind direction could obfuscate NO2 enhancements near warehouses when daily satellite-derived NO2 near warehouses is composited . As a result , we obtained hourly 0.25 ? ? x ? 0.25 ? 100-m wind data for 2021 from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts fifth-generation reanalysis45 . Reanalyzed winds at this altitude have been evaluated on hourly timescales against in-situ observations ( largely in the U.S. and Europe ) and were found to capture observed values with a mean absolute error of 9-13%46 . We sampled and averaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered around the overpass time of TROPOMI over the continental U.S , and applied bilinear interpolation to increase the spatial resolution to 0.01 ? ? ? ? 0.01 ? for direct comparison with the oversampled TROPOMI data47 . We found the mean wind direction near each warehouse following Yamartino48 using the arctangent of the zonal and meridional wind and artificially rotated each daily NO2 footprint tangential to the prevailing wind ( Figure S13 ) . Finally , we averaged all daily , rotated NO2 at each warehouse in 2021 to account for seasonal variations in NO214 . While TROPOMI does not measure surface-level NO2 , it exhibits a quasi-linear relationship and high correlation with surface-level observations14,23 and has enabled the detection of individual point sources and intraurban variations of NO219,20,22,23,27,49 . Multiple warehouses can be clustered together within the same ? 7 grid cell buffer or even within the same 0.01 ? ? x ? 0.01 ? TROPOMI grid cell . It is not possible to disentangle which fraction of satellite-observed NO2 might be attributable to a given warehouse in a cluster . Accordingly , some of our results present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not controlling for multiple colocated warehouses ( e.g. , Fig. 2A ) . We also partition warehouses into groups based on the level of clustering ( e.g. , Fig. 2B and Figure S3-4 ) to understand average NO2 enhancements for single versus clusters of warehouses . NOX emissions To understand how the satellite-measured NO2 signal near warehouses might be influenced by underlying emissions , we considered a 1 ? km x 1 ? km emissions dataset , NEMO50 . Briefly , this dataset is based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's National Emission Inventories 2017 ( NEI 2017 ) with additional fine-scale spatial allocation using over a hundred spatial surrogates such as population , traffic counts , and oil and gas wells . In addition to providing total NOX emissions , NEMO also provides sector-specific emissions from nine sectors : anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions ( henceforth " dust " ) , agricultural ammonia sources , nonpoint sources not in other sectors ( " non-point " ) , nonpoint oil and gas-production-related sources ( " oil and gas " ) , locomotive sources on railroads ( " rail " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion " ) , on-land mobile sources that drive on roads ( " on-road " ) , On-land mobile sources not on roads or railroads ( " non-road " ) , and Airport emissions ( " airports " ) . Because agricultural ammonia sources were not associated with any NEMO NOX emissions across the U.S. , we did not further consider emissions from this sector in our analysis . Similar to our analysis of TROPOMI NO2 , we sampled the NEMO NOX emissions at the grid cell nearest to each warehouse and ? ? 7 grid cells in each cardinal direction ; however , since these emissions represent a surface flux , unlike the column-integrated TROPOMI NO2 levels that are prone to prevailing wind patterns , we did not rotate the NEMO NOX emissions in the direction of the prevailing wind . Matching these 2017 NEMO NOX emissions with 2021 TROPOMI NO2 is not a perfect comparison , but we are not aware of a more recent emissions dataset at a resolution commensurate with TROPOMI . Moreover , changes in land use ( e.g. , road density and volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a developed country such as the U.S. compared with developing areas51 . Demographic data Demographic data at the census tract level were derived from the American Community Survey ( ACS ) 5-year estimates spanning 2017-202152 . The ACS is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in the years between the decennial censuses and provides statistics that are controlled to match the Bureau 's annual population estimates by age , sex , ethnicity , and race53 . The 5-year estimates are considered the most reliable ACS product and represent data from the entire period , the final year of which ( 2021 ) is the primary year of our analysis . We paired the tract-level demographics with corresponding tract geographic boundaries from the 2020 Census54 and assessed the racial-ethnic composition of the population living in the same census tracts in which warehouses are located using six different categories : white ; Non-Hispanic ; Hispanic ; Black or African American ; Asian , Native Hawaiian , or Pacific Islander ; and some other race or two or more races . These categories are non-mutually exclusive since individuals can , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We use census tract total population estimates and the area of each tract to calculate the population density and assign each warehouse a population density based on the census tract in which the warehouse is located . To assess race- and ethnicity-specific near-warehouse NO2 levels , we calculate the population-weighted NO2 near warehouses with the following : ? ? ? ? 2 , ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? h ? ? ? ? ? ? = ? ? ... ( 1 ) Here , ? ? ? ? 2 , ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? h ? ? ? ? ? ? represents population-weighted near-warehouse NO2 for the total population or a particular racial-ethnic population group , i corresponds to an individual warehouse , NO2 is spatially-averaged NO2 levels near ( ? ? 7 grid cell ) warehouse i , and pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial-ethnic population group in the census tract in which warehouse i is located . We then calculate the percent difference between ? ? ? ? 2 , ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? h ? ? ? ? ? ? for a particular racial-ethnic population group ( i.e. , white , non-Hispanic , Black , or African American , etc. ) and ? ? ? ? 2 , ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? h ? ? ? ? ? ? for the total population to quantify whether certain population groups living near warehouses experience worse traffic-related air pollution than overall near-warehouse levels . Traffic data We incorporated traffic data from the Highway Performance Monitoring System ( HPMS ) , which provides annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) by vehicle class for 14.3 million road segments representing highways , collector roads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study 's completion , only HPMS data through 2020 were publicly available . Because traffic in 2020 was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic , we paired the 2019 HPMS dataset with the other data inputs from 2021 , acknowledging that traffic volume and patterns may have changed between 2019 and 2021 . We formed two different measures of AADT : total AADT and truck AADT ( i.e. , AADT from vehicle classes 4-13 , which include single-unit trucks , buses , and semi- and multi-trailers ) . HPMS synthesizes data from individual U.S. states ' departments of transportation , leading to variations in the spatial completeness of the data . To address this limitation , each state 's AADT was scaled using the ratio of total activity reported by HPMS to the total activity reported by the nationally consistent Federal Highway Administration database55 . We then transformed total and truck AADT on individual road segments to vehicle kilometers traveled ( VKT ? = ? AADT * road length ) due to the variable lengths of road segments and thereafter summed total and truck VKT over all road segments contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the contiguous U.S. ( Figure S14 ) . For every warehouse , we sampled the 0.01 ? ? x ? 0.01 ? traffic grid at the grid cell nearest to each warehouse and ? ? 7 grid cells in each direction and summed total and truck VKT over this area to represent near warehouse traffic , similar to our treatment of TROPOMI data . Statistical analysis We measured whether relationships exist among warehouse characteristics , NO2 , and traffic using the slope of the least squares regression and the nonparametric Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient ( r ) . The significance of these relationships was quantified using the Wald test with a t-distribution of the test statistic and a significance threshold of 0.05 . We assessed the significance of temporal trends using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test , declaring trends as significant if the significance level associated with the test is below 0.05 . When determining whether demographics in census tracts containing warehouses significantly differed from national or state demographics , we employed the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test , again with a significance threshold of 0.05 . When examining the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 tract-level population density tertiles in the contiguous U.S. ( &lt; ? 267 ? people/km2 ? = ? Low density , 267-1501 ? people/km2 ? = ? Medium density , and &gt; ? 1501 ? people/km2 ? = ? High density ) to disentangle changes in NO2 associated with warehouse characteristics from enhancements due to different levels of urban activity . In a similar vein , we quantified associations between warehousing and traffic by partitioning warehouses based on daily total VKT to effectively control for different baseline traffic volumes before calculating the change in daily truck VKT . In visualizations , we present results grouped by deciles ( median values and the 95% confidence interval for the distribution of each decile ) for interpretability , but we note that measures of significance and correlation related to these visualizations were calculated using the full distributions of particular variables . We did not formally assess significance for population-weighted near-warehouse NO2 levels among different racial-ethnic population subgroups ( Section 4.4 , Fig. 3B ) given that this comparison is between pairs of singular values rather than between distributions .

Webber Wentzel had in the meantime been trying to serve papers to the chef in March 2024 , but even their tracing agents have not been able to locate him . <p> Chef Riku however says he intends to fight the judgement from the UK , being a British citizen , as he will be entitled to legal aid there .

Hariparsad has turned her passion for storytelling into a thriving publishing house . <p> Her journey is an inspiration to many , demonstrating the power of pursuing one 's dreams against all odds . <p> Hariparsad hails from the vibrant region of Durban North and currently resides in Ballito . Her love for storytelling started at a young age . She shared , " My mother always tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a page ( before I knew how to write ) and then narrate what I 'd written .

This marked the beginning of a new chapter in her life , dedicated to writing and publishing . <p> Her debut novel , The Four Hundred Club , is set against the homegrown backdrop of Durban , Umhlanga , Ballito , and Hillcrest .

" The literary world is one of the most competitive in the world , authors have to be incredibly competition-hungry to get their book noticed in this industry , " she continued . <p> Hariparsad hopes to see more women owning businesses in the publishing industry , which , despite being female-dominated in terms of employment , still lacks female business owners .

" <p> The populous Mpumalanga settlement is one of many areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility Eskom . <p> The utility giant has defended the measure , citing overloading of the grid due to illegal electricity activities as the primary reason for these interruptions . <p> The Bushbuckridge Local Municipality , however , has distanced itself from the issue , stating that it has no energy supply or distribution deal with Eskom . <p> " Bushbuckridge Municipality does not owe Eskom any money related to failed revenue collection , except for the electricity we use as a municipality . <p> " This is a national issue , and it should be addressed as such , " said municipal spokesperson Fhumulani Thovhakale . <p> Eskom explained that the load reduction is necessary to prevent damage to its infrastructure due to network overloading . <p> " Load reduction is implemented in areas where network overloading occurs , primarily during peak hours in the morning and evening . <p> " This is not load shedding , which is used when the national grid is constrained , but a measure to protect our assets from repeated failures and explosions , " the utility said . <p> Eskom further highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The prevalence of ghost vendors selling cheap , illegal electricity has caused significant overloading across Mpumalanga , including Bushbuckridge . This not only compromises our equipment but also poses a severe risk to human life . <p> " Load reduction is applied wherever overloading is detected to safeguard our infrastructure and the communities we serve . We understand the inconvenience it causes , but it is necessary to prevent extended power outages . " <p> Regarding financial matters , Eskom noted that Bushbuckridge is not among its top municipal debtors but stressed the broader issue of municipal debt . <p> According to Eskom , as of the end of March , municipal debt , one of Eskom 's most significant challenges , stood at approximately R74.4-billion . <p> " This debt has surged in the last financial year from 1 April 2023 to 30 March 2024 by around R15.9-billion . <p> " As of the end of June 2024 , the arrears debt has reached R82.3-billion , growing by R7.9-billion in just three months . This debt includes R8.3-billion owed by two metropolitan municipalities in Gauteng , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of the municipalities to pay Eskom for the bulk electricity they consume undermines Eskom 's financial stability and its ability to generate and supply electricity at reasonable prices for the benefit of South Africa 's growth . " <p> Eskom also addressed the challenges posed by illegal activities , including the use of ghost vendors . <p> " Additionally , we lose over R5-billion per annum to non-technical losses , including ghost vending , which severely compromises our network . <p> This week most of the provincial departments , including the premier 's office , tabled their budget votes in the provincial legislature in Mbombela . <p> However , the elephant in the room remains the 2021-22 report from the auditor-general ( AG ) , which indicated that nearly R1-billion was spent to remedy municipal accountability . <p> The AG highlighted the waste and ongoing financial mismanagement that hinders service delivery . <p> " We issued three material irregularities on the ineffective use of consultants at three municipalities . The total investment in financial reporting , including salaries of finance officials and consultant costs , was R941,3-million , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unfunded municipal budgets requires careful consideration and resolve to turn around the situation . <p> " Spending on non-priority items needs to be reduced , and municipalities must explore innovative solutions and identify opportunities for sustainable revenue generation . <p> He said municipalities need fresh strategies to combat the challenges they face . <p> " Our focus in the medium term will be on assisting our municipalities in developing strategies to bridge funding gaps and institutionalise sustainable controls for better financial management , " he said . <h> Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy <h> Privacy Overview <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience while you navigate through the website .

These pens , which are plastic tubes filled with insulin , have a disposable needle on one end and a dial on the other . Turning the dial makes a clicking sound as it passes numbers in the dosing window , which helps a user set the exact amount of medicine for injection . This makes it especially convenient for users such as the elderly , who may have arthritis in their hands , or people who ca n't see well . <p> But since May these pens have been running low in South African public hospitals and clinics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of " capacity limitations " . <p> This means many of the country 's diabetes patients have no choice but to switch to syringes and vials , which take many steps to prepare for injection , as public hospitals ration the remaining pen supply to people who ca n't safely switch from pens to vials . <p> Putting patients in this position is " unconscionable , unconstitutional and a clear abuse of intellectual property rights " , says Hassan . <p> Following the announcement of the deal , the Department of Trade , Industry and Competition said it was an " excellent first step " towards manufacturing refills for reusable insulin pens , which are in short supply in the public sector . For South African manufacturers to do that they may need permission from the company that holds the patent to make and supply them , called a voluntary licence . <p> In response to Bhekisisa 's questions about the further licensing for insulin pens , Nicolaou says he ca n't predict whether Aspen will be able to make pens in the future . The vice-president and general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the focus of their new partnership with Aspen is to increase the supply of affordable insulin in Africa . <p> Novo Nordisk has a strong stance on intellectual property rights , according to the company 's website . It says that because making new drugs is expensive , recouping the investment is important so that they can continue to make more lifesaving medication . For this reason , and because they already " sell human insulin at low prices through large government tenders " in many low-income countries , the company is against voluntary licensing . <p> If companies abuse their patent rights by not meeting the country 's demand for a specific product -- such as insulin pens -- or refusing to grant a licence on reasonable grounds , the commissioner of patents can issue a compulsory licence to other manufacturers via a court process , which allows them to make the product without the inventor 's permission . <p> " This deal is insufficient to meet South African needs for insulin pens .

These licences have never been issued in South Africa , though , partly because it 's a long , complex court process and the high cost that comes with it blocks people from filing applications for them . <p> But even with such forced permissions , local manufacturers would still need a supplier for the insulin . <p> In 2019 , more than 90% of South Africa 's insulin supply came from three multinational companies -- Novo Nordisk , Eli Lilly and Sanofi -- none of which have manufacturing sites in southern Africa .

" <p> For example , in 1997 South Africa passed new laws that would allow the government to use compulsory licences and import more affordable generics of ARVs from other countries to fight the Aids epidemic . <p> This led to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Pretoria High Court in 1998 to oppose these new measures , arguing that it violated the constitutional right to not be deprived of property . <p> By August 2001 the price of original branded products , which at the time cost more than R80,000 ( $10,439 ) for one year 's treatment per person , dropped to about R6,000 ( $712 ) after competitors were allowed to make low-cost versions . <p> " The threat of compulsory licensing marked the beginning of reasonably priced ARVs . It was basically a gun to their head , " explains adjunct professor at the Wits School of Governance , Alex van den Heever . <p> " This is what the Department of Health should be doing to provide access to insulin pens . In times like these , the government ca n't afford to just sit on its hands , " he says .

@@112437232 <h> South Africa <h> TRAINSPOTTER <h> Floyd Shivambu , deputy president of the Economic Freedom Fighters , is leading his outfit 's election campaign for Johannesburg . He and the party believe they will triple the support they garnered in 2014 , and that the country 's most important metro will swing their way . If that scenario comes to pass -- and do n't laugh , because you laughed the last time -- it could mean that Shivambu will own Johannesburg . But who is The Floyd ? What does he want for your country , your city , your community ? RICHARD POPLAK went to Heidelberg for a rare chat with the man behind the Man behind the Man . <p> People are always shouting that they want to create a better future . It 's not true . The future is an apathetic void of no interest to anyone . The past is full of life , eager to irritate us , provoke and insult us , tempt us to destroy or repaint it . The only reasons people want to be masters of the future is to change the past . They are fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and histories rewritten . <p> Milan Kundera -- The Unbearable Lightness of Being <p> In mid-winter , the rolling hills of Heidelberg are stained an old-underpants brown , a uniform dun that extends to the city , the outlying townships , the strip malls , the shacks , the future . In Ratanda , a model RDP-housing community ( if there is such a thing ) , a breeze blows into every exposed crevice , coating the nostrils with grit that soon transforms into a post-nasal mudslide . <p> As it happens , in a political space governed by bombastic A-type self-promoters , Shivambu is merely shy . When locals stop him in the street for a photo-op , he behaves like a bashful , basketball-player-sized pre-teen . But if the big man has a defining trait , it 's his weapons-grade smarts . His noggin is not raised above the parapet too often , mostly because he 's too busy building the parapet 's foundation . Conversely , if you happen not to be a fanboy of commie political theorising and the implementation thereof , Floyd is a fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is engaged in the slow , methodical , grinding work of constituency building . Over the course of this municipal election campaign , which is vital to the growth of the organisation to which he has staked his political career , he has walked through hundreds of such dusty , windblown wards . Along with him are a gaggle of Fighters brandishing clipboards . They knock on the doors of the RDP houses and the makhukus in the backyards , offer the standard sales spiel , and ask for a phone number . The number is added to a database , which is in turn used to build a ward-specific WhatsApp group or SMS list . <p> The day before , the EFF Gauteng Provincial Task Force , under Floyd 's command , gathered 11,705 names , which were added to the millions of other names already collected and collated . This process demands tens of thousands of hours of free-ish labour , and can not be done without a massive commitment of time from the party 's leadership . <p> But does it work ? <p> " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " There are nearly 58 independent candidates operating there who used to be ANC , and the majority of them said they will give the PR vote to the EFF . I think that we will be the surprise of the elections . I think we will get close to 600,000 to a million votes there . " <p> Um , a million votes would almost match the total number of votes the EFF garnered nationwide during the 2014 national campaign . <p> " The most bare , bare minimum of votes for the EFF will be triple what we got in 2014 . In Mpumalanga we 'll get some wards . In KZN we 'll get something . And in Limpopo , obviously , we 'll get something . " <p> Okay , so if coming from a base of nothing to over three-million punters in the course of three years is the plan , what 's going to happen in the next 11 days ? Malema sent to the Moon in an EFF Humvee ? The unveiling of a cold fusion generator ? The revelation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing so dramatic : the trick , apparently , is capitalising on the other guy 's mistakes . " If you know the ANC , it 's easy to beat them , " says Floyd . " The biggest mistake the ANC made was to announce political candidates . Even people in ANC T-shirts are refusing to vote for fly-in councillors . So we might even win these municipalities along the West Rand . Randfontein . Westonaria . The metros are going to be hung . Johannesburg is going to be hung . We 've got very strong , extremely strong candidates in all the wards in Johannesburg . And in these metro discussions , " adds Floyd , pausing a little for the zinger , " it might end up that the EFF is in control of Johannesburg . " <p> In this case -- and stranger things have happened , sniggering pundit -- Floyd will , in all likelihood , be the man to run the joint . <p> How did it come to this ? <p> If you 've been following closely enough , you 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political historians , a radical political movement . Speak candidly to a member of the Central Command Team in a dusty township street , or in a TV studio green room , or over whiskies in some neon-lit dump , and the discussion quickly veers towards the large red tomes at the back of the library . The Marxist inevitability of history , baby : the present is the past 's industrial waste product , a fetid compost that must enrich and grow the future . Steeped in any number of iterations of commie flimflam , a vital part of their programme , they 'd argue , is workshopping the past in order to create a future . In truth , they 're workshopping the future in order to recreate the past . While the former impulse is utopian , the latter is fascistic , and the distinction is therefore not unimportant . Behind this project is the party 's Great Unknown , the Shadow , the man behind the man behind the man . <p> Meet Floyd Shivambu , the Fighter who may end up in possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * <p> We 've paused , Floyd and me , to stand under the shade of a blue gum , across from an RDP house flying a tattered white flag indicating the presence of a sangoma . <p> He is now telling me stories about the old days . <p> A funny thing : put a black DA candidate in front of a group of white businessmen , and he or she will wow the crowd with a patented Inspirational Shack-to-Sandton origin story . Yet in South Africa , where the majority of the black population grows up poor , almost every politician who is not a member of the new ANC elite has a Shack-to-Sandton origin story , even if it has yet to be packaged for the business breakfast crowd . Example : Julius Malema could out-Mashaba Herman Mashaba . Floyd Shivambu could out-Mashaba them all . <p> It begins in 1983 , in a Limpopo village called Mahonisi , Malamulele region , where Floyd was one of seven young Shivambus growing up on the bad side of the poverty line . Small house-type thing , no electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Smoke to sell hand-sewn duvets or pillowcases on the streets , and were routinely chased away by the authorities . And so when Floyd berates Executive Mayor Parks Tau and his metro cops for harassing informal traders and confiscating their goods , as he did to great effect at the Daily Maverick Gathering , it 's personal . <p> " What Parks does n't understand is how close the line is between having something to eat and having nothing -- nothing , " he says . <p> As a boy , Floyd dreamed of studying at the University of Witwatersrand . He wanted to be a doctor , an engineer , a professional . He duly applied to a technicon , but when he arrived at the main campus in 2001 , he was jazzed up by all the excitement and the possibilities . <p> " I was hearing for the first time that there was a course called ' sociology ' or ' political studies ' , " he tells me . This was a happy accident , because Floyd was active in political life throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on the local high school 's Student Representative Council from his mid-teens . His father used to bring home books , one of them a dictionary of political concepts , another a copy of Lenin 's The State of Revolution , which was missing a bunch of pages . ( Make of that what you will . ) <p> Floyd memorised killer pick-up lines like : The state is the product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms . In the nothingness of Mahonisi village , at the very bottom of South Africa 's bottomless pyramid , Lenin 's sales pitch had a nice ring to it . <p> So , welcome to Wits , Young Leninist . On his very first day on campus , Floyd looked around at all the white-people nonsense and told a friend that he 'd be president of the university 's SRC by the time he was done . " Ah , but this place is not for black people , you will not succeed , " replied the friend . True enough , but Floyd was just one of a number of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the SRC in the early zeroes , setting the scene for the movements currently recoding the country 's universities . <p> In his third year , you 'll be unsurprised to hear , Floyd Shivambu became president of the SRC . <p> Over the course of his time in Johannesburg , Floyd got to know the state-let in a way that most citizens never do . He stayed in a backyard shack in Diepkloof , he stayed in a student digs in Hillbrow , he lived in Braamfontein . Through it all , he was sucked inexorably towards the ANC . " There were no youth at all , " he tells me of local structure meetings . This fact alone quickly made of him a commodity . Before long , he was on the National Executive Committee of SASCO . From there , he was swept towards a young ANC Youth League activist named Julius Sello Malema . <p> " When I heard him speak , " says Floyd , " I thought , Ay ! " <p> Malema may have felt the same way about his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had gained a reputation for presenting a cogent argument in relatively simple terms , employing English that an average cadre could understand -- which basically made him unique in the party since the draftees of the Freedom Charter . Everyone in the broad church wanted a piece of him . But it was his destiny to be rolled into the ANC Youth League saga , and to be one of the principal leaders that veered the Mother Body towards the shoals of the appropriation without compensation palaver . Along with Malema , Shivambu helped destroy Mbeki and install Zuma as top dawg . Along with Malema , Shivambu helped yank the party 's discourse into ungovernable territory . Along with Malema , Shivambu was implicated in all the hoggish mega-consumption and whoremongering that defined the young Turks of that era . <p> " But Julius , " he chuckles , " if he had some businesses here and there , and if you had some business with him , you could still not tell him what to do . " A new calculus : corrupt , but uncorruptible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 . <p> " It is cold outside the ANC , " promised Zuma . That dire injunction proved not to be true . Floyd claims that , while Malema had no real intention of starting a political party after the Grand Spanking , the moment arrived after the Marikana massacre . They were swept by history towards establishing a standalone political entity . <p> Who wrote the seven cardinal pillars -- the " nationalise everything " precepts that define the EFF programme and so terrify the country 's neo-lib bien pensants ? <p> Floyd . <p> Who is in charge of the history of the future of the past ? <p> Floyd . <p> Who wrote into being the second fastest growing opposition party in the history of this democracy ? ( Sorry -- first place still goes to Cope . ) <p> Floyd . <p> The rest , as they say , is the epistemological framework for a new historicity . <p> *** <p> So here we are -- at the cusp of Floyd Shivambu 's Marxist-Leninist prose defining the way South Africa limps forward into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is the backstory , the context : a young man from rural Limpopo is on the cusp of shaping the City of Gold into something else , something that perhaps abnegates its long , unfortunate history . <p> That said , Floyd is n't joking when it comes to the ideological underpinning . " Noooo , " he drawls , when I ask him if the EFF 's fanciful manifesto can properly function in an actual version of the real world . " Think about how much money is wasted . Hundreds of millions on this project or that project . Everything we suggest can be paid for . " Communism , capitalism , all of the competing and conspiring adjuncts and animadversions -- it 's all amounted to nothing . What the EFF will -- will , insists Floyd -- implement , is hardcore Marxist-Leninist socialism without the Soviet seepage . <p> What will Johannesburg look like under Floyd ? Why not peruse the State of Revolution for a clue or two . And before you dismiss this as a non-possibility , consider how far the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They have come for the future in order to own the past in order to massively reconfigure the present . The interregnum , it is clear , belongs to them .

@@112437233 <h> Maverick Life <h> FIGHTING MEMORY <h> A woman soldier 's beautiful book reclaims the MK mantle <h> Marion Sparg 's Guilty and Proud shows up Jacob Zuma 's party as interlocutors . Ferial Haffajee asked the author about her memoir . <p> Marion Sparg 's story starts in her Hillbrow apartment in the mid-Eighties . She puts on a sensible suit , slings a bag over her shoulder and heads to the police station where she plants a bomb , the first of several . It is a sweeping memoir of a woman soldier . <p> Sparg went on to be charged and found guilty of treason , with her race and steadfast commitment to uMkhonto weSizwe ( MK ) found to be an aggravating factor by the apartheid judge . As the MK party of former president Jacob Zuma shapes a contemporary political narrative , the book ( inadvertently ) reclaims the mantle of the true MK , showing up the newbies as fong kong interlocutors . <p> Ferial Haffajee : What a beautiful story . Why was it so difficult to tell ? You write that your editors and muses had to keep telling you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Marion Sparg : I had written most of the book a long time ago but as they say , life keeps on getting in the way . After publishing Bulelani 's story ( Ngcuka 's The Sting in the Tale ) in 2022 , I finally got down to finishing the manuscript . The response I got from my publishers when I first submitted it was very positive . But they said they " wanted more of Marion " . I 'm not a person who spends a lot of time on introspection and it was a challenge to recall my own thoughts and feelings . I was determined at the same time to tell the stories of those I met along the way and the challenge lay in getting this balance right , which I believe we did in the end , with the assistance of a wonderful editor ( Gillian Warren-Brown ) . <p> Along with a number of other former MK cadres who have written about our experiences , it is also difficult at times to have to focus on oneself as an individual when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong at times to focus on oneself . But I had to tell the full story of course after the stance I took at my trial all those years ago , where I decided to plead guilty and to attempt to explain why I joined the ANC and MK as a white woman . There is only so much I could say in the confines of a courtroom . <p> FH : In the end , it is both a story of MK ( and its leaders who most influenced you like Chris Hani , Joe Slovo and Jack Simons ) and your story . Why was this important to you ? <p> MS : It was extremely important for me to be able to write about the comrades I met along the way . Individuals like Chris , Joe , Jack all had an enormous influence on me . And as I say somewhere in the book , it was meeting and getting to know individuals like this that cemented my commitment to the ANC and MK . It is one thing to agree with an organisation 's policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's life on the line it is the people who make up the organisation that count . As I said at my trial : No matter how much I believed in the aims of the ANC , " I would have had very serious doubts about laying down my life for that organisation if I did not know its leaders to be capable , rational , sensitive people " . <p> FH : In one of the forewords , former president Thabo Mbeki writes that you did n't emerge in the Struggle through conventional routes -- student resistance and student organisations . Instead , you became a journalist and thus began your political journey . What was it about the newsrooms you worked in that made journalism a limited profession to bring change ? <p> MS : In the end , I suppose it was the self-censorship ... Much has since been written about people like Tertius Myburgh , the editor of the Sunday Times , at the time . He actively collaborated with the apartheid regime . I had a very short career as a journalist and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the response from Myburgh when I joined a few colleagues at SA Associated Newspapers in a one-day solidarity strike with our black colleagues who had gone on strike for fair wages and equal treatment . Myburgh told me in no uncertain terms that if he had his way he would fire me and that if I ever contemplated similar actions in the future , I should pack my bags and leave . Our strike seemed such a small , insignificant action : a few white journalists expressing solidarity with their striking black colleagues . Myburgh 's response seemed extreme . I had had a number of run-ins with him before this . And after this experience I felt that it was time to leave journalism . <p> FH : You learnt to make bombs in a bathroom in Bellevue . Tell us more . <p> MS : Well . It was petrol bombs we made , just to clarify . We had some idea about how they were made but it was Damian ( de Lange , a fellow journalist and later MK combatant ) who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles with petrol , stuffing the top with rags and " testing " them in the bathroom of Damian 's flat . <p> FH : A comrade told you that whites left the country by plane , usually . You and Damian de Lange left on foot . That was quite a journey . <p> MS : Yes , it was a journey . I remember so much of that walk ( and ride ) across the desert in Botswana . The most unexpected , and delightful , part , which I write about in the book was bumping into friendly donkeys on the road in the dark . They were curious and kept us company for some distance . <p> FH : You write that Steve Biko 's life and death were shape-shifting for you . You were inspired by his words that skin colour is not the only quotient of black consciousness . I read through the book your striving and struggling for an identity outside of race , to live nonracialism . In the end , it 's not possible ? Or is it ? <p> MS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identity beyond race . It 's my experience in the MK camps that convinces me of that , the fact that I did forget , for a short while , that I was white . I only realised this after leaving the camp and realised I would never experience that again , but the fact that I was able to forget my white skin even for that short while , was remarkable and testimony to the calibre of cadres I was so privileged to be in camp with ; the kind of politics that was taught and lived in the camps . <p> FH : In court , the apartheid state tried to paint you as a lonely ( and obese ) young white woman open to being exploited by " terrorists " . The Sunday Times amplified the narrative . Was it painful to relive this in your story ? <p> MS : More frustrating than painful . I am comfortable with who I am , the body that I occupy . I did n't see much of this coverage until much later ... and as I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising ) to see how the Sunday Times was once again so willing to do the bidding of the security police with the narrative they carried . But perhaps they too could only make sense of me and my actions by painting me in this light . <p> FH : A Black Sash activist writes you a poem in prison ; she reclaims and rewrites you with words that made my hair stand on end . " Beautiful , brave , fat , white woman . Viva . " The book 's title , Guilty and Proud , is born from the poem . What did this mean to you ? <p> MS : I was very moved when I received Annemarie Hendrikz 's poem in prison . It is a beautiful poem , written in response to the way the Sunday Times chose to cover my trial . I remain indebted to Annemarie for this remarkable piece of writing and could n't have asked for a better title for the book . <p> FH : In prison , you form a close sisters ' community with Trish Hanekom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jailing on treason charges ) , H ? l ? ne Pastoors and others . You overturn power relationships with the warders and fight and fight and fight for better conditions . How important was this to surviving your sentence and emerging stronger ? <p> MS : The bonds I formed with my fellow prisoners , and with Barbara Hogan in particular , were very special . Barbara had had to fight prison conditions on her own for so long . She is one of the bravest people I know . She inspired me at the time and continues to inspire me . <p> FH : I know it 's not your intention , but the book was published just as the MK party juggernaut settled into our polity . Who knows what it will bring ? I read the book , thus , as a reclaiming of the mantle , a telling of the true MK story as pretenders hijack the name and history . Is this an interpretation too far ? <p> MS : As you say , the appearance of my book at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But your interpretation is not taking it too far . From the start , when I started writing the book over 20 years ago , I wanted to ensure that I did n't only tell my story , but as much of the much bigger story of MK as I could . Like many former cadres of MK , I am outraged at the way the name and legacy of MK are being abused and if my book is one small part of reclaiming that proud legacy and telling the true MK story , I would be very proud . <p> The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation organised a book launch for Guilty and Proud , and panel discussion , on 9 August . What was particularly special for me was to hear from the young people who attended and those who formed part of the panel . <p> One of the young women who participated in the discussion said she was reluctant at first to read the book . She did n't normally read books about politics , but she said reading it was important . It took her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in exile , " she commented at one point . <p> She asked me what I find most rewarding having written the book ? My answer was hearing from young people like her about their response to the book . DM <p> Guilty and Proud by Marion Sparg is published by NB Publishers ( 2024 ) . <h> Comments <p> This is one of many people who helped corrupt terrorists into power to which we now sit with the hell hole sa is today . Not a hero . This narrative of freedom fighters being the heros is over . They are the oppressor today . <p> What corrupt white people ? Brutal force ? you mean dealing with terrorists who bombed churches , shopping malls and massacred church goers . Yeah those whites that sent those terrorists to the great beyond are heros . <p> Was that MK though ? There were multiple forces fighting against apartheid or to retain it . The deadliest bomb in SA from the struggle era was planted by the AWB . It 's too simplistic to take individual incidents and build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle . <p> As opposed to what ? the literal nazis ( who had originally been sentenced to death by the Smuts government during WW II ) who ran the country prior to that ? For all the corruption and criminality of the ANC , I 'd still take them ahead of the fascists ... <p> That was all in the future and unknowable in real time . She is somebody who saw a brutal , unjust system and decided to fight against it . That fight was a just one , and nobody involved in MK should be ashamed just for fighting against the brutality of apartheid . <p> I wont judge her past . However , with the ANC where it is today , I would like to ask her one question ? Does she still vote for the ANC even though its betrayed the people it apparently fought for . If so , why ? <h> DM168 <h> DM168 <p> We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits .

This includes setting out " procedures for authorising user terminals , IoT terminals , earth station user terminals communicating with space station whilein motion ( ESIM/ESV ) , and ground earth stations in the South African territory .

Starlink , as an example , is n't available in South Africa is because it would be required to comply with broad-based black economic empowerment regulations , something it has reportedly refused to do . Whether the procedures ICASA settles on would change that remains to be seen . <p> The Authority has said that , " Interested persons and parties are hereby invited to submit written representations , including an electronic version of the representation in Microsoft Word , of their views on the proposed new licensing framework for Satellite Services by no later than 16h00 on 12 November 2024 .

To that end , the dismissal was said to be unfair in the absence of substantial grounds to justify termination of employment . <p> The commission tore into the matter in its 73-page ruling . <p> WRC adjudication officer Michael MacNamee said in his decision that allowing 24 hours to respond this email could n't be considered " reasonable notice " . <p> " No employee when faced with such a situation could possibly be faulted for refusing to be compelled to give an open-ended unqualified assent to any of the proposals , " said MacNamee . <p> Indeed , Musk 's demand that employees accept the new terms of " working long hours at high intensity " with no mention of better pay or otherwise put employees in a precarious situation , using continued employment as the carrot on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BL argued that it was impossible for the executive to know what package he was offered or the implications of staying at Twitter if he clicked yes . <p> Twitter 's representative 's in the matter tried and failed to argue that Rooney 's departure was of his own design and that he was responsible for not clicking yes . Ultimately , the company was ordered to pay Rooney compensation for unfair dismissal , as well as a fee for the loss of prospective earnings . <p> Whether this ruling will open the gates for other employees to pursue same is unclear at this stage . However , with that having been said , this sets something of a precedent and we would n't be surprised to hear that X 's legal team is inundated with lawsuits similar to this one in future . <p> Hypertext is one of South Africa 's leading technology news and reviews sites .

@@112450239 <h> Onyx : beautiful , tough and your next EVERKI backpack <p> Backpacks have broken through the perceptions of only being for education environments to become arguably the most popular type of bag in just about every environment . While they continue to be popular in schools , offices , shared working environments , airports and more are all packed to the brim with people choosing to keep their important possessions on their back . <p> Unfortunately this increase in popularity has not seen an increase in quality . Most backpacks are still put together cheaply and require replacements often . For working professionals this lack of quality is mirrored by a lack of professionalism with backpacks still relying on gaudy colours and decorations that simply are n't a fit for the workplace . <p> The company EVERKI was established by founders frustrated with this very problem . As career travellers they saw that no bags on the market were built tough enough to last or smart enough to fit in at work . EVERKI 's engineering is best seen in the Onyx , a backpack that borrows its strength and good looks from the natural resource that bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onyx has a carrying capacity of 25 litres , which is more than enough for the school or office commute with more than enough to also be your best friend when travelling . <p> Along with its focus on longevity and sharp looks , EVERKI also knows how important it is for modern bags to carefully carry your expensive electronics . That 's why the Onyx has a dedicated , padded compartment that can fit devices up to 15.6 inches . As fans of laptops with these larger screens we 're very happy to see companies like EVERKI give us the space we need for our tech . <p> Another feature we personally love is the large side pockets . These work great for water bottles and EVERKI has even built in a secure loop for that use case . But it 's not just for water bottles and with one of these multifunctional pockets on each side , you can pack more . We find it most useful for umbrellas and battery banks , both especially useful for travel locally and overseas . <p> All the features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any situation . Your Onyx will continue to look good as time goes on thanks to superior craftsmanship and clever choices of materials . For example : the Onyx uses a water-repellent ballistic nylon on its exterior to keep dry and premium leather is used in the handle and other accent areas for even more strength . With a corner-guard protection system and even real metal zippers , EVERKI has thought of everything here . <p> The black exterior is in contrast to the signature orange EVERKI interior . The high brightness colour choice here makes it easy to find items , even in low light , and it makes security checkpoints a breeze as officials wo n't have to spend extra time on your backpack . This focus on travel is also seen in the trolley handle pass-through , allowing the Onyx to quickly and securely be placed on top of your luggage . <p> We did n't even have time today to touch on some other great features , like a hard-shell , quick-access glasses case at the top , or another quick-access slot on the side for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need . <p> No matter where you get your EVERKI you enjoy another promise from the aforementioned founders : a limited lifetime warranty against defects in workmanship and material defects for original owners . EVERKI can only offer this kind of deal given its supreme confidence in the manufacturing of all its products . To go from expecting to replace backpacks every few months , to keeping one for life , is a real game changer you will only get from EVERKI . <p> Hypertext is one of South Africa 's leading technology news and reviews sites .

This is especially risky given that FLUX.1 is being showcased by X 's Premium user base who often engage in misinformation and fakery in hopes of upping their engagement count for a greater payout from X 's revenue sharing programme . With a corpus of copyright protected material to draw from an few if any guardrails , it 's just a matter of time before somebody creates something that brings a lawsuit against xAI , X and Black Forest Labs . <p> Not that it will likely care , Stability AI , the company formed around Stable Diffusion was sued by Getty Images for alleged improper use of the Getty Images library . That lawsuit is yet to reach a conclusion after more than a year after it was filed and may just signal that even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run before the copyright owners get what 's due . <p> The AI market is a lawless wild west and FLUX.1 's presence is a watershed moment for the technology .

For my work , I had to write reports on each project which helped hone my writing skills . The book took three years to write . It was the publishing part that was complicated , but I had assistance from Anthony Cuerden of Flying Ant Designs who did the layouts and graphic design work and Cara Hallier who did the proofreading and editing . The printing was done by Pronta Print in Westmead , Pinetown . " <p> A vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist with the planning and preparation of tenders for many dams in the country .

" <p> Easton 's journey to becoming a dam expert was n't straightforward . He had to work hard to get to the point where he could influence the design of many of the country 's dams .

So , I dug out the pond and created my own dam with a sluice gate . <p> " When I was a young man , I was hired by a major British construction firm , McAlpine . I started right at the bottom , putting pegs in the ground . After a few years , I was planning a whole construction site for steel works . I then worked on tenders for the head office in London for three or four years , but I could n't see a future for myself there .

I worked on Hazelmere Dam , which is off the Mdloti River , near Verulam , in KZN . My last project was Springrove Dam in Rosetta , near Mooi River . " <p> The legacy lives on <p> Easton is still engaged in life at 94 . He 's a family man and has four daughters , two who live in South Africa , one in the USA and another in Australia .

@@113074230 <h> Visions of Mana - Review <h> With nearly 20 years between mainline games , this long-awaited RPG does n't disappoint . <p> It would be an understatement to say that Visions of Mana has high expectations to live up to . There has n't been a main entry in the Mana series in nearly 20 years , with only spin-offs and 3D remakes of older games tiding fans over in the meantime . But thankfully , the wait was worth it . Although there are a few glaring flaws , Visions of Mana successfully brings the series into the modern age with excellent combat and class systems , as well as a new cast of likable characters . It 's not only a great Mana game , but it 's become one of my personal favorite JRPGs in years . <p> If I could sum up my impressions of Visions of Mana 's storytelling in its opening acts with one word , it would be " simple " -- and I mean that as a compliment . I 'm a big fan of games tackling complex subjects or having dense lore to comb through , but not everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Visions of Mana keeps its plot straightforward instead of bogging it down with needless exposition -- at first , at least . <p> You play as Val , a skilled swordsman who must escort a group of people chosen to sacrifice their souls to sustain the Tree of Mana . This includes Hinna , Val 's childhood friend and hinted sweetheart , and I found the duo endearing right from the start . You 'd normally expect a character in Val 's role as a guardian to be someone who takes things too seriously , but instead he 's cheerful , charming , and brimming with optimism . And rather than dwell on being compelled to sacrifice herself , Hinna is honored to be selected and excited to make her pilgrimage with Val by her side . <p> The party members they gain along the way have their own distinctive personalities that add variety . Careena , for example , is plucky yet irritable , and -- for some baffling reason I 'm still trying to wrap my head around -- speaks with a heavy Texan accent . Morely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , but it 's his blunt attitude that leads to some of the funniest moments . It soon becomes apparent what shaped your new friends into the people they are , and each has a proper arc that gives them a chance to grow as individuals by directly confronting their own flaws . Rather than feeling like side stories , their tales are woven into the central plot in a way that feels organic . Gaining more insight into these characters helped change my entire perspective of them -- for instance , Careena begins the journey as a brat and I had initially dismissed her as rude , but by the end , I found her to be one of the most endearing party members . <h> The main story had me intrigued from the very beginning . <p> Visions of Mana 's main story itself had me intrigued from the very beginning , but while I loved the brisk pace of the first half , it slows to an absolute crawl later on . To avoid spoilers , I 'm not able to go into detail about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of the final 15 to 20 hours ( I rolled credits on the campaign in just under 40 ) that I strongly felt was unnecessary padding . There ends up being a lot of retreading , and it feels like an unwelcome detour from where the story had been heading . <p> This turning point is also when the simplicity I initially liked was thrown out of the window and the dreaded exposition dumps started to pile up on top of each other . As a whole , I still found the overall story to be enjoyable and the ending to be emotionally satisfying , but these pacing issues later on frustratingly squander much of the early momentum that had been built up . <p> But the real star of Visions of Mana , one that shines even when the story falters , is its combat . Fights are fast and frantic , with a number of systems to keep track of . You have your standard and special attacks alongside moves and spells , such as fireballs or shurikens , to mix things up and exploit enemy vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and using moves slowly fills up the Class Strike gauge that then lets you perform a devastating attack you 'll want to unleash as often as you can ( preferably at the exact right moments ) . During all this , you 'll also incorporate equipable items called Elemental Vessels , each of which provides its own special ability . For example , the Luna Globe will briefly create a small bubble on the battlefield that slows down enemies while speeding up attacks and spell casting times of the party . <p> However , when a character equips any given Elemental Vessel , they will also automatically be swapped to its associated class , which leads me to my absolute favorite mechanic in Visions of Mana : the class system . While the function of the Luna Globe itself will never change , the role , moves , and abilities of the character equipped with it will , and every character has a class entirely unique to them for every element available . <p> The Luna Globe will transform Val into an Aegis , changing him from his default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance and shield rather than his usual sword , but Careena will instead become a Moon Charterer and takes on a buff-support role through fan dancing . As an Aegis , Val can use a move to aggro enemies and gains an ability that allows him to survive what would otherwise have been a fatal blow with 1HP once per battle , and it 's the way these options come into play as you swap around that really highlights the fun of each class <h> The real star of Visions of Mana is its combat and class system . <p> You 'll unlock even more moves and abilities for each Vessel thanks to the Elemental Plot , which acts as an upgrade system . The key difference between those two types of actions is that any moves you learn are permanent and can be equipped regardless of a character 's class , whereas abilities are tied to the class itself . So Val wo n't get that protection from a fatal blow unless he 's an Aegis , but he 'll always have the option to add the aggro move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to invest solely in one class . <p> But the coolest part ? When equipping an Elemental Vessel to a character for the first time , you get treated to a wonderfully cheesy costume transformation cutscene straight out of a Super Sentai show as they don their new thematic outfits and weapons . Even if I did n't really want to equip a character with a particular Vessel , I 'd always do so at least once because the cinematic never failed to put a huge grin on my face . And do n't worry -- once you 've done the initial transformation sequence , you can just swap between classes at the press of a button in the menu screen between encounters . <p> Even more depth is added to combat by Ability Seeds , which are obtained through quests , chests , and battles . Some Seeds grant you passive bonuses like upping your stats while others grant you an entirely new move to use . Later on you 'll even be able to transfer the Corestones of defeated enemies and bosses into more powerful Seeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss at my leisure to unleash some serious damage . <p> All of these systems tie together in a way that encourages strategy over button mashing . I had my preferred classes for certain characters , but some situations called for me to invest upgrade points into a Vessel I 'd never use on them just to unlock certain moves , or even reclass them entirely . That might sound restrictive , but I actually liked that it encouraged me to branch out and try classes for characters I initially would n't have wanted to , and prevents you from putting all your eggs in one basket . <h> Bosses can be tough if you 're not taking advantage of all your options . <p> For instance , normally I liked to have Morley use the class associated with the water Elemental Vessel , which transforms him into a hybrid of a stage magician and Gambit from X-Men who can stun enemies . But to defeat one particularly challenging boss , I had to switch him to a class that could maximize damage output thanks to its focus on critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on boosting his critical damage and hit rate for complete synergy . <p> You 'll want to make sure you understand how to make the most of each class like this , because bosses in Visions of Mana can be tough even on the normal difficulty level if you 're not taking advantage of all your options . There are some really inventive boss designs , both visually and mechanically . Some might heavily focus on area-of-effect attacks while others will snatch your Elemental Vessel from you , temporarily preventing you from using it . Every boss kept me on the edge of my seat , and slaying them always felt rewarding . <p> Exploration also makes up a huge bulk of Visions of Mana . From lush jungles to snowy tundras to seaside villages , every single location feels unique and lets the gorgeous art style shine -- it 's vibrant and looks like something out of a storybook , which fits the fantastical tone . Hidden chests and collectables had me exploring every inch of the map and pulled me to optional areas I otherwise would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more still left for me to tackle , too , and I ca n't wait to dive right back in to complete everything Visions of Mana has to offer . <p> That said , while the art style itself is great , I did notice a fair share of visual bugs . There are a lot of moments where the lipsyncing did n't match up , and at one point a character was speaking without their mouth moving at all . I also ran into a few huge framerate drops despite playing in performance mode on PlayStation 5 , though these were extremely rare . <h> The Verdict <p> Visions of Mana finally brings the long-dormant classic RPG series into the modern age , looking great and playing even better thanks to multi-layered class and skill systems that interact in clever ways . There are definitely some pacing issues and a few questionable design choices later on , and the occasional framerate drop or awkward lipsyncing can distract . But the flashy and exciting combat , deeply rewarding class system , and cast of likable characters make Visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same -- and a great game even if you have n't spent decades waiting for it . 
@@113074231 <h> Batman : Arkham Shadow -- The First Preview <h> Beware The Batman( 's punches being thrown in the living room ) . <p> Many gamers understandably felt a rush of excitement when they heard that a new Batman : Arkham game was in development , followed quickly by disappointment after learning that it would be a VR game exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 . I get it . VR has been in our lives for the better part of a decade now , and not even a full-blown Half-Life game could get core gamers interested . So what hope does Batman have ? <p> That 's ultimately for the market to decide , but what I can confidently say after playing the first 45 minutes of Batman : Arkham Shadow , out this October from Camouflaj Studios , the folks responsible for Iron Man VR , is that it 's a " real game . " Meaning , it 's not a 90-minute tech demo , like Rocksteady 's 2016 PSVR1 launch game Batman : Arkham VR clearly was ( though it was quite enjoyable ) . And I had a really good time that was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set between the events of Origins and Asylum , with the latter being the Camouflaj team 's primary inspiration . This extends to the physical structure of the campaign ; this is n't an open-world game like City or Knight , but instead a series of larger but ultimately confined play spaces you can move freely around . Given the technological and gameplay constraints in VR compared to a flat-screen game , this makes sense . But how does it actually play ? <p> Pretty well , it turns out ! I 'll be honest : I was skeptical coming into this demo . Though I had fun putting on Batman 's cowl in the aforementioned Arkham VR , there was n't much of a real game there . Camouflaj promises that Arkham Shadow is the biggest and longest game they 've ever made , and thus far I 'm inclined to take them at face value there . In fact , if anything , the onboarding takes too long . I get that players have to be taught how to execute the familiar gameplay mechanics of the Arkham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for more freedom in combat sooner than Shadow was ready to let me loose . <p> I learned how to sneak up on bad guys from behind , how to punch , how to counter , how to do finishing moves , how to throw batarangs , how to glide down from above , how to drop smoke bombs , how to grapple up to ledges , how to activate Detective Mode , how to hang upside down , and how to tie up bad guys from perches . It really is most of the stuff you do in the other Arkham games , but you get to perform the actions yourself , with your hands . <p> And you know what ? It 's pretty fun . At least , once you 're taught all the moves and get to start stringing attacks together . Was I breaking a sweat ? No , this is no Beat Saber . But you do get to throw some punches as Batman in a first-person perspective in VR and enjoy the thrill of taking down a mob of bad guys all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm out to counter a bad guy approaching from the weak side . It feels cool to grapple up to a vantage point . It feels cool to beat the ever-loving tar out of the dredges of Gotham . <p> But this is n't just a VR punch-fest . Myriad bat-characters are here , from Jim Gordon to Harvey Dent and many others -- and it 's all in service of a story revolving around the Rat King , a new foe in Gotham who wants to bring down the city 's elites . And herein lies my biggest unknown with Arkham Shadow so far : its story . It 's not that the story is bad , it 's that I really did n't see any of it in the first 45 minutes of the campaign . In fact , my demo ended just as I was about to talk to Commissioner Gordon and really get the plot moving forward . The Camouflaj crew told me that they 'd skipped me past a prologue that would 've helped set things up for me . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkham games I think of two things primarily responsible for making each one memorable : combat and story . The combat is there in a uniquely VR way , yes , but the jury is still out on the story . <h> I 've played enough to call this a real Arkham game . <p> Still , I 've played enough to call this a real Arkham game . There are tons of collectibles scattered around to find , from Rat King transmitters to rip off the wall and smash to homemade Rat King Statue of Liberty figurines , plus others Camouflaj would n't reveal yet . Unfortunately , as expected , the visuals in the Meta Quest 3 are so-so -- they 're nowhere near as pretty as Rocksteady 's Arkham trilogy . That 's to be expected in lower-power tech like this , but it 's nevertheless a bit disappointing . I would n't say Arkham Shadow looks bad , by any stretch , but this is n't a gorgeous Gotham like we 've seen in the rest of the series . <p> So where do I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the room where I started , I mean , thanks to all of my punches , turns , crouches , and stealth grabs ? I 'm quite optimistic , honestly . I really wanted to keep playing when they took the Meta Quest off my head , as the campaign really seemed to be just starting to hit its stride . Should you go out and buy a Meta Quest 3 just for this game ? It 's too early to make that call , but at the very least , it has the potential to tempt a lot of people . <p> Ryan McCaffrey is IGN 's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN 's weekly Xbox show , Podcast Unlocked , as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show , IGN Unfiltered .

It was only through the work of true-crime **26;532;TOOLONG sleuths-turned podcasters Charles-Haden Savage ( Steve Martin ) , Oliver Putnam ( Martin Short ) , and Mabel Mora ( Selena Gomez ) that anyone in the posh apartments of The Arconia came to understand the inner complexities of the victims ' lives .

It 's eventually revealed just how little Charles actually knew about one of the most important people in his life , and visions of Sazz haunt the faded TV star , coaching him through the process of avenging her . Lynch 's similar appearance to Martin was previously played as a joke on his slight build , but there 's a poignant counter in the reveal that Sazz 's height made it hard for her to find women actors to stand in for . As his investigations put Charles in contact with other stunt doubles , he struggles to prove himself worthy of being her " face " ; Martin displays a touching emotional vulnerability as his character comes to terms with just how much Sazz sacrificed for a lifetime of protecting Charles . <p> The themes of doubles , twins , and parallel lives are woven throughout season 4 thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mabel 's podcast . A trip to Los Angeles for a pitch from insistent , highly prepared movie producer Bev Mellon ( Molly Shannon , bringing the manic entitlement of her turn in The White Lotus ' first season to the role ) threatens to revive last season 's games of showbiz inside baseball and stunt casting . Thankfully , the trio quickly returns home , and the stars Bev has handpicked to play them -- Eugene Levy , Zach Galifianakis , and Eva Longoria as heightened versions of themselves -- fit neatly into the core fabric of Only Murders . <p> They each reflect the podcasters ' powerful insecurities , which are laid bare as the actors try to get into character and help with the latest murder investigation . Levy appeals to Charles ' vanity as an earnest fan of his work on the crime drama Brazzos , but becomes quickly disillusioned after seeing the way bumbling and cowardly Charles fails to live up to his smooth TV persona . With his dreams of Broadway greatness crushed by murderous producers , Oliver sees the film as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why it 's especially brutal how quickly he 's dismissed by Galifianakis , an actor the notorious clout chaser does n't even recognize at first glance .

He occasionally feigns enthusiasm just to more brutally eviscerate Oliver as a failure and fraud . <p> Mabel continues to feel adrift in her life and the series , but her role as an avatar of Millennial malaise is given new context by Longoria , who joined the project after a focus group declared the age gap between Mabel and her co-hosts " creepy .

They receive yet another set of counterparts in the so-called Westies , the residents of the apartment tower across from theirs ( and suspects in Sazz 's murder ) who turn out to be an equally odd and close knit group with plenty of secrets . The guest stars make big impressions as they provide ample opportunities for gags , particularly deeply awkward pinkeye sufferer Vince Fish ( Richard Kind ) and the Christmas obsessive Rudy ( Kumail Nanjiani ) , who crumbles under booze-fueled grilling from Longoria and Mabel . <h> Only Murders in the Building does n't just flip its usual script in season 4 -- it returns to form . <p> Season 4 also returns Only Murders in the Building to the comedy basics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an extended bit where he struggles to slickly slide a piece of paper across a conference room table while negotiating with Bev .

And while Michael Cyril Creighton did n't quite earn his elevation to the main cast in season 3 , his character fits in better this time around . Busybody neighbor Harold Morris makes for an inconsistent ally in the search for Sazz 's killer , always looking to improve his own fortunes whether through a role in the movie or his own spinoff podcast . <h> The Verdict <p> After a rocky third season , Disney+ 's Only Murders in the Building is back on track thanks to a renewed focus on its mystery and the inner complexity of its characters .

This was supported by easing global tensions , particularly in the Middle East , which had previously led to risk-averse behaviour in global markets . As concerns about potential conflicts lessened , investors moved away from the dollar and turned to riskier assets , boosting the rand 's momentum .

Here 's what you need to know : <p> What is dull skin ? <p> When skin is dull , it looks lacklustre or tired . It may have a grey hue and appear bumpy or have a rough texture . It may also be dry or patchy and uneven in tone . <p> Why does skin become dull ? <p> Internal factors like a lack of sleep , diet , stress and unhealthy habits such as smoking can cause dull skin , but external factors like UV rays and pollution also play a role . One of the main causes of dull skin is a build-up of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redundant skin cells are replaced by new skin cells as often as every 27 days ( or more frequently in teenagers , children and babies ) . As we age , this process slows down . More often than not , these dead cells accumulate on the outermost layer of the skin ( known as the epidermis ) . This may lead to clogged pores , an uneven texture and -- you guessed it -- dullness . Most of the time our skin needs a little help to remove these cells from the epidermis , which is where skincare products come in . <p> How can I brighten dull skin ? <p> Regular exfoliation is key to removing dead skin cells from the epidermis . When gently removing these cells , the skin appears brighter , smoother and more even . Plus , exfoliation also helps prevent the formation of breakouts and blackheads ( when cells accumulate on the epidermis they can clog pores , leading to the formation of blackheads and pimples ) . <p> But there 's more : When we do n't have a build-up of dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products penetrate the skin better , meaning we can reap the full benefits of active and moisturising ingredients . <p> It 's also important to include some glow-enhancing products in your daily skincare routine . One of the most important ingredients to help combat dullness is vitamin C. Known for its brightening benefits , vitamin C helps to boost the skin 's regeneration process , protects against environmental stressors and helps minimise dark marks and uneven skin tone . <p> Exfoliator : Physical scrubs containing microbeads are best avoided , as these particles may cause micro-tears in the skin . Opt for an enzymatic exfoliator such as Lamelle 's Cathepzyme 1 ( specifically for sensitive skin or first time users ) or Cathepzyme 2 ( designed for a more intensive exfoliation ) , instead . <p> Serum : A good quality vitamin C serum ( applied either in the morning , or twice daily ) , is a must-have for a brighter , more radiant complexion .

@@113565230 <h> Prioritise inclusive healthcare for people with disabilities <p> Statistics South Africa estimated that people with disabilities comprise 7.7% of the country 's population . ( Photo by Leon Sadiki/City Press/Gallo Images/Getty Images ) <p> Commonly defined as " those who have long-term physical , mental , intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others " , people with disabilities are often failed by health systems , resulting in poorer health outcomes . <p> Statistics South Africa estimated that people with disabilities comprise 7.7% of the country 's population , although this excludes children under five years old , people living in institutions , and people living with mental illness , making this a significant underestimation of actual prevalence . This number will continue to increase as the population grows and ages . <p> Essentially , disability arises from an interaction of an impairment and environmental , societal , or personal barriers . People with disabilities report barriers to accessing healthcare such as inaccessible health facilities and negative attitudes of providers . They are also excluded from many healthcare services , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) often reported as inadequate or poor . <p> All of this prompts a need for improvement in the health system to ensure that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need to lead healthy lives . This is something that we should also keep in mind as we celebrate Casual Day on Saturday 6 September to create awareness of persons with disabilities . <p> It is possible to make health systems disability inclusive . However , South Africa currently has no comprehensive tool to assess how inclusive the healthcare system is for people with disabilities . Our project is aimed at contributing to this gap . <p> We are part of a Special Olympics International ( SOI ) Rosemary Collaboratory Initiative entitled " Leveraging Research and Advocacy to Make Health Systems More Inclusive of People with Intellectual Disabilities " . SOI partnered with the Missing Billion Initiative to adapt an existing MBI system-level framework which describes the components required to create a disability-inclusive health system . The original framework is targeted at making health systems inclusive to all people with disabilities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities ( IDD ) specific module . This IDD-focused tool is being piloted in eight countries and three states in the United States . The findings of these assessments will appear in a global report on the health of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities ( PWIDD ) that Special Olympics plans to launch in 2025 . <p> Serving as consultants for South Africa , we are using the tool to assess the inclusion of persons with IDD in the country 's healthcare system . The significance of the missing billion framework is its ability to illustrate how systemic factors influence service delivery and produce outputs and outcomes relevant to people with disabilities . The tool has four system-level components and five service delivery components ( two on the demand side , and three on the supply side ) ( Fig. 1 ) . It is assumed that improving performance with respect to disability inclusion in these nine components will improve the output of this system , that is , effective service coverage and thus lead to improved health outcomes ( health status ) of people with disabilities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The preliminary findings of our desktop review and policy analysis in accordance with the MBI framework system indicators show the following : <p> In terms of governance , South Africa has been hailed for its policies which are aligned to the international laws and the Constitution . For example , South Africa signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ( CRPD ) in 2007 . However , the last country progress report of the UN convention was published in 2014 . South Africa has legislation protecting the right to health for people with disabilities in general , without any specific reference to PWIDD . There is also no independent law specifically for them . They are referenced as a priority group in the National Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan 2023-2030 ( department of health , 2023 ) . There is no independent policy for IDD in the country . <p> In health policy plans , the National Policy Framework and Strategy on Palliative Care 2017-2022 makes considerations that healthcare facilities and services must prioritise PWIDD and ensure that reasonable accommodation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible to people with disability , without specifically mentioning IDD , and fall short on how this inclusion will be implemented . <p> It remains unclear how PWIDD are represented under the ministry of health leadership . There are no dedicated health sector structures for IDD and often IDD needs are grouped under mental health action plans . We found no evidence of formal representation of PWIDD or their caregivers in the national taskforces . <p> Health financing in South Africa takes place through a two-tiered health system divided along socioeconomic lines , resulting in inequitable access to healthcare ( department of health , 2019 ) . Health services are mostly provided through the tax-funded public sector that caters for about 84% of the population , while the private sector caters for about 16% of the population through medical aid schemes . But , there is no dedicated budget allocated for disability inclusion . <p> The 2023 evaluation report of the white paper on the rights of people with disabilities highlights that budgeting for the disability sector is currently fragmented with different departments funding specific projects relevant to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary healthcare services are free at clinics for all public healthcare users and charged on a means-tested sliding scale at higher levels of care . People who receive disability grants are entitled to free healthcare at hospitals as well ( department of social development , 2016 ) . The South African Revenue Service allows for declaration of disability which allows for reclaiming of tax on disability-related purchases . <p> The used WGSS questions ask about a range of domains of functioning and do not collect specific disorder information and are therefore not able to specifically identify PWIDD , thus prohibiting disaggregation of data by IDD status . For this reason , we conclude that there is a paucity of data on IDD-related information in the country . We could not identify national data for the output indicators on service coverage and outcomes of health status because of the lack of disaggregation by IDD in the national data sets . <p> We call on the government of national unity to collaborate and partner with us on this endeavour as this assessment can help prioritise activities by policymakers , including the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth and persons with disabilities . The study will also provide many opportunities for the development of disability inclusion in the country within structures , programmes and monitoring and evaluation , and make healthcare inclusive for people with disabilities . There are opportunities to link with current efforts to implement the pillars of the White Paper on the Rights of People with Disabilities as well as harmonise disability reporting . <p> Professor Lieketseng Ned , Dr Nomvo Dwadwa-Henda and Dr Babalwa Tyabashe-Phume are affiliated with the Division of Disability and Rehabilitation Studies at Stellenbosch University . 
@@113565233 <p> The cities in which we live today can not see their edges . Citizens in the centre , the suburbs , and the outskirts are out of sight of one another . The 15-minute city is a different kind of place , instead of endless horizons , it represents compact neighbourhoods as the theatre for urban life . The 15-minute city is an emerging model from the urban global discourse conceived by Carlos Moreno , professor at Pantheon-Sorbonne University , and was first piloted by the City of Paris in 2016 . In this model , Moreno proposes an urban setup where all the primary urban services and amenities are accessed by walking within a timeframe of not more than 15 minutes . The concept is hyper-literal , meaning that people need not conduct all their activities within a 15-minute walk . The preferable mode of transport concerning this model is soft mobility , that is cycling and walking . With every aspect of the city organised in a 15-minute radius , Moreno opines that urban residents would have sufficient time for themselves , and for building and cultivating stronger social relationships , leading to more livable cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban setups , because people are trapped in traffic and the placement of critical infrastructure like road networks has always been in favour of vehicular flow , rather than humans . This results in only a few cities dedicating lanes for cyclists or walking paths . Four principles make up a 15-minute city and these are proximity , density , diversity , and digitisation . This paper intends to explore how Waterfall City , through the four principles , has been able to fulfil the 15-minute city building blocks . <p> The proximity dimension focuses on ensuring that urban residents can access urban services and amenities quickly , without spending money on travel and without having to spend unwarranted time in traffic . Furthermore , the proximity aspect enables residents to not only access services and amenities but also has much influence on how they can take care of themselves in areas like health and recreational activities . Through the proximity dimension , there can be a subtle reduction of vehicles in urban areas . Density is also regarded as a pivotal aspect in the fulfilment of the concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people that a given neighbourhood can comfortably accommodate without straining or underusing the available resources , infrastructure , and space . One of its benefits is that it enables the concentration of basic amenities within a defined radius , assisting the city to ensure that it is sufficiently equipped . This further assists in achieving an equal distribution of resources , services , and infrastructural development within urban areas . Moreno asserts density is important in solving rampant socio-economic inequalities that bedevil most contemporary urban areas . <p> Diversity is identified as a crucial principle in 15-minute city building and is understood from both the physical environment and those who occupy the city . Diversity in the physical environment alludes to the aspect of mixed-use neighbourhoods , where basic amenities and services are readily accessible . This means that the neighbourhood should comprise , at the minimum , residential , commercial , government , health , learning , and entertainment components . With those , the residents can comfortably pursue social functions . The second aspect of diversity is neighbourhoods that accommodate and encourage diverse cultures from different backgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural diversity has the potential to spur numerous benefits in the social , economic , governance , and other sectors . Digitisation is the last block of the four principles . It is a mandatory element to ensure that digital products such as sensors , cameras , and other devices are used to enhance urban security . Thus , propelling activities such as walking , and cycling into attractive and common practices . Technology further encourages novel construction methods and the use of alternative energies such as solar . <p> Waterfall City , a smart city in Johannesburg , has emerged as the continent 's fastest-growing mixed-use lifestyle precinct . This smart city , rooted in the core values of connection , commerce , care and community , offers integrated live-work-shop-play environments that are secure , ecologically sensitive , convenient , and easily accessible within a 15-minute radius . As a mixed-use development , it features everything expected from a lively modern city , secure residential estates , and retirement villages to private schools , a hospital , five-star hotels , green spaces , and fitness spaces . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has drawn global attention as a premier destination site for corporations seeking modern and strategically located spaces for their African operations . The city also has a range of dining and entertainment options , including the Mall of Africa , the largest mall on the continent , built in a single phase coupled with a fibre optic and wireless communication network and on-site alternative energy provision . <p> The year 1994 marked the dawn of a democratic South Africa . One of the issues it ushered in was that of historical urban space misuse . Urban space is a social outcome , the result of a historical process , an unequal accumulation of time , a presupposition , and a milieu of social production . The distinguishing feature of urban space is exclusion , which causes deformity and the disappearance of urban structure . Exclusion has become a permanent visual reality in cities in which walled and gated communities divide the urban tissue and take up a large part of the urban space . However , in the case of Johannesburg , the Waterfall City development has been accessible not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader Johannesburg community . The key accessibility enabler of this innovative mixed-use smart city is its accessibility to major road infrastructure . It is positioned halfway between Johannesburg and Pretoria and is interlinked by the N1 and the R55 , and from Sandton . It can be accessed through the N1 , and the N3 . Situated within the triangular area formed by Woodmead , Kyalami , and Midrand , its prime location greatly enhances the attractiveness of this development . Therefore , the city 's landscape has been strategically positioned to enable inclusive access , making it easier for individuals of all social groups to travel in and around the city . <p> Drawing on the case of Waterfall City and how it has embraced walkable urbanism in mixed-use living reflects proximity within the area . The entire city is integrated and centred around the Mall of Africa . Within the Mall radius , there are six residential estates , including a hospital , a school , and several office parks . The area is referred to as a walkable and bikeable city because it features bicycle racks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle use in the city is optional . The city 's density is proportionate to the infrastructure in the smart city . This is to propel efficient use of services and address all the residents ' needs equally . The city 's 10 residential developments house 12 000 residents in close to 6 000 homes . About 26 000 people work in the city , with continuous growth to becoming the new economic hub of South Africa , contributing over R470 million a year in rates and taxes to the City of Johannesburg . Compared to Steyn City , a smart city in the north of Johannesburg , Waterfall City is effectively cultivating sustainable development in an urban environment through dense mixed land use which promotes inclusivity , accessibility , availability , and quality amenities in proximity . <p> Waterfall City embodies diversity . The city 's corporate campus has attracted a lot of American companies and local blue-chip brands in leading industries including PwC , Cisco , Accenture , and Attacq . Accenture is one of the first companies that moved from Woodmead to Waterfall in 2018 , Cisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diverse culinary experience with upscale restaurants and coffee shops and is also home to renowned international brands such as Hugo Boss , Maxhosa , Jo Malone and Emporio Armani .

Safety and security are a prime driver for estate living and Waterfall continues to focus on creating an environment that is safe not only for its residents but for everyone living and working in the city . With a fully integrated security system that includes access control at every residential estate , business park , logistics precinct , and major retail centres , as well as a 24/7 surveillance and reaction service that is supported by a state-of-the-art management office , Waterfall takes its safety procedures seriously . <p> The primary objective of 15-minute cities has been to create inclusive and economically vibrant urban spaces by reconnecting people to their neighbourhoods and localising city life . The intention has been to bring activities to the neighbourhoods and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of proximity . Beyond proximity , the other role of 15-minute cities includes an enhanced land-use mix , the optimisation of land use by allowing for multiple functions in one place , and varied and affordable housing options . The envisioned outcome is the development of complete , self-sufficient neighbourhoods that are designed to ensure safe and convenient ways for citizens and visitors to access the amenities they need in daily life . However , many urbanists have interpreted the 15-minute cities framework as exclusionary and spatially fragmented . The exclusionary lens stems from the fact that only a particular social class can afford to live in these cities , leaving the majority trapped in overpopulated peri-urban areas . For example , in the case of Waterfall , the city is targeting South Africa 's middle class . Continuing to scale this model of urban development requires that people from a variety of backgrounds/income levels can live and work in Waterfall . The other criticism of 15-minute cities has been around practicality , that it would be difficult to reorganise cities that are already populated . Charter cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities concept . From the above information one can opine that 15-minute cities are not designed to create socially polarised cities but are designed to create inclusive socially rich neighbourhoods . <p> Hluma Luvo Ralane is the project coordinator for Africa-US City Relations . 
@@113565235 <h> Moonchild taking over the world , one festival at a time <p> Maverick : South African music sensation Moonchild , born Sanelisiwe Twisha , performed a record-breaking 10 shows at Glastonbury this year , but admits that radio hosts are cautious of her , because she refuses to censor herself on air . Photo : Grace Pickering <p> A fortnight ago I was , as per usual , over-researching for an interview . Neither " Password " nor " Password123 " worked on the old Mac desktop in my son 's room here at home . " Try our pets ' names from then , " he suggested on the phone from Cape Town where he now works . <p> Then was 2009 when he was in Grade 8 and had to do a school essay titled " My Jozi " . His focus was on Joburg musicians and I helped him get interviews with Moonchild Sanelly and Nakhane ( who was then still using Tour ? as a surname ) . Both musicians were wonderful and generous with their time for an awkward teenage boy , but one with hints of coolness . <p> I was keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating blue-haired Moonchild , whom he interviewed at a Maboneng street caf ? one afternoon after school . ( I was of course dispatched to the next table in case I tried to steal his show . ) <p> Now 15 years later it is me doing the interview . It is Moonchild again . She is frantically packing for a flight to Portugal for an upcoming show while listening to my stories and replying to my questions on the other side of a Zoom call . <p> The reason for our chat is that on her return , she will perform in the Road to Amapiano Festival happening on Saturday at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg . <p> It is a musical celebration of three decades of South African democracy , featuring influential artists and DJs such as Oskido , Thebe , Glen Lewis , Ready D , Nasty C , Tamara Dey and Boom Shaka . <p> The festival will highlight the evolution of genres such as kwaito , Afro-house , gqom , Afrotech and amapiano . <p> " It 's really nice because just going on stage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So just being celebrated is something that I 'm not used to from this country . Being seen feels good . <p> " Just to be recognised in that space as one of those people , that 's fucking amazing . " <p> Now 39 and on top of the music world , Moonchild is as unassuming , witty , bubbly , smart and engaging as back when I first encountered her in some of Joburg 's underground music haunts . <p> She shrieks with laughter when I tell her that even the pets ' names could n't open the stubborn old computer to tell us what the Grade 8 essay contains . <p> She 's genuinely interested to hear what my boy -- now a confident young architect -- is up to . <p> We have n't had a proper chat for about 15 years . <p> " It 's so nice to hear your voice again , " I tell her . <p> " It 's nice to use it , " she replies and giggles . " I do n't know if I know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus hard work , determination , commitment and talent -- is taking her around the world . In July and August it was the Womad , Green Man and Shambala festivals in the UK , followed by back-to-back gigs in Germany , Norway , Belgium , the Netherlands and France . All high-energy shows with crowds roaring back her lyrics and erupting in delight when she does her booty-shaking routines . <p> That was after her trailblazing performances at the UK 's most celebrated annual music festival , Glastonbury , which attracted 200 000 people this year . Many of them must have seen Moonchild performing -- last year she did two performances , this year she did what was probably a record-breaking 10 shows . <p> But unfortunately she can not be a fan girl at these fantastic festivals where some of the globe 's most interesting stars perform on the same bills . <p> " I ca n't even enjoy myself in real life because I have to always preserve my voice and be mindful when it 's showtime , " she tells me . <p> Moonchild does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just need to shut up because I 'll be screaming . I get excited and then I scream and my voice is so high- pitched ... It 's like , my God , I really kill it . " <p> Born Sanelisiwe Twisha , she grew up in Port Elizabeth , where her mum encouraged Moonchild onstage from a young age . Her music-filled childhood was full of creativity . Whether it was self-choreographing dance routines to Spice Girls tracks , teaching herself to play the piano , singing in church , or writing poetry , being artistically free was always encouraged . <p> She moved to Durban to study fashion . She quickly immersed herself in the buzzing music scene there , before moving to Johannesburg . <p> Here Moonchild established what is now her signature " future-ghetto-funk " sound , but life was tough , with periods of intense hardship : from the early death of her beloved mother , sexual assault , experiencing homelessness with newborn twins , and almost dying of malaria . <p> Since her award-winning debut album Rabulpha ! ( 2015 ) put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African hits . She signed to Transgressive Records in the UK , which released her second studio album Phases in 2022 . <p> Moonchild is currently working on her third album , which will be released next year . <p> One ca n't help of being reminded of that other trailblazer for being your own woman on your own terms , Brenda Fassie , especially when Moonchild unapologetically spreads the message of female sexual empowerment : " Liberation for women , in the bedroom , in the boardroom , knowing your power ... I needed to be heard by a lot of people . " <p> Moonchild says that in her songs " I 'm every girl " -- from " good girls " to " bad girls " , single ones to " side chicks " . <p> Strippers have thanked her , she says , for her hit Strip Club -- " They say thank you for representing us , because we used to hide our jobs until you spoke out loudly about us . It 's an adventure sport to own a vagina in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> With her music being unashamedly sexy , it is no surprise that her interviews are what one can call frank . Moonchild said in a 2017 interview she never censored herself in any promotional interviews , which meant that her songs would be number one on 5FM , but " on Metro FM it will never show up because it 's too provocative for black South Africa " . <p> She tells me these days local radio is behind her , enhanced by her massive success overseas . But there is still some caution because when she does a live interview , " People definitely make sure I know that they are sitting on the edge of their seats because they do n't know what 's going to come out of my mouth ... ' Did I tell you you 're not allowed to say fuck ? ' " <p> She gives a mischievous chuckle . <p> " It 's just the truth , you know , I know how to speak in biology ...

And also to be fair , I was called Vivienne Westwood at fashion school and I had to Google who it was . " <p> One of the most influential British fashion designers , the maverick Westwood was associated with the punk subculture fashion movement . <p> " Even at fashion school I never had fashion references , " Moonchild tells me . " I was the one girl who did n't have those conversations about brands . " <p> Moonchild has had a number of high-profile collaborations so far , including Wizkid , Major Lazer &amp; Diplo , Beyonc ? and Gorillaz . <p> Beyonc ? ? " She 's amazing ! " <p> And Damon Albarn , who is the brains behind the Gorillaz and Africa Express ? " He 's fucking ridiculous . I love him .

And it 's happening right in front of my eyes . " <p> I tease her that she can probably make outrageous demands now that she is a superstar . <p> " The one thing I 've learned from every living legend is humility ; it is the one common denominator , " she says seriously . <p> And what is it like before she goes on stage ? <p> " I go silent and I have a joint to calm down because I 've got a lot of energy in general .

" I 'm really just looking forward to the vibes and the people and the energy of Art Joburg because that takes over the city .

Nhlengethwa 's focus on fresh talent and new collectors underscores the fair 's role as a nurturing ground for the next generation of artists and art patrons . <p> Zanele Kumalo , who is associate director at Kalashnikovv Gallery , is eager to explore the curated spaces before the public rushes in . <p> " Taking in each gallery or project 's curation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is something she looks forward to every year . <p> It 's also an opportunity for her to catch up on exhibitions she might have missed . <p> Kalashnikovv director Zanele Kumalo <p> From Kalashnikovv , Kumalo and her team will have a range of artists , including Boemo Diale , Cinthia Mulanga , Ntsako Nkuna , Theresa-Anne Mackintosh and Yolanda Mazwana , to name a few . <p> For Zimbabwe 's First Floor Gallery , the thrill comes from the frantic pace of preparation : " Finishing the install on Thursday morning ! " <p> For them , the fair is not just about the art on display but also about the behind-the-scenes work that makes the event possible . <p> First Floor Gallery is bringing a stellar lineup to the event , including Gresham Tapiwa Nyaude , the winner of the FNB Art Joburg prize , along with Troy Makaza , Victor Nyakauru , Amanda Shingirai Mushate , Pebofatso Mokoena , Again Chokuwamba and Grace Nyahangare . <p> Bereng is excited about the new GIF section , as well as the photographic exhibitions and the stage section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show alongside one of our gallery artists " . <p> Bereng 's gallery , Stevenson , has a solo presentation on Nigerian-born artist Ruth Ige 's work and that is something she is very proud of . <p> She says that artist Robin Rhode has made a charcoal drawing for the fair featuring a BMW 3-series key . The Gusheshe ( as these cars are known in the townships ) is close to her heart , she says with a smile . She had a blue one she inherited from her parents .

" It 's very easy to get something valuable there after everything has sold out from the VIP pre-viewings , " he notes . <p> Artist Katlego Tlabela <p> His collection mostly consists of prints by young artists and close colleagues . <p> Kumalo is another collector who ca n't resist the urge to buy , despite her walls being full . " I like to support emerging artists ( which also suits my current budget ) , and I look for women artists , in particular , who are making work that feels different to what their peers are producing , " she explains . <p> For her , it 's not just about aesthetics but also about supporting artists whose work challenges trends and explores new themes . <p> With each year bringing new experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favourite editions of the FNB Art Fair . <p> For Nhlengethwa , it 's impossible to pick just one . " They are all good because each year is different , " he says , appreciating the unique energy that each fair brings . <p> Kumalo 's standout fair was in 2019 , the year Mandla Sibeko became the owner . " It was a privilege to be part of history , to have a black man at the helm of our continent 's longest-running contemporary African art fair , " she says . <p> First Floor Gallery , ever optimistic , believes that " 2024 of course ! " will be the best edition yet , reflecting their excitement and anticipation for what 's to come . <p> Art fairs are often surrounded by gossip and controversy , and the FNB Art Fair is no exception . <p> Kumalo recalls the debut of Latitudes Art Fair in the same year that Mandla Sibeko took over FNB Art Joburg . " There was some unease about having two art fairs in one city over the same time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own identities and places in the art market . <p> Artist Sam Nhlengethwa <p> First Floor Gallery takes a philosophical approach , noting : " Our industry thrives on gossip and speculation , most of it overstated and overdone .

" <p> To help you navigate the fair like a pro , we 've gathered insider tips and advice from seasoned participants . <p> Nhlengethwa emphasises the importance of focus , discipline , and self-respect . As he puts it , " The pain of discipline is better than that of regret . " <p> Bereng believes more is more . " Try to do as much as possible . You know the interesting thing about Art Joburg , my advice for Art Joburg is completely the opposite of my advice , for say , Art Basel . <p> " Art Basel I 'm like , forgive yourself ; do little bites otherwise it becomes overwhelming and try to do gently because it 's just so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come for opening evening for the thrill of a great social night out ... then come back again to really take in the art when it 's quieter and you can have more meaningful conversations with gallerists . " <p> First Floor Gallery advises visitors to take notes and use the art fair map to stay organised . <p> FNB Art Joburg is a long day , so staying hydrated is crucial . Nhlengethwa prefers a mix of water and wine , while Tlabela balances bubbly and water , warning against overindulgence . <p> Kumalo and Khosi both recommend having all options on hand , but starting with coffee and always keeping water ready in your bag . <p> Fashion is as much a part of the art fair as the art itself . Tlabela focuses on comfort , saying , " It is best to come to a public space dressed as yourself " . <p> Kumalo enjoys dressing up for key moments , often in wearable art or local designer pieces , but warns against wearing heels . <p> First Floor Gallery keeps it classic with " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comfortable shoes . <p> But whatever you wear , drink or buy , FNB Art Joburg , is not to be missed because as Bereng says : " This is the event of the year .

" Without a will as a guide , conflict can quickly erupt when emotions and financial strain run high . It is not surprising that children are a major motivator for drafting a will .

Surely the hospital has a few dripping taps or stagnant pools they could drink from ? <p> That will have to be for the committee that has been convened by Mr Premier Lesufi and Ms MEC Double-Barrelled to look into the treatment received by Mr London , as well as , presumably , the conditions generally pertaining at ( they will surely use these words ) Helen Joseph . <p> Still , you 've got to try to imagine their conversation with Mr London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean groundbreaking ? ) commitment to a committee to investigate stuff everybody else knows about already . <p> London goes over his hospital experience again , as he has now done several times , adding " as you will have seen in the video " at a few points , and Lesufi and Double- ?

@@114192232 <h> The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds ( Sanccob ) , BirdLife South Africa and CapeNature are evaluating the establishment of a land-based African penguin breeding colony at De Hoop Nature Reserve , linked to the eastward shift of small pelagic fish populations . <p> A small colony of African penguins first self-established itself in the mid-2000s at De Hoop , reaching about 18 breeding pairs with about 100 other penguins regularly visiting the colony . However , by 2008 the colony had been abandoned due to high levels of predation by caracal and there has been no penguin colony there since . <p> As the African penguin species inches towards extinction , BirdLife South Africa , CapeNature and Sanccob have been working to re-establish this land-based penguin colony in the De Hoop Nature Reserve . <p> The chosen site is important because there is a good supply of fish for the penguins with an eastward shift of small pelagic fish populations . <p> Among the leading causes behind the decline of African penguins has been food shortages . These are caused by shifts in the distributions of their prey species , namely declining small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct competition with a commercial purse-seine fishery for food . <p> BirdLife South Africa and Sanccob said that the sardine ( and to a lesser extent anchovy ) distribution had shifted to the southern Cape coast , away from the West Coast , which was historically where the largest penguin colonies were . <p> This made it harder for penguins breeding there to find food . The penguins have been unable to " follow the fish " because of a lack of safe breeding areas on the southern coast . <p> By creating a safe breeding site for them and encouraging them to breed there , the teams are helping them " colonise areas with better fish availability " , but the challenges in re-establishing this colony have been considerable with the African penguin population under huge threat of extinction . <p> The main threat being addressed through this colony is the shift in fish distribution which could offer a good supply of fish for the penguins . <h> Establishment of the De Hoop breeding colony <p> South Africa began investigating whether this would be possible in 2010 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . By 2015 , when BirdLife South Africa had secured funding ( mostly through the Isdell Family Foundation ) , they began a long process of engagement with government entities and other penguin conservation stakeholders , looking at the feasibility and desirability of such an action . <p> A site selection process was conducted and once the De Hoop Nature Reserve was chosen , the teams had an independent risk assessment drafted , and developed a management plan for the project . <p> The initial phase of the project , which began in early 2019 , was to use techniques known as " social attraction " where conservationists try to mimic an existing penguin colony by installing penguin decoys ( model penguins ) and playing penguin calls . <p> The second phase of the project began in 2021 with the support of Sanccob , to release juvenile penguins which had been hand-reared from abandoned eggs and chicks . The intention was for the penguins to imprint on the colony area and return when they were ready to breed . <p> A total of 245 penguins have been released since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 66 in 2023 , and 31 in 2024 as of August . Breeding adults were observed in June 2022 and the first two chicks were bred in October 2022 -- only one pair of penguins bred that year . <p> But the colony appears to be slowly strengthening as four pairs bred in 2023 , raising six chicks between them . <p> Christina Hagen , a Pamela Isdell Fellow of Penguin Conservation working at BirdLife South Africa , told Daily Maverick that this colony did not yet mark an improvement in the African penguin population as the project was still in the relatively early stages , but creating new colonies had the potential to help increase the population in the future . <p> She said that the De Hoop colony was a " proof of concept " that could potentially be rolled out in other suitable areas . <p> Hagen said that they expected the released penguins to return only from 2024 or 2025 , when the first released birds would be three or four years old . <p> However , the establishment of the colony is further ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released ) arrived and began breeding in 2022 . <p> BirdLife South Africa and Sanccob believe the colony may increase quite quickly , as was seen at Boulders and Stony Point went from one or two pairs to more than 100 within a few years -- this took six years at Boulders and 19 years at Stony Point , due to predation impacts . <p> Predation and other setbacks <p> Sanccob and BirdLife South Africa told Daily Maverick that the main challenge was predation . African penguins are especially vulnerable to predation when breeding on the mainland by terrestrial predators such as leopard and caracal . <p> Despite having constructed a predator-proof fence at De Hoop , a honey badger managed to get into the colony in March 2024 and killed 11 penguins , some of which were preparing to breed . <p> The loss of these penguins was a huge setback to the establishment of the colony , but not unprecedented when looking at the establishment of other African penguin colonies on the mainland . <p> The Stony Point colony at Betty 's Bay had several predation events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1980s and it is now considered the third-largest penguin colony in South Africa . <p> Since the incident in March , the teams have reinforced the fence and have plans for longer-term solutions , such as potentially installing a second fence . <p> Since the honey badger predation , penguin activity has slowly increased again at the colony . <p> One pair is raising two chicks and there are eight other penguins regularly seen on the camera . The honey badger has been detected by cameras along the fence , but has not managed to access the colony again . <h> Collaborative conservation effort <p> BirdLife South Africa and Sanccob told Daily Maverick that creating a new colony was also a way of diluting threats to penguins by spreading the risk between colonies . <p> Elaborating on this , the teams said that most of the remaining large colonies are near ports with a higher risk of oil spills and disturbance from underwater noise . De Hoop is far from any ports , reducing that risk . <p> BirdLife South Africa is the lead project partner and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the predator fence , day-to-day maintenance , monitoring of the infrastructure and penguins , and employs a full-time staff member to work on the project . <p> CapeNature is the landowner , provides logistical support and assists with monitoring . Sanccob is responsible for the penguin releases , from hand-rearing the penguins to the logistics of the release . <h> Penguin release and breeding activities <p> There have now been 245 penguins released at the colony , thanks to Sanccob 's rigorous egg and chick-rearing procedures . <p> During the hand-rearing process , the Sanccob team limits handling and interactions to a minimum and these occur only when necessary . Typically , there are large cohorts of penguin chicks undergoing care and this assists them in retaining their wild instincts . <p> Environmental conditions can affect the success of penguins going out to sea for the first time , therefore the teams seek optimal weather conditions which include low sea swell and the absence of windy conditions . <p> Penguins are transported to the De Hoop site a day before the planned release and housed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa and Sanccob team . <p> This is to allow the birds to familiarise themselves with their new surroundings . The next day , they are given their last " free " meal of sardines before the enclosure is opened to allow them to wander into the ocean at their own pace . The rest is up to them . <p> The penguins are released at an age when they would naturally fledge from the colony , around three to four months old . <p> They go to sea and spend most of the next three to six years in the water , coming ashore only to moult ( replace all their feathers ) . Not much is known about this period , but the teams said penguins needed to learn how to find food and probably spend some time investigating different areas . <p> From the few tracking studies , it seems that many go west and north , up the West Coast of South Africa , with some going into Namibian waters before returning to South Africa . When they are ready to breed , BirdLife South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony where they hatched . <p> In this case , the team hopes that they will choose the De Hoop colony . <p> This has not happened yet as so far none of the penguins observed breeding have been penguins released at De Hoop , and the teams do not know the origin of the birds that have bred . <p> As the colony is in a highly delicate and vulnerable stage , the teams are trying to cause as little disturbance as possible . A transponder ( microchip ) ground reader was installed , which can detect if a penguin walking across the antenna has an implanted microchip . <p> All the penguins released have microchips and there is an intensive programme to microchip penguins in other colonies to monitor survival , movements and breeding . <p> The teams have also installed a pan-tilt-zoom camera , which allows them to monitor the penguins remotely . <p> CapeNature spokesperson Petro van Rhyn told Daily Maverick that the breeding birds indicated that the colony was being used by the birds , but this was a long-term project , which would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 10 years to establish as a formal African penguin breeding colony , " she said . <p> Challenges such as additional changes in fish migration patterns can not be predicted , and land and sea-based predators could harm the success of the colony . <p> " This is a long-term project with many variables , the success of which will only be established in years to come , " van Rhyn said .

@@114192235 <h> Business Maverick <h> DRIVING VIOLATION <h> Beware the lemon -- what to look out for when buying a second-hand car <h> A cautionary tale about the pitfalls of buying a second-hand car , plus tips on how to make sure the same thing does n't happen to you . <p> Money Cents reader Emma bought a second-hand Opel Vivaro in March 2022 , and was a little suspicious when she found there was no service book in the cubbyhole . " I asked the smooth salesman , and he said it 's all digital and he 'll get it to me asap , " she recalls . <p> However , five days later she was alarmed when the car stopped dead in a rural area late at night -- with her kids in the back seat . " The alternator had melted . A lot of backwards and forwards later , and the dealer agreed to pay for a new alternator , " she says . <p> However , that was just the start of her troubles . The car started leaking oil about four months later . It was n't showing any warnings from the electric control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I took it for a service and to have the oil leak looked at , only to find that the engine block was cracked and a gasket had blown , " she says . The dealership had by this stage stopped responding to her , other than to say it was n't its problem . <p> Emma laid a complaint with the Motor Industry Ombudsman of South Africa , which responded that the implied warranty is void because the car was in for a service . The Retail Motor Industry Organisation was keen to help , but Emma found the dealership is not a member . So she hired a lawyer at great personal cost . <p> The case dragged on through the National Consumer Commission , which eventually gave her a notice of non-referral , so Emma 's lawyer referred the matter to the National Consumer Tribunal and was granted a hearing in January 2024 . <p> " The lawyer agreed with me , but did not pass the message on until nine months later , " Emma says . <p> Her legal fees have racked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forked out for repairs . " I 've now been told the car is irreparable . The body electric control unit was broken . The wheel hubs and bearings are broken . The entire engine and turbo system had to be replaced . The bodywork was glued together . ( I discovered this when pieces started falling off . ) <p> " And I am still waiting for the tribunal hearing -- between the lawyers trying to ' find a date that suits them ' , " she says . <p> To compound matters further , the car was financed through a bank , which has issued a notice before summons , forcing her into debt review to prevent a judgment . <p> " The notice specifically said I did not have to pay if the matter was before the tribunal , which it was , but Absa went ahead with the action anyway , " she says . <p> As Emma succinctly puts it : " I 'm paying R5,000 a month for the pleasure of a lemon that literally does not go anywhere , and off-the-charts legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She never received a service history , and has since discovered there is no record whatsoever of the vehicle on Lightstone Auto or on VIN Lookup . <p> As the cost of new cars continues to rocket , buying a second-hand car has never made more sense -- more so when you consider that a new car loses value as soon as you drive it off the showroom floor . <p> To avoid getting landed with a lemon like Emma did , use these pointers before putting any money down or signing any paperwork : <p> Go for a test drive . Turn off the radio and listen for any strange engine sounds . Pay attention to the handling -- for example , does the car drag to one side ? It may need wheel alignment , or it could be a sign of a more serious problem . <p> Inspect the car carefully in a well-lit area . " Look for bodywork damage or signs of repainting , check that the interiors look good , switch on lights , indicators and wipers to make sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doors and windows . Do n't be shy of the seller 's thoughts . This is your money at stake , " advises Ernest North , cofounder of digital insurer Naked . <p> Do your research . In addition to requesting the car 's service history from the seller , check the vehicle identification number against the South African Insurance Association 's vehicle salvage database to check the car 's history . This will tell you all sorts of useful things , such as whether it has ever been written off . <p> Use Lightstone Auto to find out more about the car 's repair history . A verification and repair history report costs R128,15 and could save you thousands in the long run . <p> Ask a mechanic to have a look at the car . If you do n't have a mechanic you trust to do this , you can book a technical inspection via Dekra Automotive . DM <p> This story first appeared in our weekly Daily Maverick 168 newspaper , which is available countrywide for R35 . <h> Comments <p> I bought a Fiat 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good dekra report , but within a week was overheating . The head cylinder was cracked and it 'll cost me R32000 . Webuycars said the cars are bought voetstoets , so claim no responsibility .

@@114192236 <h> Maverick Citizen <h> MEDICAL INTERVENTION OP-ED <p> President Cyril Ramaphosa and delegates at the public signing into law of the National Health Insurance Bill at the Union Buildings on 15 May 2024 in Pretoria , South Africa . ( Photo : Gallo Images / Frennie Shivambu ) . <h> There is a critical need for public sector and private sector healthcare reform that transcends political posturing and vested interests , and prioritises the health needs of all South Africans . <p> In the weeks leading up to the 2024 general election , the National Health Insurance ( NHI ) Act , signed by President Cyril Ramaphosa on the eve of the election , became one of the issues that polarised people in South Africa . Sadly , despite the formation of a Government of National Unity ( GNU ) , the polarisation around health reform and NHI has continued . Most notably , Business Unity South Africa as well as significant sectors of the medical fraternity declined to sign the presidential health compact , because of its perceived uncritical endorsement of NHI . <p> Meanwhile , reports of the challenges and crises besetting the public health system mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Joseph Hospital made by the broadcaster Tom London went viral and caused widespread outrage and condemnation . A recent report by the Academy of Science of South Africa highlighted leadership instability , lack of transparency , insufficient accountability mechanisms and pervasive corruption as key challenges of the South African health systems . <p> In addition , growing waiting lists of patients for cancer treatment , medico-legal claims running into billions of rands , staff and medicine shortages and widespread corruption continue to plague the health system . <p> On the other hand , the challenges in the private health sector , especially unaffordability and cost escalations , have been well documented by , among others , the Competition Commission 's Private Health Market Inquiry ( HMI ) . The high rates of Caesarean sections in the private health sector , recently highlighted by the South African Medical Research Council , raise concerns about clinical governance in the private health sector . <p> Given the heated ideological divides that seem to exist in the NHI debates you might be forgiven for thinking that finding consensus on healthcare reform is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that there is substantial common ground among medical practitioners , public health activists , government and the private sector . <p> This became evident in the findings of a research study conducted in 2021/22 by Concentric Alliance and SECTION27 . In-depth interviews were conducted with 33 health sector leaders to " see what stakeholders in the health system ( when they are away from the public eye ) agree on , what they disagree on , and whether there is a possibility of bringing them closer together ... " <p> The interviews revealed significant opportunities for alignment across these sectors , unanimously agreeing that universal access to quality healthcare remains the overarching goal . <p> This consensus underscores a critical need for public sector and private sector healthcare reform that transcends political posturing and vested interests and prioritises the health needs of all South Africans . <h> Nuanced perspective <p> The research indicated that public discourse on NHI has oversimplified opinions into " pro-NHI " and " anti-NHI " camps . Many stakeholders said they supported the Act 's fundamental objective of ensuring universal health coverage while expressing valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This nuanced perspective challenges the polarising narratives and highlights a spectrum of viewpoints that deserve thoughtful consideration in policy deliberations . <p> Of course , the health system faces difficult challenges , but South Africa has the capability to run a high-quality healthcare system , if you take into account the skills and resources that exist across public , private , academic and NGO health sectors . <p> The interviews revealed that most public health leaders and activists believe there is room for practical collaboration on programmes and reforms that would fix health . <p> Some of the areas identified by interviewees include : <p> Addressing the significant failings in primary healthcare with a specific focus on disease prevention and health promotion ; <p> Improving access to healthcare services in rural areas ; and <p> Upgrading the infrastructure and systems of the public health sector , inclusive of health facilities , information and communications technology ( ICT ) , procurement and logistics systems . <p> The research also highlighted opportunities for leveraging private sector expertise in ICT , procurement and logistics management to strengthen public healthcare infrastructure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness within the NHI framework , paving the way for sustainable healthcare improvements across the public and private health sectors . <p> The research drew attention to those issues that divide us : concerns about the mechanisms by which NHI will be governed , the powers allocated to the minister of health , the future of medical aid schemes , and myriad other contentious issues within the Act . <p> Most interviewees felt the Bill ( now Act ) had failed to address the structural issues within the health system such as the massive inequalities in resources between the private and public health sectors and between urban and rural South Africa , the massive skills shortages , the need to strengthen primary healthcare services , the high costs of medicines and medical care , and the variability in quality and outcomes across the sector . <h> Missed opportunities <p> If there is so much consensus why are n't we moving forward ? <p> The reason is simple : we allow the issues that we think divide us ( some real , some perceived ) to paralyse us . The opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the public and private healthcare sectors is unaddressed . <p> This is why we believe there is an urgent need for all parties to deeply listen to one another , and compromise when necessary , to agree on confidence-building measures that bridge the trust deficit and foster effective partnerships for health sector transformation that is in the interest of all South Africans . <p> Health services , which form an important part of the social safety net for the most vulnerable sections of the population , are in serious need of urgent intervention . <p> Both sectors , notwithstanding challenges , collaborated well to serve the nation during Covid-19 . There were important lessons to be learnt that should pave the way towards a more unified national health system . These include vaccines being procured for the country as a whole and supplied to both sectors , providers collaborating to ensure adequate coverage of mass immunisation on a scale not seen before , and a shared information system to track vaccine coverage and hospital bed utilisation . <p> The Concentric Alliance and SECTION27 report recommends two mechanisms to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stakeholders should pursue an objective-driven approach that sets achievable outcomes for the private and public sectors . These could be partnerships on specific issues like revitalising primary healthcare , strengthening health promotion and overcoming logistics challenges within the health system . <p> They could be targeted at health outcomes such as improved postnatal care or eradicating backlogs and waiting lists in the treatment of dread diseases like cancer . Achieving objectives collectively will demonstrate commitment to mutual goals and build trust . <p> In the longer term , there is a need for a consensus-building process to reconcile divergent perspectives and foster constructive evidence-based dialogue and policy options without compromising fundamental principles of equity , equality and universality . <p> The purpose of such a process should be to address the health system 's structural issues and realise section 27 of the Constitution , which says all in South Africa have the right to access healthcare services . Such a process must be political and technical . Technical leaders should be responsible for developing solutions to structural and technical problems , while political leadership should be reality-testing such solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should evaluate the impact of these solutions . <h> Seize the moment <p> The GNU and the debate around NHI ( despite being polarised ) is a once-in-a-generation policy window of opportunity to fix and cohere our health system . We dare not miss it . <p> The agreement between the political parties serves as a basis for renewed engagement on health reform and the mechanisms by which access to universal and quality healthcare can be achieved . Failure to seize this opportunity now will result in years of legal battles over the NHI Act and will continue to stymie the attainment of urgently needed health reform . <p> The implementation of the NHI will take several years . This creates the space for sequencing steps over the years as described in the NHI Act . If pauses of certain clauses in the NHI Act are required , this should be considered at a political level , to create the space to find consensus and common ground . <p> Amid the mud-slinging , a pivotal opportunity to advance the objectives laid out in the Constitution has emerged . The inclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to improving key health system objectives -- a mandate transcending partisan interests and personal agendas . <p> The urgency for reform in the health system is measured in lives lost or saved , disease prevented and dignity and equality of opportunity protected . <p> There is still significant underutilised capacity within the private health sector , including specialist capacity , beds and expensive health technology , while the public sector is significantly strained by the huge and increasing service demands . <p> The repercussions of inaction and failure to collaborate could be profound , underscoring the critical need for stakeholders to engage earnestly and proactively in shaping the future of healthcare in South Africa .

@@114319231 <p> SoftBank Corp . ( " SoftBank " ) and Intelsat have inked a collaboration agreement , which will result in the introduction of a single " ubiquitous network " that will allow users to stay connected wherever they go . Both companies will collaborate on the research and development of seamless 5G links between terrestrial mobile and satellite communications networks . <p> Telecommunications are critical in a culture where everyone and everything is becoming increasingly reliant on remaining connected , convenient , and always-on . However , despite the impending realization of autonomous mobility via automobiles , ships , drones , and other vehicles , many regions still lack ground-based mobile network coverage and require separate devices and accounts to connect to non-terrestrial networks . <p> With the ease of a single device and account , SoftBank and Intelsat hope to work together to create a hybrid communication solution that would enable customers to stay connected via accessible networks , whether terrestrial or satellite , wherever in the globe . The solution will help accelerate the commercial adoption of mobility solutions based on new 3GPP 5G standards for non-terrestrial networks . It will do this by building on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently allow devices to roam between terrestrial cellular networks . <p> Hideyuki Tsukuda , Executive Vice President and CTO of SoftBank , said , " By using technology that switches between terrestrial mobile networks and satellite communication networks through roaming , we can integrate the two previously separate networks and utilize satellite communication as an extension of mobile communication . Through this joint research and development , SoftBank and Intelsat will aim to build a ubiquitous network where people and things around the world can be connected to communication anytime , anywhere . " <p> One of the collaboration 's primary goals is to create a universal device that will remain linked no matter where it moves in the world . For example , a future connected vehicle outfitted with such a gadget will be able to easily transition to a non-terrestrial satellite communication network when outside of terrestrial mobile network coverage . The proposed approach is intended to have widespread commercial applications , including land mobile , maritime , and catastrophe response and recovery . <p> Intelsat and SoftBank will design , develop , field test , and commercialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the new 3GPP 5G non-terrestrial network standards . The resulting hybrid solutions will enable the use of existing satellite terminals in the short term , as well as the introduction of newer 5G-based terminals . <p> " Intelsat and SoftBank share a pioneering vision of ubiquitous networking and seamless interoperability between satellite and terrestrial networks , " said Bruno Fromont , Intelsat Chief Technology Officer . " Until now , the challenge was aligning standards that allowed the two different networks to connect . With recent progress on 5G-based standardization of non-terrestrial networks led by Intelsat at 3GPP and this strategic collaboration with SoftBank , we are ideally positioned to accelerate the design and practical implementation of commercial hybrid services that will allow devices to freely roam between satellite and terrestrial networks .

@@114440235 <h> ANC leaders have been occupied with memorial services for Pravin Gordhan , but they still have major political decisions to make -- ones that could determine the future of the national coalition . In Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay , the crucial question is whether the local ANC will work with the DA . ANC MPs have accepted working with the DA , but forcing ANC councillors to do the same may prove more difficult . <p> The decision by ActionSA to no longer work with the DA in Tshwane , but instead to cooperate with the ANC , presents the national ANC leadership with a major decision -- either to force the DA out of power in Tshwane or to solidify their national coalition with the DA by working with it in the capital . <p> To regain control in Tshwane , the ANC would need to work with the EFF in addition to ActionSA . This poses a key question for the national ANC : Can it approve working at the municipal level with a party it could not agree with at the national level ? <p> The EFF has been an unreliable partner for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ANC councillors pushed and shoved each other . In Joburg , the EFF refused to vote in favour of a motion to approve a loan for the city , in retaliation for the ANC removing the EFF 's Gauteng leader , Nkululeko Dunga , as MMC for finance in Ekurhuleni . <p> The fact that the EFF and the ANC were unable to reach agreement in negotiations about the national coalition reveals the deep tension between them . <p> In Nelson Mandela Bay , a similar question is presenting itself ( without the role of ActionSA ) . The ANC and the DA each have 48 seats on the council and the ANC has previously supported a mayor from a much smaller party . <p> Now it seems that a decision will have to be made there , too . <p> This raises the spectre of another problem the ANC has not faced before . <p> One of the major reasons the national coalition has worked ( so far ) is that ANC MPs have been disciplined and voted according to their instructions to support a DA Deputy Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Council of Provinces . <h> Rebellious councillors <p> It is not certain that ANC councillors would be capable of such orderliness . <p> There is plenty of precedent , going back to Tlokwe in 2013 , that reveals how often ANC councillors have rebelled against their national leadership . Famously , Tlokwe councillors only voted for the candidate they were instructed to after each councillor had an individual meeting with the then ANC secretary-general , Gwede Mantashe , and the then president , Jacob Zuma . Such a personal approach would be unlikely to work now . <p> In Mangaung last year , ANC councillors voted for a DA candidate as Speaker -- not as part of a coalition but in stark defiance of their instructions . <p> In Ditsobotla in North West , ANC structures have almost routinely ignored the instructions of the national ANC ( leading to the town having two people claiming the mayorship ) . <p> To add to the problems of the national ANC leadership , councillors who refuse to obey their instructions could argue they were doing so out of principle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some might well say they represented wards where voters opposed any deal with the DA . <p> Hence , a major factor in the national ANC 's decision about coalitions in municipalities is whether it can enforce its will on its municipal politicians . No matter which way it goes , the result may be chaos . <p> If the party decides to work with the EFF and ActionSA , and spurns the DA , then the ANC coalitions at the municipal level will differ from those at the national level . <p> If it decides to work with the DA and its councillors rebel against that decision , it will show that the ANC 's national leadership has lost control of parts of the party . <p> In reality , the ANC 's national leadership lost control of some of its structures a long time ago . That the party has arrived at this situation reveals just how weak the national ANC 's control over these structures is . <h> Eye on the future <p> That is not nearly the end of the problem . The ANC 's national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other parties will help or hinder those parties in the 2026 municipal elections . <p> This gives rise to another conundrum : whether the national ANC believes the national coalition will be a vote-winner or a vote-loser for it in those polls and the elections in 2029 . <p> This could lead to difficult soul-searching by the party 's leaders . <p> What is clear though is that if the ANC were to reject ActionSA , Herman Mashaba would be left hanging in the wind . He will have broken a consistent promise to never work with the ANC , only to then be rejected by it and still out of power . <p> In Tshwane , his party will presumably have lost the position of deputy mayor . This could lead to infighting at ActionSA , which has yet to hold a leadership conference . <h> Comments <p> Great piece . When you distil things down to the lowest possible denominator , the ANC has a membership problem . It 's a bottom -up organisation where advancement often needs to be purchased . Leadership and their decisions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always prevails <p> Either way the ANC is done for . The only increase in the voter base of significance has been those abstaining . The majority of people do not trust politics as a way out . When taxpayers join them , we shall see . <p> The ANC must take hard decisions but is simply too sh*t scared to move in any positive direction thus avoiding alienation across various fronts . Mashaba is inept and is a dead loss . The DA has the strength and will to make things work but Ramaphosa is the weak link and dithers endlessly . As usual . <p> The ANC has long been a Ponzi scheme , where you buy your way to positions of power ( and access to wealth ) . Its problem is that coalitions are upsetting the trough at provincial and local level , so at these levels , contestation is how to keep the faces in the trough and not giving it up to others . <p> What makes me laugh is now , 30 years on from 1994 , many of the original ANC councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire to their beach houses . And who takes their place -- their own children ! <p> How are you all feeling about your ActionSA , RizeMzansi ( et al ) votes now ? Keeping the ANC in power and settling for any ' bones ' that are thrown towards them ? Must feel like that vote really made an actual difference to our country . <h> DM168 <h> DM168 <p> We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits .

@@114440237 <h> Be afraid , be very afraid : Darkroom Contemporary 's spectacular ' autoplay ' urges us to get off autopilot <h> autoplay is a new dance-centric operatic experience that 's been created through a choreographed interaction between humans and machines . It 's also a meditation on the degree to which our autonomy is being subsumed by the technologies we 've so willingly embraced , perhaps with too little questioning of the existential threat that this not-so-Brave New World poses to our humanity . <p> Fantastical shadows danced on the high walls of the vast , warehouse-like space . They shimmered and fluttered like huge , depthless wraiths , afterimages emanating from the four dancers repeating a sequence of gestures on the square turntable that comprised most of the performance area . The gestures formed part of a physical language that was simultaneously strange and familiar . There was a haunting soundtrack , too , something eerily electronic , digital yet apparently composed from human elements . <p> At some point in the show , the voice of singer and actress Inge Beckmann , who was clad in the same fake-looking , straight-fringe crop-style wig as the dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my guts , broke my heart a bit . Her mournful , plaintive warbling resonated and resounded through the vastness of space , transforming what had until that point felt like an avant-garde ballet into a kind of edgy , alternative opera . Or perhaps it was a kind of futuristic ritual , an amalgamation of captivating dance moves , semi-synthetic music , hypnotic human vocal gymnastics , and the relentless , though sometimes indiscernible intrusion of technologies , some of them ancient and some brand new . <p> It was in these moments of triumphant symbioses that the show became a kind of riveting , propulsive gesamtkunstwerk , a work of art incorporating myriad mediums , a coming together of disparate components to create something far richer and more profound than the mere sum of its parts . <p> Baked into this thrilling whole was the playfulness , the dry wit , the clever physical puns and heavy supply of symbolism , and the endless variety of allusions to an overwhelming body of research . Philosophy , religious references , randomness and chance , nature versus nurture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithmic constraint ... All manner of insights had been brought together to create some semblance of an unfolding narrative while avoiding anything as straightforward or simple as a beginning-middle-end story with easy answers as the reward for your attention . <p> Vuyelwa Phota in autoplay . ( Photo : Oscar O'Ryan ) <p> Instead , autoplaygives rise to endless questions about the ways in which , each day , we relinquish our autonomy to machines . It asks what happens when we allow an algorithm to dictate the next step . Whether that step is the next sequence in a choreographic dance piece or the next step in our evolution , what this dance-opera confronts the audience with is a perplexing theory : what happens if human creativity itself is consumed by the artificial processes being developed in the Silicon Valleys of the world . <p> Making this horrifying philosophical question bearable , though , is the fact that this disturbing eventuality is being imagined and rendered visible by real people -- what we witnessed in that makeshift performance space was a cast of flesh-and-blood dancers and actors and musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the performers all wear identical wigs to impose a kind of rigid sameness that hints that they might be automata or robots , it is impossible to suppress their inner light , their soulfulness , their urge to express themselves . Because it is the soul -- or whatever term you wish to use to describe that pulse which drives us from within -- that makes us dance , play , create , love , feel , move forward . It 's that spirit that makes us human . <p> Even as these dancers move in synch , perform according to a preordained choreography , attempt to convey a sense of robotic mechanisation , their organic nature is there . And , unlike robots , they possess passion . <p> And so their synchronised movements , their beautiful and sometimes weird gestures , the slaps against their thighs or stomping of their feet on the wooden stage , all of these choreographic components that have been developed as part of a unique dance vocabulary are reminders of our ability to create simply by playing . <p> Playfulness being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the four dancers pushing their proverbial office chairs-on-wheels around the stage . A proverbial game of " musical chairs " that might put you in mind of some servant-like office minion who one day loses his or her mind and goes sailing down the corporate corridor using that chair as a means of metaphoric escape . <p> Such images -- and there are so many clever and inspired ones in this show -- suggest the variety of ways in which the human imagination can be mustered to sustain our autonomy , to keep us looking at the world through the eyes of a child , or to experience life with that same new-to-the-world amazement and awe that must have possessed Adam and Eve before they ate the apple of knowledge . <p> Bronwyn Craddock and Darion Adams in autoplay . ( Photo : Oscar O'Ryan ) <p> In autoplay , that apple is among the many symbols that turn up to play tricks on the audience , to send our imaginations and intellects racing . From the apple in the book of Genesis to Apple computers and iPhones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of autoplay 's hybrid mix of artistic forms is the music , a dazzling interplay of human voice , digitisation , improvisation and live mixing . Created by Beckmann with composers Njabulo Phungula and Brydon Bolton , the soundscape is a captivating force , edging the work into a kind of alternate universe , somewhere between worlds , at the intersection of organic and synthetic , human and digital . It does n't merely haunt , it consumes the air molecules , makes your brain feel as though it 's vibrating at an alternate frequency . <p> Along with the layering of Beckmann 's voice and other composed components of the score , the rich soundscape was further being created and modified live thanks to some wizard-level real-time recording and sampling that was happening , imperceptibly , via the twiddling of knobs and buttons at the sound desk just beyond the edge of the performance space . <p> It 's this kind of thrilling interaction between human and technological creativity that sparks autoplay 's quandary : what happens if these things -- dancing , creative expression , human voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real , authentic , organic , and tinged by tiny imperfections -- become somehow subsumed by machines , infiltrated by digital corrections , polished and perfected by algorithms that know us and know our hopes , desires , and even our dreams , better than we know ourselves ? Do we really want to live in a perfectly artificial world ? <p> While autoplay sets out to ponder this philosophical dilemma , what it does not do is provide solace . Nor does it pretend to have the answers . <p> Louise Coetzer , who choreographed this work , is far too smart , way too invested in making art ( as opposed to simplistic entertainment or empty spectacle ) , to pretend she has answers . What she and her apparently inexhaustible creative team have done , is create an experiment that instead amplifies the questions she wants to explore -- and in so doing they 've transformed philosophical and intellectual issues into an absorbing and exhilarating performance that grips you from start to finish . <p> Coetzer , who is part of a multi-disciplinary collective called Darkroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is mind-bending in its complexity and in its capacity to prod at pressing issues . She is known for incorporating elements of chance into her shows , meaning that not only are no two performances identical , but there are heightened demands on the performers . This element of randomness adds an edge , too , keeping the cast on their toes to an almost alarming level . They are dancing , moving , singing according to a playbook , but there are moments throughout when the unfolding action might be altered in some or other way . <p> Coetzer likens it to those old " choose your own adventure " books some of us grew up reading , where decisions made on impulse or taste or preference could send the narrative in a new direction and fundamentally change the outcome . <p> With autoplay , there is to some extent a slightly disturbing sense that despite the choices offered there is nevertheless something preordained -- even automatic -- about the outcome . Even in the moment when the audience is offered the chance to affect the outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is in fact a distraction , that in fact the future has already been mapped out , the outcome predetermined , that something akin to fate ( or authoritarian control ) does in fact steer our evolution . <p> Perhaps the point Coetzer hopes to make is that even the slightest opportunity to act , to participate and to have a voice , is valuable . Even the tiniest gesture of agency is better than giving away our sovereignty to agents of technological control . <p> autoplay is in some sense the story of Creation , only what it explores is a brand new beginning . It 's not quite the Garden of Eden , although there are certainly Apples that provide access to infinite knowledge , so much as it is a world where we humans , via our proliferating technology , are in a sense reengineering our genesis . Our technologies now enable us to reconstruct ourselves not so much in God 's image , but as a series of godlike 1s and 0s . <p> This dance-opera is not only about technology and its strangely parasitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by AI . The performance itself has been guided by Coetzer 's deep-dive research into generative AI , and her experiments with it as a creative partner . What has emerged is an important work that highlights some of the great possibilities as well as some of the potentially damning consequences of the digital age . The great question is to what extent we have surrendered or are willing to surrender our autonomy to the algorithms that hide in the machines we now share our most private and intimate lives with . <p> It could so easily have descended into something flat and empty and awful , but in the hands of this extremely capable -- and very smart -- creative team it is instead vital , alarming and exquisitely challenging . <p> And it is important . Because this show is also evidence of live performance 's enduring capacity to captivate and enthral us like nothing else . <p> It 's only fault -- for me at least -- was the fact that I was sitting down to watch it instead of standing on the edge of the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , felt the pull of something urgent and devastating . Sometimes merely watching does n't feel right . And that , I think , is the point of this show : it urges you to participate . To play a little with your body , mind and soul , and do whatever it takes to avoid autopilot . DM <p> autoplay will be performed until 28 September at an unnamed site within Longkloof Studios in Gardens , Cape Town . Tickets available from Quicket . A special Heritage Day performance on 24 September at 4pm will be followed by an artist discussion and Q&amp;A session . <h> DM168 <h> DM168 <p> We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits .

@@114441235 <h> The cost of a cyber breach goes way beyond money <p> This is according to cyber security experts within the Cyber Security Special Interest Group ( SIGCyber ) of the Institute of Information Technology Professionals South Africa ( IITPSA ) . <p> Financial costs <p> Bryan Baxter , SIGCyber member and enterprise account manager at BC Technologies , says : " Estimating the true cost of a cyber security breach is challenging . According to the latest IBM ? Cost of a Data Breach report , the global average cost of a data breach is $4,88-million , with South Africa estimated at $2,78-million . " <p> The costs of each breach vary , however . He says the impact of a cyber breach could be determined through a number of variables , including the nature and size of the business and the organisation 's level of preparation . <p> Baxter says : " The costs of a cyber breach can range from thousands to millions of Rand . For example , costs for a Business Services organisation ( turnover : R100-million , 100 employees ) and a Manufacturing organisation ( Turnover : R1,146-billion , 11 000 employees ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breach , an investigation is required to determine the extent of the breach , the data affected , how many records were involved , the source of the breach and whether the breach has been contained . These investigations may require the assistance of cybersecurity experts . Of course , the larger the breach , the higher the cost of resolving it . " <p> Big impacts on smaller entities <p> SIGCyber member and a Professor in the School of IT at Nelson Mandela University , Professor Kerry-Lynn Thomson , points out that while massive financial losses make headlines , individuals and small businesses can also suffer catastrophic losses due to cyber security breaches . <p> " When cyber breaches occur , it is most often the large organisations that grab the headlines . However , each day , individual online users are affected by cyber breaches -- the cost of which can be complex and devastating , " she says . <p> Prof Thomson says : " Individuals affected by cyber breaches are , most likely , not skilled cybersecurity professionals and would have to deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cost of a cyber breach for individuals could range from the inconvenience of changing passwords , securing accounts , and dealing with long-term privacy concerns from exposed sensitive information -- to , more seriously , direct financial loss , such as stolen funds or the cost of recovering from identity theft , including legal fees . <p> " Further to this , individuals may have to spend a significant amount of time to address cyber breaches , including contacting financial institutions or authorities . In the case of identity theft , for example , it is estimated that it could cost individuals an average of 200 hours of their time in resolving these issues . " <p> From an emotional point of view , victims often experience stress and anxiety caused by an invasion of privacy and financial losses , she adds . " The sense of violation that comes from having private data exposed could lead to victims feeling vulnerable and helpless . Many victims also struggle with the loss of trust , not only in the affected platforms or services , but also in the broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities they once took for granted . " <p> Therefore , while it is difficult to quantify the cost of a cyber breach for individual online users , there is no doubt that it affects not only their financial stability , but also their emotional well-being and quality of life , she says . <p> Racking up indirect costs <p> SIGCyber member and Nexio head of department , Doctor Mafuwafuwane , says : " Apart from the immediate financial expenses related to data recovery , system repairs , forensic investigations and potential fines from regulatory bodies , organisations often suffer reputational harm , leading to a loss of customer trust , decreased sales and diminished market value , which are challenging to quantify . <p> " Additionally , legal costs resulting from lawsuits or non-compliance issues further compound the financial impact that organisations must bear , highlighting the fact that the effects of a cyber breach extend well beyond the initial incident . " <p> Individuals also face distinct consequences from cyber security breaches , including emotional distress , identity theft and the loss of personal information . These personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring credit and combating fraudulent activities , he adds . <p> On a personal level , the rise in scams and identity theft in South Africa further demonstrates how breaches affect financial stability and mental well-being , underscoring the need to comprehend the multifaceted costs of cybersecurity breaches . <p> " The psychological burden , which includes concerns about personal safety and disruptions to daily digital activities , can have significant implications for overall well-being . Therefore , gaining a comprehensive understanding of the financial ramifications of a cyber breach in South Africa necessitates an analysis that considers both direct and indirect effects on a diverse range of stakeholders , " Mafuwafuwane says . <p> Cyber security skills costs <p> Fellow SIGCyber member and Professor in the School of IT at Nelson Mandela University , Professor Lynn Futcher , says that a cost often overlooked is the cost of cybersecurity professionals who need to detect , protect from , defend against , respond to and recover from cyber breaches . <p> Prof Futcher notes : " Cybersecurity professionals are required to keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and stay abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often under high-pressure conditions , to monitor and defend against threats in real time . This demanding work environment can lead to burnout , high-stress levels , and mental health challenges , which can reduce the effectiveness of cybersecurity teams and lead to high turnover rates . <p> " To attract and retain top cybersecurity skills and talent , organisations should invest substantially in recruitment and competitive compensation packages . This includes not only salaries , but also benefits , bonuses , and other incentives ( including flexible work arrangements , generous vacations , and paid time off ) to keep these professionals motivated , even under challenging conditions , " she says . <p> There are costs to the professionals themselves , she adds : " The responsibility of safeguarding critical data and infrastructure from persistent cyber threats is often mentally exhausting . Organisations must therefore acknowledge and recognise this , and provide adequate support , especially from top management , as well as mental health and wellness programs , to ensure the well-being of their cybersecurity teams . <p> " While the financial , legal , and reputational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the cybersecurity professionals who protect organisations are equally important . Investing in the well-being , education , and retention of these professionals is crucial for building a resilient team of cybersecurity professionals , " Prof Futcher says . <p> Reducing breach costs <p> Baxter notes : " The costs of a breach are impacted by the ability of the internal cyber response team to respond to the particular incident , as well as the type of data compromised . For example , customer personally identifiable information ( PII ) , personal financial information , or health information can incur the highest costs . Further , the duration of the cyber breach , and how long it takes to resolve , will have an impact on an organisation , as well as whether cyber insurance is in place . " <p> As the cost of cyber breaches can be so significant , it is vital for organisations to have skilled internal cyber response teams and should consider a skilled ransom negotiator , Baxter says . He warns that preparing for a cyber-attack after it happens is too late -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for well in advance . Basic cybersecurity hygiene is essential and a risk assessment should be conducted to identify and protect an organisation 's most critical assets .

Throughout the reported period , Kaspersky security solutions detected more than 6.6 million attempted attacks , where cybercriminals used the brands of the kids ' games as a lure . <p> Out of the 18 games chosen for this research , the majority of attacks were related to Minecraft , Roblox , and Among Us . <p> According to Kaspersky 's statistics , more than 3-million attempted attacks under the guise of Minecraft were launched throughout the reported period .

" It 's great to be able to fix problems , but you must also identify the right problems at the right level . <p> Daily Maverick visited three Home Affairs offices -- two of which have been covered extensively in our " Hell Affairs " series -- and found there is still a great deal of work to be done to shorten queues , alleviate staff shortages and get branch officials to treat people with dignity . <p> " I 've said it from day one ; there is simply no magic wand , " Schreiber told Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've waved it and we would 've fixed all those things overnight . " <h> Reducing backlogs ( 9/10 ) <p> Arguably , Schreiber 's most visible achievement has been to reduce the backlog in the processing of visas and permit applications , which has been increasing for more than a decade . <p> In November 2023 , Motsoaledi revealed in a response to Parliament that the processing backlog of visas and permits had been 118,253 in August 2023 . Motsoaledi had a target of clearing the backlog by November 2024 . <p> In his budget speech this July , ? Schreiber said the department had already reduced 30% of the backlog , which had ballooned to about 306,000 applications . <p> This week , he announced that 62% of the backlog had been cleared . He told Daily Maverick the department was " on track " to have a backlog-free Christmas . <p> " We 've made major progress ... We 've done it through a combination of things , " he said . <p> These include prioritisation , a partnership with Business Unity South Africa , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dedicated visa backlog team that is working overtime , and daily reports and monitoring , according to Schreiber . <p> Schreiber announced last week that the department had also cleared a backlog of 247,500 identity documents ( IDs ) that had begun to accumulate in November 2023 following a change in IT service providers . <h> Reactivating the Immigration Advisory Board ( 9/10 ) <p> In his budget speech , Schreiber announced that he would be reactivating the Immigration Advisory Board . <p> South Africa has been without such a board for more than a decade , in breach of the Immigration Act . The board provides for role players to engage with the department about problems affecting the sector . <p> Importantly , the minister said the board would provide him " with evidence-based advice on tackling issues such as the court-ordered process of consultation on the future of the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit ( ZEP ) " . <p> " That 's where we can have -- we must have -- conversations around the ZEP ; we must talk about all those policy things ... in a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " Schreiber told Daily Maverick . <h> Digitisation project ( 7/10 ) <p> The digitisation of Home Affairs is the top priority for the department . It has been on the agenda of former ministers , but was hobbled by budget cuts and capacity constraints . <p> Asked by Daily Maverick if he believes he can achieve the digital transformation of Home Affairs in his five-year term , Schreiber responded with a resounding yes . " That 's because it 's the only priority , " he said . <p> Schreiber said that one of the outcomes of a recent strategic planning session was that employees ' performance would be measured entirely by their contribution to the digital transformation project . <p> This vision for his term of office -- " Home Affairs at Home " -- was announced this week . The ambitious plan to turn the department into a digital-first organisation would mean that , over time , no one would have to visit its offices in person for routine services . <p> Schreiber 's announcement fleshes out his plan more , but is scant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's also unclear what the project would mean for the majority of South Africans who do not have access to data or Wi-Fi , and are un ? ? able to access online systems . <p> Speaking to Daily Maverick , Schreiber kept his cards close to his chest when pressed for details on where the plan currently stands . <p> " I 'm not going to tell you too much , " he said . " There 's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to put in place the partnerships we need to test the technology that we 're going to require and to create a proof of concept ; that 's the phase we 're in . " <p> Asked about funding , the minister was unable to provide estimated costs , but admitted " it will not be a cheap exercise " . The department has a budget of R10.5-billion for 2024/25 -- a meagre increase from R9.8-billion the previous year . <p> Schreiber said the department would begin by reprioritising funds internally before requesting additional funding from National Treasury . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <h> Corruption , fraud and accountability ( 5/10 ) <p> Like all his predecessors , Schreiberhas vowed to clamp down on fraud and corruption in his department . " Syndicates and mafia have infiltrated every sector of society and Home Affairs is absolutely no exception , " he told Daily Maverick . <p> A 2022 report by the former director-general in the Presidency , Cassius Lubisi , exposed the rot in the department , detailing evidence of fraudulent visa applications first being rejected , then accepted after reconsideration , and the department 's antiquated systems being used illegally . <p> In a recent parliamentary response , Schreiber revealed that 109 corruption cases had been reported to the department 's counter-corruption and security services branch for investigation since the beginning of the financial year in April 2024 , News24 reported . <p> Schreiber said a strategy had been developed to manage fraud and corruption risks in the department . <p> However , of the 109 cases , it 's unclear how many were reported after Schreiber took office . <p> Speaking to Daily Maverick , Schreiber maintained that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way " . After pressing for tangible evidence of this , Daily Maverick was told that Schreiber 's spokesperson would provide us with figures on arrests and convictions . No response had been received by time of publication . <h> Network failures ( 6/10 ) <p> In his budget speech , Schreiber announced that he would prioritise solving the problem of offline systems , saying he intended to be the " minister of ' system online ' " . <p> The department has in the past been hamstrung by system outages , often blamed on the State Information Technology Agency ( Sita ) , which have caused interminable queues at its offices . <p> Speaking to Daily Maverick , Schreiber indicated that steps were under way to ditch Sita . <p> " What we need to do , under the existing model , is chase Sita every day , and we 're chasing them as effectively as we can , but it remains a losing battle , " he said . There was a " severe bottleneck " relating to Sita . <p> " We can not wait for Sita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not going to happen . <p> " I 've spoken to the Minister of Communications to say Home Affairs can not implement our plans if you are going to constrain us with this monopoly , and so we are doing a lot of legal work in the background with the Auditor-General and others to understand what is re ? ? quired for us to actually move our network on to a reliable space , " he said . <h> Queues and capacity constraints ( 4/10 ) <p> Day-long queues have become permanent features outside Home Affairs offices around the country . In 2022 , Daily Maverick reported how people at the Stellenbosch Home Affairs office and the main Barrack Street office in Cape Town waited in vain for a whole day to apply for IDs or passports . <p> We also visited the office in Epping , Cape Town , which is implementing a pilot project that takes only online bookings , and where processes such as photographs and cashier payments are integrated . <p> Daily Maverick found that all three offices were heavily understaffed . <p> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only four officials at work . There were about 20 people inside the office and two long queues outside . The queue for those who had booked online appeared to be moving relatively quickly compared with the stagnant queue for those who had not . <p> Several people who had not booked online said this was the second day that they were queuing for their documents , as they had not been attended to the previous day . <p> Alison Malgas had arrived at the Stellenbosch office just after 6am to apply for a new ID . At 10am , she was still in the queue . She said she had tried to book online , but the first available date was 23 October . <p> Malgas said that , shortly after she arrived , a security guard had come around and written down people 's ID numbers , but since then there had been no communication . <p> " I 'm even considering going home because I 'm getting very cold , " she said . <p> In February 2022 , in a parliamentary response to Schreiber , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Stellenbosch office was supposed to be staffed by 41 officials , but only had six . <p> The situation at the Barrack Street office was no different . At 19 counters , Daily Maverick could spot only three officials . With about 40 people waiting inside the office and about 50 people in queues in the street at 12.30pm , it was difficult to see how they would all be served by closing time . <p> Faiek Williams of Manenberg opted to visit the Barrack Street office after the online system offered dates that did not suit him . He faced a wait of more than an hour to collect his ID . <p> " For collection purposes , I do n't think it should take that long , " he said . <p> Schreiber , in his interview with Daily Maverick , said the department would be opening an office at the Cape Town Civic Centre to alleviate the pressure on Barrack Street . But a new office , which will require more staff and resources , does not solve the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system were recurring concerns during our conversations with people in the queues at Barrack Street and Stellenbosch . These included limited availability of bookings and the system 's inaccessibility to those without internet . <p> At the Epping office , the queue moved swiftly , and people who spoke to Daily Maverick were generally pleased with the service they received . " Our booking was for 10am ... We were sitting outside for about five to 10 minutes and then we went inside , " said Hendricks Samson . <p> " There are only two counters for passports and ID applications . The rest is collections . But when they work , they work fast . They are very professional . " <p> Schreiber said he would be rolling out the Epping model to other offices . However , pressed about when this would happen , he responded : " It 's in the strategic plan . " <p> According to the latest Home Affairs annual report , the department has only 42.37% of the staff it should have . <p> Schreiber told Daily Maverick that the department was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added that the counter-corruption and security services branch was operating at a staffing level of 28% . " State-owned enterprise bailouts are a moral disgrace when Home Affairs has 28% of the anti-corruption officers it needs , " he said . <h> Mixed reviews from public representatives <p> As Schreiber approaches the 100-day milestone on Friday , 11 October , we gathered reviews of his performance . <p> The spokesperson for the Public Servants ' Association of South Africa ( PSA ) , Reuben Maleka , said it was " troubling " that Schreiber appeared " to be riding on initiatives and plans set in motion by his predecessor " . <p> " The minister has only managed to re ? iterate all known challenges of staff shortages , lack of digital transformation needs , network failures and the dilapidated state of offices ... <p> " The PSA has yet to see tangible progress in addressing these pressing issues . " <p> The parliamentary coordinator for the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) , Matthew Parks , said it was too early to assess any minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schreiber had , since his appointment , agreed with many of the key issues Cosatu had been raising -- including that the department can not be expected to operate optimally at 40% capacity ; queues can not end when Sita is often offline ; and IT systems need to be " overhauled and modernised " . <p> " We need the government to work with labour at Home Affairs to turn it around ... workers should not be made to queue for days on end when applying for IDs . This robs them of their daily wages and disrupts the economy , " said Parks . <p> ActionSA 's chief whip in Parliament , Lerato Ngobeni , said the party was concerned about the shortfall of R4.35-billion for the Border Management Authority . <p> " Without a clear plan to address this , South Africa 's borders will remain porous and inadequately managed , " said Ngobeni . <p> Political analyst and professor of political studies Mcebisi Ndletyana said reducing the backlog of visa and permit applications , and reactivating the Immigration Advisory Board , were clear indications that Schreiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seems to have tackled the backlog within a matter of a few months . But that programme was started before he was appointed , so it is a programme that preceded him . It 's very important to note . <p> " Nevertheless , it does n't take anything from him ; he seems to have accelerated it , " said Ndletyana . <p> Build One South Africa ( Bosa ) leader Mmusi Maimane described the work the minister and officials at Home Affairs had done as " commendable " . <p> " It has demonstrated ruthless focus on eradicating backlogs . <p> " Now is an opportunity to focus on giving more access to South Africans who are undocumented , regularising our im ? migration processes and ensuring that with the new budget cycle Home Affairs is able to improve the digitisation process , " he said .

Edelman , the communications consultancy , conducted the survey in September 2023 , well into the war in Ukraine but just before the Middle East erupted in massacre , bombings , death and destruction , raising fears of military escalation , including , as in Europe , the specter of nuclear war . <p> The percentage of distraught older workers was lower but , as a late boomer , I can attest we are n't immune . When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 , I immediately ordered potassium iodide pills , even though at my age , the tablets -- which can shield the thyroid gland from radioactive fallout -- are probably less protective for a sexagenarian than they are for the young . I usually keep the bottle close to me , in a drawer in the office or in my valise . Happy to share . <p> We have lots of coping mechanisms , including macabre humor . Between the catastrophic hurricanes Helene and Milton in the southern US , my friend Rene Alegria posted a note saying he 'd started binge-watching " apocalypse porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's been streaming since 2017 . He 'd just been through Helene , which swept through Georgia where he lives , to wreck a big chunk of neighboring North Carolina . " It definitely tipped my imagination over the edge , " he told me . Watching the series was " like fast-forwarding one 's life to the end , just to save time and the prolonged misery . " Then he added " LOL . " <p> Anxiety is not to be laughed at , of course . Things do go wrong -- and just the prospects can be palpably terrifying . We are wired to worry . Millennials are practically named for historical end-is-nighers , the Millennarians . And they have the Y2K panic of 1999 -- when the zeros of the coming year 2000 would throw the world 's computers back to 1900 and create cybernetic chaos -- as an emblem of their cohort 's coming of age . <p> We want to be able to see apocalypse coming -- if only for the survival tips . Movies and books , magazines and television have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theologians who 've been calculating when the world will end ( and the best way to get through it ) since the Book of Revelation ( aka The Apocalypse of St. John ) became part of canonical Christian scripture . <p> I wo n't touch on The Omen and 666 ( or the astrological prophecies of Nostradamus and zombie apocalypses for that matter ) . There are enough terrifying examples of the banal human sort without calling in divine or devilish interventions . In the early years of the Cold War , we had On the Beach , starring Hollywood legends Gregory Peck , Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire . It depicted a post-nuclear war world where all human life appears to have been annihilated , except momentarily in Australia . In 1964 , director Stanley Kubrick gave us Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb . It remains a paramount expression of nuclear end-of-days paranoia as a high-ranking military officer sets off a fail-safe proof Armageddon , with a triply-lunatic performance by the late , great Peter Sellers . A stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London 's West End this week . <p> In 1983 -- at the height of Ronald Reagan 's confrontation with what he called the " evil empire " -- the US television network ABC aired The Day After , which follows characters who live near Midwest missile silos after the US and the USSR engage in the unthinkable . More than 100 million people tuned in . The next year , the UK came up with its equivalent : Threads , which is set near a devastated NATO base in Sheffield , England ; it was broadcast for only the fourth time on British television last week . <p> Movies can be uncanny . During the Covid pandemic , viewers rediscovered a chronicle of the plague foretold in the 2011 movie Contagion . Even more prescient was The China Syndrome , which depicts a meltdown in a nuclear power plant . Twelve days after the film 's release in March 1979 , the real-life near-meltdown of the Three Mile Island power facility took place near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . Seven years later , the world got a full-on catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped a new generation of viewers in 2019 , providing context for the battle over nuclear plants in Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion , including the entombed remains of the still glowing toxic facility in abandoned Chernobyl . <p> Fast-forwarding via Hollywood offers psychological benefits , as my friend in Georgia notes . But we can also derive comfort from history , by looking backwards at what we 've survived . The activism of ACT UP helped contain and almost completely defeat an apocalypse for the gay community -- and indeed all humankind -- when the Reagan administration tried to laugh off the AIDS pandemic . <p> As the news director of Time magazine for a 13-year period that included 9/11 , the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , and tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan , I 've had to worry about a lot of world-shaking events as well as the reporters I sent out to cover them . So many , I 've lost track . Last weekend , Facebook " Memories " reminded me of a note I put up on Oct. 6 , 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world ends . " I forgot why I wrote that and Googled the date . It was the Monday that the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 30% as global finance went into meltdown . <p> That was a bad time -- touch-and-go for the style of living we 'd become accustomed to . But we 're still here , perhaps even feeling a bit more confident . Just as we can rebuild better after earthquakes and other disasters , we 've learned to count on central banks -- particularly the US Federal Reserve -- to becalm all serious financial outbreaks of volatility . Indeed , the Covid pandemic reinforced the role of central banks in financing government largess to prime national economies , spending our way out of disaster . It 's contributed to a prevailing technocratic verve across many sectors : " We have the data so we can prepare for any contingency . " <p> Is that true ? We may have defined apocalypse downward so it no longer means mass extinction . But we still expect disasters to be sudden and massively destructive , metaphorically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were subversive , slow and treacherous ? Sometimes trying to outmaneuver prophecies of doom can lead to more tragedy . In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , nightmares over Malthusian predictions of massive overpopulation and a collapse of resources may have propelled colonization as well as the kind of industrial development that 's brought us to the edge of climate cataclysm . <p> The best laid schemes of mice and men can go ugly . The Fed 's bond-buying programs , for example , likely contributed to the dramatic spike in inflation that only now seems to be under control . It 's made central bankers cautious , questioning how effective their best weapons are . " They ca n't just cut rates because stocks go down . They ca n't just cut rates because a bank is wobbling , " Jared Gross of JP Morgan Asset Management told Bloomberg 's What Goes Up podcast last year . <p> I know this is n't going to calm those too distraught by news to focus on work . Office jobs are far from paradise , but being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who may be just as anxious . A friend told me one of his young employees chose not to join colleagues at the pub after work , saying " I 'm not into that work-hard-play-hard trauma bonding . " News flash : We 're trauma bonding together , like it or not . As one of my favorite old t-shirts proclaimed : " Jesus is coming . Look busy . " <p> Oh , by the way , I just checked my potassium iodide . It expires this month . I 'm going to reorder while there 's still time .

With the ANC 's diminished power and centrist parties stepping up , there is cautious optimism for reform . However , challenges like high unemployment and lingering populist policies remain .

Though that may not last . <p> Global Unemployment Data . Data provided by the World Bank ( 2024 ) and prepared by Our World in Data . <p> A recent poll from the Social Research Foundation ( SRF ) , a think tank , shows growing support for the GNU parties . <p> Yet it also warns that a , <p> " critical mass of voters , if ... dissatisfied with the performance of the GNU , could flip the balance of power in South Africa 's politics in favour of a future populist , leftist administration .

The beauty still sleeps . <p> The ANC lost its national majority in May 2024 for the first time since 1994 , with 40.18% of the vote . It formed the GNU pact with the centrist Democratic Alliance ( DA , at 21.81% ) , and smaller parties . <p> As the main economic ministries are in ANC hands , such ' sidestepping ' obstructive parts of the ANC may be the path forward . <p> The Economic Empowerment for the Disadvantaged ( EED ) ' scorecard ' has long been a brainchild of SA 's Institute of Race Relations ( IRR ) , a think tank . <p> This could open the floodgates to scrap BEE and other job-killing laws . <p> Any formal employer in SA survives despite the edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxing of such laws , these firms sit ready to rocket , as do tax receipts from job growth . <p> SA 's short walk to prosperity lies in normalising the labour market , in the same way that President De Klerk bonfired race-based legislation in the early 1990s . The Free Market Foundation ( FMF ) , a think tank , has proposed an exemption ' card ' from these laws to get young people into work . <h> The political centre <p> The damage to the country can start to be reversed , with better oversight in half the GNU ministries . <p> Plans are afoot for 2% vote thresholds at all levels of government . This will prevent the hyper-fragmentation which has made governance very , very difficult , particularly at municipal ( council ) level . <p> SA has three levels of representative government : municipal ( 257 local councils ) ; provincial ( 9 legislatures ) , and national . <p> Tiny parties have been able to collapse city councils across the country , hampering service delivery and faith in democracy , even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers . <p> The centrists stand to do well in the local government elections ( LGEs ) of 2026 . <p> For the first time , major cities of Durban , Johannesburg and others may get stable , centrist local governments . Talks are ongoing to stabilise these ' metros ' , possibly through confidence and supply arrangements . <p> SA has largely passed the test of the liberation movement conceding power . <p> Of the three major provinces , one has long been in the hands of the DA ( Western Cape ) . The historically violent KwaZulu-Natal is seeing impressive stability with a four-party coalition . <p> The last battle , then , is in the most populous and productive province of Gauteng and its constituent municipalities ( including Johannesburg and Pretoria ) . <p> Factions within the ANC 's Gauteng provincial structures and its Premier Mr Panyaza Lesufi are unhappy that a deal was struck with the centrists at a national level . They are more inclined to side with the far left . <p> There may be skeletons in the closets of the provincial legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national deal between the ANC and DA broadly . <p> Corrupt individuals could be granted conditional amnesty -- immunity in exchange for full disclosure . In return , the ANC scraps BEE and race-based legalisation . I wonder if this has been floated behind closed doors . <p> Mr Lesufi 's rise to ANC top spot and possibly President by 2027 is a threat to the GNU . That may re-run 2024 -- collapse the GNU , team up with the far-leftists and destroy things . <p> Yet it could also be the catalyst for a new centre left party or smaller party consolidation , with national elections only two years later in 2029 . <p> Markets would be an ally , having forced the removal of an unpopular finance minister in 2015 , and the shortest serving British Prime Minister ever in 2022 . <h> Finding the way <p> Tourism thrives from wine tours in the Western Cape to luxury safaris in Limpopo . <p> Harmful legislation has meant mines have gone undug for so many years .

@@116321231 <p> For October 's superhero issue of Inverse , Snyder served as the issue 's guest editor , with Snyder also penning on feature on his love of superheroes and the comic book medium , and conducting an interview with comic book auteur Frank Miller of The Dark Knight Returns and 300 fame . Predictably , Snyder 's re-entry into DC-heavy talk has the whole world talking , his devoted fanbase in Snyder 's corner and his detractors remaining skeptical . However heated the Snyder superhero debate might be , his work on the new issue of Inverse demonstrates just how much he really understands who and what Superman is . <p> What makes Zack Snyder stand out so much from other superhero filmmakers is how much of an emphasis he places on deconstructing iconic characters . That is n't to say other makers of superhero films have n't done the same , but taking characters like Superman apart and putting them back together again is a staple of Snyder 's entire philosophy of bringing superheroes to life cinematically . <p> In the case of Man of Steel , Snyder started his Superman story from the foundation of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as he is determined to use his powers to help people . While Snyder 's critics have labeled this approach as giving Superman a dark and brooding makeover more fitting for Batman , what Snyder really allows Superman to do is breathe and evolve as a character in a way no prior cinematic or televised version has done . Moreover , Snyder 's Superman also shows that being a symbol of hope is n't a simple as just smiling or pulling cats out of trees , and takes far more self-actualization and sacrifice that Superman has often been allowed to explore . <p> In his recent Inverse feature , Snyder shares his affinity for comic book storytelling and superheroes as transcending escapism and entertainment , and embodying " an often profound commentary on our shared human experience " . Snyder 's Superman arc that began in Man of Steel and which was intended to conclude in Justice League 3 exemplifies that by presenting Kal-El as a hero in hiding , using his abilities to help when he can but going out of his way to stay out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment he reveals himself . General Zod 's invasion leaves him with no choice but to publicly step up to the plate as Superman , and he spends much of Batman v Superman just trying to re-assure humanity and the mistrustful Batman that he 's on our side . <p> That ultimately comes at the cost of his own life when Superman sacrifices himself to defeat the monstrous Doomsday , but Snyder 's philosophy on the shared human experience superheroes embody really begins to come into focus in Zack Snyder 's Justice League when Batman , Wonder Woman , Aquaman , Cyborg , and The Flash revive him in time to defeat Steppenwolf and the invasion from Apokolips . The fact that Superman has struggled so much in the two preceding movies also makes his return far more triumphant . Sure , Superman 's " Not impressed " one-liner and effortless pummeling of Steppenwolf is a Superman movie moment for the history books , but his trials in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman bring out not just the best in him , but in everyone around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of seeing criminals as weeds ; Wonder Woman had lost her faith in the world of man ; Aquaman was a loner estranged from his people in the sea ; The Flash felt powerless to save his wrongly imprisoned father ; Cyborg thought everything that made him human had been stripped from him ; and Martian Manhunter was content to hide among humans as General Swanwick . In Superman , all of them saw a man who never gave up when he had every reason to turn his back on a world that saw him as the enemy , even to the point of falling on the sword for them . For all of them , he is the hero they all thought could not exist in such a dark world , and thus , the Justice League is born . <p> Snyder 's plans for Justice League 2 and Justice League 3 also show that he was n't finished challenging the Man of Steel ( as seen on Snyder 's whiteboard outline of the two sequel 's story ) , with Superman to be turned into Darkseid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Batman and The Flash using time-travel to undo the Knightmare future , Superman would embody leadership and hope like never before in leading the entire world to defeat Darkseid once and for all , with Batman dying a hero 's death . <p> Viewed in its entirety , Snyder 's Superman arc shows that he is portraying the concept of Superman as a symbol of hope in a far more complex and ultimately more fulfilling way than the Last Son of Krypton has had the chance to exemplify elsewhere . Superman has to weigh the idea of consequence at all times . He may have the power to save the world , but what happens when him doing so reveals that we are not alone in the universe , especially when he 's part of the same alien race that invaded Earth ? By struggling with such questions , Snyder 's Man of Steel earns the title of Superman in the most definitive way possible , with the entire world becoming a Justice League by his example . <h> Zack Snyder Always Knew His Take On Superman Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Superman and the Justice League , it 's also equally clear that he always knew it was going to be a hard sell to many Superman and DC fans by not having the Man of Steel default to Christopher Reeve-levels of cheerfulness and fun . In his interview with Frank Miller on Inverse , Snyder touches upon exactly that , funnily enough , in his analysis of the idea of Batman using guns . As Snyder states to Miller : <p> " Well , it 's cool because if you can create a scenario where Batman has to shoot a gun and someone says , " Well , Batman ca n't shoot a gun . " And you 're like , " Well , what should he do in this scenario then ? " And then if someone says , " Well , do n't put him in that scenario . " I 'm like , " Well , that 's a weak character . " You ca n't have a character where we 're modifying this scenario because he ca n't exist in it . That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality can work inside of , rather than the other way around . " <p> While Miller concurs with Snyder 's perspective , it also shows that Snyder knew he was going to be tipping over many sacred cows with his portrayal of the world 's first superhero . Superman breaking General Zod 's neck in Man of Steel is still as fervently debated as ever , but Snyder 's point rings true . Simply avoiding putting Superman in the position of having to decide whether to take a villain 's life puts up fences around him as a character , and keeps him from having to ever make difficult , in-the-moment decisions as a hero . The same is equally true for Snyder 's portrayal of Batman lapsing into lethal force , which , in Snyder 's story , asks the question of what it would take for Batman to become willing to kill . <p> As the tone of Zack Snyder 's Justice League shows , Snyder 's intention was always to evolve Superman , Batman , and the DC heroic pantheon into their classical versions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they would have to make hard choices , deal with the consequences of them , and come out on the other side having grown from their experiences . Snyder clearly knew that would ruffle many feathers , but time and evolving landscape of superhero movies have shown that he was on the money . <p> It 's easy to boil Superman down to the personification of hope , but Zack Snyder obviously was never content with just doing that and takes that idea much further . Superman embodies hope , but what does that mean ? Where does hope come from ? How does hope survive being tested doubt and fear ? Can you regain hope after losing it ? <p> Too often , filmmakers , audiences , fans , and even comic book writers have been reticent of tackling the question of what it means for Superman to embody hope and to inspire hope in others . Snyder 's Superman arc shows that asking these kinds of questions about Superman and all superheroes is n't just a compelling storytelling decision , but fundamentally necessary for superheroes to embody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , Zack Snyder knew he was telling what was bound to be a divisive , polarizing Superman story by taking on such themes . Nonetheless , the fact that his Superman remains such a hallmark of superhero filmmaking after weathering that storm is testimony to how far ahead of the curve he was on what makes Superman tick . Superman 's most triumphant flight is the one that comes after he 's had to fall -- not unlike the trajectory Snyder 's own DC movie franchise and the continued hope of millions of fans that it will one day fly again .

Deux implicitly shames its own audience . <p> In stark defiance to its pre-release controversy that it was a rallying cry for would-be mass shooters to go wild , Todd Phillips ' Joker became a true cultural phenomenon in late 2019 . On top of clearing $1 billion worldwide with ease and earning multiple Academy Awards , including a Best Actor Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix , his iteration of Mr. J also took on a life of its own . Go to any Comic-Con since 2019 , and you 're bound to cross paths with multiple Arthur Flecks , while his Joker make-up and origin story have been embraced as emblematic of the downtrodden and societal outcasts . A half-decade hence , Joker : Folie a Deux recognizes this , but not in the way one expects . <p> As Arthur Fleck 's trial proceeds in Folie a Deux , he gradually becomes disillusioned with the Joker persona , and eventually renounces it outright , much to the chagrin of his legions of fans cheering him outside of the Gotham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially enraged at Arthur abandoning the uprising he kicked off and breaks off their romance .

An additional scene or two could have solidified this . <h> Is Classified worth watching ? <p> Apart from a few brief moments of aesthetically pleasing action , Classified stumbles and spills all its " secrets " in the first act . Nothing surprises here . If an action movie is what a viewer is in the mood for , rather watch Take Cover or The Shadow Strays , which are infinitely better than this disappointing film .

It relied on the machine to stay up and running during the worst of South Africa 's power cuts , which affected the country 332 days last year . The vintner was lucky . As the blackouts grew increasingly severe , suppliers without generators " took a hard knock " , said Bradwin Persent , Aslina 's operations and logistics coordinator , as did many of the country 's struggling small businesses . <p> Then , in March , the outages suddenly stopped . Even as the southern hemisphere descended into winter , when electric heaters and early sunsets drive up demand , Eskom , the troubled state-owned utility that generates most of South Africa 's energy , managed to keep the lights on . <p> It 's now been seven months and counting since the country 's last episode of load shedding .

First implemented in 2008 , they cost the economy up to R899-million/day , according to central bank estimates , and were a big reason why the ANC lost its majority in elections last June . Attempts to fix the corruption-gutted utility have failed over the years -- a sweeping privatisation plan collapsed ; an effort to add generation capacity dragged out and never fully materialised ; and inside power stations , theft and sabotage became more audacious . <p> Now the situation appears to be stabilising . The effects of recent and longstanding reforms have radically improved employee morale , according to experts , analysts and officials , which has made all the difference in helping Eskom get back on its feet . The decision to delay the retirement of three coal-fired power plants also played a big role . <p> That move " brought confidence " , said Malekutu Bizzah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highveld region , where most of Eskom 's coal plants are located .

Across the country , the proliferation of solar panels , a popular alternative to relying on Eskom , eased stress on the grid . Coal theft declined as the mineral 's price fell .

While the government of former President Jacob Zuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft grew rampant at power stations .

Not only was the company publicly villainised every time the lights went out , but workers were also expected to function under nearly impossible circumstances .

@@116727238 <p> Apple , seeking to make further inroads in health care , tested an app this year to help people with pre-diabetes manage their food intake and make lifestyle changes , according to people with knowledge of the matter . <p> The company tested the service on select employees earlier this year , part of its broader push into blood-sugar features , according to the people , who asked not to be identified because the work is secret . Though Apple does n't have plans to release the app , the company may eventually integrate the technology into future health products , including a non-invasive glucose tracker that it 's been developing for more than a decade . <p> The employees involved in the test needed to validate that they were pre-diabetic with a blood test . That means they do n't currently have diabetes but may be at risk of developing the type-2 version of the disease . As part of the test , they actively monitored their blood sugar via various devices available on the market and then logged glucose-level changes in response to food intake . <p> The work indicates that glucose tracking and food logging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea behind the system is to show consumers how certain foods can affect blood sugar -- with the hope of inspiring changes that could ward off diabetes . For instance , if users logged that they ate pasta for lunch and that their blood sugar spiked , they could be told to stop eating the pasta or switch to protein . <p> The study was intended to explore the possible uses for blood-sugar data and what tools the company could potentially create for consumers . For now , though , the app test has been paused to let Apple focus on other health features . A company spokesman declined to comment . <p> The work indicates that glucose tracking and food logging could be two important areas of expansion for Apple in the future . The company 's current health app lacks features for logging meals , a contrast with rival services . The research could also lead to Apple integrating third-party glucose tracking more deeply into its offerings . <h> Ambitious <p> The research was n't directly tied to Apple 's longstanding effort to build a no-prick glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company handles that project . The non-invasive checker is one of Apple 's most ambitious health initiatives . The idea is to analyse a person 's blood without pricking the skin -- a potentially ground-breaking advance in the fight against diabetes . <p> Apple often uses employee studies to get health features ready for public launches . It took a similar tack with its hearing aid and sleep apnoea detection features for AirPods and the Apple Watch . The Cupertino , California-based company has multiple labs on its campus for testing health features . <p> The glucose studies were highly secretive -- even compared with Apple 's previous projects -- and employees required specific vetting from managers before they could participate in the programme . Several medical and non-disclosure agreements were also required to participate . <p> Today , glucose-testing systems typically require a blood sample , often through a finger prick . There also are small shoulder-worn patches from Abbott Laboratories and Dexcom that are less cumbersome -- though they still require insertion into the skin . <p> About 15 years ago , Apple set out to create something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so under the radar at the start that Apple created a subsidiary dubbed Avolonte Health to operate it .

But an actual product is still years away . Before the company can shrink down the sensor enough to fit it in a smartwatch , it is working on an iPhone-sized prototype . And even with that format , Apple has run into challenges with miniaturisation and overheating . <p> The system uses lasers to shoot light into the skin and determine how much glucose is in the blood .

" What remains steadfast as a theme on this list is the priority to showcase businesses that are African , with a proudly African mindset . <p> From a community-focused food-processing company or a sneaker brand that is uniquely recognizable for its mesh material to a female-led enterprise known globally as a pioneer in the tea industry , these businesses are small in scale but big on ideas and impact . For these businesses , it 's not about reaching three-comma numbers when it comes to revenues or fortunes , but rather , about honoring their unflinching belief that success can have a whole different definition in creating meaningful futures , for all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possibilities , as evidenced by this list , which is but only a small representation or subset of the growing , thriving small business sector on the continent . From across Africa , the FORBES AFRICA editorial team looked at businesses that were at least five years old this year , were privately-held , had sound business models and were profitable . Our research led us to finding the local heroes in their communities . We called for nominations , which gave founders an opportunity to put forth the names of their enterprises . To gain deeper insight into their impact-driven models , we interviewed the founders/directors/CEOs with one key question : what makes your business homegrown and proudly African ? To determine their scale of success , we looked at metrics such as self-preservation , sustainability , community engagement , innovation and value-creation . While this unranked list of 25 local businesses captures the versatility of industries on the continent , purpose remains a common priority for each of these Small Giants . <p> Editor 's Note : The list on these pages follows no particular order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fintech companies are on the rise in Africa , and it is a space that Andy Jury finds incredibly exciting . <p> Advertisement <p> Over rounds of beer and biltong with the founders of Mukuru , Jury con- cluded that participating in this sphere could greatly benefit Africa 's development . <p> " We pride ourselves in being an African business that has an Afri-can-do spirit that is looking to solve the challenges that the vast majority of Africans across the continent feel today , and leverage the opportunities that come with that , " he tells FORBES AFRICA . <p> Mukuru has a customer base of over 13 million across Africa , Asia , and Europe . With over 100 million transactions to date , the company , whose core was built providing international money transfers , has developed a set of services to address the extensive financial needs of its customers . <p> " We essentially originated as bridging borders and fueling dreams , and allowing people to move money between two locations , " Jury says . <p> " I think what is amazing , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so there 's always this sort of African ingenuity to solving a problem . " <p> When it comes to financial inclusion , Jury believes it 's important to look at what the customer wants , to help solve the problem . <p> " We 've spent time walking in our customers ' shoes , watching how they engage with each other and how they send money in an informal environment and then tried to say , ' how can we layer over simple **39;5177;TOOLONG everyday-context technology that our customers are familiar with ' , " he says . <p> " In doing this , we are enabling the sort of theories that are looking at small but continuous changes made in their lives , such that they benefit from the value chain of digitization , but also for more financial inclusion . " <p> As the co-founder of Yoco , Carl Wazen has witnessed how their ubiquitous smart card machines have helped African SMEs . <p> " An important thing to understand is that the core of Yoco 's innovation , from the outset , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this payment gap being one of them , because there was only one out of 10 businesses that accepted cards . And therefore , 90% of the market was previously excluded . We really focused our efforts on closing that gap and solving a range of things that needed to be solved . " <p> Yoco has secured over $100 million in funding from top-tier global investors , solidifying its posi- tion as a key player in the fintech industry . Wazen , along with his three co-founders , have always sought to play a pivotal role in delivering impactful solutions to small businesses . <p> " We just did n't feel like there were a lot of prod- ucts being built for small businesses , " Wazen says . " And we thought we had an opportunity to build products , but also tell their stories . We have built a narrative around underdogs , around bravery , and around entrepreneurship being a very noble pursuit .

The fintech connects over 500 million mobile money wallets across these African markets . <p> " Our mission to open up a world without borders for countless Africans and their businesses , is deeply personal to us , " Okoudjou tells FORBES AFRICA . <p> " It 's born from a profound belief in the power of access . " <p> The company 's new name is around the idea of One Africa -- an interconnected borderless continent where access unlocks greater potential . Their reach in trying to assist SMEs across the continent led to them partnering with multinational payment card services corporation , Mastercard , in April . <p> " We know that for a continent as rich and varied as Africa , hav- ing access to financial services is more than just a convenience -- it 's essential . It 's about giving people and businesses the keys to unlock <p> their full potential , allowing them to join the global economy , and spark economic development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrates being homegrown and African be- cause of its focus zeroing in on challenges and opportunities unique to Africa . Okoudjou adds that it 's also about his leadership and team being based in Africa and dedicating significant portions of their careers to addressing and solving African challenges . <p> " When you put all these elements together , it 's clear that Onafriq is n't just in Africa -- it 's of Africa . It reflects a deep-seated commit- ment to not just doing business on the continent but being a part of its growth , challenges , and opportunities . And that 's what makes it truly homegrown and African , " he adds . <p> South Africa has been known for its infamous power outages for well over a decade now , even officially reaching Stage 6 ( several hours of loadshedding on a given day ) in recent years . For many South Africans , staying up-to-date about these rolling blackouts has been made easier by an app , EskomSePush . <p> Back in 2014 , founders Dan Southwood-Wells and Herman Maritz worked together at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power was out again and they were unsure about whether to brave the heavy traffic for their commute home .

" And then Herman was like , ' ca n't we just build something that will send us a message when there is no power ' ? " <p> They did , and their app has reportedly reached over seven million users in South Africa . <p> " ' Information is power ' has always been our mission , " Southwood- Wells adds . " What we 've learned through loadshedding is that if you can give someone the right information , at the right time , and it 's accurate , then they can plan for their lives , for their community , for their family , for the company , and they can move around .

At the NewKatz.Studio in Johannesburg , South Africa , where he strides in for an interview , the founder of Bathu tells us more about one of the country 's much-loved sneaker brands . It started when Baloyi was still an accountant and concerned about his community , more so , every time he would go home to Alexandra , a sprawling township in Johannesburg . <p> " I would realize that a lot of people in my community are unemployed , and pre-dominantly , the youth ... they 've lost hope as well . When I went back to the people -- those who have given me opportunities and have paved the way for me -- to ex-press my gratitude , it was met by one big ask from them ; ' we do n't want anything from you , just pave the way for others ' . ' " <p> At the time , Baloyi , the self-proclaimed " sneakerhead " , had bought himself sev-eral pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They say when you buy too much of something , why not own it or become part of the value chain ? " <p> Baloyi says.When he launched Bathu in 2015 , he only sold about 100 pairs . Today , the company sells 250,000 pairs of sneakers a year with 32 stores nationwide and a staff complement of over 300 employ-ees , many of whom are today 's youth . <p> " We are a footwear brand and a shoe business with a soul , " Baloyi says . " And why I say that is because I feel as though we go back into investing in our future consumers , so not necessarily someone who can buy Bathu today ... someone who does n't know their journey yet . They do n't know their dreams or purpose yet . And we believe in walking the journey not only with our current consumers but with our future consumers as well .

" Starting Skin Gourmet with just $45 was a journey marked by significant challenges and milestones that shaped our path to where we are today , " she says . <p> These milestones included being a finalist in the Africa Business He- roes competition and winning the Best Innovative Response Strategy to Covid-19 in 2020 at the Ghana Makeup Awards . <p> She says that Skin Gourmet crafts products so safe that they are ed- ible , aligning with the belief that skincare should enhance health , not compromise it . Beyond safety , Skin Gourmet 's social impact activities , she says , extend to every aspect of its operations , from sustainable sourcing to workforce development . <p> " Skin Gourmet envisions a pivotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , " says Amoabeng of the company 's vision . <p> Sheldon Tatchell 's journey began on a stoep ( veranda in front of a house ) with nothing but a clipper , a chair , and a dream . " Coming from a community like Eldorado Park a suburb in Johannesburg , the barber is the go-to guy , he 's a superhero purely because he has the power to make you look good and feel good about yourself , " explains Tatchell . " As a kid , that was a person I aspired to be . " <p> With that determined spirit , Tatchell has been able to open over 50 Legends Barbershop stores and boasts more than 600 staff members across five countries , namely South Africa , Lesotho , Zambia , Namibia , and Botswana . <p> Taking his business a step further , Tatchell also sells a line of Legend Barbershop products in some of South Africa 's biggest retail stores such as Clicks and Dischem . <p> " The advice I would give to anybody is to have hope that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you , " he says . <p> " I was n't the most talented , I was n't the most skilled , I do n't have a degree , I do n't have any of the qualifications in this position . <p> It 's just being able to say I 'm humble enough to take on what I 've learned , to never to look down on people and always just take learnings as they come . But , for me , it started with hope ! " <p> The inspiration for the brand started with me being a woman in South Africa , and Africa , who uses beauty products , " says Portia Mngomezulu when we meet in Johannesburg for a photoshoot and interview . <p> " I wanted to create a product that not only is a cosmetic product , but that gives our skin results and with ingredients that will resonate with Africans .

" <p> For Mngomezulu , it was about finding local solutions for African women . <p> " I honestly believe that we are homegrown , " Mngomezulu says . " Our skin is different , our climate is different . So , we need tailor-made products for our skin that are tested here with our climate , with our skin conditions . I believe that the products that are imported are not made for our skin . " <p> She never expected her brand to become a nationwide success , but with products that are available in over 4,000 stores in South Africa and across over 14 African countries , Mngomezulu truly believes that hers is a proudly African brand . <p> In a world where technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to benefit as profoundly as healthcare . <p> Reliance Health is redefining how Nigerians access medical care .

He also took a few trips overseas to find suppliers and de- termine how the company could connect mobile payments to solar electricity . <p> " When we started , it was kind of a dif- ficult time to sell solar to people because , first of all , people did n't believe that solar electricity was the same as grid electric- ity -- they felt that there was a difference in the electricity , so we had to explain to them that it 's the same thing , it 's just a different source , " he says . <p> Irims created packages to make it easier for the customers to understand . <p> The on-demand solar electricity platform is currently available in South Africa and Nigeria , however , the com- pany has plans to enter Zimbabwe , Rwanda , Tanzania , and the DRC in the future . <p> Irims advises future entrepre- neurs : " It 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a long run . If you want quick wins , I do n't think entrepreneurship is for you ... unless you 're ready to make a sacrifice , you 're ready to put in the discipline , and the consistency . And you also need to stay innova- tive as an entrepreneur -- you need to actually look ahead . So , if you 're ready to sacrifice , ready to play the long game , it 's for you . " <p> " We ca n't talk about industrial or commercial development , you ca n't talk about high quality of life , in a residential sense as well , without power , " explains Easy Solar 's Chief Commercial Officer , Nthabiseng Mosia ( pictured ) . Along with her co- founders Alexandre Tourre and Eric Silverman , Mosia set out on a mission to find solutions to Africa 's energy concerns . <p> " I was born in Ghana , raised in South Africa ; my parents are from both countries , but I grew up mainly in Johannesburg . Around the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I really experienced what a lack of power can mean . And when you do n't have access to something , it becomes <p> quite visceral , to see all the things that it does enable , " Mosia says . " I went to graduate school in the U.S. -- I was focusing on energy degrees or energy resource management -- to try and answer the question of how do we really fix Africa 's energy problems ? " <p> Easy Solar has offices in Sierra Leone and Liberia and is focused on making energy affordable and accessible for all . " We started the company with a mission to light up lives . At the time , Sierra Leone had about 95% of the population without access to electricity , which is quite significant compared to other parts of the continent . It seemed like the right market opportunity to really try and do a pilot . And the rest is history , " she says . <p> " Seeing the first community that we electrified and virtually everyone in that pilot community now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb for the first time , because I think first access is such a powerful thing ; those are the things that stay with me.

@@117328230 <p> If successfully implemented , this initiative , set to be signed at the Africa Energy Summit in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , on 28 January 2025 , will slash energy poverty on the continent by half . About 300 million people stand to benefit . <p> A critical component of the plan , though , hinges on gas as a ' ' transition fuel ' ' , which raises serious concerns for Africa 's energy sustainability and global climate commitments . The lack of in-depth public participation also threatens the credibility of this initiative . <p> Africa 's energy challenges require urgent and co-ordinated responses . While expanding access to energy is crucial , centering gas in this effort is counterproductive for several reasons . <p> Foremost , putting up gas infrastructure requires high upfront investment . This would not provide value for resources because such infrastructure would leave African countries with useless assets as the world transitions to renewable energy forms . <h> Missing voices <p> The conspicuous absence of input from African communities and civil society organisations during the rollout of Mission 300 at the World Bank meetings was troubling . Without the active participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mission 300 risks failing to secure the buy-in of the people . <p> Neglecting public participation is to overlook essential local insights and bypass the concerns of those most impacted by energy policies . <p> It is only through robust and meaningful public engagement and inclusion of community voices in the planning and execution that Mission 300 would be grounded on actual community energy realities , needs and concerns . This would help to create energy solutions that are truly sustainable , equitable and responsive to local needs . <h> Mission 300 -- ambitious but misguided <p> For many countries that have battled acute energy poverty for decades , coming on board was an easy decision to make . Already , Rwanda , Mozambique , C ? te d'Ivoire and Tanzania are leading the way by committing to transformative energy reforms . <p> The four have hit the ground running and are expanding grid connections , building decentralised mini-grids and setting ambitious targets for renewables and clean cooking solutions . <p> The energy compacts are a pivotal moment for Mission 300 to commit to renewables , rather than gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compacts require robust public engagement and clear commitments to realise sustainable energy solutions on a continent where 600 million people still live in the dark and cold . <p> Gas infrastructure is both capital-intensive and replete with risks . Nigeria and Senegal have incurred enormous costs developing gas pipelines , power plants and related infrastructure . <p> Over the years , these projects have diverted significant resources from renewable energy investments . Consequently , these countries are locked into fossil fuel dependency for the foreseeable future . <p> Even with financial support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank , paying off loans made to put up gas infrastructure could be a financial burden . <p> While gas is often touted as " cleaner " than coal , it still contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions . Relying on gas undermines Africa 's commitment to climate resilience , especially considering the continent 's acute vulnerability to climate change-induced extreme weather events . <p> On a local level , increasing gas infrastructure fails to address one of the major health concerns in Africa today -- indoor pollution .

Patriarchy is at the centre of it all . Radical feminist scholar , Sylvia Walby , offers a deeper discussion on patriarchy . <p> Broadly , patriarchy is a social system that prioritises men and sees them as superior to women and is rooted in the oppression and marginalisation of women . <p> Walby identifies six social structures and practices that create or reinforce patriarchy , namely : <p> Household production which includes everything from the hierarchy of importance within the family , women 's roles often being seen as inferior and unpaid domestic work . <p> Labour , where women are either excluded , discriminated against and/or paid less . <p> Culture , which entails ideologies and praxis that portray women as inherently inferior . <p> Sexuality ensures that women 's sexuality or sexual expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women have less bodily autonomy and agency . <p> Violence , gender-based violence and sexual abuse give men power over women , leaving women subdued and fearful . <p> Finally , the state and related structures like legal systems , policies and so on have a long history of perpetuating systematic and direct violence against women . <p> These six structures of patriarchy seldom exist in isolation . <p> A single event could see one or more of these structures at play , which is why in part it becomes difficult to ensure justice in individual cases or to even dismantle patriarchy as a whole to protect everyone ( including men ) from the harm patriarchy causes . <p> Intersectional scholars and activists such as Audre Lorde , Kimberl ? Crenshaw , Bell Hooks and Patricia Hill Collins further help us understand the complex cocktail of oppression when patriarchy is met by other social identities perceived as negative , including race , class and religion . <p> These two theoretical approaches provide a lens for society to understand gender and different forms of oppression so we might be better able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our seemingly more relatable systemic oppression and lives as South African women are the same , even though the events and experiences of abuse might appear to be different .

@@117797230 <h> Dune : Prophecy Series Premiere - Review <h> Tug of lore <p> The following review contains spoilers for the first episode of Dune Prophecy , " The Hidden Hand . " <p> The tasks assigned to " The Hidden Hand " seem insurmountable . The premiere of Dune : Prophecy is asked to set up an enormous cast of characters and the relationships between and the conflicts amongst those characters , all the while introducing audiences to an era of the Dune universe never before depicted on screen -- one that is , in many specific ways , very different from the interplanetary Imperium of Denis Villeneuve 's Dune and Dune : Part II . And speaking of Villeneuve , " The Hidden Hand " also has to recreate the vibes of his Dune movies on a much smaller budget . So , honestly , it 's pretty remarkable how much the episode is able to accomplish in its hour-and-change runtime , while also disappointing that it is n't a complete success . <p> " The Hidden Hand " is much better at adding to the lore of the Dune universe than it is at telling a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hearing the tale of the Butlerian Jihad and the role the Atreides and Harkonnens played in it is just the right kind of lore dump that will get fans of the Dune universe looking to dive deeper sitting up in their seats ( though I 'm still salty they called it " the wars against the thinking machines " ) . It 's interesting to see the universe so recently unshackled from the binds of the thinking machines , with people so easily slipping back into trusting them . But when the premiere delves into the nitty gritty of the Emperor 's political woes with House Richese , it never piques any interest . It 's a storyline that feels more in line with the Star Wars prequels and their Trade Federations than the sprawling sci-fi epic we 've come to love , and stalls the momentum of the episode . <p> That 's not to say that every element of its present-day thread drags , though . There 's a lot to chew on with the Sisterhood and the war within itself over how to proceed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Desmond Hart ( Travis Fimmel ) represents . Getting Emily Watson and Olivia Williams for the roles of Valya and Tula Harkonnen does n't hurt things either , as they consistently elevate the sometimes dry writing . Jessica Barden and Emma Canning are n't often able to do the same , coming off as stiff and awkward as the younger Valya and Tula , but it seems more a symptom of the clunky dialogue . There are enough carrots on the stick between Tiran-Arafael , the backstories of the Harkonnen sisters , and the lineage of Sister Lila to keep " The Hidden Hand " from being bogged down in the mundane .

@@117797236 <p> By all rights , the debut of Dune : Prophecy on HBO should be an exciting way to cap off 2024 . Director Denis Villeneuve 's two Dune movies stand as some of the best sci-fi films of the last decade , and are very worthy adaptations of the beloved source material . Who would n't salivate at the prospect of spending more time in that universe ? <p> But however great Dune : Prophecy may sound on paper , in reality the series is shaping up to be a surprisingly bland and downright boring spinoff of the movies . It 's a prequel that fails to make a strong case for its own existence . Let 's break down what went wrong and why Prophecy probably picked the wrong story to tell in the first place . <h> Dune : Prophecy 's Opening Flashback <p> Dune : Prophecy 's pilot episode is easily at its most compelling right at the very beginning . The series is itself a flashback to a period some 10,000 years before the Dune movies , but it opens with a sequence set several hundred years earlier , during a conflict known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Dune universe , the Butlerian Jihad was a titanic clash between mankind and the artificial intelligence on which it had become so deeply dependent . Not unlike the wars seen in franchises like The Matrix and Terminator , humanity in the Dune universe had to conquer its machine oppressors and reclaim its independence . <p> The Butlerian Jihad is a fascinating conflict , and one author Frank Herbert only alluded to in his various Dune novels . It 's a war that shaped humanity for thousands of years to come , explaining why technology in this far-flung futuristic universe is so oddly primitive and simplistic . In the absence of advanced computers , humans had to rely on spice to become computers themselves . It 's also the war that birthed the all-important feud between the Atreides and Harkonnen families . <p> With all of that in mind , it 's enough to wonder why HBO did n't focus their Dune prequel on the Butlerian Jihad itself . It would have been such fruitful ground for a prequel spinoff , giving movie fans much greater insight into how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Atreides and Harkonnens has remained so potent for so long . Instead , Prophecy glosses over that material in the span of a couple of minutes , jumping ahead two centuries to when humanity is recovering and the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is beginning to consolidate its grip on the galaxy . <p> In a way , this opening sequence is reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings : The Rings of Power . That series ' first episode also opens with a flashback to an ancient conflict in Middle-earth , the original war with Morgoth . But at least in The Rings of Power 's case , the show pivots to an equally compelling storyline involving Morgoth 's former lackey Sauron . Dune : Prophecy fails to make that same pivot . It glosses over the Butlerian Jihad only to arrive at something far smaller and less interesting . <h> How Prophecy Makes Dune Feel Small <p> Frankly , this is an area of the Dune timeline that just is n't as compelling . The Bene Gesserit are an integral part of the Dune mythology , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this reclusive coven of space witches that we do n't get from the movies ? Sure , we get a sense of the harsh training the sisters must undergo on their paths to becoming Reverend Mothers . But apart from that , the series hits on the same material we 've already seen , with Emily Watson 's Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen obsessing over her precious genetic archive and pulling the strings of the newly forged Imperium . <p> The problem is that the Dune universe as seen in Prophecy has already become pretty much identical to the one seen in the movies . Humanity has turned to spice to form the backbone of its new intergalactic economy and its system of space travel . A Corrino sits on the Imperial throne . The Atreides and Harkonnen families are locked in a deadly feud . Arrakis is the source of immense wealth and incredible peril . It all highlights just how little is fated to change over the next 10,000 years . <p> What exactly is the point of a prequel where all the pieces are already arranged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock or surprise us ? What room is there for drama when it seems this universe is just going through the motions for the next 100 centuries ? Whatever minor setbacks the Sisterhood may experience over the course of this series , we know where all of this is leading . They 'll have their Kwisatz Haderach eventually . It 's all just a waiting game . <h> What 's the point of picking a specific and very early point in the history of the Sisterhood and parking the story there ? <p> As Charlotte Rampling 's Reverend Mother Mohiam said in the first Dune movie , " Our plans are measured in centuries . " So what 's the point of picking a specific and very early point in the history of the Sisterhood and parking the story there ? If anything , a series about the Bene Gesserit needs to be more like Foundation - one willing to take great leaps forward in the timeline to trace the conflict over a great span of time . <p> It 's one reason Dune : Prophecy just feels small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endpoint of thousands of years of planning and turmoil . The series simply explores the earliest origins of that unrest . The cast of characters is small , and many seem to recycle familiar archetypes from the movies . Once again , we 're dealing with an eclectic assortment of Bene Gesserit sisters , Imperial monarchs , and master swordsmen all jockeying for control . <p> Even the visual scope of the series is underwhelming . There 's a grandiose , operatic quality to Villeneuve 's Dune that is sorely lacking in Prophecy . The scope of this series feels closer to the SyFy miniseries from the early ' 00s . Dune should n't feel this small and contained , especially a series ostensibly part of the same universe as the films . <h> Dune : The Original Game of Thrones <p> One of the reasons Dune has struck such a chord with readers over the decades is that the books did Game of Thrones before Game of Thrones was a thing . Cut through all the sci-fi trappings and the spice visions and you have basically the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all scheming and plotting against one another . The original Dune even has its own , shocking Red Wedding moment when the Areides family are betrayed and many beloved characters are killed in one fell swoop . <p> It stands to reason that any TV spinoff of the Dune movies would want to lean into the franchise 's Game of Thrones-esque qualities . The Game of Thrones books made for compelling television in their own right ( give or take a couple of seasons at the end ) , so why not give viewers the Dune equivalent of that ? <p> So far , it does n't appear that Dune : Prophecy is veering in that direction . Again , the scope of the series is just too small . The show centers mainly around the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and House Corrino , with a few Arrakis-based characters like Travis Fimmel 's war hero Desmond Hart thrown in for good measure . You do n't get that sense of many houses warring and plotting against one another . <p> If Dune : Prophecy is going to succeed , it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need more characters who are n't part of the same handful of houses and organizations . We need protagonists whose fates are n't preordained . Prophecy needs a true Game of Thrones-sized cast pulled from all walks of life in the Dune universe . There needs to be room for betrayal and surprise and all the unexpected plot twists that made Game of Thrones such a compelling watch . Spending time with a handful of ancestors of characters from the movies simply is n't going to cut it .

Besides the slowdown in inflation and the expected interest rate cut in September , factors such as the formation of a national unity government , the absence of load shedding , a stronger rand and significant fuel price reductions have all played a role in boosting consumer confidence . <p> " Moreover , the implementation of the two-pot retirement system allows consumers access to a portion of their retirement savings , " Matikinca-Ngwenya says , hinting that a bit of extra cash is what most people needed to be happier . <h> More money <p> The pressure on barely-better salaries has eased compared to a year ago . <p> The ' average ' household should have R1 000 to R2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower petrol prices and interest rates . <p> The interest calculation is based on the average home loan of around R1.5 million and the average car loan of R350 000 .

@@118458230 <p> A new wind-driven system by startup CoFlow Jet promises to reduce shipping fuel costs by up to 90% using stationary cylinders with no moving parts . <p> Looking like old-school chimneys , these cylindrical erections take a page from the history books as the shipping industry looks at ways to readopt sails and harness the wind . <p> The new outlook is due to rising fuel costs and increasing government mandates requiring shipping companies to go carbon neutral by 2050 , which has resulted in a strong push to increase the efficiency of cargo ships while reducing their emissions . <p> For centuries , sails have propelled ships all across the world , and they were still employed for commercial shipping until well after WWII . However , several issues with sails have driven them out of the freight market for all but the most local niches . <p> Firstly , sails require huge crews to manage . The famous clipper Cutty Sark needed a crew of about 30 just to handle the sails and the complex sheets and lines that controlled them . Compared to modern 196,000-tonne container ships that only need 13 officers and sailors -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy to understand how ' hoisting the sails ' can be an issue . <p> The second biggest obstacle is the wind , or rather , the unpredictability thereof . If it blows in the right direction , great . If in the wrong direction , or not at all , it 's not so great . <p> For these reasons , steam and later diesel power became the go-to options for cargo ships , with only hardened explorers and pleasure yachts still preferring sails . <p> Sails are undergoing a renaissance , but unlike the old canvas and ropes methods , modern shipping companies are looking to technologies like kites and wind vanes , with some even using the hull of the ship itself as a sail . <p> CoFlow is however focussing on a variant of the old Flettner rotors developed in the 1920s . <p> Flettner rotors are smooth cylinders with disc end plates which is spun along their long axis and , as air passes at right angles across it , the Magnus effect causes an aerodynamic force to be generated in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airflow . <p> Outside of Wikipedia , this means drawing in a small amount of air from the intake , pressurizing it using an impeller , and then squirting it through the outlet , which generates a pressure imbalance and a considerable amount of thrust . <p> GeCheng Zha , a professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Aerodynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab at the University of Miami College of Engineering says this method allows for a very effective wind propulsion system that can provide 100% of the needed thrust to move the ship . <p> What makes CoFlow 's system unique is that it can be retrofitted to existing vessels and the cylinders can be retracted to get in and out of harbours . <p> " What 's old is new again . " <p> " With the technological advancements of today , wind-assisted propulsion is an efficient alternative to diesel engines .
