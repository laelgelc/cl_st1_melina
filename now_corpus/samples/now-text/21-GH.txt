Are Catholics free to become Freemasons ? <h> Answer <p> Freemasonry is incompatible with the Catholic faith .

It includes temples and altars , prayers , a moral code , worship , vestments , feast days , the promise of reward or punishment in the afterlife , a hierarchy , and initiation and burial rites . " <p> Masonry is also a secret society . Its initiates subscribe to secret blood oaths that are contrary to Christian morals . The prospective Mason swears that if he ever reveals the secrets of Masonry -- secrets which are trivial and already well-known -- he wills to be subject to self-mutilation or to gruesome execution . ( Most Masons , admittedly , never would dream of carrying out these punishments on themselves or on an errant member ) . <p> Historically , one of Masonry 's primary objectives has been the destruction of the Catholic Church ; this is especially true of Freemasonry as it has existed in certain European countries .

The penalty of excommunication for joining the Masonic Lodge was explicit in the 1917 code of canon law ( canon 2335 ) , and it is implicit in the 1983 code ( canon 1374 ) . <p> Because the revised code of canon law is not explicit on this point , some drew the mistaken conclusion that the Church 's prohibition of Freemasonry had been dropped . As a result of this confusion , shortly before the 1983 code was promulgated , the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a statement indicating that the penalty was still in force . This statement was dated November 26 , 1983 and may be found inOrigins 13/27 ( Nov. 15 , 1983 ) , 450 . <p> President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama tangoed with professional dancers Wednesday during a state dinner at the Kirchner Cultural Centre in Buenos Aires . <p> The event started with a dance performance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed while Argentine President Mauricio Macri explained aspects of the dance to Obama .

We examine both those individuals motivated by Jihadist ideology , understood as those who worked with or were inspired by al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups , as well as those motivated by other ideologies that are non-Jihadist in character , for example right wing , left wing , or idiosyncratic beliefs . <p> NAF 's list of terrorist attacks since September 11 , 2001 includes 9 attacks led by jihadists , which have killed 45 people -- the most recent attack being the San Bernardino shooting in December that killed 14 and wounded 21 -- and 18 attacks by American right-wing extremists that killed 48 people . <p> Most notably , while there were zero terror attacks on U.S. soil by Islamic extremists between June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eight attacks by right-wing extremists in that time frame .

As the chart below shows , the only years between 2001 and 2015 where non-jihadist terrorists were indicted or killed for their crimes more than their jihadist counterparts were 2001 , 2004 , 2008 , and 2012 : <p> Additional data shows that while jihadists were diverse in ethnicity , an overwhelming majority of American terrorists were white . Out of 182 total non-jihadist perpetrators of terror attacks in the US between 2001 and 2015 , 165 were white . And while Trump is proposing an outright ban on Muslims entering the US as a way to combat terrorism , he ignores the fact that a vast majority of terrorists , both right-wing and Islamic , are American-born citizens : <p> What these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop extremist terrorism .

In fact I 'm not sure who needed it more , the players or the manager . Steve Bruce has been under immense pressure these past few games but has kept his nerve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darlow , who made an excellent intervention when it looked like Yerry Mina was about to head home a wonderful cross from James Rodriguez followed by a cracking save from Richarlison . This was a much-improved performance from their defeat at home against Leeds and a very important three points . One hell of a lifeline for Steve Bruce as well , I should think . <p> Did you know ? Darlow made three saves against Everton ; only against Liverpool in December ( four ) has he made more in a league game in which he kept a clean sheet this season . <p> Trent Alexander-Arnold : This week saw Trent Alexander-Arnold back to his best . He has n't been there for a while but against Spurs he looked terrific . He was n't bad against West Ham either . I had to wait for 68 minutes to see Alexander-Arnold 's quality against the Hammers but when it came it was glorious . His cross-field pass to Xherdan Shaqiri was just sensational . What then took place was pure art . Shaqiri found Salah who produced the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? Since the start of last season , Alexander-Arnold has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other defender in the competition ( 21 - five goals , 16 assists ) . <p> Jordan Henderson : Captain Marvel is back in the side , albeit at centre-back , and Liverpool looked far more comfortable with him against Spurs than they did without him against Burnley . That Henderson looks so comfortable at centre-back and the opposition unable to expose his limited experience in that position probably says more about the way the modern game has changed than the strikers he was up against . I ca n't imagine Henderson looking so comfortable against the likes of Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch . Meanwhile , you write off Liverpool 's title chances off at your peril . <p> Did you know ? Against West Ham , Henderson won 100% of his duels and won possession 11 times - the most of any player in the match . <p> Ruben Dias : Joao Cancelo was superb for City against West Brom in midweek , although his goal should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another reminder of just how ridiculous the game 's rules have become . He would have made my team of the week had he played against a stubborn Sheffield United . However , I felt compelled to pick Ruben Dias after two masterful displays against West Brom and the Blades , who proved to be a much more difficult opponent than the Baggies , and who appear to have found their cutting edge again . Dias has brought a sense of calm authority to the City defence that has stopped leaking goals since the Portugal international 's arrival . <p> Did you know ? Manchester City have shipped just seven goals in their 18 Premier League games in which Ruben Dias has featured . <p> Cesar Azpilicueta : Thomas Tuchel 's first game in charge against Wolves after the departure of Frank Lampard was a rather cautious affair . Not so against Burnley . The Blues took the handbrake off against the Clarets , Cesar Azpilicueta in particular . The Chelsea captain played his part in both fixtures but his goal against Burnley was quite outstanding . Azpilicueta 's determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Callum Hudson-Odoi was compelling . It also makes you question why Frank Lampard left the full-back out of the side for so long . <p> Did you know ? Azpilicueta scored his first Premier League goal in 376 days since netting against Arsenal in January 2020 . Chelsea have yet to lose a Premier League game in which the Spaniard has scored ( won five , drawn four ) . <p> Jack Grealish : I thought Aston Villa were very unlucky not to come away from Turf Moor with at least a point . Jack Grealish was outstanding on the night and put the finishing touches to a well-worked goal against an impressive Burnley , who are fighting for their lives . However , Villa got a little bit of luck against Southampton who themselves would have got something out of the game had VAR not interfered in matters when Danny Ings ' injury-time strike was ruled out because his arm was offside . When did anyone ever score a goal with their arm from 12 yards out ? Grealish was once again the difference between the two teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Did you know ? Grealish has been directly involved in 15 league goals ( six goals , nine assists ) in a single season for the first time , eclipsing his tally of last season ( 14 - eight goals , six assists in 36 appearances ) in just 19 games . <p> Ilkay Gundogan : In the absence of Kevin de Bruyne , Ilkay Gundogan has taken over the mantle of running the show . Manchester City are starting to pile the pressure on to title rivals Manchester United and Liverpool . They blew West Brom off the park with two brilliantly taken goals by Gundogan . His first was the most exquisite side-foot you will ever see and the second the smash-and-grab of the century . Romaine Sawyer was still gathering his thoughts when Gundogan was putting the ball in the back of the net with West Brom 3-0 down at home and only 30 minutes gone . City were made to fight for every ball against Sheffield United but it did n't stop them from stretching their lead at the top of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier League goals this season - his best ever scoring campaign in the top five European leagues . <p> Marcos Alonso : It never ceases to amaze me that when a new manager comes in players who were previously out of favour suddenly come into focus . Marcos Alonso has hardly featured for Chelsea this season but scored what can only be described as an Alonso classic . New manager Thomas Tuchel seems to have dispensed with any notion of Alonso defending and got the player concentrating on using his magical left foot to great effect . Whatever Tuchel 's reason for bringing players like Alonso back , it will certainly give the English players in the club a reality check . <p> Did you know ? Alonso scored his first Premier League goal since February 2020 against Burnley . <p> Mohamed Salah : With Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino missing for the game at London Stadium , West Ham must have breathed a sigh of relief given that pair 's performance against Spurs in midweek . West Ham only had Mohamed Salah to contend with - but the Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved . What I could n't understand is why West Ham were so reluctant to put centre-back pairing Henderson and rookie Nathaniel Phillips under sustained pressure . It was as if the Hammers seemed to pay for too much respect to Liverpool 's reputation and were unable to take advantage of the champions ' makeshift injury-ravaged team . <p> Did you know ? Mohamed Salah became the first player to score 20+ goals in all competitions in four consecutive seasons for Liverpool since Ian Rush did so six times running from 1981-82 to 1986-87 . <p> Patrick Bamford : It 's only the second time Patrick Bamford has made my team of the week this season . The last time was his amazing hat-trick against Aston Villa . Well his performances since then have not been scintillating but he was pretty impressive away at Leicester . His goal and two assists against the Foxes sealed a fabulous few days for Leeds , having beaten Newcastle earlier in the week . A lot was made of Bamford 's unselfishness in front of goal for Jack Harrison to seal the points against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only , thing to do . <p> Did you know ? Bamford has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 20 Premier League appearances for Leeds United ( 11 goals , four assists ) - only Tony Yeboah ( 17 ) has had a hand in more goals in their first 20 Premier League appearances for the club . <p> Callum Wilson : When a striker scores two goals and his team win away from home there is not much to complain about . However , I will bet a pound to a penny Callum Wilson will be furious with himself that he did not complete his hat-trick . Newcastle paralysed Everton and looked like a side in the top half of the table instead of one hovering above the relegation zone . This victory would have been impressive without the added pressure on manager Steve Bruce but considering what another defeat for the Magpies might have meant this was one hell of a result . <p> Did you know ? Wilson has been involved in 67% of Newcastle 's 21 Premier League goals this season , scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matter <p> It would appear race hate on some social media platforms is now out of control .

@@32707237 <h> The Watchability Power Rankings : Ranking every team in Europe 's top leagues <p> The final international break of the season is coming to an end and the European club season is hitting the home stretch . Now 's the time for all the title races ( or , more likely , battles for Champions League positions ) we 've been talking about for months to play out . There are plenty of high-consequence matches upcoming . <p> But beyond important matches or matches with an intense personal rooting interest , we 're coming up on our final few opportunities to watch fun club soccer for a few months . With that in mind , let 's talk watchability . Who are the most enjoyable teams in Europe 's " Big Five " leagues -- English Premier League , Spanish Primera Division , German Bundesliga , Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1 -- to watch at the moment ? <p> To address that question , I combined stats and my own aesthetic leanings . Let 's walk through watchability criteria : <p> Quality ( 6% ) : It has to matter a little bit , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't very good at them , it 's not going to be as watchable . ( Relevant category : points per game in league play . ) <p> Shots and goals ( 36% ) : Traditionalists in every sport will always point out how good defense can be fun , too , and harrumph when things get a little too high-scoring . While I have indeed seen 0-0 matches that I enjoyed immensely ... come on . Shots and goals ( and the things that create them ) are undeniably fun , especially when you are both taking and allowing them . ( Relevant categories : goals scored , goals allowed , total average shots , xG per shot and xG per shot allowed , pass completion rate into the attacking third . ) <p> Pressure and intensity ( 25% ) : A large part of watchability is knowing that the team you 're watching is trying really , really hard . In soccer , that 's reflected frequently in terms of defensive intensity . There are n't many effective and direct ways of measuring this , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using quite a few . ( Relevant categories : passes allowed per defensive action , opponents ' average passes per possession , possessions beginning in the attacking third and , because watchability goes both ways , opponents ' possessions beginning in the attacking third . ) <p> At least a little verticality ( 9% ) : In modern soccer , shot quality is often created through patience , building possessions slowly from the back , lots of horizontal passing , etc . But verticality -- the ability to explode forward and create occasional fast-break opportunities -- is exhilarating . Adding this to the mix rewards teams that create all the shot quality above with a little bit of extra verve . ( Relevant category : direct speed , a Stats Perform measure of how many meters a team 's average sequence advances the ball . ) <p> Switches and through-balls ( 2% ) : I just enjoy them ! ( Relevant categories : switches of play and through-ball attempts per match . ) <p> Tension ( 7% ) : If you are up or down by a few goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwatchable pretty quickly , right ? ( Relevant category : percentage of a team 's matches that take place with the score within one goal . ) <p> Entertaining big matches ( 15% ) : In six matches with Liverpool , Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur , Chelsea have scored and allowed two goals each . United have played in scoreless draws with Chelsea ( twice ) , Liverpool and Manchester City . Even Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig played in a scoreless draw last February . Big matches against intense , possession-heavy teams often produce cautious stalemates , especially in the Premier League . So let 's reward the teams that figure out how to avoid that . ( Relevant measures : goals scored and total goals in matches against teams averaging at least 1.5 points per game in league play -- the better teams in the league . ) <p> Based on all the above categories , weighted to my whims , I graded every team in Europe 's Big Five leagues on a 0 to 10 scale of watchability . Here are the irrefutably scientific results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Grade : 0-1 ) <p> 98 . Cadiz ( 0.4 ) <p> 97 . Newcastle United ( 0.6 ) I 'm not going to say I calibrated this to make sure that Newcastle graded out as the least-watchable Premier League team ... but I 'm not going to say I did n't , either . <p> 96 . Burnley ( 0.6 ) 95 . Elche ( 0.6 ) 94 . Genoa ( 0.7 ) <p> 93 . FC Augsburg ( 0.7 ) Augsburg can put together some pretty counterattacks at times , but they are n't much for defensive intensity and those counters come amid long stretches with no shots . <p> 88 . Wolverhampton Wanderers ( 0.9 ) Wolves do occasionally string together some pretty passing in attacking areas and are constantly involved in close games , but that 's offset by a complete and total lack of defensive pressure , verticality or , in many instances , goals . <p> 79 . Osasuna ( 1.4 ) You have to give Jagoba Arrasate 's squad this : it knows itself very well . Los Rojillos might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of 2.2 , the highest in the Big Five along with Cadiz . They score points for both that and the fact that 90% of their possessions happen with the scoring margin within one goal . They lose points for , well , everything else . They neither score nor allow many goals , and that 's doubly true when they 're playing a big opponent . <p> 68 . Schalke 04 ( 2.7 ) Are Schalke maybe the worst team in the Big Five ? Yes . But for better or worse , a Schalke match is going to feature shots , goals and possessions starting in dangerous areas . It might just be that their opponents are the ones doing most of that . <p> 58 . Lille ( 3.9 ) The first true league contender to show up on the list . Lille average more than two goals per match thanks to a lovely attack featuring Burak Yilmaz , Canada 's Jonathan David and , off the bench , the United States ' Timothy Weah . But their defense is strong enough to keep scores low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disruption , and in big matches they are more than happy to keep things sterile -- they played Paris Saint-Germain to a 0-0 draw in December , and they somehow did the same with a prolific AS Monaco in mid-March . <p> STREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ <p> Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley , Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines . Stream on ESPN+ ( U.S. only ) . <p> 45 . Atletico Madrid ( 5.6 ) Diego Simeone 's Atletico have made unwatchability their brand through the years . They 're going to grind you to dust defensively and eventually hit you on the counter . They 've had their watchable moments this season , however , averaging 1.8 goals per match and putting together some truly pretty attacking moments ( but not that many ) . That extra oomph in attack has given them the La Liga lead heading into the home stretch . <p> 34 . Internazionale ( 6.9 ) Inter are plowing toward their first Scudetto in 11 years . They take loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least selectively apply solid defensive pressure . The biggest factor in only ranking 34th ? They are one of the least-vertically minded teams in Europe , and when the chips are down and a big match is underway , they are , like Lille , more than happy to play " **25;0;TOOLONG ball . " For the season , their matches average 3.4 combined goals , but in matches against good teams , that average sinks to 2.4 . It 's worked out well for them , but again , this list is about entertainment . <p> 28 . Aston Villa ( 7.9 ) Dean Smith 's squad has slipped a bit since a fast start , but they 're still only six points outside of the top six and still have plenty to play for , especially with star Jack Grealish back from injury . They also play in some of the most free-shooting matches in Europe . Villa matches average 27 shots , eighth-most in the Big Five leagues , and while not all of those shots are particularly high quality , there is plenty of both aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real Sociedad ( 7.9 ) 26 . Real Madrid ( 7.9 ) <p> 25 . Juventus ( 7.9 ) Juve fell in the Champions League round of 16 , and their odds of continuing their nearly decade-long Serie A title streak are dim , but in Andrea Pirlo 's first year as manager , as a youth movement slowly makes headway , there have been glimpses of truly fun and beautiful soccer . There have also been just enough defensive glitches to make their matches particularly enjoyable . <p> You 're going to have a good time ( Grade : 8-9 ) <p> 24 . Leicester City ( 8.0 ) 23 . Lazio ( 8.0 ) <p> 22 . Manchester City ( 8.1 ) The Cityzens score more than almost anyone , they put together beautiful strings of passes and when they play against good teams , the goal scoring actually picks up -- their matches average 2.8 goals overall in Premier League play , but matches against particularly good teams average 3.1 . These are all good things , but you can probably piece together what 's holding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly close and there is , by design , almost no verticality to their attack . <p> 21 . Bologna ( 8.2 ) 20 . TSG Hoffenheim ( 8.2 ) <p> 19 . Celta Vigo ( 8.3 ) In the Big Five , no team better combines high levels of watchability with aggressively mediocre play ( they are 11th in La Liga , averaging 1.2 points per match ) than Eduardo Coudet 's Celestes . They allow just 4.2 passes per opponent possession , and their 8.7 PPDA ( passes allowed per defensive action ) is the lowest in these leagues , too . They attempt a healthy number of through-balls , and when they play good teams , they do n't change a damn thing about what they do . Granted , that does n't work out very well for them -- in nine matches against La Liga teams averaging 1.5 points per game or more , they have generated only one point and have been outscored , 26-7 -- but it 's great for observers ! <p> 18 . RB Leipzig ( 8.4 ) 17 . Borussia Monchengladbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shots ? Montpellier matches average nearly 27 of them . Verticality ? Their direct speed is easily the highest in France . Wide-open matches against good teams ? Said matches average 3.8 goals . La Paillade swept Lyon and are just four points out of a European slot in Ligue 1 , and they have gotten there with fun , optimistic play . They 'd rank even higher if they occasionally attempted to apply some defensive aggression . <p> 15 . Lens ( 8.7 ) 14 . Paris Saint-Germain ( 8.7 ) <p> 13 . Manchester United ( 8.9 ) United have been two completely different teams this year . One is an extremely sound , prolific squad capable of incisive passing , high-level goal scoring , lots of switches of play and decent defensive pressure . The other is the team that plays to 0-0 draws against every good team . Of course , even the latter team has had its expansive moments -- a 2-1 win over PSG and a 5-0 win over RB Leipzig in Champions League play , 3-2 against Liverpool in the FA Cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team for the most part ; just skip future matches vs . Chelsea . <p> Clear room in your schedule to always watch ( Grade : 9-10 ) <p> 12 . AS Monaco ( 9.0 ) Niko Kovac 's loss was our gain ; after getting sacked by Bayern Munich in November 2019 , he landed at Monaco and has transformed the team into something incredibly enjoyable . They 've increased their output from 1.6 to 2.0 goals per match and scored 30 in an 11-match span earlier this calendar year . They are safely in fourth in Ligue 1 , but they 're also only one point out of third place and a Champions League position . <p> 11 . Eintracht Frankfurt ( 9.0 ) I had Eintracht pegged as a candidate for a run at Europe in the preseason , and that pick 's looking solid at the moment thanks to an attack featuring some of the most high-quality shots in Europe -- and with former Eintracht star Luka Jovic back on loan from Real Madrid in January -- and strong defensive pressure . The occasional defensive breakdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VfB Stuttgart ( 9.1 ) The freshly promoted Schwaben are perhaps the quintessential German team this year , producing loads of shots , intermittent pressure and occasionally hypnotic counterattacking . They hang big totals against bad teams ( five vs . Schalke , four vs . Augsburg ) and occasionally get run out of the building against good ones ( 0-4 vs . Bayern , 2-5 vs . Leverkusen ) . You 're getting goals one way or the other . <p> 9 . Sassuolo ( 9.2 ) They have n't kept up in the race for one of Serie A 's European slots , but Roberto De Zerbi 's Neroverdi take and allow a pickup game 's worth of shots , and they pressure the ball as well as anyone in the league not named Juve . They 're the perfect mid-table team , too : good enough to play close games against the top teams and the bottom teams . Ca n't beat tension and large goal totals . <p> 8 . Liverpool ( 9.3 ) It was bad news for Liverpool and their fans when seemingly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe Gomez , Joel Matip , even stand-ins Jordan Henderson and Fabinho ) got hurt , but from a watchability standpoint , the injuries and added vulnerability made the Reds even more fascinating . They still possess most of the defensive intensity you expect to see from a Jurgen Klopp squad , but frailties at the back have helped to create high shot quality for opponents and a lot more close matches than we perhaps expected . They probably wo n't get any less interesting as they attempt a late-year move back up the table , either . <p> 7 . AC Milan ( 9.4 ) Milan 's dreams of a first Scudetto since 2011 have faded -- Inter are six points up with a game in hand -- but this is still their best team in a while , and it 's a sexy team at that . They take lots of high-quality shots , they pressure with youthful vigor ( a lot of their minutes to go players 24 and younger ) and they occasionally give up lots of shots too . Serie A is , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , and Milan 's a big reason for that . <p> Bayern Munich are on the top of the world at the moment . Getty <p> 6 . Leeds United ( 9.5 ) It was easy to assume fun things from a Marcelo Bielsa team in the Premier League , and Leeds have n't disappointed . They both take and allow lots of shots , they allow only 3.4 passes per opponent possession -- fewest in the Big Five -- and they are always trying to throw haymakers even if they occasionally get knocked out in the process . They are neither fighting for a spot in Europe nor fighting to avoid relegation , but Leeds matches will remain must-watches all the same . <p> 5 . Borussia Dortmund ( 9.6 ) They still have Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho ( and Giovanni Reyna , and Marco Reus , and Jude Bellingham , and ... ) , so of course they 're entertaining . And in 2020-21 , they 've added bonus points for falling behind early in seemingly every single match and therefore producing plenty of tense finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-PSG PSG for the Ligue 1 title ? Lyon are possession-heavy and put together prettier attacks than anyone else in France . They attempt a decent number of through-balls , which wins me over , and they keep the accelerator on , for better or worse , against good teams . Even with a 4-2 loss to PSG on March 21 ( like I said , accelerator on ! ) , they 're still only three points back of the reigning champs , which could mean you want to watch Lyon matches both for their aesthetics and their importance . <p> 3 . Barcelona ( 9.6 ) As with Liverpool , an extra layer of vulnerability has made Barca incredibly fun to watch all year . They have alternated between a team capable of outright dominance -- case in point : their 6-1 domination of Real Sociedad on March 21 -- and a team capable of losing four early matches and drawing with teams like Cadiz and Alaves . But they 're fun and prolific and still produce some sexy ball movement . Eminently watchable . <p> 2 . Atalanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Atalanta continue to play the most aggressively optimistic soccer in the Big Five . They pressure you , they attempt a ton of shots ( and allow quite a few , too ) , they advance the ball vertically in a way that most of the richest clubs do not . They remain a treat for the eyes , and they are in decent position to qualify for the Champions League once more this year . Here 's to hoping manager Gian Piero Gasperini never leaves , and here 's to hoping he never changes . <p> 1 . Bayern Munich ( 9.8 ) When you read the criteria up top , you had to figure the reigning European champions would grade out well . No-one scores more , almost no-one pressures the ball more or allows fewer possessions , and no-one is more capable of coaxing good teams into a track meet instead of a 0-0 standstill . And in 2020-21 , they 've even had an added bonus : their defense has been pretty glitchy . Bayern matches average 4.4 goals this season ; no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely pull ahead and win eventually , you are going to see fireworks in the process , and no matches are more watchable.

" <p> The former Nandom MP said Mr Mahama has " his presence ; a leading and formidable person in the party , " but noted that it " does that mean that John Mahama himself accepts that he is now in control of the party ? " <p> " I do n't believe that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry to invent enemies for John Mahama and that is exactly what I 'm saying and I do n't know the motivation for people to sandbag John Mahama in that way " , Dr Kunbuor wondered . <p> In his view , the clamour for the former president " is childish , uninformed , unscientific and anti-John Mahama " , adding : " I believe he deals with it " . <p> " What I know is that John Mahama has his style of engaging this issue . I have my style which might be different . Other leading members of the part have their style . <p> " If I were in John Mahama 's position and I have seen bits of it with Jerry John Rawlings ; when you start behaving in this sycophantic manner , giving the impression that you are the one on whose health and breath John Mahama is surviving politically ; many people will not take that " , he warned . <p> " They will find an opportunity to draw your attention publicly that if that is the line you are running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunbuor noted . <p> According to him , the party is better off focusing on fixing its internal challenges before even thinking of the next flag bearer . <p> " What we should be talking about today in terms of what you see in the media is : ' who should be the flag bearer ' , ' who should not be the flag bearer ' . Those are the anglings enabled . And I said : ' No , you 're putting the cart before the horse ' . It 's on most of the party platforms : ' You need to deal with this and A should be the flag bearer and B should not be the flag bearer and A should be the flag bearer ' and I say that conversation is not opportune , it is irrelevant , it 's an invention of a problem onto the party , which they might not have immediate answers to but the issue of who becomes the flag bearer is contingent on a number of very specific issues which need to be addressed so that any flag bearer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke on Accra-based Joy News , said : " I can give you a number of scenarios . For instance , who has raised a question about a possible contest for a flag bearer ? Nobody . So , why is it important and why are you thinking that you are helping anybody beyond sycophancy of saying that A must automatically be the flag bearer ? Why do you jump when no one has pushed you ? " <p> For all you know , he noted , " you 'll get to the flag bearer contest and there might be no contest . So , why do you invent a problem of which the party structures have a mechanism for resolving ? " <p> " We have a mechanism for electing our leaders , imperfect as it might be , but what happens is that a mechanism exists . What we do not have a mechanism for are the challenges we are facing -- internal party democracy , how to maintain the values of the party -- and they are the ones that require engagement and wider conversation " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do you take such a position when there 's a mechanism for electing a flag bearer ? And the mechanism is to hold elections . Your vote at that election is one , your vote at that election is supposed to be private to you . What is the motivation of announcing your vote and your preference ? " <p> Dr Kunbuor believes the sycophants are not helping Mr Mahama with their commentary . <p> " The question we are raising is that you are doing a great disservice to the last flag bearer by this level of behaviour because if you are holding an office in the party and you know that you have not opened up the gateways for people to decide who should be flag bearer , why do you jump the gun ? Once you do that , your leaked mission comes into question and in any way , you are not helping anybody by jumping the gun " . <p> " For all you know , there is an unexpressed consensus that this is the direction in which we are going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble because for me to come out into the public and announce I am going with A or B , the question I am asking is that what point do I have to prove ? Am I being suspected of not going with A or B and that 's why I have to come out openly to say it ? The second issue is that : is that the responsibility of independent umpires who are likely to be involved in organising and activating the mechanism for us to elect the flag bearer ?

@@52390235 <h> The Church <p> By Adjei Boakye <p> Listen to article <p> The good old Lord has been so faithful to us and Has always been our guide and comforter . This is a good day He has made and I want to discuss something with the masses . This has been my dilemma for almost a year now . <p> It 's all about the church . It 's time to think about the recent happenings in the church as Christians . Some will disagree but this is my opinion . <p> The Church In Focus . <p> It 's time for the church ( the building and the members ) to ship from its current position . It 's time for us to make it attractive to the masses . Research has shown that less than 30% of the Christian community in Italy thinks about the church on Saturday or Sunday . Less than 20% of the Christian population thinks about its change in Germany .. and it goes on and on . For Africa , it 's worse and I think our Christian leaders should wake up . <p> A great paradigm shift is needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ... and we need church leaders . The era where we use the depth of ones pocket to measure his/her sense of reasoning is over and I think we should go for the right leaders to lead the church . <p> The church should be a place of problem solving .. not just a building with some beautification . It should be a home of peace , joy and wise counselling . This place should be a house of personal development and growth . Yes ! we have to pray as people but I think this is the time to go beyond prayers and fasting . <p> The church is expected to be an incubator , to incubate our future leaders . It 's expected to groom the next set of Leaders with morals who can drive this country to its rightful position . <p> This holy place should be a place where someone can boldly share his or her problems without being judged . A place where backbiting would n't be entertained . A place where unity is the beacon . A church that can see beyond look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gradually loosing its relevance in society . It should n't be an inhibitor of progress and newness . It 's not bad to give out to God , but the question is , what do our church leaders use the money for .... ? <p> Let me ask these few questions and I know you will understand me . <p> As a member of the church , when was the last time your pastor discussed business opportunities with you ? <p> When was the last time your pastor discussed scholarship opportunities with you .. ? <p> When was the last time your pastor discussed the well being of his members which include the health status of the members .... ? <p> Without all these things in place , the pastors expect us to fill the 500 capacity building each and every Saturday or Sunday . <p> That place is a place of good morals , values and good ethics that can help guide the members and the next generation . <p> It 's time to end that unnecessary pronouncements in the name of prophecies . This is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian leaders . Putting our people first should be the new mantra within the Christian circles . <p> Today is Sunday , and some do not feel like attending church because they do n't know the essence of going to that place . The bitterness alone is driving away God 's children and it 's time to build our house . <p> God this is the time to help us build the house . We are your builders , and we do n't want to labour in vain . Guide your people throughout and bless us with a third eye which can help us see beyond look . In Your hands we leave everything to .

President Vladimir Putin then announced a withdrawal , but both Blinken and Zelenskiy said Thursday that " significant " numbers of Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia has the capacity on fairly short notice to take aggressive action if it so chooses , " Blinken said . <p> The Pentagon estimates there are still 70,000 to 80,000 Russian troops near the border , the most Moscow has put there since the Crimean annexation , according to a senior US official familiar with intelligence estimates . More than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting with Russian-backed separatists . <p> Blinken arrived in Kyiv during massive NATO military exercises throughout Eastern Europe involving 28,000 troops from the US and other countries . It includes maneuvers and live fire training in multiple countries , including airborne operations in Romania and Bulgaria . <p> Together , the actions on the diplomatic and military fronts were intended to send an explicit message to Putin that the new US government would punish alleged behavior that has included devastating cyberattacks and election interference in the US ; the poisoning of political dissidents ; and military aggression in neighboring countries . The positioning of the NATO forces for the drills is meant to signal to Moscow that the Pentagon could move swiftly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A long list of economic sanctions against Russian officials and businesses has failed to deter Putin . <p> Blinken made a point of noting that his trip to Kyiv was one of only a small handful of in-person meetings he has had with foreign leaders , choosing Ukraine and Zelenskiy before Russia . <p> Ukraine played a starring role in US election intrigue when in 2019 then-President Donald Trump telephoned Zelenskiy and threatened to withhold military aid unless he helped dig up dirt on Trump 's political rivals -- and especially Joe Biden , whose son Hunter had a controversial , high-paying consultancy job with Ukraine 's state energy company . <p> The incident triggered Trump 's first impeachment trial , which saw a number of US diplomats go before Congress to testify about the Trump administration 's bizarre , ad hoc foreign policy , led by the former president 's personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani . <p> Zelenskiy , a **26;938;TOOLONG who once played a hapless president on a popular sitcom , found himself in the truly hapless position of wondering why this was happening to him .

Blinken said Biden would visit when the " time was right . " <p> Zelenskiy also expressed gratitude for U.S. help and defended his record on " good governance " anti-corruption reforms , which have also been at the forefront of Biden administration demands for Ukraine .

" Because we do n't have a strategy for the region , we do n't allocate resources to it .

Each kidney contains up to a million functioning units called nephrons which filters units of tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus attached to a tubule when blood enters the glomerulus . It is filtered and the remaining of fluid then passes along the tubule . <p> According to David N Adjei et al , Nephrology ( Carlton ) research titled " 20 year trends in renal disease mortality in Ghana : A review of autopsies " which was conducted in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital ( KBTH ) in Accra and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital ( KATH ) in Kumasi , indicated that out of a total of 94 309 deaths , 5608 were attributed to renal disease from 1994 to 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2013 to 10.8 per cent . <p> The research revealed that the major leading attributable causes of renal disease death include end stage renal disease 45.0 per cent and acute pyelonephritis accounting for 20.9 per cent of the cases . <p> Dr Mensah Amoah , a Physician Specialist at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , in an interview with the Ghana News Agency said Kidney Failure is when the kidney is unable to perform the functions that it normally does . " The kidney removes waste materials from the blood through the urine . It is the main organ that removes most waste materials from the body . The kidney also removes excess water and corrects acid levels in the blood . It helps to control the blood pressure and helps to maintain bone health , " he said <p> He said kidney disease was the 6th fastest growing cause of death worldwide and that about 14-17 per of Ghanaian had Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . <p> Dr Amoah said about 800 Patients in Accra were on dialysis and that Korle Bu Teaching Hospital admits about 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from kidney disease had doubled over the past ten years . <p> He said there were so many kidney diseases but people were most concerned about the ones that result in kidney failure which meant that the kidney function declined to the point where it was unable to undertake its normal functions and that " this affects an individual 's optimal health . " <p> Explaining the symptoms of kidney failure , Dr Amoah said it included body swelling , leg swelling , tummy swelling , and face swelling . " This is as a result of excess water being unable to come out . Some of the symptoms may be due to inability of the kidney to remove waste products from the body . This results in symptoms such as nausea , vomiting and stomach pain , he said . <p> Dr Amoah added that the kidney also helped the body to produce blood and that when the kidney failed to perform such function , an individual may experience anaemia , weakness , poor appetite , inability to speak well . " When it gets severe , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs which would affect breathing . " Severe cases may lead to coma when medical care is not sought . Some symptoms may not show up until it is very late , " he said . <p> He explained that the normal functioning of the kidney was usually measured above 60 and that when it goes below 15 , it means that it was in the last stage or end-stage kidney disease . <p> " There are two main types of kidney failure : chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury or acute renal failure ( this is a sudden onset of kidney failure ) . " <p> Dr Amoah said over the past decade , there had been an increase in the number of patients suffering from chronic kidney diseases in Ghana and that current data shows that about 10 -- 14 per cent of Ghanaians had various stages of chronic kidney disease . <p> He added that there had been an increasing number of referrals to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and other Tertiary facilities such as the 37 Military Hospital which also recorded increasing numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the hospital when they are at the last stage where it is difficult to determine the cause of the kidney disease , adding , " Chronic kidney diseases occur when the kidneys have gradually deteriorated over months or years .

The confident part of your brain wishes to believe something unavoidable ( but not dangerous ) occurred like his phone died or he 's truly overwhelmed at work and busy with things he ca n't control . <p> Or maybe your own phone is broken and your text simply did n't go through , so he 's been trying to call you without you knowing it . <p> Then there 's that miserable part of your brain that envisions the outright worst possible outcomes , causing feelings of rejection to surface . <p> What does it mean when a guy stops texting and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . <p> Maybe his attention has strayed elsewhere , maybe he 's scared of things getting serious , or maybe he 's just still not over his ex . <p> When a guy stops texting and calling you , it usually says more about him than it does about you . But sometimes , guys will retreat if you play hard-to-get for too long and put him in a position where he is always pursuing you and left unsure about how you feel about him . Men like to chase , but only for so long . <p> Or , you could have said something that was off-putting to him and he does n't know how to confront you about it . <p> So , how should you deal with this vanishing man ? Exactly what should you do when he goes silent ? <p> Follow these tips on what to do when he stops calling and texting you . <p> 1 . Stop yourself from bombarding him with messages . <p> When somebody is n't responding to you , the absolute worst thing you can do is bombard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fastest means to push someone away . <p> I know how irritating it is to go without feedback ; however , do not begin sending a bunch of texts or calling , Be sure to also avoid sending DMs on Facebook , Instagram , Snapchat or any other social media on which you 're connected . If you leave a voice message , you might come off as needy or creepy . <p> And do not text his friends to see if he 's with them . That only looks desperate ( and makes you seem a little crazy ) . <p> 2 . Follow the 3-day rule . <p> The 3-Day Rule is usually used after the first date , but it can be put into action at any time during a relationship or situationship . <p> Simply take a 3-day break from texting and calling him to see if he might initiate conversation . You can do this when he 's stopped communicating to give him time to come back . Equal effort in communication is good for the relationship . <p> If he has n't responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would call and never ever did , shoot him an easy , casual , playful text . <p> Stay casual about it . If you send out a mad , demanding text , he 's definitely not going to answer . <p> And I would personally drop it altogether if you do n't get a response after the second time you try . <p> 3 . If possible , reach out in person . <p> Casually try to see him in person , where you 'll be able to feel his vibe . Plus , it will give you the opportunity to dress to impress and ignite his attention . <p> Men tend to be visual creatures ( as are women , but we do n't need to go there right now ) , and sometimes they need a friendly reminder of how fantastic you are . <p> You 'll know something is up if he acts unusual or is really avoidant when he actually lays eyes on you . <p> 4 . Be careful about who you complain to . <p> I understand this whole scenario is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about who you complain to . <p> I would n't complain to any mutual friends you have with this person because they can easily go back and inform them what you stated or , even worse , make things more dramatic and make you seem crazy . <p> Vent to your own family members or friends who you know you can trust , but do n't let too many people know you 're upset . <p> 5 . Avoid writing about it on social media . <p> Again , you do n't want this to be a public affair . It 's between you and this person and it 's no one else 's business . <p> Avoid sub-tweeting nasty remarks or making subtle vague-booking Facebook statuses that are obviously about him and the situation . <p> You may believe doing that will capture his attention and send a signal to him to call or text you , but it will more certainly make you look immature and annoying -- and turn him off completely . <p> 6 . Do n't wait around for him . <p> When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to obsess as you wait anxiously for any possible text or message from this man . But whatever you do , do n't bother waiting for him . <p> Do n't spend your days sitting near the phone desperately waiting for his phone calls , ready to pick up the phone before the first ring . Live your life , and try to put him in the back of your mind . <p> 7 . Move on and cut your losses . <p> If he never ever reacts to anything you do , seriously , just forget him and move on . <p> Giving him no attention and doing your own thing will offer a much better message than sending him a long text explaining why he 's a dirtbag . <p> And if he 's not going to respect you enough to answer you , he 's unworthy of your time at all . <p> Those are your options of what to do when he goes silent . When he suddenly stops contacting you , you have to keep your dignity and self-respect . If he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@88414232 <h> Flashback : The 419 electoral promises by NPP <p> The good people of Ghana should not to buy into Akufo-Addo 's 419 promises <p> It is said that sin has many tools , but deception is the handle that fits them all . It is worrying that the NPP is fast carving out a niche for themselves as masters of the art of deception . I 'm , therefore , cynical about their campaign promises , and my cynicism is definitely not without cause . I have some justifications to make . Some of the broken promises in NPP 's 2000 manifesto are as follows : <p> Expansion of railway to the northern part of Ghana , construction of a public University in every region , building a factory in every district , create 500,000 jobs every year , establish a modern airport in Tamale , engagement of 20,000 sanitary inspectors every year , construction of fifty thousand housing units per year , just to mention a few . <p> Unfortunately , none of these was done in their eight years in government . The question many people would want to ask is : did the NPP lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did they mislead the electorate for political gain ? <p> Now , let 's fast forward to 2016 and examine the One district one factory policy -- an unfulfilled promise in 2000 . The critical question is which type of factories are they promising , and on what infrastructural basis are they building those factories ? In all sincerity , is this promise hitched on the admission that all our districts are now ripe for factories ? Are they putting their hopes on the massive roadworks , extended water supply , and electricity President Mahama has and is still undertaking in the districts ? <p> In economics , factors of production heavily hinge on infrastructure , so what is the infrastructure plan of the NPP towards their one district one factory promise ? How long will it take them to put in the factors of production , and how long will the procurement process and construction of 245 factories take ? We need to know the source of funding , supply chain strategy , and manpower plan . <p> President Mahama is building these infrastructure component factors of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he has a better understanding of how a factory is built . After all , he has demonstrated his competence by building the Komenda Sugar Factory and others from the base . <p> One Village , One Dam -- it is possibly easier for city dwellers to be deceived by this 419 promise . Not every village has the natural features for a dam , being irrigation or hydroelectric . If it 's dugouts , then Akufo- Addo should state that . <p> Interestingly , the one making the promise does not seem to know the difference between a dam and a dugout so how can he satisfactorily fulfill such a promise ? The irrigation capacity of a dam is measured by the landmass it covers , not by the village . One dam is capable of irrigating a landmass of 50 or more villages , so one village one dam exposes Akufo-Addo 's technical ignorance . <p> One constituency , one million dollars is another funny promise . In Ghana , we have the District Assembly Common Fund , so why not promise to put that one million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocate one million to a purely electoral area that is n't self-accounting . If this is n't an avenue for looting what else can it be ? Pure intent to steal , because the constituencies are pure political divisions under the MPs , who have no locus in our constitution to manage funds . <p> In any case , are the challenges of all the constituencies homogeneous ? Absolutely no ! This is a pure one-shop solution , a deceptive strategy used by a frustrated flag bearer who wants to be president at all costs . <p> Allowance/Salary for Arabic Teachers . It 's obvious Nana Akufo-Addo does n't even know that this is already happening , so I will spare him for his ignorance . <p> President Mahama has shown commitment to Arabic teaching by building one brand new Arabic Training College in Wenchi . He has also initiated the policy to allow the Arabic language to be examinable in Ghana at all levels . Currently , the syllabus is almost ready . <p> Free SHS . The progressive free SHS which is more sensible for our economy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Akufo-Addo has not told us how he is going to create those Jobs . President Mahama has outlined his job creation strategy which he calls Livelihood Empowerment through skills development , using YEA , then entrepreneurship development using YES , revival of GIHOC holding , Farmer Service Centre concept , expanding job avenues by building more schools , more health facilities , expanding military garrisons , and increasing police and other security agencies numbers and roles . <p> Growing the economy to 8% in 2017 to automatically churn out jobs , etc . This is what is called a clear plan . <p> NHIS now has national coverage with twenty times hospital visitations and increased payment to one billion dollars annually as compared to the NPP 's mutual scheme that was nowhere near this current one . I 'll entreat readers to go to Joy FM for the truth . <p> Restoration of full allowances for teacher/nurse trainees is an act of double standards by the NPP . They proposed this withdrawal in their 2007/08 budget guidelines , so why this U-turn ? How can such a promise be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did n't they tell us corruption is as old as Adam and ca n't be fought ? I hope readers have not forgotten about waa waa , K.T. Hammond 's drillship , hotel Kufour , Amoako Tufour , the looting of lands in Accra , and what happened during Ghana at 50 celebrations . <p> President Mahama is exposing corruption , unlike those who said publicly they would n't expose corruption in their government to bring it down . Well , it will interest my cherished readers to know that President Mahama has signed into policy , the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan . Please get a copy and read it . This is a government that is serious in the fight against corruption . <p> Our primary source of revenue comes from taxes , but a party that has promised heaven , one this one that says it will reduce taxes and would n't borrow , and yet has a very high budget by restoring students loans , building 245 factories , giving one million dollars to 275 constituencies every year , build a dam each for all villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magicians have stopped making such promises . ' Opana ' should come again . <p> In conclusion , I want to admonish the good people of Ghana not to buy into Akufo-Addo 's 419 promises as we go to the polls . Let 's heed the advice of Ekiti State Governor of Nigeria , Ayodele Fayose not to succumb to deceit and vote for change because Nigerians buying into the All Progressives Congress ( APC ) deceptive message of change has brought hunger , suffering , and economic recession to their country .
