That air crash at Ejigbo , Lagos shook Nigeria to its foundation as all the passengers died , with 173 bodies found later and 27 missing . <p> The air tragedy left over 200 young Nigerian women widows ( most of them less than 30 years ) and severalNigerian children ( including those in the womb ) fatherless . On this day , many families lost their breadwinners in one fell swoop . <p> On that black Saturday , Nigeria lost a generation of intelligent and vibrant young military officers not to war but to human error of a plane crash . <p> Following the tragedy , the Federal Government of Nigeria promised to compensate families of the deceased . But to what extent that has been fulfilled still remains unclear . <p> After the burial on October 5 , 1992 , the late General Sani Abacha addressed the families of the deceased and promised that government would compensate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armed Forces . He added then that a panel of enquiry would be set up to look into the cause of the crash . <p> State governments were directed to provide housing for the widows of the victims in their states of origin . Acting on this directive , Ogun , Oyo , Lagos , Osun and Ondo states immediately provided the accommodation . <p> Mr Dele Onabokun(r) presenting a key to Mrs Grace Bamidele , one of the beneficiary widows <p> Cross River through its governor , Clement Ebri then pledged support of N50 , 000 and automatic scholarship for the children of the victims up to university level . Non-indigenous officers who served in the State got N25 , 000 . <p> Most states in the North , however , failed to provide accommodation relief to the widows . Mrs. Useni , it was learnt , was squatting along the Hospital Road , Jos with her five children . Her plight was similar to that of seven others widows most of whom were unemployed . And for feeding and maintenance of their families they lived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NAOWA . <p> In 1994 , a directive was issued from the office of the Chief of Defence Staff that letters should be given to all the widows to their various state administrators for accommodation . This according , Mrs. Ukagha , a widow was not the terms of the promise . While some of the state administrators responded positively , some shut their doors against the widows . <p> In Benue State , dilapidated houses were allocated to the widows . Abia State would only provide house if widows provide lands . In fact , most of the widows and their children were thrown out of their various barracks even before accommodations were provided outside the barracks for them . <p> Apart from the disregard to the terms of conditions of service , the widows were also denied their husbands ' gratuities ; the Peugeot cars given to military officers of the rank of Captain and above were denied some of those whose husbands were not privileged to receive before the crash . <p> After suffering in silence for nine years , the widows represented by Mrs. Hadiza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioned the Human Rights Violation Commission headed by Justice Chukwudifu Oputa for redress . In the petition , they demanded among other things for : <p> *Implementation of terms and condition of service of the Armed Forces to wit sections 331 to 335 . That the military should implement conditions applicable to Federal Government scholarship students . Widows who remain unmarried and the children should be paid the officers ' entitlements . <p> The Army agreed to have an out of court settlement with the families of the C-130 plane crash . In the memorandum of agreement , they agreed to settle the families and the widows of the deceased in consonance with sections 331-335 of the Nigerian Army condition of service . With the agreement , the military would pay N15 , 000 for primary school , N25 , 000 for secondary school and N50 , 000 for tertiary .

This phrase , which has been used for ages , was constructed to help the public see beyond the guns , handcuffs , teargas and batons that police are often accompanied with , to the reasons for the police force which primarily is " to maintain law and order " as we were taught in elementary school/foundational days . This bullying tools helped , at best when they were introduced , in frightening off the public from anything associated with the police-not just crime . So , in order to check the defeat of the police aim , this phrase was introduced . But , from experience and through history , it 's been proven that , in Nigeria , this singular phrase has been seen to be more frightening to the public than the guns . <p> The Nigerian Police , through lack of proper training , has helped in modernizing crime in Nigeria .

The police , as a result , became the fastest agent of propagating bribery and corruption in Nigeria . At this time it 's imperative to say that this fallout is mainly between the police and the common populace and not between the police and the " welthies " of the land .

@@1794236 <h> People are so much into oil and gas because of the way our economy is <p> By Ebele Orakpo Alhaji Usman A. Danmalam is the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Middle East Energy Limited , an oil services and haulage outfit with headquarters in Kaduna , Nigeria . <p> In a recent chat with Vanguard in Kaduna , Alhaji Danmalam , a man with high business acumen who has gone from provisions , to fertilizer and now oil and gas business , told the story of his rise from an ordinary trader to an oil magnate and why banks are not readily lending to businesses . Excerpts : <p> According to Alhaji Danmalam , he went into business about 20 years ago at the famous Singer market in Kano , dealing in soap , sugar , and all manner of provisions from Lever Brothers and PZ Industries . " I would buy and sell in bulk but after some time , I went into fertilizer business . <p> I did that for some time and then went into the oil and gas business in 1993 when the fertilizer business was going down . I was then at NAFCON in Port Harcourt so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NBC , and other companies in the area . That was how I started the oil and gas business . <p> I continued until the Port Harcourt refinery was shut down and I moved down to Lagos where I started buying from private depots . Sometimes I send the consignment to Port Harcourt and sometimes to the north . " Alhaji Danmalam later joined Rahamanniya Global Resources Limited , an oil marketing company from 2001 to 2007 when he decided to start his own company , Middle East Energy Resources Ltd . He noted that although the business is very lucrative , but has been drastically affected by the recent global economic meltdown experienced worldwide . <p> " Back then , we really enjoyed the business and dealing with the banks , especially during the mergers because you could get facilities to run your business but since the economic meltdown , things have changed . Every business has been affected in one way or the other . Now , to get a bank loan to finance your business is not easy . <p> My working capital is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is how I have been able to continue in business . Before this time , you could give the bank your garage or a plot of land as collateral and they provide money for you , but now , everything has changed because they no longer accept empty land , you must erect a structure on the land before they can accept it as collateral . It is now very difficult for upcoming entrepreneurs because the banks will not assist them as they do not have collateral . <p> Even long standing customers can not easily access bank loans . They will want to see your monthly turnover and they may give you a target of N100 million . It 's no longer only their marketers they give targets , even the customer is not spared . If your turnover is not enough , you must have a house , or a third party 's house if both of you agree and the bank agrees . So , the way things are now , we are just moving by the grace of God , " he noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of the oil and gas industry " because banks lost so much money to the industry . People will borrow money and are unable to pay back due to no fault of theirs . <p> For instance , the price of diesel is still high , it 's not that people can not import diesel but the banks can not open the LPO at this high rate because of what had happened before . At the beginning of the economic meltdown , AGO 's landing cost was N136 but it crashed to N70 . So assuming you brought in 1,000 trucks , you would be losing over N1 billion so that is why the price of AGO is high because every bank is afraid to open the LPO . <p> You can open it today , and before the product arrives , the prices have crashed . For PMS it is a different matter as it is subsidized by government . The landing cost of PMS is over N100 per litre , the government pays the balance to PPPRA . That is why everybody is selling at N65 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer to the big buyer , everybody is facing one challenge or the other . This problem is not peculiar to the oil and gas sector , it affects every sector of the economy and why people are so much into oil and gas is because of the way our economy is . " <p> Despite the challenges of finance and security , Danmalam said he has decided to continue the business which he started with one truck but today , he can boast of 32 trucks loading products from Lagos , Warri , Port Harcourt and Kaduna . " I never collected bank loan to buy trucks because you can not make it that way . <p> Example , if you collect N10 million from the bank , the equity on that money is N2 million , then you do the insurance , at least N1m . The bank charges on this money is 25% so that when you add it all up , you are looking at N14m and this N10m they give you is for one year . You may decide to be paying a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for one truck and this truck may likely do three to four trips in a month . Some of my trucks stay up to one month on a trip . If I had collected loan from the bank , how then do I pay back ? " he asked . <p> Continuing he said : " We need to improve on security . Before , our only fear in this business was accidents but today , things have changed . When a driver moves in the night these days , armed robbers may attack him , tie him up and throw him into the bush , carry the truck , sell off the products and abandon the empty truck somewhere on the road . <p> I think NUPENG should do something about this , like putting a law in place that says once it is 6.00pm , every truck driver must park . Because they may even kill the driver in the process and supposing the owner had taken a loan from the bank to get the truck and product , how does he pay back ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company with 75 people in its employ , noted that no country can progress without electricity , lamenting that so many able-bodied men have become motorcycle ( okada ) riders as a result of job losses . " If we have constant and adequate electricity supply , I believe those going into okada business will drastically reduce . <p> In Kaduna State alone , we have 19 textile factories , but only two are functional now . These textile mills can take care of over five million people but today , these people are jobless , and some have become okada riders , brick layers or fire wood sellers . They go to the bush and fell trees to sell as firewood as a means of livelihood even though the government is against deforestation . But if we have 24-hour electricity supply , I believe Nigerians are very creative , very strong people and ready to work . " <p> Alhaji Danmalam called on the government to subsidise solar energy so that " we in the north especially , with a lot of sunshine , can switch over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other sources of power work effectively . <p> It is not a one day job . All the PHCN cables need repairing or replacing , we need more transformers because even if we generate enough electricity , distribution is another problem . In some areas , you see light but it is so low that you can not use it for anything . It is frustrating hearing the same story everyday . The money they have poured into PHCN was enough for the UAE to transform Dubai . <p> They used less than $20 billion to get Dubai to the level it is today everybody wants to go to Dubai . Nigeria is the heart of Africa and I tell you , if we have constant electricity supply , and put our infrastructure in order , neighbouring countries will be coming here to look for jobs . <p> He said he had tried to create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths but lack of electricity supply has been a great set back . " I bought a machine that makes wafers from Turkey and I tried it and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending all my profit on diesel to generate electricity with which to run the machine .

I decided to go for something that I could do immediately and I found this best in lives of ordinary people around events . We started small but today , we have grown . <p> We did Idol West Africa .

I do n't like scaring people away , so If I see someone that has a potential , even if I do n't have anybody that can sign you , I will direct the person to someone . I try and encourage artistes and put them in the right direction but to actually sit down and manage them , is not for me . But there is one guy , Vocal Slender who is now under my wing . We are hoping that he would explode into the music world soon . <p> The reason I was drawn to him was that he is a street boy but he never one day picked up a gun and said because life is so hard , this is the root .

The first time I went to her house to get my hair done , she kept looking at me and I was asking myself why she was just looking at me the way she did . She is also big . At first , I thought maybe she knew me and was going to say she knew me from somewhere . Eventually , she asked if I had ever heard of the Miss Big and Beautiful competition and I said yes .

I was somebody that never believed in beauty competitions before I entered . I never liked it because I felt that if something like talent and intelligence were attached to it , it would have been better looking at the whole personality of the person . <p> When I declined , she said okay that she has a book where she puts her clients names and addresses .

It was a very casual thing but when I entered it , to certain extent , I saw a lot of women that were very shy and at the end of the competition , become very bold and proud . It was a good thing for me . I actually saw another side of beauty pageant . And to my surprise , I won and I was the only African girl there . <p> Nowadays , people who win beauty pageants go into NGOs . Did you do something like that ? Not in England . They assigned on work to do . But as a queen I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is a very Nigerian thing . And when they ask you question in the competition , it is the same answer .

That is not how it works in England . I guess their own form of NGO was to do what I was doing . Going round and talking to children without being paid . <p> How do you see showbiz in Nigeria ? Showbiz in Nigeria is doing well . I think that if the government should put eyes down , they would see that this will be one of our biggest money makers on the continent .

It is good to remind you , that his only offence that led to his purported impeachment by Obasanjo and Adebibu with cooperation of Akala was his insistence not to share Oyo State money for their reckless uses . However , it is a sad story today that the traditional ruler with some notable business contractors , who enjoy the loot of the present government in Oyo State are now funding ACN wanting to continue to share the treasury from where they stopped after the sharing formula caused problems among themselves . It was notable that they now have external god fathers apart from the one inside , whose agenda is to share the money among themselves and installing their children to position of authority . Let the traders , workers , and teachers , young and old stand up to liberate our state from these people . My Brother Ajimobi may be Sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunes .

@@1797235 <h> BOKO HARAM : The Northern Nigeria ( Hausaland ) <p> By SHEHU SANI THE Northern Nigeria of today comprises 19 states , and to a very large extent , Abuja , the Federal Capital Territory , FCT . Despite the heterogeneous ethnic composition of the North , the Hausa-Fulani ethnic group still predominates , with over 70 percent of its people belonging to the Hausa-Fulani ethnic stock . By extension , the historical evolution of the Hausa group is closely linked with other ethnic groups that can be found in the region . <p> The source of origin of Hausaland has been a subject of conjectures . There is a tradition which states that Hausaland was founded by a man named Abuyazigu ( Bayajida ) . Bayajida was said to have fled from his father in Baghdad ( the present Iraq ) after a quarrel . On his way , he arrived at Daura ( Hausaland ) now in Katsina State and allegedly helped to kill a terror snake which had menaced the people for a long time . In appreciation of his gesture in killing the snake , the Queen of Daura , was said to have married him and a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bawo later got married , but still had a concubine . Legend had it that the wife gave Bawo seven legitimate sons and the concubine also gave Bawo seven other illegitimate sons . These sons proceeded to establish the 14 Hausa states . This actually is the legend , but the true origin of the Hausa remains a subject of historical conjectures . <p> The 19th century tourist , Heinrich Barth , in trying to establish the genealogy of the Hausa , links them with the Atlanter of Herodotus . It is , however , certain that some of the people we now refer to as Hausas had lived in a more interior part of the present Northern states than that which they now occupy . The Hilal invasion brought into these lands Tuaregs , who were said to have been driven southward by the Barber Tribes of North Africa . <p> Tuaregs and Barbers <p> For sometime , the Tuaregs and Barbers lived in harmony and intermarried . Their intermarriages produced half-castes . These half-castes were said to have migrated southwards and founded various states , the most ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the ancestor of the Hausas . His descendants , Daura , Gobir , Kano , Rano , Katsina and Zaria were the founders of the kingdom which still bear these names . <p> These descendants together with Biran were called the seven legitimate Hausa states ( Hausa Bakwai ) . The other states whose population had been mixed through intermarriages with foreign elements ( Nupe , Gwari , Yauri , Bauchi , Zamfara , Kebbi ) were known as bastard Hausas . ( Hausa Banza Bakwa ) . <p> These resulting kingdoms varied in extent . The oldest ; Biran and Rano were not much larger than their capitals . However , the others developed considerably . The rulers of the various Hausa states are called Sarakai ( Emir ) . Although they exhibited a slight variation in culture , they had homogeneity of language . <p> Islam in Northern Nigeria <p> The first contact with Islam by the people of Kano and the entire Hausa-land and by extension Northern Nigeria was in 1370 . It was introduced by merchants and scholars from Western Sudan ( Mali ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1385 . Ali Tsamia was also called Sarkin Yaji because of his hot temperament . <p> He was at that time , the ruler of Hausaland . Apart from Islam , which was newly introduced at that period , there were other traditions , such as the bori-cult which was very influential . The rulers at these times did not reject Islam completely nor did they adhere very strictly to the principles and the teachings of the Holy Qur'an . Consequently , they were called pagans by revivalist and fundamentalist Hausa-Fulani . <p> In Kano , at that time , the king had the power to decide what the state religion should be , and with such power , Ali Tsamia , made Islam the official religion . In the process , he built a mosque and by his authority ordered the people of Kano to pray five times a day . He equally appointed Islamic officials such as Imam , Muezzin and Quadi . However , the fact that the king had accepted Islam did not mean that everybody else accepted it . <p> Indeed , many people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have refused to embrace the Islamic religion , and were deeply attached to their ancestral or traditional religion . In fact , the six successive rulers after Ali Tsamia were said to have equally refused to embrace Islam . <p> During the reign of Mohammed Rumfa ( 1463-1499 ) , Islam had penetrated Kano which was then inhabited by the Hausa people called Maguzawa . It was after the conquest by Uthman Dan Fodio ( 1802-1817 ) that Islam began to spread among the Maguzawa people . By the time the British arrived the area , it was estimated that about half of the Maguzawa had accepted Islam . <p> Before the arrival of Islam , the Maguzawa had a belief in Allah as the Supreme Being who could be approached or invoked through other deities . They also had a belief on the last day when Allah will judge everyone , punishing and rewarding each person accordingly . <p> The Maguzawa people also believed in and worshipped spirit ( Iskoki or Iskokai ) who inflicts or removes suffering from people when they are invoked . The religion of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religion were in synchronization with those of the Maguzawa . <p> However , as time passed , some of the spirits were believed to be good and lived in the city where they were considered and compared to Muslims who lived in the city . The black spirits were seen as being purely wicked and evil and were considered as Maguzawa who lived in the bush . <p> Traditional religions <p> Therefore , in many of the Hausa states , we saw how Islam existed side-by-side with traditional religions . Severally , there were frequent wars of proselytizing and supremacy between these Hausa states , yet , there were a number of factors which encouraged the development of unity among the Hausa states . One of them , and perhaps the most cogent , was the Bayajida legend which served as a unifying factor among the different Hausa sub-groups . <p> The importance of the legend was primarily the fact that it provided the belief that all Hausa states had a common origin and derived from common ancestors . Another potential rallying point for unity among the Hausa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 The 1980 Maitatsine uprising marked the watershed of large-scale ethno-religious conflicts comparable to a small-scale war in a smaller nation . It has become a landmark reference of ethno-religious conflicts in African nations by local and international media , policy makers and strategic political analysts . It was a conflict that heightened the Nigerian security operatives ' sensitivity to the activities of legal and illegal aliens on her shore . <p> The 1980 Kano Maitatsine massacre was said to have been ignited by a violent confrontation between the authority and the Al-Masifu sect led by Alhaji Muhammadu Marwa Maitatsine . The Al-Masifu members estimated between 3000 and 5000 denounced ostentatious display of wealth , such as owning houses , wearing Muslim customs , such as facing Mecca while praying , an act which an average Kano Muslim considered sacrilegious . <p> The sect members , therefore , sought to purify the practice of Islam to conform with the teachings of their leader .

He decidedly sent a letter to Maitatsine and his followers ordering them to leave Kano immediately . The sect leader received the governor 's order , but decided to ignore it , damning any consequences of his action or inaction . <p> The beginning of the end for the Maitatsine 's reign of terror came exactly three weeks after the governor 's expulsion letter was issued . On December 18 , 1980 , the Al-Masifu sect members allegedly attacked orthodox Muslims praying outside Kano city grand mosque . <p> Police attempt to bring the situation under control was rebuffed by the sect members and the governor of the state was thus constrained to ask the Federal Government to send in the military .

@@1797236 <h> Compendium on Fair Hearing <p> The importance fair hearing to the administration of justice and jurisprudence needs not be over-emphasised . Recently , a Federal High Court in Lagos nullified the sack of the former Director-General of the Nigerian Sock Exchange ( NSE ) , Professor Ndi Okereke-Onyuike by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) principally because she was not given the right or opportunity to state her side of the allegations heaped on her . <p> For instance , delivering judgement in the suit she instituted challenging her sack , Justice Mohammed Idris not only described SEC 's letter removing Okereke-Onyuike from office as reckless , hasty and in bad faith , but also added that the removal was irrational and did not comply with the condition precedent in removing the plaintiff . What is this condition ? Fair hearing . <p> Justice Idris faulted SEC , saying that it was wrong for it to act on the allegations upon which it removed the plaintiff without giving her the opportunity of fair hearing . <p> Hear the judge : " It is indeed ridiculous that SEC removed the plaintiff within 24 hours based on bad and unverified allegations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted in any forum and in any manner whatsoever to answer those allegations on their merits . " <p> The above example vividly describes how important the emphasis fair hearing places in both justice administration and jurisprudence in Nigeria and all over the world . <p> In Nigeria , so many people have had cause to sue or institute suits or be sued because they were not given the opportunity to state their own side of the story and as such , were sanctioned wrongly . While some have won , others have lost . <p> Section 36(1) of the Constitution also supports the need for fair hearing before any action is taken hence it expressly states that : " In the determination of the civil rights and obligations , including any question or determination by or against any government or authority , a person shall be entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by a court or other tribunal established by law and constituted in such manner as to secure its independence and impartiality . " <p> The concept of fair hearing is an integral part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairness . The principles belie the whole jurisprudence of law and justice . <p> The rule of fair hearing requires that in all disputes between two more parties , judgement should not be based on one-sided testimony . It is interesting that fair hearing is not only applicable to the courts or tribunals but also to any person or persons acting in a judicial capacity . <p> Because of how important the concept of fair hearing is , eminent legal practitioner and arbitrator , Fabian Ajogwu ( SAN ) , in his latest book Fair Hearing , tries to approach the topic with emphasis on the 1999 Constitution . <p> In the book , he carefully selects his materials and cases in way that presents the practical issues that come in a consideration with the concept and fair trial . <p> In the book , Ajogwu takes a careful look at the meaning of fair hearing and fair trial , before analysing the right to a fair hearing under the 1999 Constitution , making references to decided cases under the constitution as well as under the equivalent provisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peoples ' Right . <p> The twin principles of audi alteram partem ( let the other side be heard and nemo judex in causa sua ( that no one should be a judge in his own case ) are discussed comprehensively in the context of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights . The author provides a practical guide to the remedies that are available under the Fundamental Rights ( Enforcement Procedures ) Rules of 2009 . <p> In writing Fair Hearing , it was not Ajogwu 's intention to provide a comprehensive survey of all instances of fair hearing in the both the judicial and administrative processes . <p> Rather his aim was to provide a practical evaluation of the substantive as well as procedural approach to the concept and principles of fair hearing , , which is crucial to the administration of justice in any legal system . <p> The idea to write the book , according to the Ajogwu , was predicated on the need to have a textbook , as opposed to a source-book to deal with the substantive law as well as give insights into the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1999 Constitution . <p> The 166-page book , the author attempts to look at the development of the audi alteram partem ( let the other side be heard ) , with emphasis on the scope and limitations . More specifically he examines the instances where the rule is excluded and the specific circumstances that must occur to warrant such . <p> He also discussed ex-parte situations and nemo judex in causa sua rule ( not to be a judge in one 's own case ) and the attitude of the courts where the issues is raised . <p> He holds that the view that the rules of natural justice are the minimum standards of fair decision-making imposed on persons or bodies acting in a judicial capacity . <p> He goes further to pronounce that where the relevant person or body is required to determine questions of law or fact in circumstances where its decisions will have a direct impact on the rights , liabilities or legitimate expectations of the parties involved , an implied obligation to observe the principle of natural justice arises . <p> However , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 90 , the author used the Abalaka v Minister of Health case as determined by courts of competent jurisdiction to show that it is not in all cases that one can claim that he or she was not given the opportunity of fair hearing . <p> In most discussions and discourse involving fair hearing , the subject of remedies is often ignored , yet it is an integral part of the legal process but the author in the concluding chapter , attempts to provide a practical guide to the remedies available under the Fundamental Rights ( Enforcement Procedures ) Rules of 2009 . <p> All of these bring depth and meaning to the book . Even though the book lays no claim to perfection , it is certainly a bold step by Ajogwu in sharing his wealth of experience and research in the field . <p> The book is a reference material for litigants , lawyers and law teachers . The sharp and attractive typefaces make the book interesting to read . <p> It is also a must read for students , teachers of law , judicial officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and justice in the determination of their rights and liabilities of others . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1797240 <h> The Allure of Osogbo Art <p> When they held the first experimental art workshop in Osogbo in 1962 , the late Ulli Beier and his former wife Susanne Wenger had no idea that they were leaving behind a legacy , whose impact would reverberate in the art scene . Okechukwu Uwaezuoke reports . <p> Susanne Wenger looked somewhat surreal in Western clothes . Was she trying to make an artistic statement with that black fedora , which complemented her black suit ? This after all was an Austrian woman , who after half-a-century of her life in the south-western Nigerian town of Osogbo , was seen more often than not in the local print shirts and pants and a straw hat . <p> Then , the fact that she was helped up the dais was a reminder to those gathered in her honour at the Osun State Government House hall in Osogbo that she was on her 90th year on earth . The presence of the then governor , Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola , and the Austrian ambassador , Christian Fellner italicised the significance of the occasion : the art community was celebrating one of the founders of the Osogbo Art School . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday , collaborated with her recently-deceased former husband , Ulli Beier , to establish the trend-setting experimental art workshop in 1962 in Osogbo . This workshop , followed by another , produced some of Nigeria 's finest informally trained artists . <p> A string of activities had paved the way for this first workshop . Dramatist Duro Ladipo was then running a recreational centre on the ground-floor of his Ibadan home . This centre , which eventually assumed the name Mbari Club , became the hub of the arts community . Playwrights , actors , musicians and artists emerged from this creative mill . <p> At the Mbari Club -- later Mbari Mbayo Club in Osogbo -- regular art workshops , exhibitions and stage performances held regularly . Fun-seeking members of the university community thronged to this venue to hang out with artists , writers and musicians . <p> At the first workshop in Osogbo , the first set of students included the late Rufus Ogundele , the late Jacob Afolabi , Muraina Oyelami , Yinka Adeyemi , Ademola Onibokuta ( nicknamed " Professor " ) , Adebisi Fabunmi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ajibola ) . <p> Meanwhile , strain in the Beier-Wenger nuptials became evident after the first experimental art workshop , which brought artisans together in Osogbo . While Beier became more and more dewy-eyed about contemporary Nigerian art , Wenger was sucked into the vortex of the traditional Yoruba religion . <p> With the maverick couple 's eventual separation , Beier married British-born artist and admirer , Georgina while Wenger found love in the arms of a Yoruba traditional drummer , called Lasisi . Enter Phase Two of the experimental art workshops in 1964 . Georgina Beier led the workshop , which drew over 30 participants . <p> Among these were members of the Duro Ladipo theatre company . When the two-week creative experiment ended , four artists who became the pillars of what informally became known as the Osogbo Art School emerged . They were Twins Seven-Seven ( born Taiwo Olaniyi ) , Muraina Oyelami , Adebisi Fabunmi and Jimoh Buraimoh . <p> Perhaps , what distinguished this workshop from others was the fact that the participants -- even with no previous formal art training -- were virtually left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awaken their hidden creative instincts . <p> " Georgina Beier sought to make us more independent from the outset , " Buraimoh recalled in an interview . " We were only asked to express what we had in our minds without being told exactly what to do and how to do it . We were only given brown paper , brushes and powder paints which we mixed with water . " <p> The four , whose works were eventually selected , owed their success to their previous exposure to stage performances . This explained why their initial expressions in visual arts harked back at those performances and festivals . <p> Above all , they were told to discover and express their individual styles of expressions . This , Georgina told them , would emboss their art with the imprint of authenticity . This explains how each member of the Osogbo quartet evolved their trademark individual styles , which earned them international recognition . <p> With series of local and international exhibitions , the art community gradually became aware of the existence of this peculiar group of informally-trained artists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goethe-Institut in the late 1960s -- that exposed them to both expatriate and Nigerian collectors . <p> Among the latter was Sammy Olagbaju , who currently chairs the Visual Arts Society of Nigeria -- better known by its acronym VASON . Today , the works of these artists adorn the homes of virtually every major art collector in Lagos . <p> Curiously , it was on account of their childlike expressions -- derisively dubbed " naive " by the formally-trained artists -- that they became a major aesthetic force in the contemporary Nigerian art scene . <p> With a pied-piper retinue of devotees swarming around these original artists , more artists deemed it fashionable to hoist the Osogbo banner . Lagos-based expatriate collectors were constantly stalked and harassed by these artists claiming to be trained in Osogbo . <p> New creative tributaries , inspired by the Osogbo Art School , detached from the mainstream techniques of formally-trained artists .

A painting by self-taught artist , Emmanuel Ekeffrey , would for instance easily pass for an Osogbo art . Ditto works by Wole Lagunju and the Ona artist , Tola Wewe . <p> Any subsisting dichotomy between the informally-trained and formally-trained artists has also vanished , thanks to the increasing interactions between the two groups . Nike Davies-Okundaye , an Osogbo-trained artist who was once married to the late Twins Seven-Seven , currently owns the largest gallery space in Nigeria . <p> This four-floored edifice along the Lekki Expressway in Lagos has recently hosted frontline Nigerian artists like the US-based Dele Jegede and Lagos-based Rom Isichei and Kainebi Osahenye . <p> The spotlight returns to this authentically Nigerian art movement with the recent passing away of Twins Seven-Seven and his mentor , Ulli Beier . <p> Please leave your comment below .

The real sector in Nigeria is on the decline . Let me say upfront that the economy is growing , that is what we are told . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on the street today looking for jobs than we had 10 years ago .

Who does that in other parts of the world ? There is no way there will be good roads in this country because of our climate , especially down south , where you have all the ports . <p> You have to truck products up north and they go through these roads that are not constructed to take these heavy loads .

It is gradually wiping out the profits of these companies . I say this to let you know that we can not really compete . <p> " You can also not close your borders because we belong to the WTO . All the bilateral agreements that we have signed , we must obey . At the time textile was in production say seven years ago , the base cloth that we print on , the one produced in Nigeria was costing us about 80 Kobo per meter . <p> The one coming from India was landing here with clearance and everything from the ports , with less than 50 Kobo .

If you look at the chemicals that we need for textile , you will be shocked that most of them are by-products of petroleum . For you to make man- made fibre , you need a peculiar acid and things like that . <p> The original design for our refining and petro-chemical plants was to produce these raw materials . Several years down the line , we are not producing . So , if you want to produce textile , everything that you need to produce is imported . How can you compete ?

It is the attitude of the Nigerian to work . It is not my father 's work and that is why when they leave and set up their own businesses , they can not change their attitude . <p> " Again , if you look at the cost of funds , banks are not interested in putting money into manufacturing that have long gestation period .

Look at a company like Dunlop , it has closed down , Michelin has closed down and textile is virtually gone . The real sector has a problem . Let us not rejoice that the economy is growing . <p> " The economy is not growing . Tell me one organisation that can tell the public the number of people in its employment . We do not have the statistics , let alone record them into age groups . <p> We do not even know how many people are graduating . We do not know how many people will go into labour market tomorrow .

A Federal High Court in Benin City has ordered the wife of Edo State Deputy Governor , Mrs. Endurance Odubu , to pay N12 million as damages to a soldier . <p> Captain Olorunduyilemi Stephen , an officer of the Nigerian Army serving with the 4th Brigade , Benin City , was allegedly beaten up and detained by security operatives attached to Mrs. Odubu in January last year.Odubu 's convoy was said to have overtaken him in a traffic jam on Sapele Road , Benin City , on January 11 , 2010 . They were said to be returning from a branch of the Winners Chapel . <p> But then , a Hilux van overtook Stephen 's car . He continued his journey , perhaps not knowing that the white van that passed earlier was the pilot car in Odubu 's convoy .

They beat him severely for obstructing the entourage of the deputy governor 's wife . <p> Stephen subsequently dragged the woman to court for infringing on his fundamental human rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adamu Hobon ordered Odubu to tender an apology to the Army officer in three electronic media and two national dailies . <p> Stephen , through his counsel , Mr. Clement Dike , had filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Benin City seeking N502 million as damages in addition to an unreserved apology to be published in five national dailies and three electronic channels for the beating he received from the security operatives . <p> According to Justice Hobon in his judgment , the use of siren is for emergency by fire fighters and to clear the road for top government officials . <p> He said the wife of a deputy governor was a private person and not entitled to heavy security guard and the use of siren . <p> Hobon added that the defendant did not arraign the complainant before any competent court since the incident occurred in January 2010 which , according to him , meant that the complainant did not commit any offence . <p> Describing the beating of Stephen as " unlawful , unconstitutional and barbaric " , Justice Hobon awarded N2 million as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million for general damages for infringement on fundamental human rights and illegal detention of Stephen . <p> Stephen was allegedly beaten up along Sapele Road , Benin City when his car almost ran into the six cars used as convoy by the deputy governor 's wife . <p> Consequently , security operatives attached to her were said to have forcibly dragged the captain out and beat him up before taking him to the private residence of Mrs. Odubu . <p> In his reaction , counsel to Stephen said the damages awarded were not enough , disclosing that his client would appeal . <p> According to him , " the judgment is not bad except in the area of awarding damages . We are not satisfied with it . We will take our reply up at the appeal . The fact that this applicant goes to court is enough to give him more damages to encourage other soldiers to seek justices in the law court . " <p> Counsel to Odubu , Mr. Jimoh Ohiafi , said the judgment was in the right direction . <p> " This is democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> We should do away with this kind of nonsense , I suggest that a law be promulgated to the effect that any public official who engages or whose spouse , children or relatives engages in this kind of act loses his position in addition to other legal sanctions that may be applied against the offender . After all Nigeria is not the only country on earth with govt. officials , in other climes all this noise about being a top govt. official is not heard yet the govts. of those places still discharge its duties to the public but here it is all noise no service . Empty idiots . <p> The hypocrisy of Nigerians . Her voice is probably the loudest at her church , yet she has no humility . Even if you are unaware of the rule of law , as a Christian you should have some humility . Even the atheists in the West have humility . They give to charity . They stop on the street to talk to the homeless and perhaps share a cigarette with them . And Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from so called believers . No wonder there are more atheists amongst us if this is an example of the " light of the world " . <p> This is a woman who calls herself a deaconess and she was coming from a church when her aides beat up the army officer . She could have stopped it if she wanted to . It 's obvious she deliberately asked the army officer to be beaten up . She has lost my respect irrespective of who she is , she should have be sentenced to jail at least for one week to feel the pain of the common man . She is obviously wicked . As a wife of the deputy governor , she is an ordinary person which the constitution sees her so , so she is not entitled to aides and siren blowing . I hope this serves as a deterrent to other . Oshiomhole should strip those who are not entitled to aides and siren blowing . They should live by examples . Odubu 's wife just exhibited her thuggery character . What a pity ! <p> Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no bi army general them beat up ...... this could have not been a easy finale . She was a private person and not entitled to use of heavy security guard and the use of siren . <p> This incredible . Stephen must have been a civilized soldier .

Deputy Governor 's wife and so what ? In a civilized country , this is enough to impeach the husband if he fails to resign . Do n't be surprised that it is the Tax payers money that will be used to pay for the fine . Oshiomole ... this is a test for you and I want to see how you will handle this . Where is Sahara Reporters ? I have read it today even yesterday and there was no mention of this case . There you are ! <p> This judgement to me is a triumph for democracy and the rule of law.The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decided to toe the path of honour by exploring his fundamental human rights in a court of law . I hope that executive lawlessness will be curtailed hereafter . <p> Justice is gradually entering Naija ! Last time it was Navy officers that were ordered 2 pay 100 million Naira as damages 2 a bloody civilian lady in Lagos after she was beaten up by them . Now it is a bloody civilian deputy governor 's wife who Carries siren when she is no govt official that is asked 2 pay damages 2 a bloody soldier ! It 's interesting sha ! <p> A very wise judgement indeed it is.Captain , please accept the 12million and allow this matter rest.I join other contributors in condemning the high rate of executive recklessness being exhibited by our politicians these days.I wonder the kind of home Mrs Odubu is even running when she does not realise that the rules of public ethics forbid her from encouraging certain actions.To our Comrade Governor , please ensure that tax payers money is not used to pay this judgement fine.We are watching very closely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to use the law against the civilians and the killing , fighting , beating , against the so called religion fanatics ( bokoharam , sarasuka ) and any other unlawful group or person . thank u captain you deserves a metal . <p> I am so glad to read this . If this corrupt and shameless officials will be subjected to this type of judgement , I think in a little way they will know that others have the right they have . I am ashamed this " disgrace to Christian " women is coming back from church . Does this show that she heard the word of God of that day ? Well sha she go show cloth and nothing else , after all it is well . Whatever happens is well . But Oga Soldier , do you see the feeling ?

Some people in Nigeria behave like animals when they are in power . Security operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no option of fine . The perpetrators of these crime are enemies of the masses . Siren for the Deputy governor 's wife ? This is misuse of power in Nigeria and the Federal Government should promulgate law banning misuse of siren by local Government chairmen , Governors and Deputy Governors wives.I did n't see Mama Awolowo using siren when chief Obafemi was the Prime Minister in Western Region . The current Governor in Edo State is a disciplinarian and should n't allow this imbecile in power to tarnish his good name . I do n't see the wife of Prime Minister in the United Kingdom going about in siren . The army should be punished in this way whenever they beat the civilians who misbehave to them . What is good for geese is good for gander . I Iike and admire the courage of this judge . I think it is time for those of us living abroad to start coming home because sanity is returning to the nation.Musa Olaiwon writes from the United Kingdom . <p> He should go for the N502m instead .

And while I 'll leave the commentary and analysis of these super-crucial issues to more experienced and knowledgeable voices , I would like to propose that there is now one more box to check when creating a new state : get on Google Maps . <p> As of this writing , South Sudan is not shown on Google Maps . If you query " South Sudan " over at Bing 's map service , embarrassingly the little orange push-pin lands somewhere in Niger , three countries away -- and Sudan is still as huge and singular as it ever was , cartographically speaking . Over the course of July , some have pointed this out . And recently , South Sudan has made its way onto Google Earth , maybe meaning that Google and Microsoft public mapping services are n't too far behind in showing Africa 's 54th state . Either way , many are wondering the reason for the hold-up . <p> The easiest answer to the lack of South Sudan on these maps is that Microsoft and Google are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation between Sudan and South Sudan is ever-changing and no official border has yet been established . A Google spokeswoman said in a recent post : " We are following the situation in South Sudan and ... we are n't able to specify when the update to these borders will be made , as the changes are often dependent on a variety of factors such as provider data availability and our system update schedule . " Fair enough . Data is needed . But here 's why it 's a good thing these two behemoths are waiting it out : <p> - In August 2009 , during a system update , Google India 's mapping service accidently showed parts and of India 's Arunachal Pradesh as Chinesecontrolled -- a region recognized by the world as India 's -- even labeling cities in the incorrect language . Google later apologized . <p> - February 2010 , Google fudges the border between Cambodia andThailand on a portion of land that has been hotly contested for decades , militarily since 2007 . Cambodia calls Google " professionally irresponsible . " Months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces conducting a military exercise along it 's border effectively invaded Costa Rica and took down that country 's flag and replaced it with its own . Why ? Because the Nicaraguan army officer was using Google Maps and the area in question was shown to belong to Nicaragua instead of Costa Rica . Costa Rica , lacking an army , wanted Google to announce the error and fix the map ; Nicaragua wanted Google to do nothing . Google blamed the U.S. State Department and their data . ( Also , Bing had the borders correct ) . <p> So these companies should by now understand that how they map the world has a political impact -- waiting for the correct info is a great sign given these pervious disputes . Especially as the accessibility to these services approaches the universal . <p> But , still , it 's hard to hear Google and Microsoft claim , once again , that it is all about the data . What 's happening in the north of South Sudan and the south of Sudan is not data . It 's divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new take on the Sudanese citizen , whoever s/he may be versus who they may become . Country boundaries are always in flux , always disagreed upon -- but also play a role in that nation 's sense of self , of community , of history . Like a flag , the shape of a state is recognized and meaningful , inspires pride and/or hate , and will be blindly defended . So , again , it 's good to see Google and Microsoft be patient with this latest change to the world map . <p> What is interesting , and maybe not-so-great is the need " we " ( speaking of the general , Western , Internet-using audience ) have for these private , data-mongering Internet companies to recognize these newly-minted countries . The UN has , the World Bank has -- why not Bing Maps ?

@@1799230 <h> Amnesty : Nigeria , EU to partner on Niger Delta <p> By Emma Amaize , Regional Editor , South South There was indication , last week , that some Nigerian government officials were beginning to think on collaborating with The Netherlands and other European countries , particularly in the area of amnesty programme for ex-militants . <p> Special Adviser to the President on Niger-Delta and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Amnesty , Kingsley Kuku , is spearheading the move in partnership with a Nigerian-based organization in The Netherlands , Hope for Niger-Delta Campaign , HNDC , founded by Comrade Sunny Ofehe and Ben Television , United Kingdom , as it affects the amnesty programme for ex-militants . <p> The Special Adviser is actually going on the European mission with his heads high , as the amnesty programme , which was initially taken with a pinch of salt by some persons , is positively impacting on the ex-militants . One of the biggest critics of the amnesty programme , leader of the Niger-Delta Peoples Volunteer Force , NDPVF , Alhaji Mujahid Dokubo-Asari , who made no pretence about his not accepting the Federal Government amnesty , admitted , last week , in Lagos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Presidency , were the best things to happen in the region in recent times . <p> The International headquarters of Royal Dutch Shell , Netherland . <p> He spoke against the backdrop of training and provision of jobs to 40 former militants after their training in Nigeria and South Africa , saying , he was enthralled by the willingness of ex-agitators to participate in the programme . His words , " I thank God , not because of the amnesty progamme but the desire of the youths to learn . " <p> Drumming int'l support <p> Head , Media and Communcation , Presidential Amnesty Committee Office , Abuja , Mr. Henry Ugbolue , told Saturday Vanguard , " The Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta , Hon. Kingsley Kuku will use the visit to secure more practical support from the international community for the Niger Delta Amnesty programme . Just like he did recently at Chatham House , London , Hon. Kuku will be urging EU countries , particularly the UK , to issue visas to ex-agitators to enable them travel to these countries where schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amnesty Office 's training partners " . <p> According to him , " The Amnesty Office emphasizes offshore training for programme 's beneficiaries because of the glaring lack of capacity in local training centres to speedily offer vocational training to the teeming population of Niger Delta ex-agitators ( 26,358 in all ) enrolled in the Amnesty Programme . Also , the United Nations ( UN ) expects all DDR programmes to take former combatants away from their natural habitats for transformation and reintegration purposes . The Amnesty Office has since inception been complying strictly with this UN code.Hon . Kuku remains exceedingly grateful to countries that have consistently issued visas to Amnesty Programme 's trainees , particularly the United States of America , Russia , South Africa , Malaysia , India , Poland and the United Arabs Emirate ( Dubai ) . He is urging EU countries especially the UK to give similar support to the Amnesty Programme " . <p> " In Netherlands , Hon.

In The Netherlands , the Presidential Adviser is expected to meet with senior Dutch government officials , representatives of civil society groups , corporate institutions , experts/consultants and a tour of strategic places of interest . <p> " An International Conference entitled , " Success and Challenges of Nigerian Government Amnesty Programme ; Role of International Community " will be held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in The Hague on Tuesday 20th September 2011 . In Brussels at the European Union Headquarters ' , the Presidential Adviser will meet with senior European Union officials at the EU Parliament , the EU Commission and the EU Council " , he added . <p> Ofehe stated , " The visit will be rounded up with an International Press Conference in The Hague where he is expected to address the Press Corp and take questions relating to the Amnesty program in the Niger Delta region " , adding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become inevitable in the face of the mounting challenges of the program on the Nigeria government and the need to involve the international community inter alia the European Union in supporting the program " . <p> What should occupy Kuku in Europe <p> With gas as the potential highest revenue earner in the world , what should be uppermost in the mind of the Special Adviser during his Europe trip should not just be how be improvement of amnesty programme for ex-militants alone , but the knowledge of how Nigeria can maximize its gas potentials . So far , the national gas master plan , has kick started with the approval for the establishment of gas central processing facilities in Delta , Rivers and Akwa-Ibom with some India and Saudi Arabia investors in Delta state recently for inspection of sites for the construction of 16 billion dollars petrochemical and fertilizer plants . <p> Borrowing a leaf <p> The story is told of Nigeria , which by 2011 , is still trying to jump-start its gas industry , but 38 years ago , 1963 to be precise , the Dutch had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.V . Nederlandse Gasunie , between Esso ( now ExxonMobil ) , Royal Dutch Shell and the Dutch government , which since 2005 is 100 per cent state owned . Since then , Holland 's destiny has been inextricably linked to the oil and gas industry . But Nigeria 's partnership with oil companies has always been skewed against the people . <p> Though , The Netherlands 's luck in the gas business , according to a research report , came at a price for the national economy , the revenues generated from the gas business were used by successive governments as current income , flooding public finances , overvaluing the national currency , and making exports in guilders far too expensive up until the emergence of the Euro in 2000 . This vicious circle came to be known as the " Dutch Disease " . Many national manufacturing industries struggled to export while public investments and resources were lost in bureaucracy . <p> Things have changed for the better in the past decade , says the Minister of Economic Affairs , Maria Van der Hoeven , with revenues being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years a considerable proportion of the oil and gas revenues have been used for investments to strengthen our economic position in the long term . Infrastructure projects were for a long time a top priority , but the last cabinet placed innovation and education as a national priority , " she explains . Van Mannekes is even more specific : " Today , about 5 per cent of the Dutch GDP comes from the revenues of the gas industry and the state profit share goes into funds partially for infrastructure development , roads , rails , and major R&amp;D activities " . That is the magic . <p> On the 50th anniversary of the Groningen gas field the Netherlands has a lot to celebrate . Their expertise in the oil and gas business combined with the country 's strategic location at the door to Europe 's main markets have made the Netherlands a leader in oil and chemical refinery , as well as cutting -- edge areas such as underground gas storage and seismic studies . <p> True to their merchant nature , the Dutch have been very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also their technology . <p> According to Mr. Hans de Boer , Managing Director of IRO , the Association of Dutch Suppliers in the Oil and Gas Industry , the Dutch industry is successfully exporting equipment as well as their skill in designing , constructing and operating offshore equipment for the wider natural gas value chain . " This is why IRO has a strong focus on exporting our members ' expertise to other markets worldwide . The upstream supply industry in the Netherlands had an estimated annual turnover of US$ 7 billion for 2009 , of which 70 per cent is export -- related " , he says . <p> All of this would not have been possible without the Port of Rotterdam . Known as the " Energy port of Europe " , it serves as a safe harbor for Western Europe 's refinery and maritime industries as they struggle to keep costs to a minimum . As Mr. Rob Nijst , Managing Director of VTTI , puts it , " Refineries in the hinterland are struggling with the increased competition from new refineries being built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , they have concentrated even more their regional activities around the Port of Rotterdam to gain in scale and international competitiveness " . <p> The Netherlands ' gas revolution since Groningen has not changed just the balance of its energy basket but also its relationship with its European neighbors . According to Mr. van de Leemput , the Managing Director of NAM ( the joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil , which explores the Groningen gas field and holds 54% of the Dutch gas assets ) , in only one generation almost 100% of the Dutch households have switched to gas for heating and 45 per cent of them use gas for electricity . The Netherlands also produces and exports 15 per cent of the gas consumed in the European Union . These are the kind of things Nigeria should strive for .

Why is it so ? <p> Decisions of Nigeria Examinations Committee have been communicated to the schools affected . But not on website . We are still looking at that -- whether to communicate the decisions to the candidates themselves or the schools . <p> Recently , the Lagos State Government introduced extra time coaching for students specifically on Mathematics and English to improve their importance . Has this impacted on the results just declared by WAEC ? <p> I do n't have the statistics for Lagos State as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it will take a long time after conduct of several other examinations to know , or to find out if previous performance is better than now . We have to compare , look at the variables , and other things to actually know if there is progress . If students are properly taught by their teachers , they will pass also very well . <p> Why is WAEC not coming out to clear the air about politicians allegedly accused of forging results and certificates presented for election purpose ? <p> WAEC is an examination body which conducts examination for students of secondary schools and also for private candidates . If at any time , a competent court of law asks WAEC to release or produce a result of anyone , we will do so . But if a journalist asks us , we wo n't do so . <p> We do n't put our results in public domain , not individual results for that matter . This is because we do n't want to be sued . But if requested by competent court , we will do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of someone seeking employment , we can send the result under confidential cover . But if for the investigation of a politician , we wo n't do so . <p> Some state governments enter their students on credit for WAEC examination , how many of such states are owing for non-payment of examination fees ? <p> If any state government says we conduct examination on credit for their students , we do so . No state government is owing us as at now . But as soon as the state pays up , the results will be released immediately . Now , no state government is owing WAEC . I do n't think we have problems with payment of examination fees by governments . <p> Is it not possible to have the statistics of the results state by state ? <p> The danger of doing so is the interpretation because it will look as if to say one state is disadvantaged educationally compared to another . But if a state request for statistics of its performance , WAEC can do so . <p> This will be like seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interested in the performance of any state , let the state endorse your request and we will do so . We do n't just release state statistics . <p> Why did you not give us the overall statistics of candidates who passed the required subjects necessary for tertiary admission as done in previous years ? <p> Why must we do something the same way every time ? Things must change , can not be conservative . But if you want so , I can tell you now . Candidates have not done badly in English Language and Mathematics this year . There use to be cut and paste kind of results -- some do it to get the required subjects . <p> However , a total of 472,960 candidates representing 30.99% obtained credits and above in five subjects including Mathematics and English Language .

But they are doing well . <p> For example , Hausa with 144,499 representing 51.86% , obtained credits and above . The performance is good , okay , but there is room for improvement . However , we observed that teachers are not there . But in the North , yes . In the South West , you have teachers in Yoruba . For Igbo in South East , the teachers are there , but not in Sough/South . There is need for retraining of teachers in local languages . <p> What is the cause of so many results still being processed ? <p> It is because of various errors and omissions committed during the online registration and the actual conduct of the examination .

For now , the off-taker is the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading ( NEBT ) Plc . NEBT is also known as the Bulk Trader . <p> " The Vesting Contract is executed between the Bulk Trader and the Power Distribution Companies . It is a mechanism that is used during the transition period in the electricity industry reform to ensure that the available power is shared equitably among the Distribution Companies . <p> " Recall that on August 16 , 2011 , President Goodluck Jonathan had approved the pioneer Board of the Bulk Trader and also named Mr. Rumundaka Wonodi , as its pioneer Chief Executive Officer .

MYTO 2 will stipulate the annual investment requirement , allowable operational expenditure , approved rate of return on equity and other allowable expenses for each distribution company " . <p> Nigeria will hit 5000 megawatts soon , El-Sudi <p> In a related development a member of the House Representatives representing Sardauna/Gashaka/Kurmi Federal Constituency of Taraba state , Hon.

As at now , the entire country is consuming less than 4000 mega watts . I am very much interested in the project because it will generate a lot of revenue for our people . It will open up that area . Therefore , I am not going to relent in my effort to ensure that the project comes to life . <p> " In the past so much money was pumped into the project but the resources went down the drain . This time , I can assure you that the Federal Government under President Goodluck Jonathan is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country and I believe the Mambilla project is not going to be business as usual or a political gimmick , " he said . <p> El-Sudi also assured proper monitoring of the project by the House of Representatives to ensure full implementation of the Hydro-electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission ( HYPADDEC ) Act .

The conflict between rebels and the formal government lasted more than four years , taking with it the lives of more than 150,000 and displacing hundreds of thousands more . Experts agree , however , that fighting would have likely ended sooner were it not for the Liberian government 's sale of illegally harvested timber . <p> Known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected areas can not only fuel corruption , arms sales , and human rights abuses in politically unstable countries , but it can also have devastating environmental and economic impacts .

Additionally , the World Bank estimates that $15 billion in revenues and forgone economic growth have been lost globally in the past decade alone . <p> The joint World Policy Institute-Demos paper , " Fairly Trading the World 's Timber , " highlights Liberia 's experience in its calls for domestic and international level reforms to curb illegal logging and promote sustainable forest management . The authors of the report -- Senior Fellow William Powers and Research Assistant Andrea Wong -- contend that the onus of responsibility does not lie solely with exporting countries , however . Major timber consumers , China in particular , need to do their part as well . <p> As the real-estate boom in China continues , the nation has increasingly turned to foreign imports to feed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international pressure , the country still has neither strong legislation that bans the import of illegal timber nor a procurement policy which encourages legal logging . As such , China is the primary recipient of illegal logs from countries including Madagascar and Gabon . <p> The country 's role as a major manufacturer of goods has also had significant implications in the struggle to combat illegal logging . Roughly 84 percent of Wal-Mart 's wood products , says the report , are manufactured in China . Worryingly , the lack of enforcement when it comes to the use of illegal timber means that this cheaper source of wood may often be the most affordable choice for manufacturers . One might also find illegal timber as a part of China 's rapidly growing furniture exports , which are often sent to Europe and the United States . As a result , Western consumers , whose governments are actively trying to curb the practice , can unknowingly support the blood timber trade during routine shopping trips . <p> Despite much rhetoric about sustainable forest management , China has yet to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country signed a Memoranda of Understanding to combat illegal logging with Indonesia in 2002 , the United States in 2008 , and the European Union in 2009 .

Evidently , they have acknowledged the impact illegal logging can have , yet their actions continually suggest an unwillingness to coordinate with other countries to put an end to this practice . <p> Timely reform , however , can ensure that illegal logging practices do not devolve further in the face of burgeoning demand from developed and developing countries . " Fairly Trading Timber " argues that China must adopt domestic legislation barring the import of illegal timber and negotiate bilateral trade agreements such as the Voluntary Partnership Agreement ( VPA ) with exporting countries .

@@1799240 <h> 08/21/11 <h> Okey Ndibe On Anambra : Truth Or Falsehood <p> As usual , he always breaks bad news to me . In the morning of Tuesday , the 16thof August he came into my office and sat down for minutes in silent , pensive melancholy . I knew that something has happened . Opening up , Johnson said : " Okey Ndibe and his mischief again ! He called Governor Obi a propagandist . Ca n't he appreciate the Governor 's good work ? " <p> I tried to lecture Johnson on why everybody will not agree on the same point . I recounted to him how Heraclitus said , Panta rei , all things change ; while Parmenides said Henta panta , all things are one and never change . We must always have our individual differences , but I quickly pointed out that it becomes dangerous when we do not tell ourselves the truth . Thus , Heraclitus and Parmenides views could have been borne out of what they genuinely thought to be the truth . I refrained from saying more , until I had read Okey 's piece to find out why he attributed propaganda in a 9derogatory sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative phenomenon . The modern Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in the Catholic Church is the son of a department in the Church that used to be called Propaganda Fide created in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV to spread Christianity and defend the Church against multiplicity of heresies . <p> Okey Ndibe 's latest in the series of his usual attacks on Governor Obi and Anambra State was entitled : Anambra and the Politics of Propaganda . But before I take him on , I will like to say that both the Government of Anambra State and Okey Ndibe are engaged in propaganga . While the Government tries to propagate what she has done that are verifiable ; Okey propagates his own views and that of his masters about the Government . In the midst of this , I will like to pose a question : Between Anambra State Government and Okey Ndibe , who is propagating truth or falsehood ? We shall come back to that , but first , let us see what Okey is up to . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing striking about his pieces against the governor is the fact that text messages were received one full day before their publication from an Anambra Senator 's camp , telling people , as the one I received on the 15th to " kindly buy the Sun newspaper of tomorrow as our man , Okey Ndibe takes on Saint Peter Obi . " Obviously , due to this inelegant strategy , we know where his articles are coming from these days . <p> In the article under reference , he celebrated what he felt was the humiliation of the Governor by workers during the rally that preceded their recent warning strike , now called off . In Okey 's words : " Last week , Governor Peter Obi of Anambra received unflattering epithets when he intruded on a rally where state workers were discussing his unpopular proposal on the implementation of the new minimum wage . " <p> Reading this , you could observe a sadistic streak in the words . It has the ring of a person who prays for the worst to befall the Governor . I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where objective writers would have started . For example , I can tell you that Okey does not know what other States offer their workers vis- ? -vis what Governor Peter Obi offers . He has become a clear case of a character seeking fault and seeing it even among the Saints . <p> In Oyo State the other day , workers were commending and thanking their Governor for pledging N13 , 000 relativity across board . In Anambra State Obi agrees to pay the minimum wage to level 1 to 7 workers and an increment of not less than N20 , 000 to other categories of workers . What this means is that a worker whose salary is N30 , 000 now will henceforth receive not less than N50 , 000 . Of course , the proposal was shielded from the workers because labour leaders were bent on declaring the strike even if for a day , to justify the money they collected from an Anambra Senator . <p> Okey can celebrate what he called " unflattering epithets " and " torrent of insults " against Obi , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even the Presidency has been spared the angry and often vitriolic outburst of workers . In the history of labour dispute , that has remained the trend . <p> One of the problems of Okey Ndibe is that he lacks the nobility of character , that living force that spurs one to act with understanding leniency . He is one track-minded and the danger with such a person is that with poor power of perception , his thoughts are often subject to passion . It is such a life that Spinoza described in his Classic Book iv Of Human Bondage . In spite of their " unflattering epithets " and " torrent of insults " , and sufficiently emancipated from human bondage , Obi made a broadcast to the State and thanked God for letting the workers listen to the voice of reason . He did not pay them back by unleashing his own " unflattering epithets " and " torrent of insults " as little mind do . He knows that those who are appointed to lead great institutions are like criminals condemned to torture , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crime and the former for their selflessness . <p> In the said broadcast , Obi said , and challenged anybody to prove to the contrary the proposition that he had done for workers more than what all past Governors of the State did for them in Anambra State . <p> Concerning those things he said he did , let him better speak in the first person : " Under the present Government , and for the first time since the State was created : Salaries of civil servants have been increased five times and have been paid consistently . Workers are sponsored to various workshops and trainings , both within and outside the country . Workers ' promotions are now released as and when due , unlike before 2006 when there were no promotions because promotion was said to be a privilege . Before this Administration , teachers stagnated on GL 15 ; it was my Government that lifted this barrier and they can now be promoted to GL 16 with all the privileges . Similarly , Primary School teachers who obtain university degrees can now be promoted alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being discriminated against , as was the case before my administration . Official vehicles/furniture allowances were provided for Permanent Secretaries and buses for all the Ministries and extra ministerial departments . 16-month arrears of the state share of pensions inherited from previous administrations to the tune of about 1 billion naira have been settled . The liquidation of arrears of Federal share of pensions owed State Pensioners has commenced . Arrears of gratuities inherited from previous administrations have been settled . Retirees now receive their gratuities soon after their retirement along with pensions as at when due . Arrears of Course allowances accumulated between 1997 and 2006 have been settled . 23-month arrears of Call Duty allowances owed Medical/Dental practitioners from January 2001 to March 2002 have been liquidated . <p> The first and second phases of the State Secretariat have been completed and put into use with necessary amenities . Salaries of State Counsels and those of Magistrates have been harmonized . Public Service Lecture Series aimed at improving the quality of public officers through strategic exposure to knowledge have been initiated and sustained . A 1,000 KVA generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3000 staff have been employed in the Civil Service by this Government . Group Personnel Accident Insurance Scheme abandoned since 2003 has been resuscitated with effect from 2008 and premium paid accordingly . The first beneficiaries of this scheme will be paid in two week 's time . " I suspect Okey is not aware of all these because he writes without intending to even understand the subject he often writes on . <p> Okey talked about the exploitation of priests by Gov . Obi and that those priests have deserted him for his failed leadership . He has said this many times to know that people will no longer believe his pettiness . I am in Anambra and can tell you that Obi takes everybody as one irrespective of positions.He would always say that he is the Governor of all Anambrarians , including Christians and non-Christians . What happens is that because he thinks so much about the future , the more enlightened a group is , the better they understand him . As an enlightened class , the priests ' love for him is deepening with every passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Gov . Peter Obi presenting a souvenir to the leader of ASA USA , Dr. Allison Anadi at the conclusion of their medical mission to Anambra State.Click For Enlarged Photo <p> The profundity of Aristiphus mind has never ceased to amaze me . He said humorously that just as , in a far northern city , words froze into ice as they were spoken , and were heard in the summer when they thawed , so the words spoken by Plato to his students in their youth were fully understood by them only in their old age . Likewise the deeds of Peter Obi , understood by the brightest and the most experienced now , will be understood by others in future . <p> If any priest does not understand him now , he will surely do so in future . However , let me use the last three encounters Obi had with priests -- Bishops at that -- to gauge what that class still feel about him . During the 50th priestly anniversary celebration of Bishop Emmanuel Otteh at the Basilica of the Most Holy Trinity , Onitsha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Governor both old and new Anambra State has had comparable only to Senator Jim Nwobodo . He is developing all sectors in the State , and for the first time no town in Anambra State is deprived of development one way or the other . I am proud of the Governor 's humility and life laced with integrity . I commend him highly , particularly his achievements in Education . Today Anambra schools are better than they were before and the Governor crowned it all with the return of schools to their original owners . " <p> In the words of The Apostolic Nuncio in the Central Africa Republic and the Republic of Chad , Archbishop Jude Okolo " God has used Governor Peter Obi to wipe away the tears of the people who have suffered the burden of incompetent and greedy rulers . He has inspired the youth unto righteousness and has become a symbol of reference . " Most Reverend Efobi , the Anglican Bishop of Ekwulobia passes his own verdict : ' Obi 's humility and integrity have provided a sound base to project the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is comparable to any State in the world . His calm , but tactical approach to issues of governance has engendered the stability prevalent in the State today . The accolades and awards he received in recent time had been attributed to his hard work and visionary approach to Statecraft . I enjoin him to continue to ensure justice and fairness in his administration as well as speak eloquently against evil . " <p> The Catholic Bishop of Nnewi , Most Reverend Hilary Odili Okeke was at it too . He said that " God has raised the Governor as a prophet , Leader and Rock in Nigeria to show the way of the Lord in many aspects of the society . He has remained God-fearing and has brought sterling qualities of simplicity , humility , contentment and wisdom to governance . He has built a legacy of outstanding contributions to the restoration and revamping of good governance through multi-sectoral development and has sustained efforts in promoting the value system of the society . " These comments were made in the last one month . So what exactly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike in his earlier pieces , when , drunk with the inexplicable passion of hate and with cavalier contempt for the truth , Okey attributed Obi 's political successes to luck instead of acknowledging his resilience , he now somewhat corrected that impression . We thank him for that , but he went ahead to extinguish that ray of light by saying that Obi thrives on propaganda , with nothing to show for it . He talked about Obi 's " hollow accomplishments " , " Awka as wretched as war-ravaged Mogadishu . " He touts Obi 's efforts to supply computers to schools , questioning if the schools are connected to the INTERNET , have power supply , among others . He described the Kenneth Dike Library as a huge joke . <p> But it is with difficulty that I reply to all this . In the bid to satisfy his fancy and in the ecstasy of hate as if permanently divorced from reality , he assumed what he can not prove . The fact that can easily be verified is that over 120 schools in Anambra have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over 120 schools have been supplied with 30 KVA generators each , with Government undertaking their maintenance for some years . I guess Okey wants us to forget everything about ICT until Nigeria has stable electricity . I have no problem provided he will convince the entire world to wait for us while we fix our energy problem . Today , over 100 schools in Anambra have brand new buses , the first since the Old East Central State . Today about 200 schools in Anambra are connected to the INTERNET via Galaxy Backbone at great cost . The State renews this facility yearly . For a more comprehensive picture of what the Governor has done in Anambra he could visit **27;31;TOOLONG if he so wishes . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above : Governor Peter Obi <p> As for the Professor Kenneth Dike Central Library , does Okey know it is the first library built in Anambra in over 40 years ? All these years that library development died in the State what did he do ? His only compliment is to say that president Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be commissioned . When he was saying that the place has nothing to do with an E- libarary , Anambra State was receiving a letter signed by the Director/Secretary of Universal Service Provision Fund , Mr. Funso Fayomi conveying the news that Anambra State has been selected as one of the beneficiaries of the Federal Government Digital E-library project under the connectivity for Development programme of the Universal Service provision Fund ( USPF ) . But Okey is immune to such news . <p> Okey described the new teaching hospital under construction , and one of the best legacies Obi will leave thus : " I drove past a huge structure under construction in Awka that the governor has named a teaching hospital . I am no medical expert , but I knew that the building was ill suited for a hospital . A hospital needs a lot of ventilation and light . The alleged teaching hospital in Awka has only its bigness going for it . The windows are horribly small . In fact -- judging by their poor ventilation -- it would be cruel to house prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a panel led by Professor Frank Akpuaka , who founded the College of medicine in other universities such as Abia State University . Other members includes Prof Rob Ofieli ( NAUTH ) , Prof. Okey Mbonu ( Chairman , West African College of Surgeon ) , Prof. Eddy Nwobodo ( Dean , faculty of Basic Medical Science , NAUTH ) , Prof. BC Jiburum ( provost , College of Medicine , Imo State University ) , Dr. Lawrence Ikeakor . The place is being built according to specifications they gave and it has just got the accreditation of National Universities Commission ( NUC ) . In trying to malign the Governor , or by plain sadism , Okey became an architect , a civil engineer and even a medical doctor , telling us what is wrong and right . Because he described the building upside down , I am left to believe that his sense of hate has overtaken his reason . Now I know while sadists can stand in front of Burj Khalifa in Dubai and proclaim it is not tall . Middleton had his reasons to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital is being built in Awka as well as other structures such as the completed two giant Secretariats , the Ekwueme Square , a network of asphalted roads , the ASUBEB building , the new courts , pedestrian crossing , and many more and yet Okey described Awka as Mogadishu . If he were correct , then Awka must have been a stone-age towns before Obi took over . We hope the person that comes after Obi will move it many notches up , but I challenge Okey to tell us what other past Governors did to the town . He probably would not want to know that even the compensation for land acquired by past Governments in Awka were paid by Obi . Awka is not developing and yet when Obi became Governor , it had only three hotels but now it has more than 30 . Bank branches have tripled . These are indices of development . <p> Okey 's pieces these days are interesting . Through him we realise what it means when we attribute the problem of Anambra to Anambra people . Today , Saharareporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anambra State . In deed we are our greatest problems . Gov . Obi is the Chairman of South-East Governors ' Forum and the Vice Chairman of the Governors ' Forum , but sadly , 99 per cent of those who want him to be removed are people from Anambra State . <p> If you have been following Okey 's write-ups , you will have noticed that he has not written a single article that is idea-based ; it must be this person or that person . He is so childishly personal and should be told that columns are meant for serious people that understand it is for them to generate ideas and propagate them . This is not a virtue but inherent weakness . If you interprete his character striat to an elder in the village , he will surely conclude na nwataa ga-akpa nsi . One of the problems we have in Anambra is the terrible condition of Federal roads , yet Okey will never use his column to bring such to the attention of the Government . Instead , he will bury himself in cynical pessimism denouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it concerns Gov . Obi . <p> Gov . Obi , in spite of Okey will remain one of the best things that have happened to Anambra State . He is at home here and he is delivering because long before he became the Governor , he had disciplined his body to hardship , his appetite to moderation and his thoughts to objectivity . He has been tested and he faced the tests with amazing stoicism . He lives an exemplary life , untouched with any scandal of gallantry or intrigue . <p> Today , development partners are falling over one another to identify with the successes of Anambra State . Obi has attracted a fortune 500 company that is presently investing about 120 million Dollars in the State . This may mean nothing to Okey . I know our people who are in the USA like him who everyday try to attract one investor or the other to the State . Okey has no time for such patriotism but only criticises blindly , which is actually the easiest thing anybody can do . Pettiness you may call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all these big grammer you people are speaking . My greatest concern here is let Governor Peter Obi use his position as the Governor and make AWKA look like a state capital that it has been created for . Other states that was created the same time with Anambra state have developed their capitals . When you enter their state capitals you will know you are in the state capitals but Awka has nothing to show all bacause it has been neglected . Politicians in Anambra state are self centered , much interested in personal agrandisement and self amorpropre. this is the disease that is killing us today . Shame to politicians in Anambra state . <p> Dear Mr Ndibe , Oyim akam agwa gi bu ajo oyi , mana agwaram gi bu ezi enyi , when a brother is dancing badly in public , it is obvious that those close to him or say Dear to him will be feeling shamefaced.Puta ba maka na ina agbazi egwu na adiro nma if you ask me . <p> I am not about to talk about your pleasure in hunting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your state , he needs it to stay focussed and if he can , t handle such heat , he would , nt have venture into politics in the first place.But you should do so without prejudice ... like , you have to cite other Governors in Nigeria that receive same allocation with ANAMBRA STATE that has out done or out performed him . So that it will be a balanced and powerful argument , because without that and with the state he met our Dear state , it is impossible for him to fight the shark , got rid of them and for even the eduacted to want his head on a spike just for political reasons.odighi nma cha cha .. <p> I read where you said that out of the roads he built , one which you plied sometime ago , has a pot hole on it , i laughed and said chei , ogini na afio ? , so even you do not know that for PDP and those goon in the state who hates the way Okwute has being running the state with decency , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work at mid-night , equipped with digger and shovel and wreck havoc , just to create and impression the type you have ? or that the contractor may be politically wicked and do harp harzard job or without intention , do a bad job on some of the roads . <p> It was provided that Governor Obi has done over 600 km of roads , what you should have done and become a good critic is to ask for the roads done , and i will provide them or another person can give you the names of the roads and location , so that you can verify them yourself unaided . Then you can ask NGIGE , OKWADIKE , MBADINUJU the roads they paved during thier own era and then compare them to see if Obi is lacking behind . <p> You visited **27;60;TOOLONG and see some of the projects Gov Obi started and finished , what you should , ve done was to visit the sites and see if they were build or if the pictures were faked.If they were build , then you bring those build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OBI .... Ok , not to make Ngige and Mbadinuju look like dwarfs in that context , you can match it with any Governor of your choice including Lagos state . I am talking about a Governor that has touched all the phase of life , all the ministry and not just roads , but everything .......... anyway that is not my main issue , my concern is your shot at EMEKA ANYAOKU ... <p> Maybe you feel tall and large trying to deduct Mr Emeka Anyaoku , the only SG of Common wealth from our side of the world , maybe forgetting that at your age , he has finished serving as SECRETARY GENERAL OF COMMON WEALTH . and that is a height many will not attend till the end of time , it simply means he worth his onus and know his left from his right , when he says that something is good , he speak from unbias perspective and i am sure that you are not good enough to start thinking for him , for you to take a punch at him is something i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gi na ya . Had that man being a yoroba or Awusa , i am sure you will always dobale for him and praise him for his attained position , but since he is igbo man from Anambra state and he said what he saw in Peter Obi , you felt like wrestling him to the canvass . <p> Dora Akunyili , what she archieved in NAFDAC , where she went to Lion , s cave and keep them in chains and fetters of iron , and as Minister of Information , where she wrestled with teh whirlwind and dare the cabals and oligarchy that has held this nation to ransom since independent , is something many people will not dream of even if they re-incarnate 3 times and for you also to take a swipe at her , just consider it as something un-igbo . <p> Then you , ve taking ANDY UBAH as your part time kernel , but have it in mind that Andy has never held any position in Government , so nobody can accuse him of embezzlement , unless we consider his 14 days at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad at him is also something that needs healing or deliverance.He served as a house boy and he made money same money that awusa and yoroba has being taking for donkey years in such position . <p> Many atimes you attack his education but i am sure he is more educated than ASIWAJU BOLAJI TINUBU OF ACN , who Gani Fawehinmi proved that he did not attend secondary school , as Tinubu said he did at KINGS COLLEDGE LAGOS , which Principal of the school during that period concured with Gani that Tinubu never attened the school not even for a day.He amassed wealth as Governor and Sinator and yet you have never gone after him , but Andy Ubah is always receiving hostility from you . <p> Can i talk about Patricia Etteh who served as Speaker house of Rep and her only qualification was that she worked at hair dressing salon and was good to OBJ on bedmatics or something like that ? . <p> Bankole has done what i know if it is an igbo man did half of it , you should , ve lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not igbo and not from Anambra state , he is untouchable . <p> Back to Andy Ubah , that guy was the only person in alaigbo who has the guts to visit Biafran War veterans and gave them2 million naira in cash , every other money pot or politician are too scared to even near the place , but this same ANDY has the balls to identify with them and so if he is not your choice of a SENATOR , maybe you challenge him on election and see how far ... i don , t care if he is qualified or not , but if Awusa can give us those that has NORMADIC CERTIFICATE as senators , then we can give them ANDY UBAH who is 10 times more qualified than them . <p> If Yoroba can give us OMISORE who was in prison for murder and he served as Sinator , then i see no reason why we should be mad about our own son , s going to Senate and being a Chairman of some committee . If OUK can be a governor and finish two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zobe ndi nke gi na ugboguru zobere anyu , do not join ndi na egbu dike na ogu ulo , maka when the invaders came calling , we then have no dike to defend the home front .

The bitterness was evident as residents of Ogale community , Eleme spoke to the Vanguard Metro , VM , recently about the impact of benzene on their water . <p> They said at the moment water under the soil in the area was contaminated with BTEX ( Benzene agent ) which is a major cause of cancer in humans . And this has made the water unfit for consumption . They traced this sad situation to oil spill from the operations of the Anglo-Dutch oil giant . <p> An oil-contaminated stream in the area <p> " Our water has been polluted by benzene .

Adding , also that the area has the largest manifold in West Africa . <p> Meantime , the Rivers State government has swung into action to save residents of Ogale from further consumption of the cancerous water underneath its soil .

The state government , according to the Commissioner , had concluded plans to rehabilitate an existing water station at Eleme , a nearby community to take care of the water needs of the community . <p> She assured that when work on the water station was completed the people would have steady access to safe drinking water .

" I want to say on a very light note that the points are inadequate , government should make it a minimum of 18 points .

As a young man desperately dreaming to have a better life , he decided to go to Europe for greener pastures through any available means without any inclination of what such journey holds in store for him . <p> The facilitators made him to believe that , through the desert , he and his seven other colleagues would make the trip to Europe in five days . But the journey lasted 91 days and , apart from Osita , no one seems to know the whereabouts of the seven others till date . <p> According to Osita , the emotional trauma he experienced when he lost his car business to debtors and visa racketeers were nothing to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert migration link-man , Osita paid N250 , 000 to a visa racketeer for two years London visa but the visa was discovered to be fake by security agents at the Lagos airport . <p> Osita was still in the heat of the crisis when a friend told him that his brother in Spain could help him get a job in Europe since he was determined to leave the country . He was able to recover some of the money he paid to the visa agent and , with the help of his family members , he got a little above N200,000 for the journey . <p> Osita said from the Kano connecting house , they travelled all through the deserts of Zindern , Agadez , Douruku in Niger Republic and Tegery to Gatron and finally to Tehrinmata in Libya . <p> Throughout the journey , he said , scores of people were dropping dead from the ramshackle truck in which they were travelling in . <p> When they eventually ran out of water , they were forced to beg for urine from women they met and that of camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stranded in the desert because " once you get to Kano , you are stripped off all your money .

It was there I got the clue that it was pure business . There is no job anywhere . " <p> Osita , who explained that the cartel has a very strong network along the desert routes , said that at each connecting border , there is a connecting house and inside it not less than 2,000 Nigerians had been left stranded . Asked to hazard a guess on the number of Nigerians in all the connecting houses , he said they may not be less than 50,000 excluding the numbers that die on daily basis . <p> Osita , claiming to have become inquisitive at one of the connecting houses at Agadez , a transit route , said many stranded Nigerians whom he spoke to told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We spent seven days in Agadez and many Nigerians stranded there had lost hopes of returning home .

" <p> On how he was able to keep his money , he said : " It was an experience I can never forget . I inserted my money into my anus and passed it out through faeces anytime I needed it " . <p> He said the worst happened when the truck conveying them from Douruku to Libya got spoilt in the desert . According to him , they trekked day and night for four days before they got to a place called Tegery where he said 250 Nigerians had died due to lack of water . <p> " While on our way from Tegery to Gatron , we were attacked .

" We drank our urine and that of a camel for survival while in the desert on our way to a non-existing Europe . Many of us who survived it were forced to do all kinds of menial jobs for survival " . <p> Osita called on the Federal Government to check desert migration by young Nigerians even as he urged government to urgently commence the rehabilitation of the 1,750 returnees from Libya . <p> He hinted that the UK government was in the process of bringing back about 16,000 illegal Nigerian immigrants back to the country . 
@@1800234 <h> 2015 disintegration prediction wo n't happen -- Jonathan <p> President Goodluck Jonathan , last Tuesday , fielded questions from a team of senior journalists in a televised chat . Excerpts : <p> Would you say that the ship of state is on course ? That is correct . But let me use this opportunity to thank Nigerians again for the way they conducted themselves during the elections . You will agree with me and indeed most Nigerians and other international observers that people were quite happy with our elections . Nigerians participated in all the villages , people were proud that they had voter 's cards that meant something to them , that they could use it to change the course of history . I can assure you and all Nigerians that the ship of state is on course . <p> You must be aware of the prediction on the CIA website which states that Nigeria will disintegrate before the year 2015 . This is 2011 and some analysts have even gone further to say President Jonathan will be the last President of Nigeria as presently constituted . What is your take on this ? <p> I do n't agree with that assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time people will come up with such idea . You must have read the book , " This House Has Fallen " . <p> Nigeria may have challenges , just like other countries . I remember in 1966 when I was in primary four , when we had the first challenge in the Niger Delta , when the late Isaac Adaka Boro declared secession and the Niger Delta Republic . <p> In 1967 , we had the Biafran war . Ojukwu declared the secession of the Biafra Republic . We had a civil war , but we are back together . So these are major issues that affected the country . It is not just because people are detonating bombs here or probably because there is some level of agitation in the Niger Delta which , of course , is almost under control , then we begin to predict that we would disintegrate . <p> A country that will disintegrate you can study the psyche of the people . During the civil war , the south-easterners were the bulk of the members of the proposed new country called Biafra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to the South-west , go to the North . <p> You 'd see that northerners have investments even in my village ; as small as my village is , Nigerians from the North , East and West have bought lands . People who want to disintegrate will begin to shift back into their own geo-political zones . <p> The behaviour of Nigerians does not really show that we are going to disintegrate . Look at us- because of ethnic diversities we are beginning to predict that we would disintegrate -- but we will not disintegrate . I will not preside over a country that will disintegrate . I assure you that we will remain one united nation . <p> There is this general fear and insecurity in the land : there are Boko Haram bombings , kidnapping and robbery . We know crime can not be totally wiped out . But when will Nigeria have a seemingly peaceful situation where people can go about their duties without being scared of being bombed , kidnapped or robbed ? <p> The issue of robbery in Nigeria is a matter of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war when light arms and small weapons got into the hands of non-state actors . We experienced our first cases of armed robbery and of course the situation continued to deteriorate till today . The new dimension now is the issue of using improvised explosive devices in acts of terrorism . We are changing our own security architecture because , before this time , the security approach was more of confrontation . <p> All the security agencies are trained , yes they have intelligence arms but they are more involved in confronting and intimidating but the level of sophistication we have now by criminals is such that you must change the security architecture . We know we have challenges but I can assure all Nigerians that this will be brought under control . Only last week we had the Council of State meeting . <p> The main thing we discussed for the whole day was security . That was the longest Council of State meeting that we have had and everybody was interested , both the governors and those of us at the centre , and we resolved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . <p> The UN office bombing incident ; it was not only Nigerians that died , it affected the whole world , that is why the UN Deputy Secretary General had to come down to Nigeria immediately so we can have that network . The security services in Nigeria : the police , SSS and the army are doing a lot of work . Certain things appear slow , but the security operators are on top of the situation . They know exactly what they are doing because they brief me on a daily basis . We are worried about the security challenges in the country , because when you have such major challenges you are not encouraging investors to come in and we are trying to develop our economic environment to attract foreign investors so we must take security seriously . I can assure you that it will continue to decrease . It will no longer increase until we get to a level when Nigerians can move freely and will no longer fear that , at the next moment , a bomb is going to explode somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plateau is in the centre of Nigeria unlike Borno or Katsina that are situated in border towns and it has been on for more than eleven years now . Many people think that there should be more collaboration between the states and the Federal Government to curb these crises . Are you satisfied with the level of cooperation between the states and the Federal Government over the issue ? <p> We are co-operating . We have an elected governor and a House of Assembly in Plateau State . The issue in the state is over eleven years old . These are community issues , mainly economic issues . Probably , religion may come in to some extent . But religion is almost like the wind that spreads the fire . It is not the cause of the fire . <p> You 'd realize that when President Obasanjo was here , he even declared a state of emergency in the state but it never stopped the problem . So you can really see that the methods we are using may not solve the problems because it is a human problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of discussions before we got close to the elections and we will continue with that level of discussion . <p> Nobody wants to believe they are wrong or that both sides are wrong . Nobody has the power to kill whether you are a Christian or a Muslim , you can not kill , so both parties are wrong and we are dialoguing with them and we would go out fully to enforce the law . <p> One of the major challenges of Nigeria is power generation and distribution . A lot of people are wondering , you talk of all sorts of mega watts , when will Nigerians have uninterrupted power supply for seven days a week ? <p> That is why I am not going to talk about mega watts . But I can assure you and indeed all Nigerians that we are working day and night to improve the power sector . We launched the power sector roadmap . Launching the programme does not bring power immediately but you must follow up with actions . <p> A lot of projects are going on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NIPP projects-what happened is that when these contracts for the NIPP were awarded , for the turbines to generate power , turbines need gas -- in some of the places where the turbines were located , the gas infrastructure was quite far away ; sometimes over 200 kilometres away or more . So when the turbines were procured , the contracts for the supply of gas to the turbines were not done . <p> That is why even now we still have some of the turbines in the wharf . We are now making sure that all the turbines are installed , contracts for gas to the turbines have been awarded , then of course you also have to install machines that will scrub the gas because if the wet gas enters the turbines , it creates problems . At the same time when you generate power , you must also evacuate the power . <p> As at the time the contracts were awarded some of the rights of way had not been acquired . To acquire right of way is extremely difficult even though we have the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been developed . I can assure you that we will continue to improve on the generation , we will continue to improve on the distribution . Our target , like we have said , is that government must do away with generation , government must do away with distribution . We will partner with the private sector to handle transmission . We have not reached there yet but by the time we get there , the private sector involvement will be enhanced . <p> Talking about the issue of selling of power , another issue of concern is the incessant increase in tariff . People felt wo n't it be better if the government finishes the reform in the power sector before it charges the appropriate tariff other increase ? <p> Even last July , there was an increase in tariff yet there was no improvement in power supply . We are improving in power supply now , the increase in tariff ? <p> If you look at the tariff we charge on power in Nigeria compared to other nations , Nigeria is still extremely low . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power then definitely you must charge a tariff that is not too high or too low . That is why there are regulators . We have the electricity regulatory commission to regulate it . You can not just wake up and charge anything . They are to regulate . Any tariff that is being charged now is still very low compared to the continental average in Africa . I am not talking about outside Africa . <p> The man who earns N18,000 a month may not agree with you on that . <p> The man who earns 18,000 will be happy if you double the tariff and give him 24 hours of light . Because , Nigerians spend so much on power and lose so much because of our power problem . <p> Nigeria is infamous for corruption and it is also infamous for bureaucratic red tapes which at the end of the day doubles the cost of doing business . We have lost big companies to neighbouring countries . What are you doing to ensure that foreign direct investment actually grows in Nigeria and that investors are confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down significantly ? <p> I agree with you . The cost of doing business is very high and beside the cost , quite a number of things are not clear to some people and that is one of the things that the economic management team is looking at . We agree that we must bring the cost of doing business down . We must make sure that we have the best global practice . The Economic Management Team is made up of people in government , the private sector , and also governors . The thing is to look at the whole issue of our economy , the whole issue of investments , the whole issue of trade and what we must do as a nation to make sure that we encourage the private sector . It is for government to create an enabling environment for the private sector to build the economy of any nation and that is what we are doing . <p> Many people are touchy about the price of cement . Lately you held a meeting with stakeholders and they agreed to bring down the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement was 1,350 naira , now it is back to about 2,000 naira . When will it be back to a manageable level and sustained so that people can build cheaper houses ? <p> The issue of cement is an issue I 'd relate to an issue like tumor or a boil on the body of a child . If you want to excise the tumor or the boil to bring out the pores so that the boy will feel better , the child will resist the scalpel , the surgical blade of the surgeon but the child needs that pain . The government then felt that what is in cement ? <p> The imported component of cement is very low . We have enough raw materials to produce more than enough cement that we need in this country but because our infrastructure is weak in terms of roads , power , cement manufacturing outside Nigeria is cheaper , so you can import cement very cheaply and bring it into the country . <p> Yes , Nigerians are buying cheaper cement but there is no job for the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local production of cement , we must restrict the importation of cement to encourage our companies to produce and allow the companies that are producing cement to import the difference in terms of the proportion . So , there is this fear of monopoly because those who are manufacturing the cement are those who are importing . So the assumption is that they can create artificial scarcity so that they will make more money . <p> It is a problem that for the past six years or more since the Obasanjo administration came up with that policy , we have been managing . But the good news , from the information before me , is that by the first quarter of next year , we would be producing enough cement and , as we progress into the middle , up to the last quarter of 2012 , we would be talking about exporting cement . Last week , I sent for the minister of transport , to do something about our train network because the present design does not include the cement factories and I said that cement is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost will still be prohibitive . <p> A lot of Nigerians believe that there is too much grammar on this economic issue .

Recently , analysts are saying maybe we should not be doing it the same way it has been done before because it has not yielded anything . With your new agenda , are there new strategies and time lines for employment generation for the youths which in a way is the only way the common man will know that there is improvement ? . <p> I agree with you . I always tell people that I do n't like talking about growth indices .

@@1800236 <h> Shell 's Messy Assets Sale <p> Messrs Emeka Offor and Les Blair , respectively , chairman and CEO of Elcrest Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited , must be terribly anxious men . Elcrest is a special purpose vehicle formed as a joint venture between Eland Oil &amp; Gas Limited and Starcrest Nigeria Energy Limited to bid for the working interests held by Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited , Total E&amp;P Nigeria Limited , and Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited in Operating Mining Lease ( OML ) 40 . <p> The interests in OML 40 are currently held as follows : Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation -- 55 percent ; Shell -- 30 percent ; Total -- 10 percent ; and Agip -- 5 percent . The three international oil companies jointly offered their working interests totalling 45 percent in the block under a tender process that started a year ago . <p> OML 40 has proven and probable reserves ( 2P ) of 225.7 million barrels of oil equivalent and historically produced at less than 5,000 barrels per day before it was capped . It , however , has the potential to produce 10,000 barrels per day , after the revamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before their anxiety set in , both gentlemen were elated almost six months ago . Elcrest had emerged successful from the tender that featured several other bidders for OML 40 . Unconfirmed media reports stated that Elcrest was selected by Shell and its partners to execute a Purchase Sale Agreement ( PSA ) and an Agreement for Assignment ( AFA ) after it had paid $154 million to acquire their interests in the block . <p> Following the selection by Shell , which was responsible for the tender , Shell - also the operator of the block - in compliance with Clause 19 First Schedule of the Petroleum Act and Clause 19.1.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement for OML 40 , wrote to the Minister of Petroleum Resources , Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke and the group managing director of NNPC , Mr. Austen Oniwon , respectively , seeking their consent to assign the 45 percent to Elcrest . Without their consent , Elcrest has no deal . It also stands the risk of forfeiting 10 percent of the bid price for OML 40 which was escrowed with J.P . Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the letter written to NNPC , other than seeking for the corporation 's consent to assign 45 percent to Elcrest , it requested NNPC to waive its preemptive rights to the participating interest under Clause 19.4 of the JOA . Seeing that NNPC could not match the price offered by Elcrest , it waived its preemptive rights to take over the participating interest held by the IOCs . Obtaining the consent of the minister and NNPC will also trigger the execution of new JOA for Block 40 , in which NNPC shall retain 55 percent and Elcrest 45 percent . <p> But Elcrest wants more than just the acquisition of 45 percent in the said block . The company wants operatorship of the oil block to be transferred to Elcrest . To achieve this , NNPC will have to waive it rights to take over operatorship in the block , as Clause 2.6.2 in the JOA states , " In the event that the operator ( in this case , Shell ) resigns , unless the parties agree to appoint a third party as operator , the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over the operatorship upon the effective date of the operator 's resignation or any earlier date as may be mutually agreed by the operator and non-operators . " <p> NNPC , however , has made it clear both in newspaper adverts and verbally to Shell and the bidders that took part in the tender that it shall not transfer its rights to operate the oil block . NNPC has embarked on an aggressive acquisition programme to grow its oil and gas reserves and production through its exploration and production subsidiary Nigerian Petroleum Development Company . NNPC 's target is to increase NPDC 's reserves and production to over 1.5 billion barrels and 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2015 . <p> The snag with NNPC/NPDC 's insistence on taking over the operatorship of OML 40 is that Elcrest 's financing banks will not permit the company to sign a JOA which gives operatorship to NPDC . Owing to its track record , Elcrest and its banks have no confidence in NPDC to operate the block efficiently and in a cost-effective manner . Elcrest is also contending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in OML 40 includes a premium for the company being made operator of the block . Without operatorship , Elcrest will be forced to cancel the transaction , forfeit $15.4 million , and OML 40 will revert to status quo , with Shell as operator . <p> Elcrest is therefore torn between the devil and the deep blue sea . It has very little time to decide on its next course of action , as the execution of the PSA that Elcrest signed with Shell , Total and Agip , triggered a 180-day period during which time the government approval to the transaction must be obtained . That 180-day period shall expire on September 30 , 2011 , hence the sleepless nights being experienced by Offor and Blair at the moment . <p> Offor , Blair and Elcrest 's story is not unique to them alone . It cuts across the entire transaction chain for the assets sale started by Shell a year ago for OMLs 30 , 34 , 40 and 42 . All the bidders that emerged through that process , having escrowed 10 percent of the bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of 90 percent , and signed PSAs and AFAs , can not get consent from the minister and NNPC to close their deals . <p> Their problem can be traced to a number of factors . The first was the precedent set by Seplat Petroleum Development Company , which last year acquired the working interests held by Shell , Total and Agip in OMLs 4 , 38 and 41 . In that deal , not only did NNPC waive its preemptive rights in the blocks , it also transferred operatorship to Seplat . <p> After the acquisition of the three blocks and execution of the JOA with NNPC , the state oil company elected to assign its 55 percent to NPDC , which in turn entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Septa Energy Nigeria Limited to fund NPDC 's interest share of petroleum operation costs and provide technical expertise to the NNPC subsidiary . Septa paid $54 million as entry fee for participation in the development of the 2P reserves in Blocks 4 , 38 and 41 . Operatorship of the blocks , however , was retained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the media . <p> The second reason the current assets sale by Shell is threatened , arose from the multinational 's handling of the transactions . Shell , from all indications , went out of its way to identify , encouraged and urged bidders which it believed had the capacity to raise their bids and the political clout to convince the powers that be in government into influencing NNPC to waive its right to operatorship . In so doing , it gave them false hopes that they could get operatorship , which it lacked the power to cede . <p> In fact , one bidder , Vertex , accused Shell of notifying the company of its selection as the preferred bidder for OML 40 , only for Shell to turn around to encourage Elcrest to increase its offer for the same block , in order to give the latter the edge over Vertex . Obviously , Shell was banking on Emeka Offor leveraging on his clout within the government to swing the operatorship Elcrest 's way . <p> Another factor stemmed from the exorbitant amounts offered for some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 -- the most prolific of all the blocks - were staggeringly high . Conoil was believed to have offered $1.29 billion ; Oando , in conjunction with Petrofac , submitted a revised conditional bid for $1 billion ; while African Petroleum and Midwestern Energy offered to pay $850 million for the block . It was not surprising that the deal unravelled when Dr. Mike Adenuga , the chairman of Conoil , elected to withdraw from the bid process , especially after repeated attempts to get the government to transfer operatorship in OML 30 to his company failed . Adenuga 's Conoil , today , could potentially lose the $129 million that was escrowed several months ago . <p> A fourth reason revolved around the excuse given by the petroleum minister for the non-transferability of operatorship . In an interview in June , Alison-Madueke identified Blocks 30 and 34 as too strategic to be handed over to " certain " oil companies because of the gas reserves they hold , and that the gas is needed as fuel for the country 's power programme . Both blocks hold an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utorogu gas processing facility operated by Shell . The minister also argued that the JOAs do not allow the transfer of operatorship of the blocks to a third party assignee . <p> The minister 's argument , nonetheless , contradicts the position of the ministry and NNPC which ceded operatorship to Seplat in OMLs 4 , 38 and 41 , and assigned the funding rights for the same blocks to Septa Energy . It further turns the federal government 's local content policy on its head , because by withholding consent or allowing the companies that won the blocks to cancel the deals and forfeit their deposits , the purpose of encouraging indigenous participation in the oil and gas sector would have been defeated . Curiously , NPDC , which lacks the funding capacity and expertise to operate the blocks , may have to enter into another strategic alliance with other parties to finance the blocks and provide the technical expertise . <p> Today , neither Shell nor the bidders have been able to move forward with the deals . The Neconde Consortium comprising the Polish firm Kulczyk Oil Ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which executed a PSA for Block 42 , faces the same dilemma as Elcrest . It has till next month to execute a JOA with NNPC/NPDC which accords operatorship to NPDC . <p> Another bidder , ND Western , for OML 34 , is only slightly better off because it has till January to decide whether to close the deal or abandon it . Its preference also is to get operatorship , but if consent is not obtained , it shall lose its 10 percent deposit . ND Western is wholly owned by an indigenous company , Niger Delta Petroleum Resources Limited and Petrolin Group of Switzerland . <p> Obviously , the ministry , NNPC , Shell and the bidders , have to find some middle of the road solution that all the parties are comfortable with . The deposits made by each of the winning bidders and those that lost out have been domiciled in escrow for several months . <p> Such deposits might have been funded by banks on which interest is accruing and possibly being paid by the bidders . Even where the deposits were funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds domiciled without a resolution in sight . <p> Shell 's management of the tender has certainly left a lot to be desired . But the time for recrimination can come later . The most important thing is to either salvage what 's left of the messy transactions , where possible , or have them cancelled with the minimum losses to the bidders . <p> NNPC is not entirely blameless either . By setting a precedent with Seplat , it also gave the bidders false hopes that they will be appointed operators , only for it to change its mind mid-stream . It should have stuck to the original terms of the JOA which does not permit the transfer of operatorship to a third party assignee . <p> Hopefully , this whole mess will serve as a lesson to Shell and NNPC on how to stick to laid down rules and agreements in the future . <p> Please leave your comment below .

I held leadership positions in many of my community organizations . In my school settings I participated in several campus initiatives from anti-apartheid movements to feminist cycles , social justice organizations and pan African solidarities . <p> I had my share of brushes with the military and university authorities who thought we were not doing what we were supposed to do as students and teachers . Secondly , my humble background tells me that solidarity with the poor , discriminated , oppressed , disenfranchised and the voice less is a noble profession .

Moghalu , who made these revelations , also disclosed that the apex bank had fixed the end of 2012 as the deadline for the apex bank 's implementation of Basel 11 in the country as part of efforts to mitigate against any shock in the system . A CBN report as at June 2010 had shown that the average CAR of the banks was below the stipulated minimum of 10 per cent . CAR is the percentage ratio of a bank 's capital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of its financial strength and stability . <p> The ratio is used to protect depositors and promote the stability and efficiency of financial systems globally . In Nigeria , the banking industry 's stipulated minimum CAR is 10 per cent . <p> The last set of rescued banks -- Union Bank of Nigeria Plc , Oceanic Bank Plc , Intercontinental Bank Plc , FinBank Plc and Equitorial Trust Bank Limited , all were successful recapitalised at the end of last month . <p> On the other hand , the proposed Basel 11 is a comprehensive international set of regulations aimed at enhancing the risk management of banks . It has three pillars which focuses on -minimum capital requirement ; supervisory processes and market discipline which has to do with disclosure among others . <p> Moghalu maintained that the proposed introduction of Basel 11 , was one of the major elements of the first pillar of the ongoing reform in the industry . <p> He explained : " We have taken a number of steps to make sure that the introduction of Basel 11 is achieved . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps that we have taken . But we have to do some internal work first .

That committee has a number of subsidiaries committees and a working group who have been working hard to identify the legislation and operational guidelines and to look at the various processes that needs to be put in place . <p> " In march 2011 , the CBN took some major steps in procuring support through consulting firms that would help was drive the work on Basel 11 going forward . We advertised in March , in line with the procurement Act for consultants to work with us on Basel 11 and Basel 111 . We have received a number of applications after the advertisement in March and the evaluation team which comprises of CBN and NDIC have reviewed the application that we have received and a decision would be made very shortly on the expert group that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that with the support of the expert that we are bringing to conduct an initial baseline survey of the Nigerian banking system in order to ascertain the level of implementation of Basel 11 .

He also averred that they would address strength of internal control and the compliance function . <p> " We expect that by the end of 2012 , all the banks , especially banks with national and international authorisation of a commercial banking licence are compliance with Basel 11 .

Basel III , which is a response to the recent global financial crisis and will be implemented between 2013 and 2019 , raises the level , quality and consistency of bank capital , " he explained further . <p> He added : " Basically , Basel III requires important global banks to hold core Tier I capital of a minimum of 7 per cent plus an additional buffer of 2.5 per cent of core tier one capital in order to counter macro shocks from economic cycles . It is important to note that some Nigerian banks are already operating above the capital thresholds established by Basel III , but there needs to be a more uniform approach to bank capital and risk management , especially by banks with national and international authorisations .

@@1801234 <h> National Assembly is Encouraging Corruption , Says Auditor-General <p> The growing cases of sleaze and fiscal indiscipline in the country have been blamed on the nonchalance and failure of the National Assembly to act on the annual reports from the nation 's Auditor General . This was part of the report which the Auditor General released over the weekend on the financial state of government agencies , institutions and bodies . <p> Describing it as negligence of duty , the report argued that the failure of the National Assembly to act accordingly had encouraged other agencies and departments to either become nonchalant about the auditor 's report , or altogether defiant about financial regulations . <p> This , it stated , had made many government agencies to be reluctant in adhering to prescribed accounting standards , while several of them had refused to submit annual reports of their income and expenditure to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation . <p> In the report presented to the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives , the Auditor General of the Federation , Mr. Samuel Tyonongu Ukura , stressed that the failure of the National Assembly to perform this constitutional role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curb graft and mismanagement of public funds in Nigeria . <p> The audit reports have always been submitted to the National Assembly at the end of every fiscal year since 1999 . <p> The report contains the audited accounts of all government agencies , statutory corporations and institutions which the constitution empowers the National Assembly to scrutinise with a view to curbing waste of public funds and checking corruption . <p> Ukura said the AGF 's report formed an integral part of the annual audit report . <p> Also , the auditor general said several top government agencies like the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) , Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) had , over the years , consistently failed to submit their annual reports for auditing . <p> According to the report , public institutions such as the EFCC and National Salaries Incomes and Wages Commission have never submitted annual reports of their finances since inception . <p> It also stated that others including the CBN and NNPC had not submitted their annual financial reports for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasing cases of fraud and graft in government agencies and institutions on the failure of the National Assembly in either taking appropriate actions on the annual recommendations of the auditor general on public institutions , or even adhering to fiscal regulations by the legislature itself . <p> At the unveiling of the report at a crucial meeting of the House Committee , Ukura and Accountant General of the Federation , Mr. Joseph Ogunniyi Otunla , the Chairman of the House Committee , Hon. Solomon Adeola , said the parliament could not take the whole blame as the Office of the Auditor General had not reminded it on the need to consider the audit report . <p> Adeola said that the last official correspondence from the Auditor General 's Office to the National Assembly on the vexed issue was in 2007 . <p> He also expressed reservations on the failure of the accountant general to enforce compliance with the law by sanctioning government agencies that fail to file annual financial reports and subject themselves to audit . <p> The lawmaker also expressed concerns that both the accountant general and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenue generating and collecting agencies in the country . <p> According to the Public Accounts Committee , the national treasury was losing billions of naira due to leakages and or the failure of revenue generating agencies to remit what they collect to the Federation Account . <p> The committee dismissed the claims by the auditor general that the existing laws had not made clear provisions for the imposition of sanctions on erring agencies . <p> " The auditor general has no excuse for failing to properly audit the accounts of ministries and agencies of government because the constitution has sufficiently empowered him to carry out such responsibilities . If you carry out your duties very well , we may not even have needed to establish all these anti-graft agencies , " Adeola said . <p> The committee said that the issue of revenue generation and remittances must be taken very seriously because of the need to make funds available to government treasury for development purposes particularly in the build up to the 2012 budget being prepared . <p> It therefore requested the accountant general to work closely with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tracked to the last kobo to prevent them from ending up in private pockets . <h> Comments ( 17 ) <p> Read other user 's comments about this page .

In fact , it is officially the ' auditor-general of the FEDERATION " ( as in all three tiers of the federation ) , rather than of the federal govt ( see Section 85 of the constitution ) . Accordingly , it is a position that can be filled by any competent person ( with the confirmation of the Senate ) , rather than simply the OLDEST ( or most senior ) auditor in the federal civil service . <p> God knows why these pack of fools are ruling NIGERIA , by the way what and where are they taken the ill gotten wealth/money to when they do die , when we were born , we came with nothing , and when these rouges do die they may have to take all what they have stolen to the hell , they should know that hell is heal , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true , but with what the governors arrested is facing this demonstrate what kind of judgements many of the evil doers will face when they do die , and God is waiting for them , but if they can return the stolen money and repent , God is a merciful GOD.by the way they may be first persons to take some their properties with them , we shall all wait and see . <p> @ aidonenyi ; your comments lack any analytical inputs that should purge them of uniformed sentiment .

This is the sunami or earth quake that will devour these thieves . The NNPC should be made to address this as amatter of extreme urgency or we are permanently doomed .

They should tell Nigerians who are the signatories and accounting officers of these foriegn accounts and who they report to . The long and the short of it is Nigeria has been skinned to the bones by these unpatrotic Nigerians and their foriegn colloborators . I bet you no person or body can call these bad Nigerians to order . One day and one day The Almighty God will expose these bad people and very soon .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do its job is not a fair statement for an Officer of your status . Dismissing the fact that the existing laws have not make clear provisions for punishment of erring agencies appears to be an ignorant statement . Simply , what would the law do to EFCC , NNPC and others that have failed to render accounts to the Auditor-Gen ? You also stated that the constitution has given enough powers to the Auditor-Gen to carry out its constitutional role . Prior to this time , we have always heard that the auditor-Gen operates from a residential building due to poor funding of the Office by gov. Most supreme audit institutions all over the world are held in high esteem , but that of nigeria is not given any form of recognition , rather all attention has been diverted to the EFCC and ICPC . Those that established the ICPC and EFCC did they not know that there was an office of the auditor-gen ? why did n't they think of strengthening the Office .

Not many are after you but your evil and fraudulent tendency is haunting you . Cut your unnecessary security budget , the jumbo pay of the members of the Houses , improve of infrastructure , create job for street roaming graduates , let the refineries work , construct good roads , let the agricultural sector be functioning , since devilish men have hijacked the power section , use a more and defiant godly strength to destabilize them and then the basic needs of the people be met , by constant flow of portable water , then the state will be clean and most disease causing germs be banished . <p> the federal government should be transparent enough to make Nigeria a better place for the have not.the NNPC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balances as this will encourage other agencies to do so.we should lead by example . <p> I think that in every human society people that have the privilege of being at the hem of affair are always concerned about the legacy they will leave behind.The problem with our current democratic experiment is huge government expenditure especially remuneration of political office holders that kills infrastructural development coupled with acidic corruption .. To me the solution is simple 1 Unicameral Legislature 2 Non Stipendiary Political Office Holding 3 Tough Anti-Graft Measure . . <p> How do you expect a National Assembly occupied predominantly by people fraudulently elected to probe their promoters . Rather than beam their searchlight on Public Sector stealing which has brought the country into comatose , they are busy dissipating energies on irrelevances .

Fertiliser Policy <p> The Minister of Agriculture , Dr. Ayo Akinwunmi Adesina , has denied allegations that his ministry is in the process of appointing Notore Chemical Industries Limited and Federal Super Phosphate Company , Kaduna , as the sole suppliers of fertilizer to the ministry for onward distribution to farmers nationwide . <p> The minister 's denial is coming on the heels of a similar statement by Notore Industries that it is coercing the federal government into adopting or implementing a backward integration policy in the fertiliser industry , similar to what has obtained in the cement manufacturing industry . <p> Backward integration is a government policy designed to encourage investment in local production of commonly used commodities by restricting the importation of such commodities to only companies that have invested in local manufacturing of that commodity . <p> Adesina 's statement was in reaction to an advertorial last week by Fertiliser Stakeholders of Nigeria , accusing Notore and Federal Super Phosphate , under the aegis of Indigenous Manufacturers of Nigeria , of coercing the ministry into making them the sole suppliers of fertilizer as an incentive to encourage investment in local production . <p> The minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advert , stating that there is no such group known as the Fertiliser Stakeholders of Nigeria . <p> He said he had been meeting with manufacturers and importers of fertiliser in the country , and had intimated them of the ministry 's plan to stop the distribution of fertiliser and hand it over to the private sector . <p> " Right now , through the distribution structure we operate , only 11 percent of the farmers have access to fertiliser , but through the structure which we are trying to put in place , that will be private sector driven , we estimate that 94 percent of farmers will have access to fertiliser . <p> " That being the case , there is no way we will be awarding contracts to any company to supply fertilizer to the ministry for onward distribution to farmers , because the current regime has been flawed and has failed to make the commodity available at cheap prices , " the minister explained . <p> Adesina stated that his ministry is targeting wholesale reform in fertiliser production and distribution in Nigeria , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agricultural input . <p> " We intend to stop people and companies from coming to the ministry for the award of contracts to supply fertiliser . Our goal is to use private sector agro-dealers to create distribution channels , " he explained . <p> Adesina added that his ministry is also working on the introduction of a Growth Enhancement Support Scheme ( GESS ) , which is a targeted support programme directed at farmers . <p> " Our focus is on 20 million farmers over four years , which translates to five million per annum , and to get to them , we shall use the GESS that would enable them buy fertiliser directly from agro-dealers . <p> " In this regard , we have been meeting with the Central Bank of Nigeria to ensure that the agro-dealers are linked to banks from which they can access credit that would enable them stock up on fertiliser in their warehouses . " <p> With this initiative in place , farmers can use the fertiliser vouchers at their disposal to buy the commodity at a discounted price , following which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption . <p> Adesina assured that the advantage the voucher scheme has over the government distribution scheme , through which a few people corner the market for fertiliser and stifle the private sector market for the commodity , millions of farmers will have access to fertiliser . <p> " Our estimate is that 94 percent of farmers will have easier access to fertiliser under this new initiative , as opposed to 11% under the government distribution scheme , " he said . <p> Meanwhile , Notore , in a statement to THISDAY , said that contrary to speculations , it has not and is not championing the implementation of any such policy to prevent stakeholders from taking part in fertiliser business in Nigeria . <p> The company said , rather , it is only interested in the sustainable development of the nation 's agricultural sector and has taken verifiable steps to ensure that . <p> In the statement , the company said , " Notore believes that there should be favourable policies that will allow the private sector embark on the importation and manufacture of fertilisers . " As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments , and this will only be possible if the investor realises that the conditions will be favourable enough for him to recover his investment . <p> " Once the enabling policies are pronounced and the conditions are attractive enough , investors will be willing to put down the required funds to build the fertiliser plant .

However , the Fertiliser Stakeholders of Nigeria had accused Notore of leading a cartel intent on seizing the entire fertiliser market in the country . <p> The group claimed that the fertiliser manufacturers were allegedly the leaders of a grand design by a cartel to take over the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to the detriment of the nation . <p> " We feel greatly concerned because of the likely danger this plan poses to the food security of the nation and the programme to attain self reliance in food production . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , this company ( Notore ) was awarded the contract to supply 120,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser , which was the largest quantity that was awarded to a single company by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture . <p> " It could only supply 29,000 metric tonnes , which represents 24 percent of the total awarded it , " the group said in the advertorial . <p> Similarly , the group alleged that the Federal Super Phosphate Company , which also was awarded a contract to supply 30,000 metric tonnes to the ministry last year , could not deliver the supply . <p> Both firms , the group claimed , had approached the minister , Dr. Adesina , to be made the sole suppliers to the federal government again , even though they had failed to meet their delivery targets last year . <p> It added that it is glaring that Notore and Federal Super Phosphate lack the capacity to perform . <p> " So to allow the companies to progress with this plan portends danger of a fertiliser crisis , as farmers will not see it to buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful scheduled maintenance operation of its Onne plant , which has improved the reliability of the plant , making it able to produce at over 90 percent nameplate capacity of 500,000 metric tonnes of granular urea annually . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1801238 <h> Egbin Privatisation as Benchmark for Other Power Deals <p> If there is one privatisation transaction that should be of interest to the public , it is that of the sale of Egbin power plant in Lagos State . This is one deal that has been in the oven for more than four years but still has not been served up for Nigerians to assess . <p> Commissioned in 1985 , at 1,320MW , Egbin is the largest power plant in the country . It comprises six 220MW independent gas-fired steam turbine units that can also run on heavy oil , also known as low pour fuel oil ( LPFO ) in the petroleum industry . Possibly built with foreign loans made available by the Government of Japan , the plant was constructed by Japanese trading conglomerate with global interests in power and engineering , Marubeni Corporation , and was maintained on behalf of the National Electric Power Authority under a technical licensing agreement by Hitachi , yet again another Japanese engineering powerhouse . Such infrastructure loans were later to pile up to form Nigeria 's Paris Club debt . <p> Like several industrial facilities , in which the federal government invested considerable resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90s was performing epileptically . Lack of regular maintenance programmes meant that the plant operated at sub-optimal levels and was unable to generate sufficient electricity for the national grid . The situation was made worse by disagreements between NEPA and the combined forces of Shell and the Nigerian Gas Company , over the price of gas supplied to the plant . Shell and NGC were often compelled to shut in gas supply or limit the amount of gas to Egbin . Where it was available , the quality of gas and build up condensates in the Escravos-Lagos Gas Pipeline to Egbin could also impede its performance . <p> By 2006 , the Olusegun Obasanjo administration chose to contract the services of Marubeni to rehabilitate some of the plant 's boiler units . Marubeni was believed to have submitted a quote of $47 million to repair two boiler units . But before the contract could be awarded , Korea Electric Power Corporation ( KEPCO ) , which owned an identical plant in Seoul , South Korea , made representations to the federal government to repair the same units at a significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country by local energy company , Energy Resource Limited , the power subsidiary of Sahara Energy which also served as its Nigerian partner . <p> KEPCO 's entry into the Nigerian market coincided with mounting interests by Asian economies , led by China , in Nigeria 's hydrocarbon resources . Countries like China , South Korea and India reckoned that if they invested in badly needed infrastructure projects , this would pave access to Nigerian oil concessions . These are better known as the oil-for-infrastructure deals , which have stalled since former President Olusegun Obasanjo 's exit from office . Convinced that KEPCO could get the job done at a cheaper cost , Obasanjo awarded the contract to the Koreans and their Nigerian partners , Energy Resource . The consortium was said to have delivered the repaired boiler units on time and helped to increase output from Egbin to some 800MW . <p> Buoyed by the successful completion of the job , KEPCO and Energy Resource formed a joint venture , KERL -- KEPCO/ERL Consortium -- in which the Koreans held a 30 percent stake and Energy Resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government through the Bureau of Public Enterprises to acquire controlling interest of 51 percent in Egbin under the negotiated willing buyer-willing seller basis . <p> Having obtained the president 's approval to hold negotiations with KERL , the Egbin power station was hived off the list of six generation companies and 11 distribution companies that had been created from NEPA 's unbundling , and had been slated for privatisation early in 2007 . During negotiations , a valuation of $560 million was established for Egbin by BPE and KERL asked to pay $280 million for 51 percent of the power utility . Under the terms of the transaction , KERL was asked to pay 10 percent of the bid price and escrow a further 50 percent of the bid price ( totaling $168 million ) , in accordance with the terms of the agreement . KERL complied , leaving an outstanding balance of $112 million . <p> KERL also committed to double Egbin 's output with the construction of an additional 1,350MW combined cycle power plant under the terms of the agreement reached with BPE . When built , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the transaction was not concluded before Obasanjo left office and his successor , late President Umaru Yar'Adua , stopped everything relating to privatisation in the power sector , including suspension of projects under the National Integrated Power Programme . <p> Given the negotiations that had taken place and funds committed by KERL , this explains why Egbin was not included in the list of electricity utilities that were advertised by BPE when the power privatisation programme was resuscitated early this year . But with the resumption of asset sales in the power sector , BPE and the power ministry have informed KERL that the federal government will no longer be willing to part with Egbin under the same terms negotiated four years ago . They contend that in the four year period , the federal government has committed additional resources in Egbin to increase output at the plant , making it impossible for BPE to accept $280 million for 51 percent of the company any longer . <p> KERL has countered that it can not be made to bear the brunt for the federal government 's indecisiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consortium believes there is no justification for an upward revision of the valuation on Egbin and by extension the bid price , because the valuation undertaken in 2007 took into consideration the cost of building a Greenfield thermal station of the same capacity at $1 million per megawatt . By KERL 's estimates , if a brand new power station of the same capacity in 2007 , that is , before the global financial crisis cost $1.32 billion , it will be difficult to justify a revision of the price now that similar plants are being constructed at approximately $500,000 per megawatt as a result of reduced demand caused by the global economic recession . <p> Of greater significance , the BPE may have failed to factor the depreciation of the plant . No plant appreciates in value , instead they depreciate . Typically , a power plant of Egbin 's capacity is amortised over 25 years which is the estimated life span of the plant . So if Egbin was built in 1985 , it has outlived its book value . But should the BPE elect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of the federal government 's investment over the years , will Egbin still attract a valuation exceeding $560 million ? <p> Its valuation aside , BPE would also have to factor the interest charges on the $168 million , which KERL may have been paying banks since the amount was escrowed four years ago . Using an annualised rate of , say , 12 percent charged by an overseas bank on interest charges , the consortium would have paid nothing less than $80 million in interest alone for delays that were not of its making . Indeed , if BPE insists on driving a hard bargain , a shrewd investor might ask the privatisation agency to net off the accumulated interest against its revised price for Egbin . Also of consideration is the opportunity cost of capital that could have been deployed to other projects and could have yielded returns to repay the bank loan(s) . <p> These are very critical issues that should preoccupy BPE as it resumes negotiations on Egbin . As it stands , the privatisation of Egbin is bound to generate considerable interest from labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled with absolute care and transparency that leaves no room for questions . All things being equal , it should be the first of the power asset sales that could be concluded in the next few months . It will also serve as the benchmark for other privatisation deals in the power sector , as investors that have expressed interest in the outstanding five generation stations and 11 distribution companies will be watching closely with keen interest . <h> Comments ( 6 ) <p> Read other user 's comments about this page . You can add your own comments below . <p> Well , you said it all . Nigeria has such a poor reputation in regard to continuity of policy , we ought to sanction ourselves by sticking to the terms of the earlier deal . I hope the people of Lagos and Gov . Fashola will pressure Jonathan and Sambo to close this deal quickly and get the monkey of poor power supply off their backs . <p> We cry , shout and begged for investors to come no our country ; yet our policies and no decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment opportunity are been embark upon by successful government . Which investor will see a situation like this and come to invest ? IJ thanks for this wonderful analysis which ordinarily the government will keep secret from the populace to justify their corruption tendencies . <p> Miss ijeoma , you did not tell us how much Nigeria expend to build Egbin plant ( with estimated capacity of 1320MW ) in 1985 however if it is amortize by 25percent over its estimated useful life , how can you justify the amount the consortium wanted to pay for it.i think a highly competitive bidding process by BPE through full advertisement in major News papers of the world will give Nigeria a good bargain.thank you , all the same for the expose . <p> Fair attempt but riddled with many inconsistencies and half truths . Overall I will rate this piece as below average . <p> First , you failed to tell the readers how much it cost the Nigerian tax payers to build Egbin power station . Your article would have been better appreciated if this important detail was included . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At $1m per mw in 1985 , a 1,320 mw plant should cost about $1.32bn . If we add other charges including interest and penalties on the foreign loan plus the " local content " bribe , it should be simply to understand why the plant cost $2bn . <p> Second , I suppose the cost of repairs should include scope of actual repair works and guaranty to cover job done . I stand to be corrected that both companies did not submit quotations for similar repairs.Marubeni could have opted to change some boiler units completely while the Koreans believed that " reworking " the units should be good enough for NEPA . Is Egbin generating 800mw now ? You may need to further confirm this fact because you sold only one side of the story . <p> Third , very interesting term " hived off " . Pray what is the meaning of this term and can the president direct BPE to hive off a billion dollar national investment to a newly formed company without due process ? Was Egbin plant advertised for sale before OBJ directed that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the real owners of Sahara Energy . <p> Fourth , on valuation , it will be time wasting to proceed on this journey since you failed to ascertain the original and initial value of the plant . Any negotiations between BPE and a company known to be the final and sole beneficiary of a hived off Egbin plant courtesy of a presidential directive is just a mere smoke screen , any civil servant worth his salt will know exactly what to do since the figures would have been rounded up in Aso Rock . Meanwhile i will advice that you kindly reconsider your position on valuation , it is quite embarrassing . It is ludicrous to say that the life span of Egbin plant is 25yrs and at such it has no book value . <p> Fifth , hiving off a power plant is not the policy of the federal government of Nigeria or the function of BPE irrespective of an illegal presidential directive , I assume late Yar Adua understood this and that is why he stopped the fraud . <p> Lastly , apparently a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no exception . Newspaper like Thisday should be at the fore front of national revival , much is therefore expected from your stable . You can do better if you investigate deeper and avoid jumping into conclusions , it will be wise to let the readers reach their own based on the facts before them as published by Ijeoma Nwogwugwu . <p> Mr Have a Blessed Day - You are a real joker . The issue here is very simple . Whether Marubeni or not , KERL or not ..... why should it take the government over 4 years to conclude such a transaction haven pleaded for interest from the international community ? Was n't this the same concessional approach granted to Etisalat for its GSM license ? did they pay an extra amount for their GSM license - using your basis valuation principles ? Reading your mail , one would believe there is actually significant progress in Nigeria and the " CIVIL SERVANTS " to you and " EVIL SERVANTS " to us - in the country are worth their SALT .
