' COMMENTS - Can the young PNP ' Turks ' make it ? <p> The PNP have been in office for twenty two of the past twenty seven years , only interrupted in 2007 , and have shown a strong and united front in both the constant victories and the rare defeats . <p> But something different is happening , something you can feel . Portia for all practical purposes is dead politically and everyone knows this now , especially after the defeat and jockeying for positions have already begun in the background . <p> The old guard refuse to budge , and if they do it is going to be at a time of there choosing so they are slowly coalescing around a single candidate . The old guard , I believe know what a messy succession can do to a parties electability prospects , they will remember the JLP in the 90 's and want a quick succession . My personal view is that Peter Phillips , the media 's darling , wo n't get it simply because the delegates wo n't forgive him of this electoral debacle . <p> Persons on the ground say that Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old guard and that must be shocking for the PNP and the YO . For a man as him to be touted as a potential leader shows you what a state the party is in , if he were to get it that would be to condemn the PNP to losing the middle class for at least a generation . <p> That then leaves the young Turks in a tricky position , they right now are not a united force as they have quite a few in those ranks who want the ultimate mantle . They need to realise that the division plays into the hands of the old guard . With so many young prominent PNP members having fallen afoul of party elders and delegates it 's hard to see certain persons making a push for it , worse still if they do n't have a seat they can comfortably call there own . <p> Step forward Julian Robinson , here is a man with youth , fresh ideas , untainted by the elders , gets along well with delegates and firmly in control of his seat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a push for power . While Julian strikes one as the lecturer that no one wants to have , he is extremely bright and may have what it takes to usurp the young Andrew . <p> The young Turks if they are wise will come together around Julian and form a winning team . Imagine for a minute , a PNP ticket consisting of Julian , Raymond , Damian , Lisa and Mark ? That surely is a team that can not only muster enough internal support to wrest power from the old guard , but also a team that is young , willing to listen and learn all while doing things in a new fashion . <p> Whomever gets the nod , the youngsters need to act fast . With the election still not over ( recounts are ongoing ) , the political funeral has not really begun , the young Turks should take this time of confusion and map out a plan because certain dinosaurs will only leave if dragged kicking and screaming . <p> Yours truly , <p> Alexander Scott <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top stories of the day .

The numbers , she said , are based on the 2013 census which showed that Jamaica has just over 513,000 adolescents , that is , boys and girls ages 10 to 19 . <p> " Originally , we used mostly our antenatal clinic attendee data , which we used as a proxy for estimating HIV prevalence in Jamaica .

She also disclosed that the estimated number of girls in State care in the 10-19 age group is 298 and that there is an estimated 3,358 girls , ages 15-19 , who sell sex . <p> She emphasised that All In gave the ministry a " clearer grasp " of the situation , because previously , though empirical data was available from working in the field , it was not as clear . <p> She said beyond establishing the population sizes , All In looked at coverage in relation to HIV intervention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mother-to-child transmission coverage , condom use , comprehensive knowledge , and media access .

@@9753235 <h> Columns <h> Gov't ... come clean on Noranda <p> As part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the USA , Noranda Aluminum Inc will sell its St Ann bauxite mining assets . On July 7 , 2016 , today , Noranda is reported to be auctioning its " downstream business " ( four rolling mills ) . And on September 22 , 2016 it will be auctioning its " upstream business " , which should include its assets in St Ann as well as the Gramercy alumina refinery in Louisiana and the New Madrid smelter in Missouri . <p> Noranda Bauxite Limited holds a 49 per cent stake in Noranda Jamaica Bauxite Partnership Limited ( the other 51 per cent is owned by Government of Jamaica ) and holds Special Mining Lease #165 , which encompasses 177 square kilometres ( 68 square miles ) south of Brown 's Town in St Ann , as well as Special Exclusive Prospecting Licence #578 covering 136 square kilometres ( 52 square miles ) in western St Ann and Trelawny , including part of the Cockpit Country . <p> Noranda originally acquired the mining lease and assets from St Ann Bauxite Limited , which had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a concession to mine bauxite in Jamaica through 20 30 . It currently employs about 300 individuals as well as numerous contractors . <p> Noranda 's bankruptcy and the selling of its St Ann assets will have consequences for Jamaica beyond St Ann , as the " twilight " bauxite industry continues its transition to second- and third-tier operators who are mostly interested in short-term gain subsidised by concessions from the Government of Jamaica . <p> Rusal has sold Alpart , which operates the alumina plant in Nain , to Jiuquan Iron and Steel Company Limited and will probably continue to divest operations in Jamaica . The Government of Jamaica must define its policy on the eventual phase-out of bauxite mining in Jamaica , instead of continuing on the merry-go-round of successive owners , each maximising their short-term gains while leaving Jamaica and the communities in mining districts to pick up the costs when the music stops . <p> It is a long-standing business practice of companies to declare bankruptcy as a means of getting out of prior financial , legal and ethical obligations . Noranda 's sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to all of the " unfinished business " in St Ann , such as unreclaimed/poorly reclaimed pits and uncompensated landowners , that Noranda will leave behind . The new owner of the assets will not be responsible for debts incurred by Noranda unless these are specifically listed in what is called a " Cure Notice " . This will state the amounts , if any , that the debtors believe are necessary to assume the mining contracts or leases that are being transferred to the new owner . Jamaica will be able to object to these amounts at the Sale Hearing in September , but otherwise they will be final . <p> No doubt the minister of transport and mining is following this closely . But how about the unresolved issues of poor reclamation ? How about the illegal operations which took place in the Caledonia crossroad area in early 2015 ? How about compensation for people whose rights have apparently been infringed because mining has occurred closer than the legal limit to their houses , such as Mr Rupert Walker of Caledonia , whose dwelling house is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , mined-out pit , which itself seems to be outside of the mining lease ? <p> History has shown that new companies reject prior agreements pertaining to wages , benefits , pension funds , etc , and ignore prior obligations and stated intentions as to social , economic and environmental investments . It is time that the Government of Jamaica protects the citizens of Jamaica and generations to come , instead of continuing bankrupt , neocolonial policies which subsidise the bauxite industry to the great detriment of Jamaica 's natural environment , agriculture , heritage , community cohesion , sustainability , and sovereignty . <p> We call on Mike Henry , minister of transport and mining , and the Government of Jamaica to clearly state what it intends to do about the money it is owed by Noranda , what amounts it believes should be included in the " Cure Notices " , how it plans to handle the outcomes of Noranda 's sale of its Jamaican assets , and what consequences this will have for Government 's 51 per cent share of Noranda Jamaica Bauxite Partners Limited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its definition of the Cockpit Country boundary and to declare the area closed to mining . <p> Finally , we call upon the Government of Jamaica to define its overall plan for the orderly phasing out of bauxite mining in Jamaica . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@9753238 <h> Columns <h> Federations ... constitutional reform <p> Today is the 39th anniversary of the clash of the four sevens ( seventh day of the seventh month , 1977 ) . According to legend , Marcus Garvey had prophesied that all sorts of calamities were to take place on that day . <p> More importantly , today is 39 years since Michael Manley , as prime minister , launched the process that was to have taken us to republican status by 1981 . Michael Manley strategically used the legend attributed to Garvey to launch constitutional reform ( read ' republican status ' ) . <p> Fundamental change has been historically started on milestone days in various cultures . Jesus Christ used the Jewish Feast of the Passover to institute the Lord 's Supper . In pagan Rome , Pope Victor I ( the first of three popes of African ancestry ) used the feast of the pagan goddess Eostre to institute the feast of the resurrection ( Easter Sunday ) . The Church also used the pagan feast of the unconquered sun to institute the Feast of the Nativity ( Christmas Day ) . <p> In Jamaica , the then premier Norman Manley proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to National Labour Day as of 1961 . It was amended to May 23 on the request of then Opposition member , the late David Clement Tavares . May 23 , 1938 was the starting date of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union , which was a turning point in our history . In converting from pounds shillings and pence to dollars and cents in September 1969 , the equivalent in dollars and cents was in notes and coins similar in appearance to the previous ones . At that time Hugh Shearer was prime minister and Edward Seaga was minister of finance and planning . <p> On July 7 , 1977 , there was a re-enactment of the Paul Bogle-led march in St Thomas from Stony Gut to Morant Bay . At the Morant Bay Courthouse Michael Manley spoke about wanting a simply written constitution that every Jamaican would be able to read . The discussions were to take place for three years until 1980 when there was supposed to be a referendum and the new constitution was to take effect in 1981 . Constitutional reform was , however , postponed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of Government and no more was said about constitutional reform until 1989 when the Government changed again . <p> In the throne speech by Governor General Sir Patrick Allen earlier this year there was once again an announcement about republican status . I suspect that there is not sufficient political will to make this great change to being a republic . Republican status will not " feed hungry bellies " , as the late Wilmot " Motty " Perkins mentioned regularly on his radio call-in programme . But being a republic is most of all the highest form of independence , at least on paper . True , we have our national symbols that came with Independence in 1962 , which are really expressions of a separate cultural identity from other nations , but republican status is a more graphic way of expressing a separate cultural identity in the world and a desire to be respected as such . <p> The greatest obstacle to political federations is the need by people in small nations for a separate identity and the fear of losing it . And some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this reason , as did the Britons in the Brexit vote two weeks ago . <p> I am a federalist because I see the economic advantages that a properly run federation can bring through collective efforts in goods , trade , and negotiations on the world scene . But Wayne Kublalsingh , who does not share my views , at least as far as the European Economic Community is concerned , made some very good points in his article in the <p> Jamaica Observer last week . Even children need their own identity , and Kublalsingh started his piece by stating that " human beings kill for their identity " , which is the truth . More importantly , Kublalsingh did a review of British history and all their international and civil wars to make his point that Britain had fought long and hard for its own identity , which 52 per cent of the electorate did not want to be subsumed into continental Europe . In that respect it was an excellent article . <p> This is why Norman Manley wanted a weak federation while political leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mindful that Jamaica 's nationalism was still young and vulnerable , having been born in the late 1930s . And barely 20 years had passed since the upheavals of 1938 when the West Indies Federation began in 1958 . But for any federation to work there has to be unity . <p> I was asked online last week if I thought Trinidad would have used their oil to help Jamaica . The answer could well be ' no ' , if they are not getting anything in return . But if they knew that working collectively Jamaica could negotiate better oil deals for them , while negotiating for better deals for bauxite , for example , then perhaps they would have joined forces for that reason . <p> Another reader pointed out that many federal arrangements are managed so that some get more benefits than others , but the answer to that is not always to run away . While the devaluation of the British pound could well be ' the establishment ' trying to punish Britain , this is nothing new . And , when devaluation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force compliance . Why did the political violence and the food shortages in the 1970s resemble a quote from the US Army manual of Psychological Warfare ? For reference see pages 210-211 of <p> Struggle on the Periphery by Michael Manley . <p> But fighting a bully in a group is more effective , which confirms the adage that " unity is strength " . This is why one of the most powerful federations in the world is the United States of America . Initially they were fighting against 18th century British colonialism . Today , there are many fights ( read ' causes ' ) . <p> If we really had free trade we would not need NAFTA , Caricom and other trade blocs , but if we never had thieves we would not need policemen , security guards , alarm systems , locks and keys . <p> ekrubm765@yahoo.com <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@10322233 <h> Am I cursed for not having a child ? <h> by <p> I am 45 years old and I would like to ask you a question . Is it true that a woman who does not have children is cursed ? I was married and my husband divorced me because I did not get pregnant for him . I became a little promiscuous and was having sex with different guys I knew . I told each of them that they can get me pregnant and not worry . I would never say who got me pregnant . <p> After doing that for two years I stopped because I became attached to one of these guys and I would have caused trouble in his marriage . I love that man so much . I gave up . Now I have a man . We are not yet married but we are planning to do so . Whenever people ask me about children and I tell them I do not have children they are so surprised . I am quite comfortable . My regret is that I have never had a child . Am I cursed ? <p> E.S . <p> Dear E.S. , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible which indicates that a woman who is barren is cursed . People may say so but they are only speculating . If it is the will of God for a woman to have children and she has a man who is in good health and is able to impregnate her , she will have children . On the other hand , there is a story about Hannah who was childless and very unhappy because she did not have a child and she went to the temple and prayed earnestly that she would have a child . And Eli , the priest , saw her and he blessed her . And God opened Hannah 's womb and she became pregnant and had a son . God does not allow every woman to become pregnant . Those who do not have children should serve the Lord and make sure that they are in God 's will .

Dr Milroy insisted that the types of injuries Mitchell sustained and the distribution of the injuries based on the pathology pattern showed that her death was as a result of a fall . <p> But when quizzed further by Llewellyn as to whether Mitchell was pushed or whether she had jumped , the defence witness said : " You ca n't differentiate if someone was pushed or if they went out on their own volition from pathology . " <p> However , Dr Milroy said it was likely that Mitchell had jumped through the window on her own will , as there was no evidence to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist being pushed or thrown . <p> " Is it that you 're saying she committed suicide ? " Lllewelyn asked . <p> " Suicide is really decided by a Coroner 's Court , and I ca n't read someone 's mind , but it is possible that the injuries were self-inflicted , " Dr Milroy replied . <p> Mitchell was allegedly killed at her Oaklands Apartment home on July 16 , 2008 . It was initially alleged that she was thrown three storeys down from the washroom window of her apartment by her ex-boyfriend , Steven Causewell , following an argument . <p> In the meantime , marketing consultant , Danielle Munroe , who is the mother of Causewell 's daughter , told jurors that Causewell is a man of great integrity , a wonderful father , and a loving person who would not cause harm to another . <p> " I always consider him to be chivalrous , a true gentlemen .

However , she said they have been separated for about four years now . <p> According to Munroe , Causewell started dating his wife some time between 2007 and 2008 . <p> However , when asked if she had seen Mitchell around during those times , Munroe said ' no ' as she did not expect him to be seeing Mitchell , given that he was a man of integrity . <p> Another character witness , Dr Clyde Morrison , also told the jurors that Causewell was a person of good reputation and that he was neither selfish nor cruel . <p> The trial will break for the next three weeks due to circumstances beyond the control of presiding judge , Justice Carol Lawrence , and will resume in the Home Circuit Court on August 29 . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@13692236 <h> News <h> Audit ... inefficiencies in property tax collection <p> PROPERTY tax collection increased by almost three times since 2011 , but the Government gave up $3.3 billion in arrears over the period due to a number of inefficiencies in the system . <p> This , according to a performance audit report recently tabled in Parliament by the Auditor General 's Department ( AGD ) . The audit was done to determine whether the Tax Administration of Jamaica ( TAJ ) is managing its property tax operations effectively . <p> The AGD said the threefold increase was mainly due to an increase in the property tax rate in 2013 , and not as a result of improvements in the compliance rate . <p> The Government auditors pointed out that the TAJ placed less emphasis on targeting the number of non-compliant properties , but was ineffective in ensuring a high level of compliance among registered properties . <p> " When property tax compliance is considered using the number of properties as a measure , TAJ only achieved 45 per cent of total obligations over the three-year review period FY2013/14 to FY2015/16 . In particular , for 2015/16 , the total obligation was $15.29 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the report said , while noting that the TAJ had responded that the department is recommending that its mandated targets be aligned with the total obligations versus budgeted collections . <p> The auditors pointed out that annual targets for property taxes are determined through the collaboration of the TAJ , and the ministries of local government and finance , but that it was the local government ministry that sets the annual targets and then communicated this to the TAJ . " No targets were set for the volume ( number ) of properties to be pursued relative to the stock of properties on record , " the AGD said . <p> " Additionally the process of issuing reminders , summonses and arrangements for payment of arrears was inconsistent , " the report stated . <p> At the same time , the AGD said the TAJ had implemented strategies to enhance opportunities for the payment of property taxes , including increasing its collection platforms , the number of collection centres staff capacity and prioritising collections efforts in parishes with low compliance levels and high arrears . <p> " However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the limited number of court sessions assigned for tax cases as well as problems related to the disposal of seized assets . Further , the non-existence of titles for some non-exempt properties acquired under various circumstances thwarted TAJ 's efforts to serve notices for payment arrears , " the AGD explained , noting also that the TAJ has committed to having discussions with the National Land Agency and other stakeholders with a view to reducing the risk of non-compliance . <p> The AGD has , therefore , recommended that the TAJ should ramp up strategies to improve the accuracy of its property tax register in order to enable greater efficiency in the use of resources for property tax collection and enforcement ; and that its performance measure should include a target to increase the number of compliant properties and specific milestones to achieve the best level of compliance . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@14000232 <h> News <h> JTA ... about recovering millions defrauded from the association <p> General secretary of the Jamaica Teachers ' Association ( JTA ) Byron Farquharson said the association is optimistic as it manoeuvres a " legal maze " in its bid to recover millions of dollars which was allegedly defrauded by a former accounts department employee , three years ago . <p> " We note the long expensive and frustrating experience we have in trying to recover what is ours ; we have made some progress through the courts but the legal maze is still ongoing " , Farquharson told delegates attending the JTA 's annual conference in Montego Bay , St James . <p> According to Farquharson , $34 million have been expended so far by the association to recover close to $100 million which was syphoned in 2013 .

@@14000239 <h> Columns <h> Encouraging ... <p> I was heartened when I saw the headline in this newspaper a few days ago , ' Thanks , Alia ' . In an environment where we sometimes destroy winners , it is refreshing to see us encouraging our stars even in difficult circumstances . <p> In a different capacity , having been instrumental in establishing the Faculty of Science and Sport at the University of Technology ( UTech ) , Jamaica , I had met with Jamaica 's swimming sensation in order to explore the possibilities of her pursuing studies in our faculty while continuing her swimming preparation . I found her to be so pleasant and patriotic . It was clear that she was not just swimming for herself , but for Jamaica . We must continue to encourage our winners . <p> The well-known parable of the talents illustrates the principle of encouraging success . The talent was taken from the servant who had buried his master 's talent and had generated no returns and it was given to the servant who had generated an additional five talents with the five that he was given initially . There is an alternative notion that would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 talents while another had four and yet another had only one . This alternative would look favourably at taking away five talents from the servant who had 10 , give one to the servant who had four , and the other four to the servant who had one , so that all three servants would have five talents . Needless to say , the servant who would have had the five talents taken from him , having traded successfully to gain them , would not be highly motivated to go trading again . And the one who received four additional talents for doing nothing would have no reason to do anything . Quite opposite to that , the ' good book ' supported encouragement for good effort and success . <p> The principle applies in the support we give to some of our institutions . In the tertiary sector , one institution receives approximately $150,000 per annum per student while another receives approximately $550,000 per annum per student , an imbalance of which present consideration towards a resolution should be applauded .

I am proud to be associated with the first , even while appreciating the benefit I got from being trained at the second . <p> With very little resources , the first continues to outperform every other university in the world in terms of the slate of athletics champions that they produce , many of whom represented Jamaica in the Rio Olympics .

Northern Caribbean University was next with 24 . In regard to such institutions , the then Executive Director Dr Ethley London had this to say in the report : " For almost 20 years , the UCJ has provided quality assurance service to Jamaican tertiary education through programmatic accreditation , but now finds it useful to proceed towards institutional accreditation for the more mature institutions .

The statue that has been built in his honour can be located there for all to see . Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce must also be appropriately singled out for further honour . The honorary degree to be conferred on her by The University of the West Indies is appropriate . One can not see why a statue of her can not be erected in honour of her achievements .

It is not inconceivable to see large conglomerates such as GraceKennedy and the Lasco Group including logos of athletes with pithy messages on their iconic brands . Big conglomerates in the United States do it to great profit . The athletes would be paid royalties and this could be an important stream of residual income for them well into the future . <p> There are many ways in which we can honour our athletes .

@@14080230 <h> ' Sausage Party ... a biting cartoon comedy <p> Sausage Party is not a light movie .

The answer , of course , is that they would realise they live in a nightmare world where their only purpose is to fuel and service humans . <p> A movie so dark could only be rated R.

@@14080238 <h> Dynamic Lifestyle Back ... school like a beast <p> Finally ! It 's time for back to school . I can hear the parents rejoicing ! Minus the traffic , this time of year is one of the best times to plan , strategise , and make due on your fitness goals . <p> Let 's face it , summer was good ! From the amazing heat to the cool rains , great fruits in season - summer 2016 provided the best opportunity for you to work out , look good and eat great food . Now its time to continue the trend with the start of a new school year . Whether you are a parent or a child , here are my top five ways to keep your fitness goals intact with the new school season ! <p> 1 . Grab a fitness journal - It will keep you focused <p> There 's an old saying - " Only that which is managed can be improved " . That said , in the same way we have academic goals , the same impetus has to be placed on ensuring that we write down out goals and work relentlessly at getting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , do n't get me wrong , writing alone will not get the job done . There has to be an all-out fight against procrastination and fear to achieve your fitness goals - working out when you could be sleeping , eating clean when you could be pigging out , and actually becoming meticulous about Every . Single . Ingredient . All that takes time , a precious resource not to be taken lightly . Ensure you grab any book , it does n't have to be special , it just needs to track your progress . <p> 2 . Grab a workout partner or app <p> Accountability is the next thing that you will need in your war against laziness this new school year . I suggest that you grab an accountability partner or an app that will send alerts , much like your friend , to remind you that you need to work out . Those muscles are not going to build themselves ; there must be a support system in place to push you past your comfort zone in order to get you burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pace , the calories burnt , and my distance . The aim is to better your score at specific intervals to ensure growth . <p> 3 . Clean up your kitchen TODAY <p> While I can understand that having snacks around the house is a good excuse for children , as adults , we need to shift the culture when thinking about food . Unhealthy , preservative-filled and gas-inducing snacks are not the mindset of a Dynamic Lifestyle . Instead , allow your mind and body to have a detox daily , ensuring that the body receives all the adequate nutrition it needs including water . Snack swap all your manufactured food for fresh , ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables until you see some improvement . <p> Remember that in order to do big things , we must start small . Get into those cupboards , and pantries today . <p> 4 . Get your children involved <p> Here 's the truth , children live what they learn and follow what they see adults doing . Why not start healthy habits by talking to your children about health and nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen to help cook . This is also very important if your family has a history of lifestyle-related illnesses and who better than your children to call you out when you 're eating badly ? <p> 5 . Create a vision board <p> In order to arrive at a destination , you must know where you 're going . To do this , you must have your vision clear as to who you want to be and what you wish to look like . That being said , I suggest that you do a fitness vision board . Whether you want abs like Janet Jackson or pecs like Asafa Powell , knowing what the goal is will also push you to work harder and stronger . This is also a great thing to do with children - have them create vision boards as to how they wish to make fitness a part of their lives . <p> What 's Next ? ! <p> That 's it for this week !

If an accused person pleads guilty before trial , then there is provision for a 35 per cent discount of the sentence . <p> " When clients express the desire to plead guilty , the first thing they ask is how long will be the sentence , " said McFarlane . <p> He said his clients are very disappointed when he tells them he really does not know what the sentence will be as it depends on the judge . <p> According to McFarlane , some judges are using the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years as the starting point , while he believes the starting point , must be below that . <p> He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , and he is urging judges to get together and discuss where the consideration for a prison term should begin once the accused pleads guilty . <p> " Unlike other jurisdictions , Jamaican judges in practice do not promise specific sentences upon a plea , " said McFarlane , who is calling for immediate changes so he will have a chance to indicate to his clients the type of sentences they are likely to get if they plead guilty . <h> Lottery-scamming cases <p> Last month , the Court of Appeal in disposing of two lottery scamming cases expressed the need for a starting point in the sentences of those who plead guilty . <p> Under the Law Reform ( Fraudulent Transactions ) Special Provisions Act which came into effect in 2013 , a judge can impose a fine or imprisonment not exceeding 15 years or both fine and imprisonment on a person who is convicted of lottery scamming . <p> Recently , the Court of Appeal , in reducing the sentences of two persons who had pleaded guilty in separate cases , outlined some of the generally accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges confronted with this issue . <p> " It is a common pace doctrine of modern sentencing ... that in choosing the appropriate sentencing option in each case , the sentencing judge must always have in mind the four classified principles of sentencing .

" <p> The Appeal Court said further that , " Having decided that a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate in a particular case , the sentencing judge 's first task is to make a determination , as an initial step , of the length of sentence , as a starting point , and then go on to consider any other factors that will influence the sentence , whether in mitigation or otherwise . <p> " It will , in our view , generally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting point in the search for the appropriate sentence , " the court ruled . <p> The other case was that of 34-year-old Kurt Taylor , who was sentenced in December 2014 to five years ' imprisonment after he pleaded guilty in the St Elizabeth Circuit Court . <p> Taylor 's lawyer , Yushaine Morgan , had at the sentencing hearing referred to two cases similar to Taylor 's in which a fine of $300,000 was imposed in September 2014 and a probation order made in the other case . <p> In Taylor 's case , the court , comprising Justice Hilary Phillips , Justice Almarie Sinclair Haynes and Justice Frank Williams , pointed out that the judge had used the maximum sentence of 15 years ' imprisonment as the starting point in Taylor 's case and in the sentencing process made two reductions before sentencing him to five years ' imprisonment . <p> The court made it abundantly clear in Taylor 's case that 15 years ought not to be the starting point for persons who plead guilty . <p> Taylor had no previous conviction and was in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet ' with the telephone numbers and addresses of persons in the United States of America . <p> The court queried if the starting point for Taylor with one lead sheet was 15 years , then what would be the starting point of a person with a previous conviction or convictions who was found in possession of 100 lead sheets . <p> Taylor 's immediate release was ordered by the court on compassionate grounds because he is wheelchair bound . <p> Director of Public Prosecutions Paula Llewellyn did not oppose Taylor 's early release .

I read on a British website that in order to help the woman orgasm , it is often a good idea to have sex with her from behind . <p> Why is this , please ? I do not understand . <p> A The main reason why this position is sometimes helpful is that the man can easily reach round and use his hand to stimulate his partner 's clitoris during sex . <p> You see , many other sex positions ( including the traditional ' face-to-face ' ) make it very difficult for the man to get his fingertips on to the woman 's clitoral region . And some sort of stimulation of the clitoris is usually essential in order to help women to orgasm .

Nine Eleven was to become a date of murder and mayhem , echoing around and across the world . Jamaica , like others , battled fears of where the world would be going . <p> Would we be able to survive the economic impact on our small nation , which depended on the assistance of the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay us low too , but some did feel a responsibility for ourselves . <p> By early October , a team of leaders of Jamaican commerce and industry took the decision to journey to Manhattan to assess the trade scene and to let it be known that we were still here : ready to do business , tourism in particular . While working on the team of <p> RJR 's leading call-in programme -- <p> Hotline -- in 2001 , the idea came as to why we should make it to New York -- despite fear of flying at such a dangerous time . A large percentage of our listeners were located in the Diaspora , especially on the eastern seaboard of the USA , and we wanted to know how they were doing . <p> At the time , our Air Jamaica was still flying , despite the stringent changes in air travel . Air Jamaica 's management was generous , anyway , to help keep our people connected , at home and abroad , in such a time . So , our trio was assembled and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What would we find when we landed in New York , considering that the Twin Towers site was still smouldering ? It was a chilly evening when we travelled into the city , where a subdued air hung over it all . We followed the trade delegation to the famed Waldorf Astoria hotel , one of New York 's historical landmarks , which at that time was one of the very few hotels in the city which were accessible . On normal days we could never have set foot there . We could n't afford the rates , but that evening , with everybody struggling for survival , we were grateful for " the charity rate " and set about preparing for the next day . <p> We came awake early and raced into the street the next morning to find transportation to get as near as we could to the disaster site . The streets were eerily quiet , lacking the mad rush and noisy traffic of a New York day . It took a while before we got a taxi , managing to flag down a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather be at home , but his family had to be fed . He reluctantly headed towards the location of the towers . <p> We were continually stopped and questioned at each intersection by police officers and members of the National Guard . We displayed as much documents of identification as we had in our possession . By this , our driver was shivering with fear . He was n't comfortable to be on the street . After a while he bid us goodbye as he dumped us out and raced away . We continued the journey on foot , stopping at one corner blockade after another to get security clearance , which we did without any problem . <p> Finally , we got as close as allowed to the area where the remnants of the towers stood . We saw the remains of the huge structures , smashed into the ground , squashed like two tin cans stepped on by an angry giant . Plumes of smoke still rose from the destroyed material . People who came from not too far away to satisfy their curiosity moved nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of how workers in the two buildings , trapped by fire and facing imminent death , joined hands and jumped to the pavements below . <p> We noticed a stocky man working in a small shop or office nearby . Who was he ? I satisfied my curiosity by asking where he came from . The answer : Portmore , Jamaica . Yes , you will find us anywhere . Asking further questions about his experience , we asked him where he was when the planes struck . He was at his little workplace , he said , but he could not explain why his place had escaped destruction . He could not fathom why he was still alive while so many others were dead . Not surprisingly , he was fulsome in a prayer of heaven-directed gratitude . <p> A little way off , we came upon two greedy traders who , regardless of the heat and the heart-rending sights nearby , kept open their souvenir shops . And despite being under the watchful eyes of the police and National Guard , they still tried to gouge gullible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a command to move and keep on moving . They obeyed quickly . <p> Then , into the space came a group of men who were identified to us as Mohawk Indians , who had been brought in to work at high levels from the ground as part of the rescue work , which would be involved in the hunt for survivors . Mohawks are noted , we were told , for their incredible skills working at seemingly impossible heights . Our sightseeing ended when we had to move away to find our way back Uptown to the Jamaican Consulate in time to do interviews and to make the broadcast link to Lyndhurst Road . <p> Public transportation in Manhattan was even more difficult to find than before . Luck then came our way and we hopped into the first taxi , despite the cabby 's inflated fares , and he took us to our destination at the Jamaican High Commission where the then High Commissioner Basil Bryan and his team were working like crazy , fielding the calls that came in from members of the Diaspora and wherever else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking the painful news of lost loved ones who had worked in what was by then an area of grief . It was a time of distress . <p> Fifteen years later , Nine Eleven was a nightmare we 'd rather forget . Sadly , there are family members whose grief has not healed up to now . Should we have set up a monument to our departed ? Other people elsewhere have done that for their own . Why not we ? <p> While in New York that day I managed , via the phone , to make contact with a father who told me how his son used to come home at the same time every evening from his job in the Twin Towers . His father said , as soon as he came home , his son dropped his keys in a little Jamaican clay saucer by the front door . He did n't come home that day -- or any time thereafter , said his father who was certain that he ( Dad ) could still hear the sound of the keys . <p> Our media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of the inconvenience of airport travel from then on . Question of today : Must we really take off shoes and stand on frowzy mats ? Is n't it time we do better at security ? <p> The reign of Osama and Nine Eleven would , and did , continue until ( 2011 ) , 10 years later , when Obama struck Osama . Since then , too , the Twin Towers site has been redeveloped . A new tower and a museum stand near Ground Zero . I 've been told that the name of at least one Jamaican victim is engraved on a monument there . His remains are interred here , kept private by his family . <p> With the help of the high commission staff in New York , before leaving for home , we made contact with fellow Jamaicans who shared their various experiences . Some were mourning , some were too shocked to speak . Nine Eleven has changed the world . Sadly , even greater evils raise their heads each day .

@@14605232 with Mugabe 's hold on power <p> Reading between the lines you 'll conclude that former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo is not impressed with Robert Mugabe 's continued hold on power in Zimbabwe . <p> Ninety-two-year-old Mugabe was elected prime minister in 1980 and served in that post until he won the presidency in December 1987 . <p> He is regarded as a hero of his country 's fight against apartheid , but in recent years he has been accused of ruling with an iron fist , crushing dissent and his political opponents . <p> Under his tenure , the Zimbabwean economy has plunged to the point where teachers and medical personnel have , in recent weeks , gone on strike over unpaid wages . <p> Mugabe has consistently blamed his country 's economic problems on Western states , led by Britain , who , he said , have plotted to get him out of office because of his seizure of white-owned farms . <p> However , his detractors have said he has not demonstrated an understanding of how a modern economy works . <p> Just this month , he was reported as saying that he intends to contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents . <p> Last Friday , the Jamaica Observer put the question of Mugabe 's continued stay in office to Obasanjo , who was on a short visit to Jamaica . <p> " I believe that unless he decides to go , he will not go , " said the former army general who served as Nigerian president from 1999 to 2007 . <p> Asked whether he believes Mugabe should step down , Obasanjo said : " Well , I believe that after he has stayed as long as he has , since 1980 , I do n't believe there is something special that he wants to achieve that he has not so far achieved . I do n't believe there is magic that he wants to perform that he has n't performed . " <p> When the Observer asked Obasanjo if he thought that Mugabe had betrayed the revolution , he gave a heavy sigh before answering . <p> " Well , he believes that he has n't . To the extent that the revolution was partly about land redistribution , I would say he has kept faith with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also about democracy , that has not been able to take place . Particularly to the extent of ensuring that there is succession , then I would say he needs to put that in play before he goes , and it 's never too late to do that , " Obasanjo said . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

And do thou , O prince of the heavenly host , by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the Earth seeking the ruin of souls . Amen . " <p> Today is the feast day of the archangels , saints Michael , Raphael and Gabriel . This is why I began this article with quoting the popular prayer to St Michael , the archangel , in the Roman Catholic Church . <p> All sins are inspired by evil , including crime and violence . Those that have manipulated the economic structure in such a way that leads some to crime and violence have also sinned . In Matthew 18:6 we read : " But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archangels , comes at a time when the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica , the Chamber of Commerce , and the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association ( JHTA ) have correctly voiced their concerns about the impact that crime in St James could very well have on the tourism product . This should be the concern of all Jamaicans as tourism drives the Jamaican economy today whether we like to admit it or not . <p> The president of the JHTA seems to be asking for more of the same from the police to stem the crime instead of getting involved in social justice . The truth is that for many decades the cry has been the same : the police are not doing enough . A statement attributed to Einstein -- some say he never said it -- is that a definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result . Will anything change for the better if the JHTA chooses not to get involved in social justice ? The president of the JHTA needs to reflect on this . <p> The president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that his organisation is willing to support any programme to stem the crime , and I understand this to mean that he supports some amount of social justice . Yes , the PSOJ can point to many projects costing perhaps billions of dollars , both as a group and in some cases individually . But there are some problems that are not solved by throwing money at them . What the poor of this country need is genuine empowerment . <p> The Roman Catholic Church teaches that there are sins of commission as well as sins of omission . At the very beginning of mass in the Roman Catholic Church we say : " I confess to Almighty God , and to you my brothers and sisters , that I have greatly sinned ; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do . Through my fault , through my fault , through my most grievous fault ... " Today I am looking at what we have failed to do , commonly called the sins of omission . <p> I have been arguing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which every worker is a shareowner . This , in my opinion , will go a long way in decreasing unemployment and crime . Will the hoteliers give to a foundation that will establish such co-operatives ? What about the other big players in the tourism industry , such as the restaurateurs and the storeowners ? Please reflect on this . <p> There is nothing wrong with being wealthy . But there is a glorification and worship of wealth and material things in the United States and we caught with the wind here long ago . This ill wind then trickled down to the poorest in Jamaica . So many are ' blind ' to the immorality in some of the ways that wealth can be gained , such as in scamming for example , which apparently leads to violence . And gross immorality is generally overlooked just because of the monetary benefit . <p> Even more important , if there is unemployment with no hope in getting jobs , then it becomes very difficult to stop crime and violence . We should be grateful that , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of the 7.3 billion people in the world are undernourished , Jamaica does not have that serious a malnutrition problem today . Gone for many centuries are the days when children died from many types of sicknesses related to malnutrition . <p> But the way in which the Jamaican society is organised it is very stressful as most people owe financial institutions and hold on to jobs in which they are not happy to pay the bills . To relieve the stress many go to doctors who give them prescriptions . But if there was more social justice the stress would be relieved and it would save them their medical bills . <p> And if more people formed co-operatives , more individuals would not be as stressed in repaying loans , as essentially they would be working for themselves and not for some miserable employer . True , it is not easy to work together in co-operative projects because many refuse to work in unity and act in a disciplined manner . Indeed , co-operatives by themselves will not change anything if we do not know how to unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be taught in our schools . <p> Co-operative education should be seen as an extension of teamwork learned in team sports , where unity and discipline can be primarily taught . And properly organised families should be regarded as the basic unit of co-operatives . Co-operative education should also bring about the end of the disgusting class attitudes that we inherited from slavery . <p> ekrubm765@yahoo.com <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@14605235 and beautiful speeches , but politicians are the problem <p> The recent spate of criminal activities , in particular in the parish of St James , has given the opportunity for politicians to grandstand and make pretty speeches about criminal activities . <p> The harsh reality is that several of the communities that are factories for criminals were either created by politicians ; or in many cases , politicians exercised wilful blindness as these squatter and informal settlements were being established . <p> Politicians from both major political parties supported the establishment of lawless communities and , when criminals take over and run these communities as " donships " , these same politicians shed crocodile tears and make beautiful speeches about how they are solving the crime situation . <p> Any analysis of the crime situation in St James will show that many of the perpetrators are from informal or squatter communities . Many of us have , for years , warned that these squatter and informal communities are breeding grounds for criminals and are communities in which normal proper policing can not be practised or enforced . <p> These communities have no proper road network and so criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any formal system of addresses . Most squatter communities need an enforcer to protect the squatters from people who might seek to evict them from occupation of lands belonging to the State or to other people . This is the foundation on which the dons , the extortionists and the enforcers , build their kingdom of crime . <p> The politicians , in time , lose control of these squatter and informal communities . Their authority is taken over by the dons , and in many instances politicians have to get the permission of dons to visit these communities . <p> No amount of pretty speeches will bring about a solution to the crime monster now haunting the country . Experience has shown that there is one , and only one activity , that the criminals all fear , be he a don or a little petty criminal , and that activity is " the hunt " . <p> If we look at the history of the dons in Jamaica , or if we go as far as to look at ex-President Saddam Hussein of Iraq , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is " the hunt " . We will not get on top of the crime situation without putting in place a dedicated , reliable , trustworthy and effective system of hunting the criminals . The young man whose photograph was shown with him holding an AK-74 rifle is at present fearless . However , should he become aware that there are professional law enforcement officers hunting him , we would be surprised to see how much a change there would be in him . <p> The hunt generates fear in the " baddest " gunmen . The hunt removes from the gunmen the sense of comfort and confidence that they will not be captured . We need a team from the army and the police who are highly trained , well-motivated , and properly equipped with both weapons , transportation and electronic monitoring devices to launch a hunt for all the arrogant and oppressive gunmen who believe that they can do anything , anywhere , anyhow , without any repercussion . <p> If we take a look at the experience of countries that had a difficulty with criminals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those countries never hesitated to embark upon the hunt . We will also note that the bravest of gunman is always brought to his trembling knees when he becomes aware that he is being effectively hunted . <p> Let us abandon the pretty speeches and the nice talk . These are not creating any sense of comfort to anyone . Let us , in fact , say no more for now , but let the result and the effect of the hunt speak for itself . It is the hunt , and nothing else that will bring a result now . <p> Finally , the hunted , that is to say , the gunmen , must be given the option of turning in themselves and subject themselves to the laws of the land . We should not , however , wait for them . Start the hunt ! <p> Linton P Gordon is an attorney-at-law .

Her mother stayed day and night in the trauma unit .

Once disturbed , those roots are of no value . You will need to encourage them into new growth by snipping them . <p> About your Cattleya ... did you get it as a baby plant ? You might want to move the plant to a slightly more filtered area . <p> Dear Orchid Doc : <p> I need to know why my orchids all die within a few weeks of purchasing . <p> I bring them home and put them inside , take good care of them , do as you say , water and feed them , but after a while the orchids start to look unhappy in the house , and in no time they are dropping leaves . <p> What am I doing wrong ? <p> Elenor <p> Dear Elenor : <p> First , let us examine your house . <p> Is it airy ?

@@15360238 <h> Columns <h> Trump ... the future of America <p> The American people have spoken and Donald John Trump is the president-elect of the United States . It is not the outcome that close to one-half the voting population desired , but it has satisfied the expectations of the other half . Perhaps the most defining emotion that characterises the Trump win is shock , even among those who voted for him . The shock continues to reverberate among Americans as can be seen in the protests that have erupted in American cities against the Trump victory . <p> The polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton in the lead , even when she suffered an almost fatal political blow from director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey 's revelation about a further probe into her e-mail . <p> Even if the Trump camp genuinely expected him to win , they could not have thought that he would have won to the extent he did . To be sure , it was a complete rout of the Clinton camp . Those who are protesting Trump as president must understand that , as hard as it is to stomach , he won fairly and squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he win the presidency , but his victory ensured that not only the White House , but the House of Representatives and the Senate remained in the control of the Republican Party . In a post-election speech , Paul Ryan , Republican Speaker of the House , praised him effusively for the political feat he had achieved , and pledged to work with him to carry out the mandate of the people . <p> What exactly is that mandate ? During the campaign , Trump himself made a number of incoherent and eclectic statements as to what he would do as soon as he took office . " From day one " , he trumpeted that the Affordable Care Act , infamously known as Obamacare , would be repealed and replaced by a dubious health care plan . A plan to rebuild America 's crumbling infrastructure is expected to be rolled out . Government regulations that have stymied production ought to be addressed , as well as the high taxation burden on corporations . <p> All executive orders issued by President Barack Obama , especially related to immigration , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to having them rolled back . The Iran nuclear deal would be scrapped . America 's relationship with the world would be reassessed , and its relationship with organisations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) would be given special attention . So too will be the climate protocols that America has entered into with the rest of the world . <p> No detailed discussion of any of these statements was given during the campaign or since . They were essentially offered as one-liners , and so no one knows for sure if Trump meant what he said , especially with respect to his signature issue of building a big , beautiful wall on the border and having Mexico pay for it . <p> Both the campaigns were taken up with personal attacks and trivia about the character of the individuals running for office . As a result , the American people were short-changed and are today not any more informed about what will happen now that Trump has won . <p> So uncertainty prevails , and the fear and anger that were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , people are fearful . They were fearful during the election when ' Trumpian ' bile was being spilled , and they are even more so now that he has won . <p> The vast majority of those who voted for Trump believed that they were losing or had lost their country . Not many doubted that the Trump slogan " make America great again " was more than a code for " make America white again " . The racist and nativist overtones of the Trump campaign were palpable . The white demographic came out in the vast numbers they did because many truly believed that the demographic character of America , or better yet , the " browning " of America was happening too fast and it had to be stopped . <p> There was definite grievance among the Trump voters that they were being left behind in an economy that was making more of them poorer . Many did not feel the recovery from the Great Recession inherited by the Obama Administration in 2008 . Many who had lost their jobs had now become unemployable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional jobs had disappeared . Those who remained employed did not see any rise in their wages . Many worked one pay cheque to the next without any real prospect of surviving financially if they should lose the job . A study indicated that as much as 65 per cent of Americans did not have the ability to meet an emergency situation that required over US$500 . <p> The middle class felt the brunt of the recovery process . While they sacrificed , they saw gains in the recovery going to the top one per cent of the population . This was aided and abetted by Federal Reserve policies of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy that left many retired savers in the lurch . Monies that were saved up over the years for the rainy day proved inadequate to meet the demands of people when the rains really came . It is a frightening prospect when you have become elderly and you have to be now feeding on the principal of the little nest egg that you would be relying on when you can no longer work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear turned to anger . It was anger at the loss of their self-worth caused by the indignity of not being able to provide for their families . Prolonged unemployment can have a crippling and deleterious effect on a personal psyche . It did not help that many had to take lower-paying or menial jobs just to survive . The reduction of the unemployment rate to 4.9 per cent masks the frustration of people with these jobs . <p> The anger was not only self-directed , but was directed at the Obama Administration which had come to represent the epitome of people 's discontent . Trump harnessed this discontent and rode on it to the presidency . Clinton failed to really understand how palpable this was , not only to the white underclass , but to the many blacks and disadvantaged groups who felt left behind . They saw her as part of the establishment , which was not complimentary . <p> Furthermore , her negative bona fides , paralleled by Trumps , fed into the narrative of a corrupt , entitled politician who would do nothing to shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the knight in shining armour who they hope will not become Don Quixote tilting at windmills . <p> So what future is there for America under a Trump presidency ? <p> This question will be answered more clearly in the days ahead . After his inauguration in January 2017 , the country and the world will begin to see the the direction in which he intends to take the country . Knowing Trump 's penchant for erratic behaviour , we may well begin to see some semblance of how he will behave in office before that time . <p> It goes without saying that the president of the United States has vast powers not enjoyed by any other mortal on planet Earth . He or she literally has the security of the world at his or her fingertips . But it must also be understood that America has resilient institutions , born of constitutional authority , that were designed to restrain a heartless president or one given to behaviour that will do harm to the American body politic . The founding fathers , in their wisdom , designed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should be governed . <p> This system works best by consensus and compromise . When such protocols are not observed , the result is gridlock and obstructionism of the kind that has been seen in Republican repudiation of the policies of Barack Obama . The net result is that the country has been hurt . For the better part of the Obama presidency hardly any legislation of worth has come out of what has been dubbed the " do nothing " Congress . For the last two years the country has simply limped along , and the president -- to preserve any modicum of legacy or respectability in office -- has had to resort to executive action , which has caused his opponents to cast him as an imperial president who does not observe the rule of law . <p> If Trump seeks to carry out even a smidgen of what he presented in the campaign against minority interests in the country he will stub his toe against the constitution .

@@15360239 <h> Columns <h> Coping ... a post-fact world : the irony of the ' information ' age <p> The world is still trying to come to terms with the shock defeat of Hillary Clinton in the race for the presidency of the United States of America against Republican nominee Donald J Trump . No one knows -- not even Trump -- what his plans are and what his presidency will be . The world has entered the deep unknown . <p> Hillary Clinton is , as many have agreed , the most qualified person to have run for the presidency in America . She was more qualified than Barack Obama -- to whom she lost in 2008 -- and infinitely more qualified than Trump , by whom she was beaten in what <p> CNN commentator and former advisor to President Obama , Van Jones described as a white-lash . <p> I do not pretend to be able to offer a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the results of the election . While acknowledging that many factors might explain what we have before us , there is one thing that stands out for me , and it is the triumph of non-fact and non-logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , rigour , and logic . <p> This triumph is , in my view , the biggest irony of the so-called information age . <p> The information age <p> One of the ' rules ' by which I tell students that my classes are governed is that they should ensure that they have devices that can connect them to the Internet during classes , and that they should keep those devices open and constantly fact-check any purported factual assertion I make . <p> I often describe the Internet as the eighth wonder of the world and encourage students to make use of its vast resources . But one of the keys to effective use of the Internet is critical thinking . This is the exercise of discretion , analysis , cross-referencing interpretation , search for evidence , and logical questioning of whatever is presented . <p> It is in respect of the failure to exercise critical thinking that the miracle of the information age could turn out to be a curse on our generation . <p> Emotion over evidence <p> Data analytics report on Internet traffic found that millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brexit , to sites which provided definitions of the words " European Union " . This suggested that millions of those who voted in support of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union had little or no information about the issues on which they were voting . <p> I followed the US elections closely from the day of Trump 's announcement and what may be the sign of the future with his ride down the escalator of Trump Tower . One of the things that never ceased to amaze me -- though I remained hooked to the darn thing -- was the manner in which Trump was able to use his non-preparedness , his lack of grasp of the facts , his appeal to shallow emotions , his twists and turns around the issues , and ' defeat ' his primary and general election opponents . <p> I recall the Republican primary debate in Florida when , in response to the question of the future of Medicaid and social security , after Marco Rubio had given an analytical response pointing to the need for a plan to rescue social security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply , " I would not touch social security . " <p> He won the Florida primary handsomely . <p> This was only one example of how Trump used emotion or a virtual non-answer to get around being accountable . During the campaign he would sometimes enunciate three different positions in a single day on the same issue . <p> Who could forget , as well , his repeated answer " I am building a wall , he 's a Mexican " to the question of why he thought the Indiana judge of Mexican heritage could not be objective in hearing a case brought against him ? The list of illogical statements made by Trump , which would force other candidates to withdraw from the race , is endless . But the fact that he won is , in my view , testimony to what may be described as the comfort of many to embrace a post-fact existence in which emotion trumps evidence , and symbolism displaces substance . <p> So Clinton won all three debates on substance , not style , and earned high marks for decorum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and articulated a clear path to doing the things she proposed . Trump , on the other hand , offered little by way of policy positions , was largely incoherent and , in terms of his demeanour , was very sloppy . Clinton was organised , prepared , and thorough -- both for and in the debates , and in the field . Trump , by contrast , was not as well organised and was largely ill-prepared for the debates . <p> The explanation for this rests , I submit , at least to some degree , in the comfort that many have with living in a post-fact world where evidence , logic , and rigour matter little . <p> Sound bites , not sound reasoning <p> We had a similar situation here in Jamaica earlier this year when the JLP promised the $1.5-million tax break and offered very little , if any , credible evidence of how it would be funded . A number of different funding plans were advanced ; none of which were found credible when analysed objectively . The parameters of the policy proposal were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the proposal still had some weaknesses , he said , at a meeting in Half-Way-Tree , " We know that there are some anomalies , but when we get into office we will fix them . " Yet , for all that this policy proposal portended for the economy , the party won power . We are yet to feel the full effects of this policy as a further $18 billion will have to be found to fund it next year . <p> Perhaps post-fact attitudes -- that is to say lack of interest in specifics , evidence , and logic -- to politics are not new , but to the extent that this is the case today represents the irony of this so-called " information " age . That we have information at our fingertips and can google anything , and verify just about any claim , but yet seem content to accept things at face value is a stinging indictment , in my view , on the general mindset of our generation . <p> In the 1960s through to the 1990s , when access to information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world bamboozled their populations . But that this is happening in 2016 is very distressing . <p> Someone has suggested that in contemporary society there has emerged an appetite not only for fast food , but fast info . And <p> Twitter , with its 140-character limit , has become the preferred outlet for many in this generation , not only millennials . So where Trump outdid Hillary , as where Andrew outdid Portia and the People 's National Party , was through the use of social media , in particular <p> Twitter . <p> Given what we have seen in terms of <p> Twitter content , it is clear that acquiring followers on social media does not require that you post substance .

@@15360240 <h> Columns <h> In ... crowded field for Trump 's attention , the Caribbean must get into the game <p> In the aftermath of Donald Trump 's election as president of the United States of America , there is genuine concern about what his presidency will mean for the Caribbean . So far , there have been expressions of both optimism and pessimism emanating from the region . Government officials have been guarded in their comments , recognising that they will have to deal with the Trump Administration come January . Academics and former politicians have been less careful , voicing considerable fears and bemoaning the consequences of many of the policies that he said he would institute . The single thread running through the Caribbean responses is uncertainty . <p> Uncertainty is a game stopper . It causes governments and businesses to pause ; to adopt a position of wait and see . No one takes bold steps , lest they backfire . At the same time , no one rocks the boat . <p> But , this can not be a time for pause by the Caribbean . <p> Unlike any other Administration in the past , nothing is predictable about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign he clawed back from some of the strident positions he took , and he insisted that he would definitely implement others . However , as people in every Caribbean country know well , statements , pledges , promises , and threats made in election campaigns are often abandoned by politicians once the reality of office and its constraints crowd in on them . Talk is cheap until the reckoning comes , when actual factors have to be taken into account , such as costs , the rule of law , treaty and contractual obligations , and public opinion . <p> There are a few certainties in the present situation . One of them is that , while Trump won the presidency on the basis of the number of states he carried , he did not win the vote of the majority of American voters . Therefore , if he truly wants to lead a united America at home and abroad , he will have to listen to the voices that shouted out visions , ambitions and aspirations that were very different from his . To try to ride roughshod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government holds sway over everything , including the media . The American republic will not stomach autocracy easily , if at all . There are enough independent media , think-tanks , foundations , institutes , and associations dedicated to free thought , free speech and open criticism to keep any US Administration on its toes , even if , as in this case , one political party controls both the executive and legislative branches of government . <p> Caribbean governments are right to express the view that they will work with Trump 's Administration . It would be impractical , if not foolhardy , to adopt any other position . Donald Trump has been elected president in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American system . He is the president-elect , and he will begin his four-year period of government in January . What is important is for Caribbean governments to try to influence the Trump Administration to pursue policies in which there is , at the very least , mutual benefit . <p> That work starts with the group of Caribbean ambassadors in Washington , DC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appoint to his Cabinet , and their staff members , to identify the areas of mutual interest and concern ; they also have to begin to educate them about the many challenges that the Caribbean faces , especially those that are caused by US government action . <p> Further , Caribbean ministers have to seek every opportunity to connect with US Cabinet members as part of the early education process about the Caribbean which , after all , lies in such close proximity to the US mainland , and with Caribbean territories as its soft underbelly . <p> The field will be crowded . Every ambassador in Washington , DC , every head of government , and every minister of every country will be seeking to do the same . Constrained by small embassies and limited budgets , Caribbean countries will find the competition for the Trump Administration 's attention to be daunting . But too much is at stake to hold back from the critical and crucial work that has to be done . <p> One of the biggest challenges that faces the Caribbean , and one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on climate change -- which he believes to be a myth . Caribbean countries , subject year after year to frequent and intense natural disasters , know well that , far from being a myth , climate change and its concomitant sea level rise are facts that have already set back their economies and are now eroding their coastal areas and land mass . If in three years ' time the Trump Administration does withdraw the US from the agreement of the Conference of the Parties ( COP ) on Climate Change , it will start a chain reaction with grave consequences for the survival of the region . For , if the US pulls out of the COP agreement , two other great polluters -- China and India -- will do the same , on the basis that if the US is continuing to industrialise , despite pollution , why should n't they . Other countries would follow the pattern ; the COP agreement would unravel and the small island states and countries with low-lying coasts in the Caribbean and the Pacific will be the victims . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US-Caribbean relationship that did not start with Trump . They include ' de-risking ' and the withdrawal by US banks of correspondent relations with Caribbean banks -- a situation that is a dagger at the heart of the region 's capacity to participate in the global finance and trading system . Starting a conversation with members of the Trump Administration is essential to get the Caribbean 's concerns across . <p> The US has chosen its president and its congressional representatives in accordance with its constitution and its laws . That deal is done . This is not a time for hand wringing and lamentation ; it is a time for engagement , persuasion and negotiation in the region 's interest . <p> Sir Ronald Sanders is Antigua and Barbuda 's ambassador to the US and Organisation of American States ; an international affairs consultant ; as well as senior fellow at Massey College , University of Toronto , and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies , University of London .

@@15395234 <h> ' Kill the ... ! ' - Youth parliamentarians call for action to end division in education <p> Youth leader Keadar Sharpe has used the convening of the National Youth Parliament for the first time in seven years to demand that the Government provide structured psychosocial care to children in schools to curb crime and violence . <p> " This noble House must move urgently to implement a comprehensive integrated system of psychosocial care without any delay , " the Young Philosophers representative told 73 other youth from diverse areas of national life yesterday . They were debating a motion for the provision of psychosocial care to children . " The lack of care has caused this country to earn herself a dragon but let us kill that ugly dragon called crime and violence . " <p> According to him , the nation " is under siege and lacks the necessary care to upset the current state of affairs " and which , he said , is being fuelled by an education system built on division . <p> " This dragon feeds on the divide , " the leader said , pointing to issues surrounding non-traditional and traditional schools .

@@15395235 protect musical heritage <p> Yet another call has come for Jamaicans to preserve and protect the work of our musical composers . <p> Musician , educator and executive director of the Music Unites Jamaica Foundation Rosina Moder notes if something is not done soon , Jamaicans run the risk of losing out on a huge part of their musical heritage , or have it misrepresented due to a lack of proper evidence . <p> " That is why we need a building to house a National Music Archive . Without a building , we can not do the proper research , preservation , and presentation of the works of our musical masters and , as a result , we are losing so much of this history . I give you a story . Lloyd Hall was one of Jamaica 's great composers and when he died his family said he had so many boxes of music and papers .

Organist Paul Bicknell gave further insights into this work by Felsted with the tender Third Voluntary for organ .

Shaw-Naar gave up his place behind the piano , lending his counter tenor to Parakeet in the Garden . Moder on recorder interpreted Elena and the Pimento String Players engaged the audience with a medley of folk standards which included <p> Bellamy , on violin , would form part of the Samuel Felsted Chamber Orchestra to present her work Coconut Woman -- another medley of popular traditional folk tunes . <p> Whylie 's foray into religious music was on show on Sunday .

@@15897237 <h> Editorial Peter Bunting ... mixed message <p> Peter Bunting 's decision to abandon his quest for the presidency of the People 's National Party ( PNP ) and his statement of explanation thereof accomplished two things . One is unquestionably good for the party . The other raises questions about the way the PNP goes about its business and whether , in the long run , the party is well served by this process . <p> Barring a stunning late development , Peter Phillips will be crowned as the next leader of the PNP sometime after Portia Simpson Miller declares her formal timetable for ending her decade-old stint as head of the party , having a week ago announced that she will not seek re-election at the end of her current mandate in September . The broad expectation is that the transition will happen by February . <p> In the aftermath of the PNP 's general election defeat , and in the midst of calls for renewal in the party , Mr Bunting , the security minister in the previous administration , signalled his intention to challenge Mrs Simpson Miller for leadership . He , however , retreated on the grounds of pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her own timetable for departure . <p> When the PNP president disclosed her plans , Mr Bunting threw his hat into the ring .

Unexpectedly , however , Mr Bunting withdrew from the race . <p> Here is the good thing about that . The party 's defeat in the general election , and subsequently in the municipal polls , though narrow , exposed deep schisms in the PNP , having to do , in part , with concerns over the quality of Mrs Simpson Miller 's leadership and perceptions that it had lost its ideological moorings ; it no longer knew what it stood for . <p> An open contest for the leadership would likely have exacerbated the divisions within the party , demanding a prolonged period of healing .

@@15897238 A Go Happen <p> With Christmas fast approaching , people are looking for gift ideas , so I thought I would make a couple of suggestions . Books are an endangered species nowadays , but here are two that offer great value for money . Serious Tings A Go Happen is film producer Maxine Walters ' present to the Universe , in the form of a colourfully reproduced selection of the best samples from her 4,000-strong collection of Jamaican street signs and dancehall posters . <p> Dating from the early 1980s , the Walters collection is essentially a valuable record of vernacular graphic design in Jamaica . This sumptuous coffee-table book is a paean to Jamaica 's vibrant popular culture , scorned by the elite here , but valued by the hoi polloi , a Greek , not Latin , term ( meaning the masses or commoners ) , as I said in my last column . <p> With titles such as ' Ants inna yu milk ' , ' Di bees pitch pon wi ' , ' Nuff niceness ' and other such choice phrases , the signs encapsulate the inimitable humour and lingo of the streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-of-a-kind , hand-painted posters advertise local parties , concerts , ' bashments ' held at bars , on beaches and in primary schools . For those who frequented these events , the signs evoke fond memories of their youth and bygone days . <p> Walters can get rhapsodic on the subject , summing up the intrinsic value of her collection : " Our language and the way we describe things vocally is so picturesque , and one of the best ways I 've seen that translated is in these street signs . They are beautiful and simple . Some are hysterical , and others are really serious . They are signs , and , to me , they are also a science of communication , which is completely unique and organic . " <p> Adding value to the signs , Serious Tings A Go Happen features essays and interviews with an array of well-known writers , musicians and designers . The introduction , for example , is by none other than Marlon James , winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize and a graphic designer himself in a previous life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . Other essayists include Carolyn Cooper , Wayne Chen , Anthony Winkler and Vivien Goldman , who also interviews Walters . I particularly enjoyed Mikie Bennett 's interview with Rory Stone Love and look forward to reading Maxine Walters ' interview with sign painter Denva Harris . <h> WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT <p> Serious Tings is being launched in Kingston on December 15 at Red Bones Caf ? . All proceeds go to the Consie Walters Cancer Care Hospice at St Joseph 's Hospital in Kingston , so this is definitely a book worth investing in . <p> The other book I want to recommend is Judy Ann MacMillan 's catalogue Still Painting ... After All These Years , consisting of 80 full-colour reproductions , with two essays , one by the artist , and another by internationally acclaimed art critic Edward Lucie Smith . The catalogue features a chronology of MacMillan 's work with a recent self-portrait on the front cover and one of herself as a teenager on the back cover . <p> MacMillan 's work is far removed from the street signs mentioned earlier in that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying with classical painter Barry Watson in Jamaica . MacMillan paints from life , the scenery and people in front of her , setting her easel up in the middle of Cross Roads to paint a ' madwoman ' on the street or balancing it in a boat on the sea so she can catch the full frontal view of a grand house . She would n't be caught dead painting from photographs , and her finely wrought canvases capture local landscape and colour consummately . The painstaking nature of her work is captured in the following passages from her blog , Welcome to my Jamaica : <p> " It was of symbolic importance to paint today and the quality of the light , that November light , Albert Huie called it ' the beautiful month ' was too precious to miss , so I quickly cleaned up my paint box , did a quick check that everything was in it , and put it in the car . If you glanced into that falling-apart cardboard tray piled with rubbish , you would not be impressed , but everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas on to the easel , the rusty razor blade for scraping , or the small bit of plastic ruler for doing straight lines quickly , is essential .

" <p> " Driving up the familiar road I passed by many motifs of past paintings stretching back to my teenage years ; that mango tree , that clump of bamboo , that deep corner were actually lifelong acquaintances and seeing them again has always had the same effect , the comfort of well-known faces ageing before my gaze . But today , the ordinary seemed significant , more intense , almost charged . Was it the light ? No , it was more than that . " <p> Judy Ann MacMillan 's catalogue , Still Painting , can be ordered directly from the artist ( check her on Facebook ) and is a bargain at J$3,000 . <p> - Annie Paul is a writer and critic based at the University of the West Indies and author of the blog , Active Voice ( anniepaul.net ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

All because of the harrowing experience of being intimidated and exploited as a child by adult men to whom she looked for guidance and mentorship . <p> And how many women do you know who will confess that they see sex as something to be endured , not enjoyed , simply because they see the act as a violation of their body ?

I 've asked a few women in the past , how can something have had such a damaging impact on your life and yet you believe it was a figment of your imagination ? I 've also asked them to explain how they could believe that the evil visited upon them was caused by something that they , as mere children , did . <p> The fact that so many women shared these same perspectives about the molestation they suffered has convinced me that I do n't need to understand it for it to be true .

I desperately want to protect her from the predators who may lurk in the classroom , at swimming class , at ballet , at gymnastics , or even the sick freaks who are themselves parents of children with whom she may be friendly . <p> There are so many men speaking to us from the platform of radio , television and newspaper , the pulpit , lecture theatre and political soapbox who have committed unspeakable crimes against our young girls and young women .
