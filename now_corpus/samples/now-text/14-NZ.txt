John Gibb finds out about Beaumont 's changing fortunes . <p> Once a fading rural backwater , the township of Beaumont now seems destined for a much brighter future . <p> People who have lived near the inland Otago township , on the Clutha River/Mata-au , for 20 years or more will remember earlier sometimes divisive and frustrating conflicts over proposed big hydro-electric dams , which would have flooded the area . <p> One proposal , by the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand ( ECNZ ) in 1992 , was to build a dam at Tuapeka Mouth that would have flooded 3000ha , including all of Beaumont . But among a series of more promising developments the long-delayed replacement work involving the nearby 19th century Beaumont Bridge is at last due to start next year . <p> This is one of the oldest bridges in the country still operating on a major state highway . <p> And more walkers and cyclists are already starting to move through the township since the 73km-long Clutha Gold Trail- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened by Prime Minister John Key on October 24 . Long-time resident , historian and writer Bill Dacker ( 61 ) is well aware of the area 's previously somewhat mixed fortunes . <p> ' ' It was a little backwater that we enjoyed as a backwater , ' ' he recalls . <p> But then a series of dam proposals came along and changed everything , he said . <p> Some locals , including some facing tough economic times , had agreed to sell their land . <p> Others , including the ' ' Hands Off Beaumont ' ' lobbyists , were determined to resist and to safeguard all they found precious in the area , including its rich history and its attractive and distinctive environment . <p> Mr Dacker highlights the significance of the bridge replacement work . <p> The current bridge had been around since 1887 and had struggled to cope with some of the ' ' huge trucks ' ' now passing through . <p> Mr Dacker , who is a long-standing member of the Clutha Gold Trail Trust Board , says the newly opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaumont , which will boost the local economy by bringing in more visitors and potential new residents . Strengthening Beaumont was also important strategically , because it gave the area a better chance of influencing its own destiny in future , he said . <p> ' ' Unless we 're going to make the place strong in a different way , other people are still going to see it as a backwater , ' ' he says . <p> Dave Crawford is an experienced jet boater and co-owner-operator of Beaumont Jet , with his wife Ali , And he is also a Gold Trail board member . <p> It was ' ' great ' ' to see the cyclists already starting to flow along the track , through Beaumont . <p> ' ' It can only be good for this area , ' ' he says . <p> When he and his wife moved to Beaumont and began jet boat operations in 2004 , he had long known the area had strong potential . <p> The nearby Clutha River/Mata-au is ' ' probably the best part of the Clutha River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river were also as good as ' ' anything in New Zealand ' ' and offered plenty of variety , including ' ' huge rapids ' ' and other ecologically appealing areas . <p> And he is not content with Beaumont being one of the region 's and New Zealand 's best-kept secrets . <p> ' ' The more people the better . ' ' <p> Mr Dacker , who these days divides his time between Beaumont and Port Chalmers , has lived in Beaumont for much of his life , having grown up there . <p> His father , Harry Dacker , had initially found work there as a rabbiter in the 1920s . <p> Bill Dacker said the idea of building a ' ' cycle-cum-walking trail through the district , along the river and through the farmland to Lawrence , was a direct response - a way of creating economic opportunity by bringing people into this area as well as the other areas connected by the trail ' ' . <p> The idea had come from the trust 's Roxburgh-based chairman , Rod Peirce , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections in Beaumont as well as to the other communities along the trail . ' ' <p> The lessees of the Beaumont Hotel had also contributed to the upturn in Beaumont 's fortunes by continuing to develop and support ' ' events tailored to hunters and fishermen while adding cyclists to those they wish to give hospitality to ' ' . <p> And the pub also served ' ' the best blue cod meals this side of Iceland ' ' , Mr Dacker said . <p> Widespread support from the Beaumont community for the trust , as well as backing from ' ' other communities connected by the trail ' ' , had been key to the success of the trail development . <p> This sense of unity and support stood in ' ' stark contrast to divisions in the communities ' ' sparked by the ECNZ dam proposal in 1992 , and was ' ' a wonderful thing to experience ' ' . <p> Alison Mills , who leases the hotel with her husband , Gunni Egilsson , is also optimistic about the future , and says patrons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were using the hotel and nearby camping ground . <p> Mr Dacker noted there had been some ' ' recent controversy ' ' over suggestions of fees for using the trail . <p> He emphasised there was no official fee for using it , ' ' but the trust asks for a koha donation , a contribution for its maintenance from its users as at the moment the trust is solely responsible for costs of its maintenance ' ' . <p> Mr Peirce ( 76 ) said there were early signs that the new trail would prove positive , and help revive smaller communities such as Beaumont and Millers Flat . <p> ' ' It 's very satisfying . There 's a general air of enthusiasm . ' ' <p> Mr Peirce , who was also once chairman of the Friends of Beaumont group , had opposed various proposals to establish big new dams nearby . <p> And he is positive about the new trail 's benefits . <p> ' ' I thought , if there 's any legacy I can leave , it may well be more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an activist against everything . <p> ' ' I 'd like to be seen as someone who left something for the benefit of the community .

' ' <p> And $3.8 million from the Government 's New Zealand Cycle Trail project funding had been used to support the trail 's development . Through the years Mr Peirce has noticed rural decline , including loss of population and services , in some of the smaller communities . <p> ' ' It 's very positive . I think that the smaller villages will definitely gain a tremendous amount over the next several years and into the future from the trail . ' ' <p> And Beaumont was already looking up .

And the area was ' ' one of the major entrance and exit points ' ' for the Clutha Gold Trail walkway . <p> The Clutha River/Mata-au is one of the outstanding natural features of the newly opened trail , which follows the river ' ' on its journey across the river flats below Roxburgh , through the Beaumont Gorge , before it turns toward Lawrence at Beaumont ' ' , Mr Dacker says . The river crosses the Beaumont Flat and then passes through the Rongahere Gorge , the ' ' last major river flat and gorge respectively of the schist peneplain or block mountain system of the Central Otago highlands ' ' . <p> Beaumont was a true border between very different geographical zones . <p> ' ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like that of coastal Otago than Central Otago . <p> ' ' On the Beaumont Gorge side the climate is hotter and drier , marking the beginning of Central Otago proper .

The natural vegetation of the nearby gorges reflected the ' ' borderland ' ' characteristics . <p> The dominant tree on Upper Birch Island - also known locally as Native Island - in the Beaumont Gorge is mountain beech , indicating the drier and hotter conditions there . The far larger Birch Island , or Moanui , in the Rongahere Gorge below Beaumont , and the bush of the gorge itself , has a covering of a mixed podocarp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as totara and matai . <p> ' ' Both the gorge and the island are home to rare and nearly extinct insect species , protected on the island from rat predation by the swift waters of the river , ' ' Mr Dacker says . <p> ' ' Beaumont 's fortunes have fluctuated over the years according to major changes in the economic , gold-mining and agricultural history of the province . ' ' <p> First the search for gold , then the arrival of the railways and the rise of horticulture on the river flats of Central Otago followed by the development of exotic forest plantations in the Blue Mountains all contributed to its growth . <p> But , subsequently , the closure of the railway branch line , the decline in gold extraction , the rise of large land holdings , changes in the horticultural sector , and finally the closure of the Beaumont Forest headquarters had also contributed to the community shrinking . <p> Closures of the railway , shops , the race track , churches and the school had all followed ' ' but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , including some who had left , showed ' ' a remarkable dedication to the area ' ' , Mr Dacker said . <p> And he emphasises that , for the first time in 40 years , there were ' ' signs of growth at Beaumont again ' ' . <p> Margaret Healy , who helped organise a series of ' ' Back to Beaumont ' ' days , held over the years , has always been optimistic about the township 's future . <p> ' ' The aim is to get people and their families to come back to their grassroots , reminisce and enjoy Beaumont , ' ' she said . <p> It was a great place to raise a family and she was keen for Beaumont to become a ' ' thriving community ' ' again . <p> Beaumont * Beaumont is a township on State Highway 87 , at a crossing of the Clutha Mata-Au River , close to Central Otago , between Balclutha and Roxburgh , and is 6km southeast from Raes Junction . <p> * The township is one of the main entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Lawrence and Roxburgh . <p> * The gold trail 's development was backed by $3.8 million in New Zealand Cycle Trail project funding and was opened by Prime Minister John Key in October . <p> * The trail includes parts of an old Maori trail , sections of the former railway line route , and parts of a former road . <p> * An earlier proposal in 1992 by ECNZ was to build a dam at Tuapeka Mouth that would have flooded several thousand hectares , including all of Beaumont .

@@2320236 <p> I believe that you should be rewarded for hard work ; if you work for an hour you should be better off than someone that has n't , even if it is by a small margin . <p> But did you know that tens of thousands of New Zealand families are currently affected by a Government policy that not only does n't make them better off by working but actually penalises them by hundreds of dollars ? <p> As a result many families are doing the sums and working out that a week 's work will leave them in the red . That does n't sound right , but it is . <p> The policy I 'm referring to is the childcare subsidy , which , when looked at in combination with taxes and working for families subsidies , means that it is difficult for a couple with more than one young child to get ahead - if they both want to work . <p> A family with two adults and two children under 3 on a single average wage of $840 a week will get up to $1038 a week in the hand . <p> But if they have two full-time incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1600 a week , they can expect to net about $1031 a week - less than a family working half the hours and a whopping $321 less than a family earning $1379 , who would qualify for the full subsidy rate of $3.93 per hour and would net up to $1352 a week . <p> These differences have arisen chiefly from the rate at which the childcare subsidies abate ; but they are made worse by the concurrent abatement of working for families , in-work tax credit and the accommodation supplement . <p> What I have n't factored into these numbers are the extra charges paid to childcare providers which in general range from $100-$300 for two children in full-time care . <p> These charges effectively mean a family would be better off on a benefit than working two full-time jobs . To me this disincentive to work seems unfair . <p> To change the current system to fund childcare for a wider bracket would benefit everyone . <p> New Zealand currently ranks a low 22nd in the OECD for workplace participation by women in their prime childbearing years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in the workforce . <p> Giving these women the option of continuing their careers through their children 's early years would increase New Zealand 's GDP , give more children access to high quality early childhood education and make sure that women are n't disadvantaged because of a long break from the workforce . <p> When thinking about how this can be fixed it pays to remember that for every hour that is funded by the Government they receive back tax and working for families entitlements from not only the parent but from the person employed to care for them . <p> Increasing the availability of the childcare subsidy is effectively a money-back guarantee with the education of our young being the icing on top . <p> When I brought this issue up with my local MP he sent this information to Hekia Parata , who I hope is working out a solution ; but the people affected by these policies need to raise their voices . <p> Given that the median household income for a two adult , two dependents family is $1587 per week from all sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be directly affected . <p> If you are one of those families , or you know one of those families , then raise your voice .

That way customers could own a practical MG while living in the glow of its sports car and racing success . <p> MG continues to be known as sports-car maker , mostly from that heritage , and new owners , SAIC , or Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation , a Chinese state-owned company , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> To build the base of the pyramid on which those cars will have to sit , SAIC/MG needs to grow sales of its bread and butter cars , and so far it has launched the MG6 mid-sizer , and is working on exporting its MG5 model which slots , as its name suggests , between the MG6 and the MG3 , trialled on these pages . <p> A compact SUV version of the MG3 has been signed-off and will reach the Chinese market later this year . <p> Unlike the British market , whose hunger for modern MGs is sustained by parts supplied from China being put together and painted on MG 's native soil in Longbridge , all New Zealand 's MGs are coming from China . <p> That should dismay no-one , as SAIC makes a large number of brands : as well as the MG and Reowe ( it 's not allowed to use ' Rover ' ) it manufactures the Maxus and Yuejin Chinese brands , along with its joint venture cars for Baojun , Buick , Chevrolet , Iveco , Skoda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that while MG is very much in thrall of the benevolence , not to mention the sheer fiscal muscle of SAIC , the company has a modern research and development centre in the UK which has more than 300 engineers and 50 designers . The SAIC Technical Centre , is responsible for the development and design engineering of MG cars worldwide , and also has a role in the development of Roewe products . <p> Which is possibly why the MG3 looks and feels so right . <p> The chiselled wedge-profiled shape even has details along its rear panels that reflect the angles of the famous octagon badge , though the designers are to be congratulated for not slavishly putting that shape all over the car . <p> From the rear , the MG shows its distictive ' hip ' which is formed from the swage that runs from the headlights and back to the hatch opening . <p> Inside , the car is belted for five and I could sit in the rear quite easily . <p> Up front , the two seats are well-shaped and big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four-ways for the front passenger , though I did find I had to adjust the driving position minutely to get the clutch take-up point right . No big deal . <p> While the dash plastic is a little hard , that 's about all that can be said to be a tad below par in the MG 's cabin . <p> Two simple round-ended panels deal with entertainment , connectivity and air conditioning and you wo n't need much time to fathom it all , while at the top of the centre console , a stowage panel opens to expose charging for phones and other devices and a smartphone dock . <p> The steering wheel takes care of many hands-on tasks with phone and stereo buttons , and with a leather skin , it looks and feels very classy . <p> Leather also features on the seats of the New Zealand MG3 , which only comes as the single top-spec ' Style ' model , which means its air con is of the climate control variety and it fronts-up with cruise control as standard . Try finding that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never mind one priced at under $20k . <p> I was n't expecting much boot volume in what is a fairly truncated design , but the car passed the Border Terrier dog test with flying colours , with the ability to take 256 litres of kit with the seats up and 546 litres to the windowline when they 're folded . <p> Possibly the most disappointing part of the MG3 is the absence of an automatic - a must in New Zealand , which has a vast majority automatic take- up even in this size segment . However , I 'm told that by year 's end we should have automatics for both the MG3 and MG6 , the lack of it in the otherwise very worthy latter car has been a stumbling block in terms of sales . <p> You could call the MG3 the kindred spirit of the MG 1100/1300 from the sixties . They 're roughly the same size , accomodate four or five better than most else in their class and they 're definitely sporty . In their day , that is . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1300 took more than 17 seconds to get to 100kmh , something the 300kg heavier MG3 does in about ten seconds - quicker than a four- cylinder MGB , I might add . <p> The new car will go on to 170kmh plus , which of course is irrelevant , but it does mean that at 100kmh it has plenty in reserve , with about 2850rpm on the clock and a pleasing lack of engine , road and wind noise at that velocity . <p> The engine is rated at 80kW and the chassis can handle that kind of power with ease . There 's standard stability control in the car , but you 're unlikely to trouble it unless you 're really stupid , as there 's simply not enough oomph to get ragged when cornering , though for all that , the car is pleasingly flexible and never short of torque in day- to-day running . <p> While the engine will rev to 6000rpm plus if you really want it to , it does get a little thrashy at those revolutions , and with the well-sorted chassis offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbocharged version of the car would be teriffic . <p> Ride quality is good too , and appears not to be affected by the car 's sporty rims , and those that travelled with me in the car remarked that they did n't have to wince over some road surfaces as they 'd become used to doing in their own cars . <p> For $19,990 , the MG3 offers incomparable value in this busy , well-stocked segment . Some punters might ignore the brand 's heritage and remark that it 's something of an unknown quantity these days . <p> I hope not too many do this , as the wee MG is a lot of car for the cash , and has great character . Handled well by its distributors , it could open the taps that could turn into the decent flow of sales the brand deserves .

@@2613239 <p> From a strategic perspective , the Amarok ute is a vital member of the Volkswagen fleet in New Zealand . <p> The German carmaker has a formidable reputation for the hatchbacks , sedans and wagons it has always built , and the commercial sector also holds the company in high regard for its vans . <p> But it 's only been in relatively recent times that Volkswagen has been a player in the ute segment . It was in early 2010 that the Amarok had its world launch in Argentina - the only country where it was built at that time - and it arrived in this country a year later . <p> Since then the Volkswagen has been chipping away at the dominance of such ute product as Toyota Hilux , Ford Ranger , Nissan Navara , Holden Colorado and Mazda BT-50 - a big task , considering that it was only four years ago that the words Volkswagen and ute did n't belong in the same sentence . <p> But now they most definitely do . There are a growing number of customers who appreciate the Amarok for being possibly the most car-like of the current ute selection . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't carry the traditional 4WD transfer case and reduction gearing , but it does have a lovely 2.0-litre turbodiesel matched an an eight-speed automatic , and on-seal drive characteristics that really are comfortable . As a result you could almost call this ute urbane . <p> The Amarok is due for a major facelift in 2016 , and as the countdown begins for that event Volkswagen has begun rolling out a series of special editions designed to maintain sales of the ute in the meantime . <p> The first arrived last week . Called Canyon and sourced from a second Amarok assembly plant in the German city of Hanover , it features such extras as factory-fitted running boards and unique leather upholstery , and it enters the market priced at just under $70,000 . An initial shipment of 60 of these utes has been secured , and a second shipment is being negotiated for later this year or early next year . <p> Next year another special edition Amarok , called Ultimate , will arrive . The intention behind this model will be to make the ute even more car-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more safety equipment . No prices are yet known . <p> Meanwhile , the Amaroks already on sale in New Zealand have been undergoing various running changes . It all started with the installation of the eight-speed auto at the beginning of last year , and it has continued via such improvements as additional sound deadening , improved audio , installation of automatic wipers and lights , and fitment of park distance control on the high-end models . <p> All of that combines to help ensure the Amarok remains a refined and desirable ute . <p> At the top end of the regular Amarok selection is the Highline , an AWD model powered by a 2.0-litre twin-turbocharged diesel engine that provides 132 kilowatts of power and 420 newton metres of torque . It 's available with a choice of six-speed manual and selectable 4Motion high/low all-wheel drive , or eight-speed auto with permanent 4Motion . <p> We 've been driving the $65,990 auto , which features a transmission taken straight out of the A8 luxury sedan . For the ute <p> operation first gear is configured for low-speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended as a fuel-saving overdrive gear that operates at reduced engine speed . This means that all the hard work is done up to seventh gear - and the transmission then pops into eighth for lazy , long-legged motoring . <p> At 100kmh along the highway in eighth , it feels as if the engine is barely ticking over , and the high level of interior specification and sound deadening add to the relaxed experience . That is despite the fact the Amarok has a ladder frame chassis and a suspension system that includes heavy-duty leaf springs at the rear , which can often mean a lumpy sort of ride . But this ute rides so well , even when empty , you 'd think it has independent rear suspension . <p> Being an automatic means there are no reduction gears , but this has saved weight . And anyway , the combination of the low first gear , permanent 4WD and various electronic aids including a lockable Torsen diff and hill-hold mean the Amarok can take on some quite heavy work . The Highline level of specification means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 17-inch alloys with flared wheel arches . On the inside , there 's a lovely leather-covered steering wheel with multi- function controls , and the ute has full Bluetooth connectivity . <p> Upholstery is a robust material called Endless , and the rear bench seat is interesting because it is what VW calls cinema style in that it is elevated higher than the front seats for better visibility . They also split and fold to provide extra storage space if required . <p> And talking about storage , our test vehicle was fitted with an optional spring-operated and lockable lid made of high-density plastic durable enough to protect any cargo in the rear tray from theft or the weather . <p> There 's also a high level of safety equipment , and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it now includes a front and rear park distance control system that is illustrated on an LCD screen on the dash area . <p> Overall , everything aboard the Amarok looks sufficient to carry the ute through to the scheduled 2016 facelift , with the vehicle 's appeal bolstered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are now starting to arrive . <p> And with that facelifted Amarok not too far away , a question that is beginning to be asked is whether the new model range will feature versions powered by a V6 petrol engine . <p> The answer is probably not . Instead it seems likely that the ute will remain exclusively turbocharged diesel , but will benefit from Volkswagen 's continuing effort to extract more power and torque out of engines with less cubic capacity . <p> At present this all revolves around that lovely 2.0-litre twin-turbocharged diesel that is efficient enough to offer a very good 400 newton metres of torque . It 'll be interesting to see if VW can do even better than that with the facelifted version .

And when it 's the Challenger of Record that that makes an exit the alarm bells really start to ring . In their position as chief negotiators on behalf of the other challengers , if this team of all teams sees a reason not to continue , shockwaves are bound to spread through the broader Cup camp . <p> Add to this the fact that the team 's key player and former Cup regatta director CEO Iain Murray , who is also a previous competitor , is someone who knows the modern Cup and its characters inside out and you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes . I for one saw Murray 's appointment as a big advantage when it came to negotiating the balance of power between the Defender and Challengers -- a means of providing stability to a notoriously volatile event . <p> So given this , and that the Australians are out at such an early stage , there is little surprise that speculation has been rife since the announcement over the weekend . <p> So why has Team Australia pulled out ? <p> " The challenge was initiated with a view to negotiating a format for the 35th America 's Cup that was affordable and put the emphasis back on sailing skills , " said team owner Bob Oatley as he explained the reasons behind the decision . <p> " Ultimately , our estimate of the costs of competing were well beyond our initial expectation and our ability to make the formula of our investment and other commercial support add up . <p> " We are bitterly disappointed that this emerging team of fine young Australian sailors will not be able to compete at the next America 's Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <p> His comments confirm the recent chatter that in being first out of the blocks to challenge for the Cup they had underestimated the true costs and over estimated the possible revenues that might be generated . <p> Murray believes that the timeline is also an issue according to an interview with Sail-World . <p> " The timeline is the killer in this Cup , " he was quoted as saying . " Sponsors want to know where the venues are , and the dates . The gap gets pretty wide trying to get the sponsors to commit against the timeline of the expenditure , " <p> On the other hand the withdrawal of the team was perhaps not that surprising . Earlier in the year we were hearing of serious tensions and frustrations between the Challenger of Record and the Defenders as the Protocol was thrashed out . <p> To add an interesting twist , it is believed that the Australian Challenger of Record deal was set up by Oracle boss Larry Ellison , much to the surprise and frustration of Russell Coutts who had planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Coutts only discovered this on the final day of racing last year .

But the problem is that under the Protocol entries can not be accepted until there are three teams , at present there are just two , Luna Rossa and Artemis . While Ben Ainslie Racing and Team New Zealand intend to be there , they have as yet to enter . The entry deadline is 8 August . <p> The process going forwards is that teams must submit $1.025 million to enter by 8 August even though competition dates for 2015 might not be known until November , and details regarding the Finals for 2017 will possibly not be released until the end of this year . <p> Secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond must be submitted by December 1 , 2014 . <p> But the biggest issue and current unknown is that of the venue .

The preliminary stages could see teams having to travel to other additional locations . Just planning for this is expensive let alone executing the plan . <p> The bottom line is that all the players know how fragile this stage of the process is , hence the carefully chosen language in the teams ' responses . <p> " We remain supportive of the Defender 's continued drive towards a more commercial event format , along with a more sustainable future for this historic trophy , " said Ben Ainslie .

The international analysis of 800 peer-reviewed scientific reports has confirmed fears of beekeepers throughout the world that long-term exposure to systemic pesticides at low , non- lethal levels could be harmful to bees and a factor in declining bee populations overseas . <p> Neonicotinoids have been linked by several scientific reports to significant unexplained losses of bee populations , known as colony collapse disorder or CCD , in the United States and Europe . <p> Beekeepers believe foraging bees pick up minute traces of systemic pesticides in the plant 's nectar and pollen which is transferred back to the hive and may affect their navigation and memory , resulting in whole bee colonies disappearing . <p> In response to questions from NZ Farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual step of publicising its conclusions before publishing its study . <p> " When the study is published , the EPA will be able to review the information and assess its relevance to New Zealand , " it said in a written response . <p> However , in line with overseas regulators in the US and Europe , the EPA said : " We are updating our requirements of applicants seeking our approval to allow new pesticides to be used in New Zealand . We are demanding a high level of scientific evidence about the safety and effect of such products before considering them for approval . " <p> Recently the EPA said it declined an application for a seed treatment product where the applicant was unable to demonstrate that it could be used safely in relation to bees . <p> The authority had been liaising closely with the National Beekeepers Association on this issue for the past few years , staff said .

" More than 100 studies have concluded that when used according to instructions on the labels , neonicotinoids are not harmful to bee colonies . "

" <p> Back when Bracewell started to move up in the company , during the 1980s , it was owned by Tappenden Holdings , the investment vehicle of Alan Gibbs and Trevor Farmer . The company had been involved in several Gibbs-Farmer deals , most notably in the 1990 privatisation of Telecom . <p> However , in the late 1990s , when Gibbs was spending an increasing amount of time overseas and Farmer was taking a less active hand in the business , the pair decided to sell . <p> After a potential bid by state-owned New Zealand Post was scuppered by the-then National-led government , Tappenden found a buyer in Australian document management company Ausdoc Group which bought Freightways for $125 million in 1997 . <p> In Paul Goldsmith 's biography of Gibbs , Serious Fun , Gibbs says , with hindsight , that selling the courier business may have been a mistake . <p> " My only mild regret is selling , " says Gibbs .

But Ausdoc 's ownership of Freightways turned out to be relatively short-lived . <p> Following disagreement among shareholders over the future direction of the company , Ausdoc was sold to private equity firm ABN Amro in 2002 . <p> ABN Amro wasted little time in splitting the company up , floating Freightways on the NZX in 2003 .

Castle Parcels offers an economy service , providing inter-island deliveries which take up to two days . <p> " The trick with the multi-brand strategy is to split the market up into its respective segments but then to be a leader in each part of the marketplace , " Bracewell explains . <p> " If we dressed ourselves up like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd walk one way , talk one way , we 'd have one suite of services .

@@2861239 <p> Two years on from its innovative listing in Australia and New Zealand , dairy powerhouse Fonterra is considering a new equity fund that could change how the industry is funded . <p> The Equity Partners ' Fund was flagged last month with the launch of Fonterra 's fifth global brand Farm Source ; a rewards , farm retail , financial management and technology package for the co-operative 's farmer shareholders . <p> While the announcement was detail light and is early in the consultation phase , the fund would source equity from pension funds with long-dated liabilities to invest at farm level . <p> As last year 's de-listing of Australian rural land player PrimeAg highlighted , there is a huge mismatch between the needs of fund managers with quarterly - or even monthly - performance measures and the funding needs of farming enterprises . <p> Fonterra may participate in the fund itself at the beginning , but it would be an independent entity providing patient capital through the cycle to encourage farmers to grow . <p> The pension funds are likely to get exposure to yield from the farm without having to operate it and/or some exposure to the value of agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Australia 's declining milk production in the face of booming Asian demand , the Fonterra equity fund could be the missing piece for dairy .

Around 40 per cent of the Fonterra Shareholders ' Fund is held by Australian institutions . <p> Since the fund 's $500 million float on the ASX and NZX , there has been lingering uncertainty over how accountable the company would be to its new third-party investors . The units give non-farmer investors economic rights but no voting rights , keeping ownership of the co-operative in the hands of its farmers . It 's a model Australia 's biggest dairy processor Murray Goulburn is trying to emulate . <p> For some fund managers this is n't a problem . Others say they would never buy units that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension is now being tested as Perpetual , which owns 13.3 per cent of the Shareholders ' Fund , is pushing Fonterra to be more disciplined around its capital expenditures . At the September full-year result the company said it has $1.6 billion of capex ( some of this is stay-in-business capex ) in the pipeline for 2014-15 and it expects capex will remain elevated for some time . <p> Fonterra is building a massive new drier at Lichfield , expanding capacity at Pahiatua , and building three new plants at Edendale . The Lichfield plant will be similar in size to Fonterra 's Darfield plant , currently the biggest drier in the world . <p> At full tilt , Darfield can process eight million litres of milk a day , the same amount as all six of Fonterra 's Australian plants combined . <p> The motivation for these shiny new plants is to provide flexibility , allowing Fonterra to move milk to the highest value use and protecting it from volatility in global markets . <p> Value-add strategy As a regulated monopoly in New Zealand these investments will generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main reason fund managers backed Fonterra in the first place is because they believed in its " turning the wheel strategy " . Turning the wheel means lifting returns on capital by shifting production toward more value-added products . <p> Achieving the cost of capital will be dilutive to group returns . <p> Unsurprisingly the two main questions Paravicini dealt with from his Australian investors were around capex and how quickly Fonterra can " turn the wheel " . <p> Fund managers want more transparency and discipline around return hurdles . If Fonterra ignores them it sends a warning to investors in the fund that their lack of voting rights is a serious problem . <p> In the intense scrutiny that comes with being New Zealand 's most important company , Fonterra has done a good job balancing the needs of all its stakeholders so it is likely to take the capex feedback on board . <p> While they do deliver lower returns , Paravicini sees commodity products like milk powders as a baseline to encourage milk production growth , and as a backbone product into markets to then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's plenty keeping Fonterra busy . <p> The company is still dealing with the fallout from last year 's whey protein concentrate ( WPC ) scandal , where a batch of product returned a false positive for potentially fatal botulism-causing bacteria .

Last year Fonterra snapped up Tasmanian yoghurt business Tamar Valley which is the final part of the brand piece before shifting the focus to product innovation . <p> During last year 's takeover scrap for Warrnambool Cheese &amp; Butter , Fonterra forked out $50 million to take a 10 per cent stake in Bega . Fonterra licenses the Bega brand in Australia and is the major customer through Bega 's Ridge Street cheese cut and wrap facility . Fonterra moved to protect its current arrangements and said it has no immediate takeover ambitions for Bega , but the strategic logic of a deal is obvious to everyone . Bega has a 10 per cent shareholder cap , but it wo n't stay in place forever and chairman Barry Irvin could get it removed immediately if it made sense for the company .

@@2876240 <p> Properties nationwide are underinsured and could leave homeowners facing a hefty bill after a disaster . Can anything be done ? And what are the consequences of not doing anything ? Alex Fensome reports . <p> If your house was destroyed tomorrow - say by a fire or an earthquake - would you have enough insurance to rebuild it ? The chances are you wo n't , even if you think you do . <p> While they may disagree on details , insurers , valuers and economists agree many homes are underinsured . <p> Since July 2013 , insurers will cover your house only up to a certain amount , which you have to work out for yourself . They call it " sum insured " . <p> The trouble with this system ? It 's left a lot of people with less insurance on their homes than they need . <p> There are now calls to tighten up how sum insurance is calculated - with warnings we could face a leaky homes-style crisis if nothing is done . <p> Adrienne Jonas-Gooch is an Auckland real estate agent , so she 's used to working out how much a house is worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it costs to rebuild . <p> She owns a pre-war villa in Ponsonby that has recently been renovated . " We 'd basically taken the back off and rebuilt it - the spend was $300,000 . " <p> So when the insurance company came back with a default sum insurance figure of $250,000 , she was surprised . A valuer has since estimated it needs at least $680,000 of cover . <p> " They do n't have to replace like with like , " she says . " This is a huge problem . " <p> Insurance changed forever on September 4 , 2010 - the day of the first Christchurch earthquake . Suddenly , what international reinsurers backing our insurance companies had assumed was a benign market turned into a complicated one . <p> And with complication comes cost . <p> Before the Christchurch quakes , insurers would agree to pay the full cost of replacing your home . <p> New Zealand was one of the few countries where this was the case - the legacy of a successful marketing scheme about 30 years ago , where one company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That was all well and good until Christchurch was wrecked . <p> As Wellington valuer Bill Sisk puts it : " Insurance is basically sophisticated bookmaking , and you 've got to have enough in the kitty and you 've got to know how much you 're up for in the worst case . " <p> Christchurch has seen hundreds of prolonged wrangles over how much homeowners are going to get to replace their homes . <p> In theory , sum insured will be much quicker . Your house gets destroyed , you get the cheque you 've been insured for , and that 's it . <p> However , it 's also forced a big responsibility on to homeowners . Insurance and Savings Ombudsman Karen Stevens says many still are n't aware of all the implications . <p> " You 've actually got to work out the cost of a rebuild , not what it is worth . . . if you have a maximum sum insured , that 's it , basically . <p> " If you 've left anything out , or you have n't calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going to be covered simply because you 've got it wrong . " <p> People are paying the price for market certainty in the wake of the Canterbury quakes and other disasters worldwide . " You ca n't say that it is fair or unfair , you ca n't say it is anybody 's fault . " <p> The question is now whether homeowners are getting enough cover . <p> Sisk says most houses he sees are substantially underinsured . Online calculators used by insurance companies are too simplistic . <p> The default sums homeowners get given are calculated on a cost of $2000 per square metre , which in most cases may cover a dwelling but not things such as decks , driveways or demolition costs . <p> They also do n't account for inflation , or the steep sections that are so common in Wellington . <p> Sisk believes most houses are anything from 20 to 50 per cent underinsured . " Ninety per cent of punters have just accepted the insurance company 's default figure . " <p> Katrina Church , from advisers Insurance People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client , who owns a beach house in Omaha , forgot to add decks into his calculation . " The default sum insured was $360,000 and the valuation came in at $771,000 , " she says . <p> Another client left out their basement , and another " guesstimated " their sum at $1.2 million . The valuation came back at $2.85m . <p> Some valuers and surveyors now believe the Government has to step in to prevent a crisis in the wake of another natural disaster . <p> Andy Thomson , chief executive of surveying firm Construction Cost Consultants , compares the situation to leaky homes , only " 100 times as big " - threatening misery for homeowners and a thumping great bill for the taxpayer . <p> He has written to Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee expressing his concerns . <p> Thomson has estimated houses could be underinsured by between $150 billion and $310b . That figure comes from an estimate that 80 per cent of homes are underinsured by 25-50 per cent . <p> With a national property portfolio worth $775b , about $620b worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council chief executive Tim Grafton firmly disagrees , saying at most 30-35 per cent of homes could be underinsured by 20 per cent . <p> " In the event the very worst happened , a house would be rebuilt to 20 per cent lower quality , or 20 per cent less proportion . " <p> The Christchurch earthquake cost $20b in private insurance payouts . " Most of that is not total constructive loss at all . It 's repairs . " <p> However , Thomson believes the Government has to step in and take some kind of action , even making it compulsory to have a proper valuation done . <p> " We are going to end up paying for this . . . somebody needs to stand up and do something . " <p> He acknowledges his company would benefit . " Of course , we do - but people should be insured properly . <p> " If you end up with the front room and kitchen of your house but no bedrooms because you 've underinsured , you 're going to say , ' I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have capped their liability - they know how much they have to pay out , and do n't particularly care if it is n't enough for someone to rebuild their home , Thomson says . <p> " All they have got now is reputational risk . " <p> Not surprisingly , Grafton disagrees . <p> From Insurance Council research , about two-thirds of New Zealanders are confident they have the sum insured right , and more than half found it easy to do , he says . <p> Valuation is hardly an exact science . " What is the final cost ? Even a valuer only makes an estimate . " <p> He concedes the industry needs more sophisticated calculation tools than the ones they have online , but says these are coming . <p> " Valuers would like New Zealanders only to deal with them . There are a lot of people who are quite capable of getting an estimate of their rebuild cost without recourse to compulsion . " <p> Professor Ilan Noy , chair in the economics of disasters at Victoria University 's school of economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People might decide to underinsure anyway - maybe they 'd want a smaller house if their current one was destroyed , for example - but it needed to be an informed decision . <p> " Companies need to be more transparent and informative . " <p> Making it compulsory to get a valuation is probably going too far . " I 'm sure the lobbyists are trying to push for that because it 'll give them a lot of work , but the costs should be on the insurance industry , not the customers . " <p> What the industry really needs is a consumer-focused watchdog that could ensure customers understand the consequences , he says . " At this point , people are not fully informed and they do n't really know what the cost of construction is . " <p> Grafton says any cost for the insurance industry would just get passed back to customers anyway , in the form of higher premiums . <p> But Jonas-Gooch says that might be acceptable . " I think they have a responsibility to do it . Even if it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valuer. "

Poverty is on the rise across the Pacific region , according to recent report published by the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) . <p> " Women have lower access to employment and they often work in the informal sector with no labour rights , social security or welfare .

Some island nations such as Tuvalu , for instance , experience relatively low rates of child stunting while almost half of the children in Papua New Guinea are stunted . <p> Outliers such as these are easily swallowed up in reports full of averages and statistics . But for those who come face to face with the reality of poverty in the Pacific , it is harder to ignore . <p> " One of the concerns we paediatricians have is we 're seeing worsening in some areas , particularly in urban areas " , says Dr Percival . <p> " They 're unable to feed themselves adequately , they ' ca n't afford to buy food , they ca n't grow anything so you end up with sick malnourished kids and malnourished pregnant woman as well .

While this halted progress towards poverty reduction and other MDGs , many Pacific Island nations fell back on subsistence farming as a coping mechanism . <p> Today , however , progress remains slow . Currently only two Pacific states -- the Cook Islands and Niue -- are on track to achieve the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters and climate change present further challenges for those in the Pacific and tend to be issues now front and centre in the minds of governments and NGOs when it comes to small island developing states . <p> " Their size , remoteness and dependence on sectors such as tourism and agriculture make them vulnerable to global economic shocks , " points out Deodat Maharaj -- the man responsible for economic and social development at the Commonwealth Secretariat . <p> " Their smallness means they are prone to country-wide impacts from natural disasters such as hurricanes , cyclones and floods , affecting both lives and livelihoods . " <p> Devastating reality It is a devastating reality , which was seen played out in the 2009 tsunami that swept over Samoa at a cost of almost $250 million -- a quarter of the country 's GDP . However numbers aside , those living in the Pacific say the real cost of such disasters can not be measured in dollars . <p> " We know first-hand how vulnerability to natural disasters can end human lives and reverse years of hard won development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN representative . <p> And while natural disasters remain difficult to foresee , the region 's focus has swung towards the more visible signs of climate change and its potential impact on development . <p> The issue largely dominated the recent Small Island Developing States conference in Samoa where a number of solutions to climate change were tabled . <p> One potential option , put forward by the Commonwealth Secretariat , would see island nation 's debt swapped in an agreement to commit to invest into climate change mitigation . <p> In a region where rising sea levels continue to threaten precious farm land , climate change is more than just a topic to debate -- it is a growing reality . <p> " If we do n't act to stop the world 's climate radically warming , we face huge catastrophic consequences for human beings , for species for our whole way of life and development , " warns UNDP administrator Helen Clark . <p> What 's behind all this ? The reasons behind the persistent and often increasing poverty in the Pacific are complex , however a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints a picture of changing economies in the Pacific as the region begins to feel the weight of globalisation take effect . <p> Although cash currency has been in use for over a century , it has only been in the last 50 years that Pacific Island leaders have begun to commit to a Western economic cash-led market with an emphasis on trade . <p> The report notes that traditionally Pacific Island Communities tend to be very communal with a strong hierarchical structure . Harvested and crafted goods were traded and allocated within communities . <p> However , for Dr Percival , a native Samoan herself , this traditional structure does not necessarily equal equality . <p> " Culturally , we 're hierarchical societies so important people get more stuff . Less important people -- they 're not important , so they do n't get much stuff . " <p> Her voice lowers when she says this as if addressing the elephant in the room in somehow taboo . <p> " That 's the way our societies are and to turn that around and say that every child is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school- that 's a bit of an uncomfortable way of looking at things for some of our societies . " <p> But despite an effort to steer the region toward more western economic values and growth , some Pacific Island countries are struggling with the transition . <p> While the agricultural industries may hold the greatest hope for trade , the UNDP says in many countries the primary sectors ' contribution to GDP has actually been declining . <p> In contrast subsistence farming is on the rise in some areas revealing people 's daily nutritional needs continue to trump a desire for trade . <p> However , while many cling to traditional livelihoods in rural areas , increasing globalisation and monetisation is increasing the need for cash incomes , driving many into the cities . <p> The former director of Oxfam New Zealand , Barry Coates , says this shift from trading to employment often leaves people with a raw deal . <p> " Where people are drifting into the urban areas , primarily younger people , they often have to work for very low wages , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swapping a kind of a low cash income for a very low wage economy where people are often exploited . " <p> And although a cash-focused economic market holds a chance for some to thrive , the UNDP points out that this is already leading to increasing inequality as many undoubtedly miss out . <p> Barry Coates , former Oxfam executive director ... young Pacific people are often exploited when moving to the cities in search of work . Image : Struan Purdie/APJ <p> Tourism- a way forward ? One of the main drivers of economic growth and possibly the Pacific greatest hope for development is tourism . In 2012 the sector contributed an estimated 10.6 percent to the region 's gross domestic product . <p> And while the tourism industry is expected to grow , questions remain over whether pacific island locals will see any of its benefits . <p> A report by Massey University , for instance , has described Fiji 's tourism industry as one dominated by foreign ownership of large resorts . It is something Barry Coates is all too familiar with . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital cities while most of the population have little cash and little opportunity , " he says . " So it 's very much a divided society and a divided economy . " <p> However , there are some examples of large corporates doing their part . The Fijian is a large 1300 guest resort which started a marine conservation programme that provided employment for local people . <p> Additionally many of the Fiji 's resorts provide donations to local clinic , schools . But beyond plain philanthropy , the Massey report argues joint ventures are needed to help established tourism operators support indigenous start-ups . <p> Although a number of such partnerships are already taking flight , it is clear that more needs to be done for the tourism sector to turn the tides of poverty . <p> Unseen hardship While the reality of hardship and inequality in the Pacific is clearly present , for many the notion of poverty is hard to grasp . For those on the outside looking in it can be difficult to see past the beachfront resorts and laidback island lifestyle says Television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealanders have this image of the Pacific as a holiday destination as opposed to real people with real lives . " <p> She says it is not surprising that so many people are ignorant of poverty , not only in the Pacific but also back home . <p> " People still think there 's no poverty in New Zealand , so if we do n't accept that it 's here in our own country it 's not surprising people ca n't see it in the Pacific . " <p> It raises a question over how well issues of human development in the Pacific are covered by local and international media . <p> Dreaver says on the whole reporting on the region is poor with international gatherings such as the Small Islands Developing States conference and the Pacific Island Forum being the only draw cards for foreign media . <p> " They do a lot of good , not for the conference themselves but as a platform where foreign media can go and actually bring these stories to light . " <p> However , often the focus shifts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July earlier this year , both New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Australia 's Tony Abbott decided against attending the Pacific Islands Forum -- a story that dominated coverage of the event . <p> Struggling for solutions While many Pacific Island states struggle to grasp a solution to increasing rates of poverty , the region 's progress in other areas is improving with many ticking the boxes on a number of MDGs . <p> When it comes to achieving universal primary education , the vast majority of Pacific island countries are tracking well towards the 2015 goal . <p> Likewise , 10 of the 14 countries are on track to reduce child mortality and most are expected to meet maternal health targets . <p> However , the issue of poverty remains a thorn in the side of the region 's long term development plan . A number of solutions have been tabled with the hope of stamping out worrying trend . <p> Among the possible options is a recommendation by the UNDP to hand out cash grants to all children under five , which would lead to an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a possibility of free health care for pregnant women and better support for those living with disabilities . <p> Other alternatives include improved access to low-cost health diagnostics through new technologies , as well as campaigns to encourage better nutrition and exercise . <p> While such solutions are no-doubt well thought through in the world of analysis and reports , those working on the ground in the region point out an important aspect that often get missed . <p> " One of the big issues is a lack of recognition by countries that poverty is actually a big issue for them and they need to address it as a whole country , " says Dr Percival . <p> It 's a sentiment that harks back to 2012 when Samoa 's Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi infamously proclaimed poverty did not exist in his country , despite Samoa being listed by the United Nations as one of the 48 least developed nations in the world . <p> " Samoans who claim to be poor are just lazy , " Tuilaepasaid on a government website . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathing around .

" It 's about bringing us into modern times . " <p> So while tourists continue to flock to island resorts , local governments and NGOs continue their work in the Pacific in places not seen from $5000-a-night beach bungalows . <p> And although they are seeing progress in the region , there is still a long way to go before poverty is truly stamped out . <p> Development goals will no doubt come and go , as will future reports and analysis on the region .

Around him , cramped tightly together are almost 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sick as him . <p> For 10-12 days , Gulzari was trapped on an unsafe boat crossing the eastern part of the Indian Ocean from Indonesia , trying to reach the shores of Australia . To him , the journey felt like an eternity . <p> " The conditions were horrible . It was a very small fishing boat going very slowly . There was almost no food or water and the boat was very overcrowded . We were not sure , where we were heading to , nobody told us . We could not communicate with the captain at all , " he says . <p> Gulzari , today aged 33 , experienced the perils as a young man in 1999 . Due to intense fighting in his home area in the central highland of Afghanistan , he was forced to flee . <p> He sold the land , his family owned , and people smugglers helped him to Indonesia , where he took place on the boat to Australia . <p> " Most of the nights I thought we were going to drown . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually the boat was intercepted by an Australian naval vessel that took them to a detention centre near Broome in Western Australia . <p> " I stayed almost four months in the camp , " Gulzari says . " In the beginning the conditions were good , but as people poured in -- at one stage there were more than 1000 people -- the conditions got extremely worse . People were accommodated in tents . It was overcrowded everywhere . People were scared . " <p> Protection needed Shortly after Gulzari arrived , things in Australia started to change . <p> Dr Karen Block , research fellow with the RAS at the University of Melbourne says the " race to the bottom " began in 2001 . In her opinion , the " Tampa Affair " where the Australian Howard government denied access to the Norwegian freighter MV Tampa , carrying 438 rescued refugees , was a key moment . <p> " You had 11 September ( 2001 ) happening straight afterwards and in the Australian people 's minds the idea of people coming here and the threat of terrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boost in popularity in the polls from the stand they took in that situation , " she says . <p> Following the " Tampa Affair " , the Australian government came up with a plan to keep asylum seekers from reaching the mainland . The plan was called the " Pacific Solution " , and it gave the Australian Defence Force power to intercept vessels at sea , and transport them to detention centres on Christmas Island , Manus Island in Papua New Guinea , and on the island nation of Nauru . The plan was in effect until 2007 , when political power changed . <p> " It was really an interesting time , when the Labor government gained power in 2007 , because they brought in some very good policy changes , " said Dr Block . <p> " For a time asylum seekers dropped out of the media to a large extent , so the government was able to bring in better policies . But they never stood up and said , ' we actually need to have a more humane way of treating asylum seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temporary closing of the detention camps in Nauru and on Manus Island in February 2008 . <p> The current prime minister in Australia , Tony Abbott , was elected leader of the Liberal Party in December 2009 . With him in charge things changed again , according to Dr Block . <p> " When he became party leader he immediately brought back asylum seekers to the front pages and started criticising the Labor government for what it was doing . That was an absolutely critical moment . He was more prepared to use asylum seekers as a political issue and then it turned into a disgusting race to the bottom , " she says . <p> The worst years Gulzari experienced the consequences of the political changes first hand . After he was released from the detention centre , he was granted a Temporary Protection Visa ( TPV ) but then left alone without any help . After a change of rules he was denied a permanent visa , when the TPV expired . <p> " It was extremely terrible , extremely horrendous . They told me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true , " he says . <p> " It was the worst years , because I did n't know when my case was going to be decided , and I did not have any possibility to see my family . No help was given to me in terms of education or even learning English properly . " <p> The uncertainty and lack of help has had big consequences for him . <p> " I have endured a lot of difficulties . It has been tragic and I am very unhappy . I have tried to get rid of the sorrow and sadness and enjoy myself , but it is engraved in my mind so deeply , that I can not wash it off , " he says . <p> Anxiety , depression and suicides Gulzari is far from the only one to experience psychological trauma from staying in a detention facility . The Professor of Developmental Psychiatry and director of the Monash University Centre for Developmental Psychiatry and Psychology , Dr Louise Newman , says that consequences have been well-documented for several years . <p> " In the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , so it is well known . There are no questions , that this is causing harm , and the government knows that , but they are still not doing anything , " she says . <p> She has been following the development in the detention camps in Nauru and on Manus Island , and she sees the impact of confinement . <p> " We are seeing high levels of people with mental disorders , especially depression and anxiety , " she says . " Women who are having babies are suffering from depression , and they have to be transported to the mainland because there are no staff and facilities to treat them in the camps . " <p> There are a lot of kids living in the camps too and according to Newman they are exceptionally vulnerable . <p> " In the young ones , we are starting to see that they are not developing properly . We are seeing signs of neglect and babies are not eating . They are suffering from anxiety and trauma . They are likely to suffer long-term consequences . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour , " Newman says . <p> New policies , worse conditions Within the last year the policies and rhetoric on asylum seekers has taken a turn for the worse , according to several experts and humanitarian organisations . In July 2013 the Australian coalition-government led by Tony Abbott implemented a policy to turn all boats around and not let any asylum seekers reach the mainland . <p> The policy was named " Operation Sovereign Borders " . <p> Following the new policy , the Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison was clear and adamant over the asylum seekers . <p> " I want to stress all those on Christmas Island who are there now -- those who arrived after July 19 will be going to Nauru or Manus Island . There will be no exceptions , whether you 're Syrian , Iranian , single , married , adult , child , they will all be going to Nauru or Manus Island and will not return to live in Australia , " he said in a statement in November 2013 . <p> Since then riots and suicide attempts have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the protester 's placards include : " I 'm tired , please kill me " and " Suicide is sweeter than Australia 's dirty policy . " <p> An anonymous Iranian asylum seeker who has been detained on Nauru for a year has described conditions there as " God 's own hell " . <p> Humanitarian activists are reporting that the detainees are being tortured , and women and children are subject to sexual abuse . <p> To Dr Block , the current policy is all about scaring people off . <p> " The current policy around asylum seekers is all about deterrence . It is wrong because you are punishing one set of people in order to have an impact on other people , basically giving them no hope of settling in Australia , " she said . <p> In the last days of September this year , the Australian coalition government began the process of reinstating the TPV . That immediately sparked protests from humanitarian organisations such as Human Rights Law Centre in Australia . <p> " The government is doing everything they can to deny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their lives . They are doing everything they can to deny permanent protection to them . These are people that have fled persecution and are in desperate need of , and entitled to , protection , " says Daniel Webb , spokesperson for Human Rights Law Centre in Australia . <p> The TPV is issued to persons who apply for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival in Australia . Refugee advocates has described the TPV as " a cruel way of treating people , that leaves them with an uncertain future .

Even though , as described earlier in this article , 90 percent of the people arriving by boat to Australia are genuine refugees , the media outlets do not take that aspect into consideration . <p> In almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seekers were described as one group without any distinctions . <p> According to Bacon , there are fundamental differences between the two analysed media outlets . <p> " Newscorp is very much aligned with the policies of the government , while ABC News are far more journalistically conservative in their news approach , " she says . <p> The analysis done by Pacific Scoop shows that both ABC News and The Daily Telegraph categorises asylum seekers as a problem for Australia , and create a narrative around a war between the asylum seekers on one side and the Australian government on the other . <p> The way of covering the issue creates a fear of the outside world , Bacon says . <p> " It is a very long and deep problem the way people fear those from the outside , this is not the first time we have had this topic in the media , " she says . <p> " But it sells , and is designed to attract attention .

But he said new moves by some countries , including Ireland , to offer companies tax breaks on profits that were derived from patents had the potential to undermine progress , if rules concerning the concessions were not made clear . <p> Saint-Amans is in charge of the OECD 's Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting ( Beps ) programme .

" The overall tax planning of companies and what has been happening in the past 20 years is coming to an end , so is not just about phasing out the double-Irish ; it is about rethinking the overall strategy and do they need to rethink the overall strategy before six years ?

Photo by Lucy Ibbotson . <p> Derek and Gillian Crombie 's work with the Matukituki Charitable Trust is aimed at aiding the preservation and rehabilitation of native birds and wildlife in the West Matukituki Valley , within Mt Aspiring National Park , by means of predator control . Their long-term commitment to the project has been recognised as a finalist in the Inland Otago Conservation Awards . <p> What is it about the project you are involved in that got you both interested in conservation and drives your work ? <p> We have been visiting the valley for over 30 years and in the last 10 we realised the number of kea was declining rapidly . When we discussed this with Doc it became apparent that most species were in similar decline and Doc did not have the resources to address the issue without more support . We decided we had to do something to ensure future generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the project you 're involved in benefit conservation ? <p> The main strategy we have is to start with predator control in the upper West Matukituki and then hopefully extend the area to join into other groups that are doing similar work in East Matukituki and the lower valley down to Lake Wanaka . The upper valley has a natural barrier to reinvasion and along with good predator control should create an ' ' island sanctuary ' ' where wildlife can develop and spread to the lower valley . <p> What do you both get out of your work in conservation ? <p> We have really enjoyed meeting a wide range of people , including Doc staff across New Zealand , who share similar aspirations and commitment , but the main objective is to ' ' make a difference ' ' and see the results of our efforts achieve the reintroduction of lost species and hopefully kiwi back in the valley . <p> What challenges has the project faced and how have they been overcome ? <p> The biggest hurdle was establishing the Matukituki Charitable Trust as an organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the funding to start the project . <p> We had a lot of assistance from other similar organisations which provided material and documents that we could use to get the trust set up legally . In reality the support we have had from Doc , volunteers and sponsors has made the task easy , but we did have to provide a reasonable amount of funding and effort ourselves . The initial support of foundation volunteers and sponsors was critical to reach the stage where we were able to apply to the Doc Community Conservation Partnership Fund to meet some of the costs for the first two years ' work . This funding will meet about half the cost of installing all the 700 traps required to reduce the population of rats , stoats , ferrets and possum . This is a massive start for the trust , and the valley , and with back-up from our volunteers to maintain the traps we hope to have predators to very low levels within two years . <p> What direction do you see your conservation work going in the future ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install and maintain a network of 700 traps . Once that is stable we will extend the trapping to specific areas such as the alpine zone where rock wren and kea nest . We will then be focused on monitoring existing species and reintroduction of species such as weka , mohua , and hopefully kiwi . Our aim then will be to ensure visitors to the valley have the opportunity to see these birds around the public access areas like Rob Roy Valley and Aspiring Hut as well as the two high school lodges . This is a 10-year project . We hope we can help others adopt similar schemes in other areas so Aspiring Park is returned to its best .

At the 2011 World Cup , captain Mahonri Schwalger , backed by his senior players , alleged team officials mishandled money , gave away team training gear to family and friends and hosted parties at team hotels when they should have been attending to team business . <p> Ominously , Schwalger was dropped from the side .

The logical organisation to step in is the International Rugby Board , now World Rugby . <p> The IRB has copped plenty from Samoan players ( Samoan centre Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu tweeting during the 2011 World Cup that Samoa 's treatment by the IRB was " like the Holocaust , like apartheid " ) and at times has been a big , easy target .

He says he chooses to supply Greenlea because it 's a family-owned , progressive company which achieves in all the areas he requires . <p> A calm and extremely focused man , Ellis could teach New Zealand Inc a thing or two about successful workplace relations . <p> Head stockman Steve Bryant , who runs the sheep and bull operations , has been with him 12 years , and stockman Luke Copeland 16 years since he left school . Ellis 's business partner Mark Walker , who runs the Singapore racing stables , joined Ellis 25 years ago on leaving school . <p> Ellis ' livestock agent Alan Radford of Greenlea is another keeper . He 's been buying and drafting Ellis ' cattle for 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hellaby 's , Ellis ' meat processor when he first went farming . <p> " I treat staff how I 'd like to be treated , " says Ellis , described by people in both the livestock and thoroughbred industries as humble , unassuming and warm , in spite of his formidable achievement record and financial success in challenging businesses . <p> On a late spring drive over his farm , Ellis , 60 , seems as proud of his sleekly healthy , well- finished steers as he is the mares and foals - the past and future of the sport of kings - snoozing in the afternoon sunshine . <p> Foreign-owned pine plantations on a skyline boundary of the farm are dismissed as beyond his understanding as a land use . <p> A lasting first impression of Te Akau pasture is that a huge herd of dairy goat weed terminators must be run over it regularly . <p> It 's very clean . <p> " We do n't do weeds , " says Ellis , suggesting the boss can get very grumpy on this issue . <p> Weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clover , he says . <p> " We have n't missed putting superphosphate on in 35 years . " <p> While Ellis is very clear that these days he farms cattle and sheep to clean up the pasture after horses , " poor grazers which leave behind weeds " , it was n't always so . <p> Auckland-city bred Ellis was the maverick farmer in his family and none of his five children aspire to be farmers either . From a young age he wanted to be a successful farmer , a vocation fuelled by holidays spent on Kings College schoolmates ' home farms . <p> " I thought what a beautiful way to earn a living . I loved animals . It worked well for me . " <p> But his dad said the only way Ellis could leave school was if he undertook tertiary study . <p> So he enrolled at Flock House , went on to gain a diploma in agriculture from Massey University , and worked on sheep and cattle farms . <p> By age 25 he had saved $40,000 - the equivalent of a Lotto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including at a meat works for several years and by pumping petrol at the weekend . <p> He raised a loan and bought a 500-acre hill country farm in north Waikato but his goal was to buy in the rolling Te Akau area - " good climate , not too hot , not too cold , good rainfall " . <p> Te Akau Farm started with 1500 breeding ewes and 150 heifers . Wool was earning $6/kg . Last season it returned $3/kg . <p> While he was later seduced by a passion for thoroughbred racing , Ellis says he always intended to have a successful cattle and sheep business as his financial base . <p> He says the success of farming all livestock - including bloodstock - is " what goes down their throats " . Te Akau pasture feeds all animals well - particularly horses , he says . <p> The farm makes about 300 bales of 10-bale equivalent haylage a year . It stocks five units to the acre says Ellis , who says he only speaks acreage . That 's five animals per 4046.9sq m <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " we do n't call them staff " - and says personally , he 's had " a lot of luck " . <p> He says the business - farm and bloodstock - expands every year , and that it is " very much " in expansion mode right now . <p> Sheep returns may disappoint him but he 's not about to give up on them . <p> " It 's the cattle that makes the money but we 're probably in sheep for the long run . Lamb might come right one day . I said in my lifetime I would see a fat steer get $2000 and a fat lamb $200. "

@@4823235 <h> Co-operation housing shortage solution <p> Addressing housing shortages is about much more than ' ' cutting through the red tape ' ' , writes Lawrence Yule , the president of Local Government New Zealand . <p> Housing affordability has rarely been out of the headlines over the past 12 months . <p> The international Economist magazine found New Zealand house prices were among the most overvalued in the world , house prices in Auckland continued to hit record highs and , in November , the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research ( NZIER ) warned that the overvalued Auckland housing market and slowing global growth are key risks to New Zealand 's economic outlook . <p> One prong of the Government 's approach to tackling this issue is a new Productivity Commission inquiry which focuses on what influences land supply for housing . <p> The Government has asked the commission to ' ' examine the bylaws , processes and practices of local planning and development systems across New Zealand 's faster-growing urban areas ' ' . <p> This will , most likely , reignite debate about the role of local government in addressing housing affordability . <p> Local Government New Zealand ( LGNZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomes the commission looking at how land planning systems can better benefit cities and how local authorities make land available for housing . <p> However , when considering housing supply and affordability , it is important to recognise the many factors at play . <p> The priority can not continue to be simply on how to provide more housing in Auckland or other areas deemed unaffordable . <p> It must be on how we create and support vibrant economies and communities in the many areas of New Zealand with good land supply . <p> If we can do this , migrants will look beyond a handful of metropolitan areas , and skilled Kiwis will have confidence to move from areas of housing pressure to other regional centres to buy homes , raise families and enjoy productive careers . <p> We need to find ways to develop our regional centres into environments which offer opportunities in education , employment and business . <p> We see a real opportunity to develop a shared national strategy to strengthen regional economies to make other areas in New Zealand attractive places to live . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall , land shortages are not the issue . <p> Research commissioned by LGNZ has found that , apart from a small number of metropolitan areas , residential land supply shortages are not a universal problem in New Zealand . <p> Major issues impacting on housing supply and affordability include timing of private sector land sales , release of land by developers and how long developers take to build once land has been zoned . <p> Banking policy , construction costs , and the high cost of building materials - highlighted in the Productivity 's Commission last report in 2012 - also play a part . <p> Another recent NZIER report also found demand for bespoke housing , poor project management and slow uptake of technology were factors in slowing productivity in the building sector . <p> Additionally , council roles in planning are not always clear-cut . <p> Changing zoning plans is complex and frequently subject to litigation as decisions are often challenged . <p> The time this process takes is a significant issue that influences the very first step in the process of making land available for housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The other significant issue for local government is funding infrastructure for high-growth areas where existing communities can not always cover the costs of future population growth . <p> Local government will be determining how it can work with the Government on changes to the Resource Management Act ( RMA ) - and providing input on ways to make RMA processes more efficient and accessible for the public . <p> That includes reviewing Housing Accord processes that streamline and better focus public participation , template formats for consistency , plan provisions with greater clarity around expected outcomes and more accessible e-planning tools . <p> Ten local authorities including Queenstown Lakes District Council and Christchurch City Council are now listed on the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act schedule . <p> This means these areas can enter a housing accord with the Government . <p> These have recognised the benefits of a truncated approach for residential rezoning and consenting . <p> There is opportunity to examine applying these provisions more widely to the RMA , beyond residential development in particular locations . <p> Statistics from the Ministry for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of consents , 97% are processed within statutory time frames . <p> Addressing housing shortages is about much more than ' ' cutting through the red tape ' ' . <p> LGNZ strongly advocates the most effective strategy is a co-ordinated effort between local and central government to drive regional development and revitalise regional economies . <p> With a joined-up approach from local and central government , we could achieve much more .
