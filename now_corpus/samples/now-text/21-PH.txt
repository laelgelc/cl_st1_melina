Several years later , we solidified our reputation as builder of choice for residential developments while also engaging in commercial and industrial projects to sustain the business . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Coming off the 2008 global financial crisis , we won our first major infrastructure public private partnership ( PPP ) project in 2012 , through the Department of Education 's ( DepEd ) PPP for School Infrastructure Project for the construction of 10,000 classrooms in over 2,000 far-flung areas . <p> This was followed by the 25-year and 35-year concession agreements with the Department of Transportation ( DOTr ) for the development , operations , and maintenance of the Mactan-Cebu International Airport ( MCIA ) in 2014 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 , respectively . <p> In all these , the underlying theme is providing the essentials through infrastructure -- education through school buildings , long-distance travel connectivity through modern airports and people mobility through efficient land transport terminals -- with engineering and construction as foundations and as enablers . As we developed , we diversified our portfolio into where it currently stands -- engineering , procurement and construction services , airport operations , and transport-oriented developments ( TODs ) . <p> As COVID-19 plagued the whole world and ushered in an unprecedented global economic shock , we stuck with our tried and tested formula to keep on track with our vision of engineering a First World Philippines , regardless of the odds . We believe that our youth , determination and agility will ensure our company 's continuity and growth to create a positive impact on people 's lives and livelihoods , and ultimately , the whole Philippine economy . <p> Amid the adverse impact of the pandemic , our construction and land port businesses reported strong results to deliver a combined net income in the black , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their significance to spur commercial activities and fast-track economic recovery . <p> Construction contributed the bulk of our revenues , with the economy 's gradual reopening auguring well for worker mobility and supply chain movement .

Given its significant economic multiplier effect , the industry will be a catalyst for a quick recovery . Studies have shown that every peso spent in construction activities generates an estimated P2.50 spending in other related and unrelated segments . We are convinced that our unique advantage in this space lies in our vertically integrated platform and our precast technology , where we can offer cost and functional efficiencies , speed to market and environmentally friendly solutions . <p> Second , over the long term , facilities that promote efficient mobility and increased commerce will establish the foundation for and accelerate economic advancement .

We also broke ground for the Carbon District modernization project in Cebu , which will revitalize the historic and economically significant yet aging district and feature a land terminal for in-city travelers and fresh connectivity via a ferry terminal to various attractions as well as the Mactan Airport .

Doing so would derail the pace of economic activity and will be ineffective in containing inflationary pressures that are mostly driven by supply-side constraints rather than strong demand , " Ng said . <p> MUFG expects the BSP to maintain its overnight borrowing rate at a record-low level of 2 percent at least for the next six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support growth . <p> Asked when the BSP is likely to switch to a monetary tightening cycle , Ng said it would all depend on the pace of economic recovery . Even assuming a gradual recovery next year , she said any interest rate hike would still be unlikely . <p> " Of course , there are some risks . We 've got some Asian central banks that are already tightening monetary policy , " she said , citing Bank of Korea and the Monetary Authority of Singapore which had started raising rates to curb inflationary pressures . If the BSP would be forced to hike rates due to high inflation , Ng said the first increase in interest rates would probably come by the third quarter of next year . <p> A bullish global energy cycle is also seen to add pressure on oil-importing countries like the Philippines . This is seen to result in a current account deficit equivalent to 1-2 percent of GDP this year from last year 's surplus of 3 percent , in turn weighing down the peso against the US dollar . <p> ADVERTISEMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincide with global inflation and optimism over growth , but definitely , this time it is not the case , " said Lin Li , Asia head of Global Markets Research . <p> MUFG is projecting global oil prices to average at $82.8 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $71.6 per barrel this full year and $73.7per barrel next year . <p> While there 's some improvement in global demand , Li said the natural gas crunch in United Kingdom and the rest of Europe had been putting pressure on oil prices . <h> COVID risks <p> Aside from risks caused by lofty fuel prices , pandemic risks remained even as the third wave of COVID-19 infection was now over . The decision of local authorities to adopt a " living with COVID-19 strategy " has its pros and cons , Ng said . <p> For one , she said mobility restrictions would be more targeted than widespread , which could help revive economic activity to a certain extent . She likewise cited attempts to revive the tourism sector by doing away with the quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this has its own risks ... especially since the laws imposed by other countries could be different , " Ng said . <p> " We still think that some risks remain . This is particularly so with the slow pace of vaccination and the difficulty in the procurement and distribution of vaccines in the Philippines . This could actually then result in another wave of COVID-19 cases , not to mention the new COVID variants that could be more resilient to vaccines ... , " Ng said . She said mobility restrictions might not be eased significantly in the Philippines and if there would be a new wave of COVID-19 cases , these could tighten again and affect the pace of economic recovery . <p> As the pace of vaccination in the country is the slowest in the Asean , Ng said it would " take a longer period of time for the Philippines ' negative output gap to actually close . " <p> A negative output gap means that there is spare capacity , or slack , in the economy due to weak demand . <p> Subscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; other 70+ titles , share up to 5 gadgets , listen to the news , download as early as 4am &amp; share articles on social media .

@@43171240 <h> Attention parents ! Here 's a science-based way to boost your kids ' appetite in their formative years <p> Proper nutrition during early childhood is critical for cognitive and physical development . However , getting kids to eat healthy foods -- let alone eat during mealtimes -- has always been a struggle . They would rather play than eat or complain that they have no appetite . To help parents cope with this dilemma , Ajinomoto Philippines Corporation shares how the science of umami can be used to entice children to eat more during their formative years . <p> " We understand how difficult mealtimes can be . Children during their development years are usually picky eaters but this is also the time where they need proper nutrition the most , " says Ajinomoto 's Science Communication Executive Deborah S. Fajarda , RND . " As parents spend more time at home , it is ideal to use this opportunity to properly monitor their kids ' eating habits . At Ajinomoto , we hope to empower parents in this pursuit by helping them understand childhood nutrition more . " <h> Nutrition for Early Childhood Development <p> Nutrition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development during the early ages of 0 to 8 years old . During this period , optimal brain formation as well as ideal physical growth requires adequate nourishment . If children fail to consume necessary amounts of nutrients like protein , vitamin A , iron , and zinc , they may become vulnerable to illnesses and have delayed development that can be hard to correct in their later years . <p> The more kids eat a variety of foods , the more they are exposed to different nutrients . However , there are many instances when kids refuse to eat . Sometimes , it 's because they 're distracted by toys and every so often , they simply do n't find the dishes tasty enough to finish . Fortunately , the wonders of umami offer a way to make meals more appetizing for kids . <p> Did you know that umami is the first taste experience for most of us ? This is because a mothers ' breast milk is rich in glutamate , making its taste not sweet , sour , bitter or salty but umami . Exclusive breastfeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and continued breastfeeding along with appropriate solid food up to 2 years and beyond . It 's no wonder that we are drawn to food with umami or delicious taste . <h> How umami science can help parents and kids <p> Umami is the fifth taste , joining sweet , sour , salty , and bitter . It is the one related to the food 's tastiness or deliciousness . When umami is sensed by the body , it triggers longer saliva secretion , enhancing the kid 's ability to taste and swallow food smoothly . Adding umami to dishes can help in boosting children 's appetite especially during their formative years . <p> To add the umami taste , parents can use MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) to achieve delicious meals that children will enjoy eating . MSG is simply glutamate , an amino acid , attached to a molecule of sodium , which has the ability to intensify and harmonize flavors that are already present in the dish , making the meal more palatable . For example , AJI-NO-MOTO ? Umami Seasoning can help in bringing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stir Fried Tofu with Vegetables , and Chicken Broccoli Soup . <p> Aside from its taste benefits , MSG also has many nutritional merits . It promotes digestion as MSG stimulates the umami substance sensors in the digestive system . MSG which is often mistaken to be high in sodium , actually helps us to reduce the sodium level of our dishes by up to 40% , without affecting the palatability of the dish . In fact , MSG only has 1/3 the amount of sodium found in table salt . Table salt contains 39% sodium ( 39 grams of sodium per 100 grams of salt ) , while MSG only contains 12% sodium ( 12 grams sodium per 100 grams MSG ) . <p> " Understanding umami allows us in Ajinomoto to craft solutions towards improving the wellness of Filipino families , especially with regards to children 's development , " shares Fajarda .

The single image he took showed something that is unlike any normal commercial or military aircraft that usually criss-cross the skies over the region on a daily basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He states that it was taken by a " Fujifilmxt2 +50-200mm " which , combined with high-altitude and the early morning lighting , would explain the small resolution and grainy nature of the image . <p> We must state that we can not authenticate the image at this time , although we gave it a cursory examination in photoshop and nothing major stood out . We do not have any reason to believe the photographer fabricated it , either , although it is only prudent to underscore that the factual status of the photograph could change . We will continue to examine the image using various tools and are reaching out to other photo experts to give us their opinion . <p> The location where the image was taken , smack-dab in the middle of two of the most strategic and tense bodies of water in the Pacific Theater . <p> At first glance , the aircraft depicted looks very much like the one seen in the supposed sighting of the so-called RQ-180 Sentinel high-altitude , long-endurance , very low-observable drone from last November . The RQ-180 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special feature , is thought to be in very limited operation at this time as it continues with its clandestine development . Flying the aircraft in this area of the world would make sense because it is precisely the type of environment it was designed to operate in , but it could also just be transiting to another location , including back to the United States . <p> Also the timing , at sunrise , crossing the last major inhabited area before heading out into the desolate Pacific would make sense . The aircraft is thought to fly out of Area 51 in Nevada and Edwards Air Force Base in California , on extremely long-duration missions , but the isolated island of Diego Garcia , in the Indian Ocean , would be another operating location as it expands its operations . Special facilities there can support the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and could likely be used to support the RQ-180 , as well . The locale is also known for its use to support clandestine aircraft activities . Andersen Air Force Base on Guam is another potential operating location , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft 's development . <p> Hangar B Productions <p> Our notional illustration of what the RQ-180 could look like based on publicly disclosed information about very similar concepts from Northrop Grumman that seem to have predated the program . <p> While the aircraft appears to be a good match to what we think the U.S. stealth HALE ( high altitude , long endurance ) drone known as the RQ-180 looks like , and the timing and location do make some sense , it is not the only possibility . China has a large number of stealthy flying-wing aircraft programs ongoing of all different sizes . Beyond its H-20 stealth bomber program , many stealth drone programs are publically underway , including a concept that is broadly similar to the RQ-180 , known as the CH-7 Rainbow . China 's Star Shadow , which has been in development for years , may also have some similarities to the shape we see in the image . Once again , that is one of a number of potential Chinese stealth drones , some of which we know have been in flight testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloaked in secrecy , that could potentially account for this sighting . <p> Chinese Internet -- A mockup of the CASC CH-7 UCAV at the 2018 Zhuhai airshow <p> Because we do not know the approximate altitude the aircraft was flying at , it is possible that this may not have been a strategic platform , it could be something a bit smaller that flies for long periods of time at medium altitudes , instead . Regardless , the appearance of Chinese stealthy drones will become commonplace in the region in the years to come , but this could have been a clandestine operation of one of these systems that has made it at least into an operational testing state . Collecting critical intelligence from a penetrating reconnaissance platform on the countries China has a standing dispute over the South China Sea with does makes sense . <p> As for the possibility that this was China 's H-20 stealth bomber , the chances of that are very low . The aircraft has not been unveiled and is not even thought to be in major flight testing , let alone flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transiting the area ? The image shows discreet features that are not indicative of the B-2 . If the image is legitimate , the chances of it being a B-2 with multiple illusions occurring to make its planform and wing design look very different are quite remote . Also , at least at the time of publishing , radio interceptors and plane trackers have not noticed any B-2s moving through the region . The RQ-170 is another candidate . We know it has been adapted to work in the maritime domain and it has spent time in Asia , but that would be an odd place for it to be and the wings do n't look right . Still , it is a possibility to consider . <p> With that being said , there are two other wrinkles in this story . First , the U.S. , U.K. , India , Japan , and Australia just held one of their biggest joint exercises ever in the Phillippine Sea . This would have been of the very utmost interest to China . While those activities wrapped up officially by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this aircraft was sighted . The same could be true for any Chinese warships movements in the same area , which would be of very high U.S. interest . <p> The South China Sea and the Phillippine Sea , and especially where the two connect , are among the most highly surveilled geographic areas on the planet earth , with dozens of surveillance aircraft , especially from China , the U.S. , and other regional stakeholders , working these areas on a daily basis . <p> Now for the final facet to this story , which may or may not be related . Local press in the Phillippines has reported on a scramble of fighters on a mystery , unresponsive aerial contact on the same day and around the same time as when the photo was snapped . Inquirer.net reported the following : <p> The Philippine Air Force ( PAF ) said Saturday it issued a " scramble order " for two FA-50 Aircraft light fighters to intercept an " unknown aircraft " that approached the Philippine airspace last Thursday . <p> PAF said the Philippine Air Defense Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone , approximately 120 nautical miles northwest of Bolinao , Pangasinan . <p> " The unidentified aircraft was heading towards Philippine airspace . Coordination with the CAAP classified it to be an unknown track of interest , " PAF said in a statement . <p> The unknown aircraft was at 21,000 feet flying at 265 knots heading northeast . <p> ... <p> " The FA-50s flew at the maximum allowable speed towards the direction of the unknown aircraft . At about 4 minutes into the intercept , the unknown aircraft changed direction towards the North and increased its speed to 400 knots and headed away from the Philippine airspace . The intercept was terminated at 9:45 A.M. , " PAF added . <p> Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Maynard Mariano told reporters that the agency could not tell the intent of the aircraft in approaching the country 's area of responsibility . He said there was no radio response from the unknown aircraft . <p> The biggest discrepancy here is the timeframe . This intercept ended some three and a half hours after the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stealthy aircraft did n't linger in the area after its picture was taken , as stealthy reconnaissance aircraft are pretty much built to do . The altitude is also too low for a HALE asset , but if the aircraft were a tactical platform , that may be possible . At the same time , a stealth aircraft like this would likely be equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems to help defend itself , so getting a firm altitude , assuming radar actually spotted it at all , may not have been possible . <p> So , we have a very intriguing image and a unique series of events and circumstances that surround it . <p> We wanted to get this up with some basic background and analysis . We will update this piece throughout the day as we can digest the image and work the story more . Finally , we want to underline once again , like any situation like this , it is possible this image is not authentic , so all information must be viewed as preliminary at this time . <p> Let us know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> It has been a day and a half since this article was published and went viral . Nobody has been able to invalidate the authenticity of the image , including those we asked to take a look at it . This could always change , but that is where it sits as of now . <p> Author 's note : A huge thanks to Michael Fugnit for sharing his image with us . He really has some gorgeous photography on his Facebook page , make sure to check it out here .

Now in the US , the Biden-Harris administration is committed to push abortion as a constitutional right , along with a plan to also promote abortion worldwide . <p> Swerving dramatically from his past pro-life stance , Biden , a Catholic , has said : " Women 's health care rights have been under attack as states across the country have passed extreme laws restricting women 's constitutional right to choice under any circumstance . " <p> Noted lifewire.com : " The statement also suggests that Biden now believes in an unrestricted right to abortion up until the moment of birth - an extreme position slowly becoming the norm among abortion activists . " <p> I ca n't help but quote St. Mother Teresa of Calcutta : " The greatest destroyer of peace in the world today is abortion , because it is a direct war , a direct killing .... If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion of abortions only confirms the signs of the times , that the world is now in peril of historic tribulations as prophesied by mystics . <p> Indeed , St. Michael told mystic Luz de Maria de Bonilla on December 30 , 2021 , soon after Biden and Harris were declared winners in the US elections by the US electoral college : <p> " Premeditated abortion is a crime against the Gift of life . God blessed humankind - and it has responded with aberrations against the Gift that it has received . The Divine Word is not respected ; those who are in charge of guiding the People of God do not apply heavy sanctions needed for this generation to desist from other aberrations . <p> " Deliberate abortion is a crime permitted on earth , and because of this , we suffer in Heaven at the hardness of the human heart ... <p> " Whoever consents to the practice of an abortion should repent , confess , and turn away from this terrible sin . Our King and Lord Jesus Christ sees inside every human being and deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 20 last year , St. Michael also told Luz : <p> " People of God , the virus that is keeping humanity in suspense has come as a prelude to the great trial that will befall all humanity : the unraveling of the shame of this generation that mourns those who suffer , those who die from this virus , but ignores the innocent who are continually sacrificed through abortion . " <p> To mystic Jennifer , Our Lord Jesus said last January 4 : <p> " My child , those who have committed these unjust acts upon My Little Ones , within the womb and outside the womb , are bathing themselves in the blood of the innocent . When they seek to destroy My Creation , My plan , know that the Hour of Justice is coming . It is in the blood of the innocent that mankind will find that his hour of reckoning has come .

Ah ! abortions , euthanasia - it all comes from evil , yet you are calm , as if everything ought to go back to how it was before . Be assured , My children , that nothing will go back to how it was before ; soon you will see the world change . Everything is over , yet you still do not understand .

No , four , for one of them would not really count , the Blessed Virgin told me ! " <p> Later , she clarified that she did not count one of the four because the Blessed Mother had told her that one of the popes would reign only briefly . Apparently , this pope was John Paul I who reigned only for 33 days . But Conchita also said the pope count referred only to the coming chastisement , not the end of the world . <p> Counting to four after John XXIII : Paul VI , John Paul I , John Paul II , Benedict XVI .

Our Mother said ( excerpts ) : <p> " Life is made up of trials ; on the earth reign both joy and pain ; it is up to you to know how best to face them . Today , I want you to be joyful : it is not possible to suffer without then rejoicing just as much . <p> " You will yet see days of trials , but Jesus will not leave you wanting for days of joy .

There are glimmers of hope that the world has now the antidote to combat the virus . The problem is that there is a huge disparity in the accessing of vaccines and medical products . According to the Third World Network ( TWN ) of Penang , Malaysia , high-income countries , accounting for 16 percent of the world 's population , have claimed 4.2 billion doses of the vaccines compared to 2.5 billion doses available to the 84 percent of the world 's population .

In a global health emergency in which substantial amounts of public funding have driven the research and development , it is simply unconscionable that these few pharmaceutical companies will benefit from their intellectual property monopolies while the world is suffering . " <p> In the light of the foregoing , it is incomprehensible why government frontline agencies -- DOH , DTI , DA and DFA -- have been hesitant in expressing support to the TRIPS Waiver initiative of developing countries . They have adopted a timid posture by advancing a weak argument : The WTO 's TRIPS flexibilities are enough . They are not , as outlined above . <p> If these agencies do not want to adopt the proposed TRIPS Waiver , they can push for another initiative that is equally significant policy-wise . Instead of negotiating on the supply of vaccines , our agencies can ask China and Russia to share with the Philippines the vaccine technology of Sinovac and Gamaleya Institute , all in the name of friendship and solidarity .

Early in this recent spell of eruptive activity , the airport closed briefly . <p> But for pilots and passengers flying to and from Catania at night when the volcano is calmer , a glimpse of fiery red in the dark sky makes for an exciting sight . <h> LIVING WITH A VOLCANO <p> With Etna 's lava flows largely contained to its uninhabited slopes , life goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like in recent days , lava stones rain down on streets , bounce off cars and rattle roofs . <p> But many residents generally find that a small inconvenience when weighted against the benefits the volcano brings .

Hikers and backpackers enjoy views of the oft-puffing mountain and the sparkling Ionian Sea below . For skiers who want uncrowded slopes , Etna 's a favorite . <h> IT CAN BE DEADLY <p> Inspiring ancient Greek legends , Etna has had scores of known eruptions in its history .

What we need to understand , however , is that those who are wealthy now -- and whose wealth did not come from inheritance or from lottery -- decided to set aside a portion of the money that was coming in , at some point in the past , and made it work for them . They may have expanded a business or ventured to new ones . They invested and re-invested resources over time until wealth was created . <p> This is where financial literacy comes in . Knowing what to do with your money and resources and how to make these work for you to grow wealth may be an abstract concept for many Filipinos . Finding a suitable investment to meet one 's requirements and risk appetite may be difficult .

The TOAP , the umbrella organization of all trust entities , has likewise taken steps to professionalize the trust industry and is working closely with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) so that the industry is in synch with BSP 's programs for financial inclusion , financial literacy and investor safety . <p> As advocates of financial inclusion , TOAP reaches out to the public by holding seminars and sponsoring activities that will introduce investing to all .

Wealth is created by starting to invest . It is a habit and a commitment . <p> The current pandemic highlights the need to have investments especially in times of unforeseen events . We now hear that the disparity between the poor and the rich is widening amid the pandemic . This is because some people have meticulously created wealth over the years , and it is now working for them . <p> There is no shortage to the investment outlets in the market that will cater to all , whatever the level of knowledge and experience in investing one has .

The BSP recently issued Circular No. 1109 which decreased the minimum requirement for an investment management account from P1 million to only P100,000 , allowing more Filipinos to start investing with a customized portfolio . Those who have less investible funds may invest in the Unit Investment Trust Funds ( UITFs ) which have standard investment plans for each fund type . Clients of the UITF , with the help of certified UITF sales personnel , will just have to undergo the client suitability assessment for the trust entity to determine the best UITF type for them .

( Alphaland ) offered a probationary employment for six months to petitioner Redentor Y. Agustin ( Agustin ) as executive chef with a gross monthly salary of P122,500 . The offer was accepted by Agustin . The letter-offer which likewise serves as an employment contract states : <p> " As an employee of Alphaland Corp . you are expected to render the highest quality of professional service and to always pursue the interest of the company . Any behavior or action contrary will become the basis for appropriate disciplinary action on the part of the Company including suspension and termination . " <p> Barely four months from commencement of his employment , Agustin received a notice of termination . He was informed that regular employment status can not be granted to him because he failed to meet the standards set forth by the company for his position . <p> Agustin filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against Alphaland praying for reinstatement and backwages . <p> Is there merit to his complaint ? <p> RULING : Yes . <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on the Court of Appeals uniformly found that Agustin was hired from the management 's standpoint as a probationary employee but was not informed of the reasonable standards by which his probationary employment was to be assessed . The standards set are too general and failed to specify with clarity what is expected of Agustin as an executive chef . Consequently , the lower courts found that Agustin 's dismissal was illegal . <p> Considering the foregoing , the probationary period set in the contract of employment dated July 6 , 2011 is therefore purposeless . In no case was Agustin hired on a probationary status by Alphaland . As of July 6 , 2011 , Agustin became part of Alphaland Corp . as a regular employee of the company without a fixed term of employment . <p> Second , Agustin served as a consultant prior to being hired as an executive chef allegedly on a probationary status . The consultancy engagement offer provided that Agustin served as a consultant from June 6 , 2011 until July 5 , 2011 , with a salary of P50,000 . Narrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible for setting up the kitchen , choosing the equipment , laying out the job description for each kitchen staff , and the preparation of menus for all cuisines that the Club will offer . Following the completion of Agustin 's tasks as the Club 's consultant , Alphaland proceeded to search for an executive chef to head the Club 's restaurants . Since the opening of the Club was fast approaching , Alphaland hired Agustin as the executive chef for all the Club 's restaurants . Alphaland claims that since it still had to assess and determine whether Agustin 's skills as executive chef are at par with what the Club requires , it hired Agustin as a probationary employee . <p> We find this circumstance contrary to the ordinary course of business . Mainly , consultants are hired to provide their expert advice and opinion on what needs to be done . Records show that Agustin has been in the culinary industry for almost 19 years already , won several contests , and had served well-known establishments in the Philippines and abroad . When Alphaland hired Agustin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his qualifications and skills to set up the " kitchen " at the Balesin Island Club .

@@72876233 <p> You see , as mentioned in our previous story , there were rumors that the big reveal of the 86 was going to be delayed because Toyota wanted the all-new sports car to simply be different from its BRZ twin .

One powertrain is available between the two : A four-cylinder Boxer engine with the same bore and stroke .

" But most businesses are also bracing for negative impact on worker productivity , and will thus help workers adapt . <p> WEF also says the " relative importance of skills sets is evolving , " and that employers are seen to favor or prioritize critical thinking and analysis , problem-solving , self-management , and technology use and development over physical abilities , core literacies , and management and communication of activities . <p> WEF also notes that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance " of critical thinking , analysis , and problem-solving .

" Ever-changing and dynamic business conditions are obviously driving these changes in skill sets . <p> What is crucial , moving forward , is how businesses -- and perhaps government -- can help people adapt to these changes and capably address the needs and demands of the times . As WEF notes , businesses must invest in upgrading their people 's skills if they wish to remain competitive . The report notes that " for workers set to remain in their roles over the next five years , nearly half will need retraining for their core skills . " <p> " The public sector also needs to provide stronger support for reskilling and upskilling of at-risk or displaced workers ...

@@72908232 <h> A green social contract without the people is anti-social <p> Like the Covid pandemic , the climate crisis is a threat to everyone . It is a threat to civilization . It clearly requires , policy-wise , a collective whole-of-society approach . All sectors of society , particularly the working people , should and must be involved . <p> In this context , the position taken by US Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the authors of the book A Planet to Win ( Aronoff et al. , 2019 ) is the right governance approach . Their vision of a " Green New Deal " ( GND ) requires the mobilization of entire society . And the task of " greening " the economy is linked to the performance of two other major societal tasks : putting the economy on the path of sustainability while addressing social and economic inequality . In short , it is a social contract undertaken by the whole society for a clear social purpose . <p> Unfortunately , the GND 's being floated in many countries in Asia and other parts of the world are social contracts only in name . Social and labor clauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtuse manner . Above all , there is no participation of the working people in the drafting of these GNDs . The overwhelming preoccupation of government agencies handling the climate and environmental issues is how to tinker or juggle the numbers on the mix of fossil fuels and renewables in order to show how their respective countries are complying with the mitigation targets of the Paris Agreement . But such an exercise , usually ending in a so-called net-zero emission target statement , is not a social contract . <p> Of course , the concept of a social contract between the governor and the governed is not new . Political scientists and philosophers have long been debating different theories on the social contract , from the divine right of kings to govern to the more enlightened concept that men and women , constituting a community or society , allow themselves to be under the rules of a government which guarantees justice , security and social protection to all citizens . <p> The " new deal " of US President Franklin Roosevelt belongs to the latter category . Based on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jobless America , Roosevelt launched a massive government stimulus program -- unheard of in the free-trade era of the early 20th century -- to create millions of jobs during the Great Depression of 1929-1933 ( Kelly , 2020 ) . Most of the jobs created turned out to be environmental in character , such as the hiring of men to plant trees , build flood barriers , fight forest fires , maintain roads and trails , and manage the National Parks . A Tennessee Valley Authority was established to build dams , stop flooding and generate affordable electricity for rural America . The social and labor aspects of the new deal included the passage of laws supportive of workers ' bargaining rights , enrolment in social security and financing of houses for the American working masses . Roosevelt 's " new deal " was in a sense the original " green new deal " or " green social contract . " <p> Now fast forward to 2009 , the year the global financial crisis broke out and clobbered stock markets around the world and pushed the global economy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an opportunity to ask the world leaders to address the GFC challenge by embracing a " Global Green New Deal , " which is similar in intent to Roosevelt 's new deal . The GGND appeal was specifically directed to the G-20 countries , which according to UNEP " produce 90 percent of the global GDP , 80 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions and command much of the world 's annual $150-250 billion fossil fuel subsidies . " The UNEP GGND advisory is win-win : revive the global economy and boost employment " while accelerating the fight against climate change , environmental degradation and poverty " ( UNEP , 2009a ) . <p> According to UNEP , the GGND ( UNEP , 2009b ) can achieve the following : <p> Creation of millions of " green jobs " in the expanding renewable energy sector , bolstered by the finding that investments in renewables create two or three times more jobs compared to the conventional energy development ; <p> Enhancement of the energy security of countries as they become less dependent on the production and importation of fossil fuels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geo-economic conflicts ; <p> Reduction of climate risks , for inaction leads to higher costs ; <p> Development of a green pathway for the realization of productive and sustained cooperation among government , private sector and other social actors ; and <p> Green-house gas mitigation . <p> The UNEP concluded that the GGND means many winners . The GGND lays " the foundation for a new , self-sustaining cycle of green growth globally , while steering the world on a course to end the scourge of energy poverty and avoid the threat of dangerous climate instability " ( UNEP , 2009b ) . <p> The overall framework of the GGND is that de-carbonization should go hand in hand with economic development . But why are governments , especially those from the advanced countries , hesitant to make commitments to the GGND ? <p> As it is , 12 years after the GGND proposal of UNEP , the world is still struggling to find ways to stop the catastrophic future arising from the runaway warming of Planet Earth . Instead of taking the GGND seriously by realigning their national budgets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exception of a few , simply went ahead with old-style budgeting unmindful of the urgent task of budgeting to combat the climate crisis . The phasing out of fossil-dependent power plants such as those running on coal , oil and gas did not happen , as monitored by the climate tracker in Berlin and as reflected in the continuing accumulation of GHG emissions in the Earth 's atmosphere . <p> Obviously , the transition to clean energy system has become a slow-by-slow process because those involved in the transition include the big investors in the fossil-reliant power sector . They happen to have powerful backers in government . They are naturally hesitant to give up profitable commercial interests on existing power systems despite the emerging fact that renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper . <p> So how can governments and the big business players in the power sector be nudged or persuaded or even forced to go green ? The answer is increase the pressure from below , from the citizenry , from the working people . There are examples given by the Transnational Institute based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how such pressure can help transform private/privatized public utilities to go green . One outstanding case is that of Hamburg , Germany , where a citizens ' movement succeeded in pushing the Hamburg local government to accept their collective demand for the city to go green and shift to renewable-energy generation ( e.g. , wind and solar ) . <p> The point is that it is not enough that a purportedly green social contract has social and labor clauses for the benefit of the people . A social contract is a contract with the people . Therefore , the citizenry should not only be informed and consulted but they should also be involved in the design , planning and implementation of the social contract . People should not be treated as mere objects of development . <p> It is in this context that the workers ' movements , which represent the working masses , should and must play a major and distinct role . They should help shape the social contract based on the people 's interests and , yes , they should lead in the implementation of the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@72997236 <h> Hofile ? a : Prelude to the Negrense uprising against Spain ( Second of three parts ) <p> IN THIS brief overview of the historic 1898 Negrense uprising against the Spanish colonial rule , we recall this event following the Katipunan revolt in the 1890s in Luzon . In this second part of our recollection , we briefly noted the beginnings of the Negrense reaction to the oppressive Spanish colonial system which we pointed out was mainly due to the Negrense concepts of political responsibilities and good government coupled with their awareness of the oppressive Spanish activities which violated their sense of human dignity and justice . We also noted the concomitant effects brought about by foreign influence through wider educational opportunities being experienced by Negrenses with the opening of international trade in 1855 . We also highlighted the effects of geographic mobility among many Negrenses to the iconic " Age of Enlightenment " sweeping Europe in the early 18th century . As soon as the insurrection in Luzon broke out in 1896 , the Spanish authorities in Negros became alarmed with the peace and order situation in Negros . Particularly disturbed were the guardia civil who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tagalog couriers . <p> Meanwhile , more reports were spreading among anti-government forces in other provinces which led the military to strengthen its positions . No sooner had the Spanish authorities reported to the Governor General about the Negrense situation , local revolutionary committees were indeed secretly being organized in the Island . Notable among the secret activities were leaders from Silay led by their central committee with Leandro Locsin and Melecio Severino providing material resources . The drug store of Locsin served as the collection center with a prescription book containing the list of contributors from various parts of Negros . To protect the identity of the donors , their names were secretly matched with names of the various medicines . The Negros Revolutionary Committee also contacted General Emilio Aguinaldo of their political activities in Negros to assure him of their support . Substantial donations were also given to Aguinaldo by Negrenses in Hong Kong . Other revolutionary groups were also being organized in Panay and Negros . <p> Sensing that the conspiracy against Spain was gaining ground in Western Visayas and related areas , Spanish General Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mindanao , was now given the new assignment to invite various prominent citizens of Visayas and Mindanao to form a " Council of Reforms . " The 24 Council Members were requested to draw up and submit to the Spanish government the plans they considered necessary to bring about civil and administrative reforms . Rios even offered ample autonomy to the Visayans who were willing to unite with the Spanish government in defending the areas against the newly arrived American forces who had already taken over Manila on August 13 , 1898 . Nothing came out of Gen. Rios ' offer and instead the Iloilo and Negros Revolutionary groups continued to recruit more supporters and secure more financial support . Meantime , officials of Aguinaldo were collecting more armaments not only to arm the insurgents and also for leverage at the ongoing Paris Peace negotiations . Finally , Panay leader Roque Lopez sent an urgent message to Aniceto Lacson on November 3 and the Negrenses unanimously voted to start the insurrection on November 5 , 1898 .

@@73046230 <h> Revisiting the Small Business Wage Subsidy Program <p> Last week , I discussed the Small Business Wage Subsidy Program ( SBWS ) , which is a collaborative project among three government institutions led by the Department of Finance ( DOF ) , in cooperation with the Social Security System ( SSS ) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) , to assist the more than 3 million workers of small and medium business enterprises negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> The program -- which opened on April 17 , 2020 and ended on June 24 in the same year -- was offered for only two months due to its limited budget allocation . SSS disbursed around P23.53 billion worth of financial aid to 3.08 million qualified workers in the first tranche . The second tranche covered a total amount of P22.08 billion and benefitted 3.05 million employees nationwide . <p> While this is the first time that SSS was tapped to carry out such a significant project , it is very inspiring to know these small business owners were delighted that the national government initiated extending financial assistance to them and their workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this crisis , the wage subsidies served as a great relief for them and their employees who did not receive any salary during the lockdown due to temporary and permanent closures of businesses . <h> Impact and learnings <p> First , an updated database is key to the success of a subsidy program . Identifying the rightful beneficiaries who will receive financial assistance is indeed challenging , especially if the list is not readily available . SSS was tapped for the SBWS program primarily for its organized and extensive database of private-sector employers and members nationwide . <p> We know the value of an updated record in granting the benefits to the rightful beneficiaries . And this is why we are continually reminding employers and members to regularly update their SSS records . <p> Second , implementing the SBWS program amplified the need for government institutions like SSS to embrace digitalization . Using the latest technological advancements can increase efficiency and speed up the delivery of government services to the public . <p> For this reason , we have been intensifying our efforts to expand our online services portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mas pinadali . Mas pinasimple . Mas pinabilis . " For the SBWS program , we successfully offered the required services online , from the application stage to disbursement of benefits . <p> Even before the pandemic , SSS has been working to make all its transactions available online . On May 31 , 2021 , even Maternity Benefit applications and reimbursement will be included as part of our digital services , along with sickness , unemployment , retirement , and death benefits . Even applications for loan offerings , like salary loans , can be facilitated through the My.SSS or SSS Mobile App . <p> Finally , the program gave emphasis to the use of digital payment methods to distribute government aid . A recent study conducted by a fintech payment company revealed that half of the online shopping transactions last year were coursed through cashless payment methods . Digital payment platforms are already gaining traction among Filipinos . We see it as an opportunity to shift from traditional face-to-face payouts to digital platform in disbursing government financial assistance . <p> In SBWS , we directly credited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to the convenience it offers , direct crediting of government aid has also eliminated corruption and helped stem the spread of the dreaded Covid-19 among beneficiaries who used to congregate and line up to receive aid . <p> While we learned a lot from the SBWS experience , we at SSS are also honored to play a significant role in implementing the government 's Bayanihan to Heal as One Act Program to assist the Filipino workers through this health crisis . <p> Have a safe and healthy week ahead ! <p> Aurora C.

@@73163233 <h> A brave face <h> Signs And Wonders <p> There was some convergence between market expectations of steady monetary policy on the part of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) and its two recent pronouncements . <p> Before the weekend , BSP Governor Ben Diokno was quoted saying " the BSP will continue to focus on keeping its monetary policy stance supportive of the government 's initiatives to address the effects of the pandemic , for as long as necessary , until the economic recovery gets underway . " This is a fair comment considering that the US Federal Reserve Board issued some forward guidance that it could accommodate its current policy settings until 2023 . This will also help the BSP keep domestic liquidity in dizzying quantity amounting to P2.2 trillion or 12% of GDP . <p> Two days ago , the BSP was again reported declaring that " the Fed rate hikes are seven quarters away . The Philippine government should continue with its game-changing Build , Build , Build program and its structural reforms pending in Congress . " The monetary authorities discount the possible threat of an early monetary normalization in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate adjustment could wait . After all , the Philippine macroeconomy has sound fundamentals and a " Fed rate hike in 2023 is less of a threat to the Philippine economy compared to other developing and emerging economies . " <p> The BSP could not have put on a braver face . <p> Market analysts , being generally backward-looking , took the hint and 14 out of 16 analysts polled projected the BSP would keep its policy rate steady . One outlier indicated a possible easing by 25 basis points even as the current policy rate is already below the 4.4% actual average inflation rate for the first five months . <p> The other outlier expected tightening by 25 basis points . As if a rebuke , one among the herd issued an incredible warning that " a calibration of rate settings at this point would derail the very fragile recovery and only delay the economy 's bounce back . " He must have an incurable faith in the signaling effect of a thin slice of a rate adjustment . <p> But some research outfits would rather place the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fitch Solutions Country Risk and Industry Research , for instance , expects the Monetary Board to be more preemptive by jacking up interest rate by as much as 50 basis points next year . Fitch believes in the possible recovery of the Philippine economy next year and unless some compensatory increases in its policy rate are done , the BSP might see some insipient depreciation pressures against the peso . But it is also seeing signs of pandemic resurgence due to the sluggish rollout of the vaccines . From a forecasting standpoint , it makes sense to be more conservative and assume that risks would appear earlier than would normally be expected . <p> If we are to give credence to the latest pronouncement of US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell , his hint of a future monetary policy stance is actually ambiguous . Bloomberg reported him saying , " the price increases seen in the economy recently are bigger than expected but reiterated that they will likely wane . " <p> The large size should call for a more progressive and preemptive move , but the short duration calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more careful in appreciating Powell . He covered his tracks by acknowledging the uncertainty around the view that the price pressure accompanying economic recovery could be short-lived . The Fed Chairman was also quick to say " they may turn out to be more persistent than we expected . " This means those large inflationary pressures might not be transitory . The flip side is that the US , after successfully overcoming the pandemic challenge , could already open up international travel and the macroeconomy . US economic recovery could be stronger than originally believed . <p> What seems to be the emerging view on the timing of policy rate normalization ? <p> Fed officials seem to be divided . <p> US Fed quarterly projections show 13 of 18 officials were in favor of at least one rate increase by end-2023 versus seven in March . This is exactly the inclination of the BSP and most market analysts . However , some 11 officials place the tightening twice before the end of 2023 . But one should not dismiss the view of seven members seeing some normalization as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one of the balls in the air . <p> President Biden 's decisive approach to pandemic management might just be the tipping point . The American Rescue Plan allocated $1.844 trillion or 8.8% of GDP , focused on providing public health response and time-bound assistance to families , communities and businesses . Unemployment benefits have been extended , direct aid supported local governments and funded school reopening . Various facilities were also introduced to support credit flow to key business sectors . <p> With confidence in the US economy seemingly restored , and the vaccines rolled out in a big way , the recovery in the world 's biggest economy should be forthcoming . <p> We believe this is the upside risk to inflation pressure both in size and duration . This could also be the US Fed 's uncertainty surrounding their forecasts . <p> The wild card is China .

@@73203237 <h> PNoy 's failed legacy in Mindanao continues under Duterte <p> The death of President Benigno ' Noynoy ' Aquino III saw the public mourn a leader they once jeered for the failures in his administration . Perhaps given the public 's exhaustion of this current administration 's pandemic response with a lockdown that has hurt the economy , and the continuing human rights violations , they must have seen PNoy 's administration and character as a better part of history . <p> But the legacy of PNoy needs more scrutiny . More than judging his character , his policies and decisions need to be held as part of evaluating history and also looking ahead for leaders to answer the questions of social justice and peace particularly in Mindanao . <p> His legacy for Mindanao was forging the long-sought peace and autonomy for the Bangsamoro people .

The standoff lasted around two weeks , displacing 109,000 in Zamboanga and another 19,000 in nearby Basilan island ( UN report ) . <p> In January 25 , 2015 , a covert military operation called Oplan Exodus launched in Mamasapano , Maguindanao province took down Zulkifli Bin Hir alias Marwan , an alleged international terrorist wanted in the US , resulting to the deaths of 44 members of the Special Action Force ( SAF ) that launched the attack .

@@73265234 <p> You make sure it has the correct tire pressure , you check how much tread remains , and you inspect to see if there are any cracks or debris that might cause the tire to suffer irreparable damage . <p> There is also the matter that needs discussion : tire rotation . For many , this is just something you leave to your local garage , but this is a very important part of tire care . <p> Simply put , tire rotation is the process of moving your car 's tires from one corner to another . Each type of vehicle has different driving characteristics . Rear-wheel-drive ( RWD ) , front-wheel-drive ( FWD ) , and all-wheel-drive ( AWD ) will have different effects on a tire 's inevitable wear . But there is a way to maximize the life of your tires through rotation . <p> Different Strokes , Different Folks <p> It 's important to understand what tires are intended to do . <p> Tires are designed to bear the weight of the vehicle , soak up the shock from the road , send power to the road , stop the vehicle , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while cornering , and disperse water . Needless to say , it is arguably ( if not actually ) the number one safety feature on your car . Knowing that then you need to really take care of those four pieces of radial rubber , steel , and other compounds . <p> The car you drive will largely determine how your tires wear because of the jobs it will have to perform based on the configuration . <p> In a front-wheel-drive car ( e.g. most sedans , hatchbacks , and crossovers like Vios , Mirage , CR-V , etc. ) it is the front tires that have to accelerate the car , stop the car , and steer the car around the bends . The rear tires are there to help with braking and with stability . Given that the front tires have to do the bulk of the work , those wear out far more than the rear tires . <p> If you have a rear-wheel-drive vehicle ( i.e. 4x2 ladder-frame vehicles like Fortuner , Terra , or RWD sports cars ) then the front tires handle steering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is more likely that the rear tires wear out more quickly . <p> For vehicles that make use of all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive ( i.e. some crossovers and SUVs , almost all Subarus ) , all four tires generally wear more evenly . But you 'll have to check the characteristic of the four-wheel-drive system in your vehicle because many tend to be front-wheel drive most of the time and only engage 4WD when it is needed . <p> Given how tires wear on a car , there is a need to spread out the wear by rotating the tires , like subbing in during a basketball game to give the star players a break . <p> But does tire rotation simply mean you can just switch the position of the front and rear tires ? Not exactly . Like what I mentioned earlier , it depends on the type of drivetrain your vehicle has . It will also depend if you have a full-size spare tire and directional tires which we 'll get to talk about later . <p> For now , here are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tires that are non-directional and uniform in size . <p> Forward Cross Rotation : For FWD vehicles <p> This is perhaps the most common pattern for FWD vehicles . The front tires are moved to the rear axle and are kept on the same side . Meanwhile , the rear tires are moved towards the front but are switched between left and right . <p> Rearward Cross : For AWD/4WD and RWD vehicles <p> This type of tire rotation serves as the complete opposite of the forward cross method . Recommended for AWD , 4WD , and RWD vehicles , the rear tires are moved towards the front and kept on the same side of the vehicle . The front tires , on the other hand , are replaced to the opposite sides of the rear axle . <p> X-Pattern : Alternate tire rotation method for FWD vehicles <p> Aside from the Forward Cross method , the X-pattern method can also be used for FWD vehicles . The front tires are transferred diagonally to the rear axle , while the rear tires are moved to the front on opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spare Tire ? <p> For cars with a full-size spare ( not the space-saving " donut " ) , they can use the rearward cross and forward cross tire rotation methods . This is to ensure that the full-size spare also get even treadwear along with the other four tires . <p> Rearward Cross ( with full-size spare ) -- Both the rear tires are moved towards the front axle . The right front tire is moved to the left side of the rear axle , while the left front tire becomes the new spare . <p> Forward Cross ( with full-size spare ) -- The rear tires are moved diagonally to opposite sides of the front axle . The right rear tire becomes the new spare while the left tire is moved directly to the left rear axle . Meanwhile , the spare tire now becomes the right rear tire . <p> Front-to-Back : For cars with directional tires <p> For cars fitted with directional and high-performance tires , the rotation methods are actually simpler . This is because these types of tires have a tread pattern designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire can not be driven in reverse ; it just means that the tires are intended to be driven fast if mounted a certain way . Oftentimes these directional tires have a pattern designed to disperse water on the road if installed correctly . <p> Cars with directional tires can rotate their rubber by using the Front-To-Back method . All tires are moved from one axle to the other but remain on the same side of the vehicle . This means the front left tire is moved to the left rear while the rear left tire is moved to the left side front . <p> Side-to-Side : For staggered setups on high-performance cars <p> There is a conundrum with cars that have staggered sizes . Most cars have what we call " square " tires ; meaning the sizes are exactly the same on all four corners of the vehicle . But some cars -mostly high-performance cars- have different size tires in front versus the back . Typically , these are rear-wheel drive ( sometimes all-wheel drive ) vehicles that need wider rear tires because they need a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that , they can use the Side-to-Side method . All of the tires are switched with their similarly-sized partner and remain on the same axle . This means the right front tire will trade places with the left front tire , while the two tires on the rear will also do the same . <p> When to rotate your tires ? <p> So we now know the common tire rotation methods that will ensure each tire is worn evenly . But when do you actually have to rotate your tires ? According to tire manufacturers , they recommend rotating your tires every 8,000 kilometers . Alternatively , drivers can also rotate their tires every time they have their vehicle 's oil changed . That way , they can remind themselves to not only change their fluids but also check on their tires . <p> If you 're the type of driver that can easily rack plenty of kilometers ( i.e. over 25,000 km per year ) , you can factor in an additional tire rotation besides the average 8,000-kilometer interval as recommended . <p> While rotating one 's tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , it is a very important practice in vehicle ownership . It 's like alternating between certain pairs of shoes over the course of a week or a month ; if you wear one more often than others , then that pair will definitely break down first . The goal is to spread it out and balance . <p> If you do that , then you can have even treadwear which results in optimal braking , acceleration , control in wet weather , and longer tire life overall . And unless you like having to buy tires , it 'll save you money in the long term as well .

@@73279233 <p> The all-new Toyota Land Cruiser 300 may have just been launched recently , but it looks like it might already face some competition from China . While some might say the Land Cruiser is in a league of its own , Great Wall Motors ( GWM ) likes to believe it has built a vehicle to match it . <p> This is the GWM Tank 600 , and it looks lean and mean .

But what will this beast of an SUV actually offer once it 's officially revealed ? <p> Let 's start by looking at the design sketches of the upcoming SUV .

Reportedly dubbed the 6Z30 , the motor will reportedly put out 354 PS and 500 Nm of torque . Power will then be sent to an 8-speed automatic transmission derived from ZF . Aside from a twin-turbo V6 , GWM will apparently introduce a hybrid version of the Tank 600 , too . <p> There 's no exact date yet as to when Great Wall Motors will launch the Tank 600 . But if the leaked photo is to be believed , then it might not be long before it 's revealed to the public . Will the Tank 600 be able to impress ? Or will Great Wall Motors ' big SUV just be all show ?

If he sells lower , with less profit , he disposes of his vegetables within the day . He then returns to Divisoria to buy more vegetables . It is a daily grind that lets him survive the lockdown . <p> THE government should partner with retailers and explore alternative sale channels , such as online and Kadiwa , to directly sell cheaper imported pork to Filipino consumers , industry players said . <p> Industry players and an economist told the BusinessMirror that the government must address the value chain problems hindering consumers to feel the cheaper price of imported pork . <p> The BusinessMirror learned that the Department of Agriculture ( DA ) called for an emergency meeting last week with meat importers to discuss concerns over prevailing prices in the domestic market . <p> Two industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Meat Processors Inc. -- alongside other registered meat importers were present at the meeting . <p> People who attended the meeting told the BusinessMirror that the atmosphere was " cordial " and " cooperative " in <p> nature as both government officials and private stakeholders agreed that there 's a need to resolve value chain problems , especially at the retail side . <p> Sources told the BusinessMirror that one sticking point during the meeting was that imported frozen pork is being sold at the retail level at P100 higher than the price being passed on by meat importers or traders . <p> Meat importers and traders are selling imported pork liempo to retailers , including supermarkets , at P230 to P240 per kilogram price level , while pork kasim ranges from P140 to P150 per kilogram . <h> Recruit like-minded retailers <p> Jesus C. Cham , Meat Importers and Traders Association ( MITA ) president , proposed that the government " recruit like-minded retailers and traders " to be able to lower the prices of pork in the market at a wider scale . <p> This way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very reasonable price level -- way below prevailing prices -- that is affordable to consumers while ensuring sufficient profit margin across the value chain , especially to retailers . <p> Nonetheless , Cham said the government has already achieved the price level it has set for imported pork . Citing data presented by DA officials during the meeting , imported pork liempo is now sold at an average of P290 per kilogram and kasim , at around P250 per kilogram , he added . <p> The government is targeting to bring down pork prices below P300 per kilogram , starting with imported pork . However , the scale of the lower prices has not been felt across Metro Manila due to various factors , Cham said . <p> One of which , he pointed out , is the low purchasing power of consumers that has been worsened by the pandemic coupled with high price mark-up by retailers , especially in the wet market , who are trying to recover losses . <p> " The pass-on price from importers has come down significantly . There 's still room for consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to involve the retailers , " he told the BusinessMirror . <h> Issue of management <p> Economist Pablito M. Villegas told the BusinessMirror that the huge price disconnect between the retail level and the importer/trader level is a " simple " management issue that government could address through various means . <p> One option is for the government to intensify the rollout of Kadiwa by putting up Kadiwa stores that only sell meat products -- both imported and locally produced -- in poorer barangays in Metro Manila . <p> The rollout could be done with the government partnering with logistics or cold chain companies to be able to secure reefer vans that will position the meat products in the selected areas or markets , Villegas explained . <p> " Selling both imported and fresh pork gives the consumers the power of choice . Let them decide what they will buy based on their preference whether its price or quality , " he said . <p> Villegas also proposed that the DA engage with the retailers , particularly the wet market vendors , and negotiate a deal with them to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an incentive . <p> Villegas said this could be done through the DA 's P40-million freezer program -- the retailers could only benefit from the grant if they agreed to sell imported pork at a level that is lower than prevailing market prices . <p> Another option is for government to explore the use of online market platforms and tapping resellers at the barangay level , Villegas said.Villegas explained that it is only natural for retailers to put a high mark-up price on imported pork to rake in missed profits , especially with its huge discrepancy with locally produced fresh pork . <p> " It is an aberration . It is the characteristic of a highly imperfect market . The solution in a perfect market condition is not applicable to an imperfect market -- to the Philippines due to the greed across the value chain that you can not moderate , " he said . <p> " The only option is to saturate the market with imported pork and provide support even at the retail level , " he added .

He initially pushed back , seeking more time , against the advice of trusted aides but ultimately relented and decided to resign before state lawmakers could begin a process that would likely have made him the first New York governor to be impeached in more than a century . <p> The announcement capped a remarkable fall for the governor , who was lauded for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 only to see his administration swallowed up in scandal -- over his alleged sexual misbehavior , the underreporting of nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus and his potential abuse of public resources as he wrote a book last year about the pandemic in New York . <p> As his handling of the pandemic came under increasing scrutiny , including through an ongoing federal inquiry , a series of reports about his personal behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepares to leave office , Cuomo could potentially face criminal charges related to the allegations against him . He is also being sued by one his accusers , former aide Lindsey Boylan . <p> Cuomo has denied all of the allegations , saying he never touched anyone inappropriately , but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable . <p> He continued to skirt the line between apology and excuses during his remarks on Tuesday , thanking the women who came forward with " sincere " complaints , but -- as he did earlier this year -- he insisted that he was , politically , the victim of evolving social norms . <p> " In my mind , I 've never crossed the line with anyone . But I did n't realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn , " Cuomo said . " There are generational and cultural shifts that I just did n't fully appreciate . And I should have -- no excuses . " <h> Coming to Cuomo 's defense <p> Before Cuomo spoke , his personal lawyer , Rita Glavin , attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monologue in which she claimed that the governor had been railroaded by a " mob mentality " among his critics . <p> Glavin accused James and investigators of bias and sought to chip away at each of the accusers ' allegations . In some cases , she issued full denials on Cuomo 's behalf . In another , Glavin sought to undermine the credibility of an accuser . She also claimed , as Cuomo did earlier this year , that a number of the women cited in the report misinterpreted his actions , which she said were innocent . <p> " They started with a presumption that he had done some terrible things , " Glavin said of the attorney general 's team , " and it went from there . " <p> She also addressed the allegations from a state trooper who was reportedly brought on to Cuomo 's protective detail at his personal request . Glavin insisted that Cuomo had sought to add her to the group in an effort to diversify the force and denied that the governor harassed her , but then apologized on his behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for anything he did that caused Trooper 1 discomfort . " <p> " I think that women should be believed and they should be believed and treated fairly , " Glavin said after cycling through accusations against Cuomo . " I also believe that men should be believed and treated fairly . " <h> Reacting to the governor 's departure <p> James did not respond to Glavin 's assertions or Cuomo 's charge that political motivations guided many of those who sought his departure , but said the governor 's resignation closed " a sad chapter for all of New York " with " an important step towards justice . " <p> " I thank Governor Cuomo for his contributions to our state , " James said in a statement . " The ascension of our Lieutenant Governor , Kathy Hochul , will help New York enter a new day . We must continue to build on the progress already made and improve the lives of New Yorkers in every corner of the state . " <p> Stewart-Cousins , the state Senate majority leader , told CNN on Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with its impeachment process after Cuomo 's resignation . <p> " It 's up to the Assembly whether or not they want to continue down the path , " she said . <p> Stewart-Cousins dismissed Cuomo 's criticism of the report as politically motivated and pointed to the " evidence " turned up by the investigators . <p> " We all had confidence in the AG 's ability to take these women 's allegations seriously , " she said . " We 've been very clear about zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace . " <p> In a mark of how drastically the political winds have shifted in the aftermath of the report , New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs , for years one of Cuomo 's closest allies , had been among those calling for him to resign . The governor had rebuffed him at first , last week , but when the announcement came on Tuesday , Jacobs in a statement did not mention the name of his longtime friend -- instead focusing on the historic nature of Hochul 's ascent . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not be in better hands , " Jacobs said . Her experience at all levels of government -- Town Board Member , County Clerk , Congresswoman , and Lieutenant Governor , makes her uniquely well-equipped to effectively govern the State at this time . " <p> Among progressives , who had warred with Cuomo from early on in his tenure , his decision was met with glee . The rivalry between the governor and the state 's left-wing lawmakers and activists exploded years ago over his blessing of an alliance between a breakaway band of Democratic lawmakers and state Senate Republicans , which helped keep Democrats out of the majority and stall the liberal policy agenda . <p> When Cuomo was challenged from the left by actress Cynthia Nixon in 2018 , their contentious relationship descended into all-out political warfare . But in the end , despite his best efforts , many of the governor 's leading opponents outlasted him . <p> " The culture of bullying , abuse , and corruption under Andrew Cuomo has finally been brought to an end , " Sochie Nnaemeka , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement . " We look forward to working with our champions in the legislature to address the urgent issues facing working New Yorkers across our state , including record rates of homelessness , the slow disbursement of rent relief and the Excluded Workers ' Fund , and deep inequities in health care . " <p> She urged the legislature " to continue with impeachment proceedings so that Andrew Cuomo is never again elevated to a position of power . " <p> New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , whose feuds with Cuomo had often consumed city and state politics , said the governor 's decision was " for the good of all New York . " De Blasio 's likely successor , Brooklyn Borough President and Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams , a figure more ideologically in step with Cuomo , also praised the governor for standing down . <p> " The governor 's resignation was necessary for New York State to move forward and continue the critical work of our recovery , " Adams said in a statement . " I look forward to working in partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and region at this pivotal moment . " <p> For all the political drama surrounding the report , Cuomo 's response to the allegations on Tuesday was similar to the explanation he had given months earlier . Still , his few moments of contrition failed to move his critics , whose ranks grew along with the number of allegations , including one that went back more than two decades to his time leading the Department of Housing and Urban Development under then-President Bill Clinton . A more recent allegation at a wedding in 2019 created the appearance of a pattern of behavior that enraged rivals and largely quieted his small circle of allies . <h> The calls for his resignation <p> The governor , who as recently as last year appeared to be a shoo-in to be elected a fourth time in 2022 , had resisted calls for his ouster since late February , when allegations first piled up . But the damning details in the attorney general 's report led to another groundswell , this time from President Joe Biden , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and powerful New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House Democratic leadership , and Gregory Meeks . <p> The public also swiftly turned on Cuomo , whose support was diminished during the scandals but had not -- until last week -- looked to be bottoming out . <p> Seventy percent of New York voters said Cuomo should resign , according to a new poll released last Friday by Quinnipiac University . That number included 57% of registered Democrats , 76% of independents and 88% of Republicans . Among Democrats , the figure had risen 34 percentage points since Quinnipiac last asked the question in March . <p> Cuomo 's approval rating fell to an all-time low of 28% . <p> The probe conducted by independent investigators hired by James found that Cuomo harassed current and former state employees , as well as a number of women outside of state government . The governor again had denied the allegations shortly after the report was released , but lawmakers in and out of New York had made their calls for his exit unequivocal in the days since . <p> " Recognizing his love of New York and the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , " I call upon the Governor to resign . " <p> Biden , who had previously said he would await the report 's findings , also called on Cuomo to step down . On Tuesday , White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden had no regrets . <p> " The President made clear his views last week , and those stand . Our view is that this is a story about these courageous women who came forward , told their stories , shared their stories , " Psaki told reporters . " And the investigation overseen by the attorney general that , of course , completed today in an outcome that the President called for just last week . " <p> Biden 's message last week was the same one delivered by US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who reiterated their past calls for Cuomo 's resignation in a joint statement following the state attorney general 's findings . <p> " No elected official is above the law . The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the New York Democrats said .

" <p> Sen.

" Which brings us to the question : Is Octa being punished for being right ? " <p> Gordon said : " Using the power of congressional oversight to question the motives of a private non-profit group whose members are academics with published credentials is a waste of resources and constitutes a veiled attempt to assign the blame to the bearer of bad news . Accusing the same group of " gaming the system " by brazenly trying to manipulate the health emergency in order to promote its professional reputation at the expense of public welfare is a preposterous idea which can not be allowed to fester by allowing idle minds to sensationalize it ' in aid of legislation .

These times require the best from all of us . Nowadays , solidarity is self-interest . If we fail to understand this , everyone loses . "

Eventually , the newspaper was banned and shut down after nearly three years of publication . <p> Osme ? a was the foremost Filipino leader in the early American colonial government when he was elected as the Speaker of the First Philippine Assembly in October 1907 at the age of 29 . Former Gov . General William Howard Taft , who later served as the President of the United Assembly , had remarked after witnessing Osme ? a sworn into office : " He is a young man , not 30 , but of great ability , shrewdness , high ideals , and yet very practical in his methods of dealing with men and things . " Osme ? a used these qualities to effectively serve his people . As the highest elected Filipino in the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor general . Meanwhile , he remained the president of the Nacionalista Party , a political banner that he co-founded with Quezon and other Filipino leaders . He adopted immediate and complete independence of the Philippines as its political platform , a crusade that he vigorously espoused in his patriotic paper , El Nuevo Dia . For this , some had regarded him as the Father of Filipino Nationalism . But not given to aplomb , Osme ? a did not claim credit for it . But the fact is , as early as June 19 , 1908 , Osme ? a had declared our people 's desire and readiness for independence in a speech he gave in a session of the Philippine Assembly : " Gentlemen of the Assembly ... on my responsibility as Speaker of this House , I declare solemnly before God and before the world that ... our people aspire for independence ; that they consider themselves capable of conducting an ordered life , efficacious for themselves and for others in the concert of free and civilized nations ; and that we believe that if at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the Filipinos in favor of their liberty , they would , upon assuming all the consequent responsibilities , be able to comply with their duties to themselves and to others , without detriment to liberty , justice and right . " <p> Osme ? a stayed in his post until 1916 when the Jones Law was approved , which promised independence to the Philippines . The enactment of this law by the US Congress was a tribute to Osme ? a 's leadership . Under him , the Filipinos had demonstrated that they were capable of self-government . This law also created a bicameral legislature consisting of the House of Representatives ( HoR ) and the Senate . He chose to stay in the lower House and was elected as Speaker . Quezon , who was his deputy in the Philippine Assembly , ran for senator and was elected Senate President . As the head of the Upper Chamber , Quezon challenged Osme ? a who was then the president of Nacionalista Party and charged him with unipersonal style of leadership . Quezon formed his own party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective leadership . In the election of 1922 , both Quezon and Osme ? a ran for senator with their respective slates of candidates . A third party , Partido Democrata of Juan Sumulong , also took part in the elections . Not one of the 3 contending parties won the majority in either House . The feuding Osme ? a and Quezon resolved their differences and consolidated their forces against Sumulong . So as not to derail his party 's program for immediate and complete independence , Osme ? a agreed for Quezon to keep the Senate presidency . Manuel Roxas , a Quezon ally , was elected to take Osme ? a 's former post as Speaker of the HoR . Osme ? a , a newly elected senator , became Senate President Pro Tempore under Quezon . Osme ? a lost the supreme leadership of Filipinos serving the colonial government but he won our people 's respect as a champion of national unity . And this was not the full measure of Osme ? a 's unselfish leadership since a greater test awaited him . <p> VP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines on November 15 , 1943 since the Philippine Constitution at that time placed an eight-year limit on the term of the president . The American authorities knew about this and legal experts of both countries agreed that Osme ? a by operation of law would replace Quezon . Because of the war , Quezon did not want to step down although he was already sick , and on a number of occasion Osme ? a had acted as president when Quezon was indisposed . Once more , Osme ? a , not wanting to divide the country at a crucial time in our history , acted to preserve the unity of the Filipino leader while on exile abroad . Instead of exercising his constitutional right , Osme ? a asked the US Congress to approve a resolution waiving the eight-year limit and allow Quezon to stay in office until the end of the war . This act of self-sacrifice on the part of Osme ? a has no equal in our political history . In my book , Osme ? a is our country 's first statesman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His patriotism was second to none and he was happy to subordinate his personal interests for the common weal . It 's tragic that Osme ? a 's exemplary example is lost on our present crop of politicians . They profess themselves as patriots yet they will do anything to capture the presidency , or worse , circumvent the Constitution to keep it .

This continued towards the first and second terms of Marcos -- until Martial Law was declared , which led to erratic economic growth rates , jumping up and down each year , from a high of 8.8% then progressively decreasing to -7.3% in 1984 and 1985 , marking two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are experiencing today . Though many things were external like oil prices , Almendras says that political pressure on economic decision makers and technocrats of the Marcos regime took away from sensible economic policies . Massive inflation ( at one point hitting 62.8% in September 1984 ) , excessive spending , and , of course , massive corruption ensued , and government investments were mismanaged . The final whammy was the heightened political risk which ultimately dampened the foreign investment climate . Infrastructure spending plunged to the lowest levels as the government was unable to pay its debts . <p> As decisions in the political arena have a direct impact on the economy , it is not enough to denounce Marcos ' scions or cronies out of mere conscience , although this is an excellent first step ; but truly a better and quite clear way forward is to select a leader that will not burden the people with mismanaged amounts of debt . For we must keep in mind that the story of the Marcoses is not simply one of extravagance in buying shoes and art and smuggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated and complex that that ; it is a master class on how the mismanagement of foreign investments , the dwindling reputation of political leaders , the threat to press freedom , and violence can cripple an economy almost instantly . <p> What then is our role as economic actors , as financial market movers , as investors , entrepreneurs ? It is to understand and better educate the public on the impact of economic decision making , from the tax increases in tobacco and oil , the transport hikes , the imports of pork , the flight of the POGOs , the retail trade liberalization act , the lowering of corporate taxes -- vis- ? -vis , the impact on the bottom-line of firms , the impact on the competitiveness of the Philippines versus our Asian peers , the sustainability of operations from an environmental , social , and governance perspective -- and how this bottom-line affects : the unemployment rate of the country , the brain drain from the flight of the OFWs , the poverty levels . <p> And it gets even more specific in the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of the health spending and dwindling fiscal aid or ayuda on the productivity of the labor force , on the ability to maintain the economy open and running ; The impact of keeping classes closed on the earnings of graduates in the future and how this severely limits their prospects .

The impact of infrastructure spending and the slow pace of construction on ballooning debt . And the idea of banking on short-term gains , remittances , BPOs , to save us instead of sound government policies . <p> These are all issues that can be brought to light and better addressed in this period , this is an opportunity to debate , to compare the difficulties economically then with now , and this is the time to take courage to learn from the past , from the dark past , but also from the highly avoidable pains of a rough economic past . <p> Daniela " Danie " Luz Laurel is a business journalist and anchor-producer of BusinessWorld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to this , she was a permanent professor of Finance at I ?

@@73483235 <p> We 've said it many times : this year is a great one if you 're in the market for a rugged seven-seater SUV . <p> Many competitors are fielding fresh and updated models in this space . Everyone wants a bigger piece of the market , and that 's why we 're seeing more features , better looks , enhanced interiors , improved performance , and confidence-inspiring safety than we ever have before in this class . <p> Isuzu , however , has somewhat of an advantage in timing . While many competitor models like the Toyota Fortuner , Mitsubishi Montero Sport , Ford Everest , and Nissan Terra are updates of the current generation , Isuzu is not in sync . The mu-X that just landed in showrooms is not a facelift , but an all-new generation . <p> Prior to the launch , Isuzu gave us a sneak peek of the mu-X with a test drive event in Laguna . But given that it 's such a restricted and small area , we are hesitant to give it a full review . For that , we need to have a vehicle for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least ) , and really learn its ins and outs . <p> Even with the limitations , there are many things we can say about the mu-X . Even after just a day , we can tell that Isuzu went to work in making sure their SUV in such a competitive category is ready for the challenge . And what is clear is that Isuzu based the engineering and design of the mu-X on valid customer feedback . <p> Let 's explain why . <p> 1 . Upmarket Curb Appeal <p> Many rivals in the 7-seat PPV ( pick-up passenger vehicle ) class are typically styled to be more rugged and more truck-like , and Isuzu was n't immune to that in the past when they did the first-gen mu-X and the Alterra . But now , they 're going for something more upscale with the mu-X . <p> In the initial set of photos during the world premiere of the mu-X in Thailand , the model looked a bit strange . However , when you walk up to it in person , things actually change rather dramatically . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very sophisticated . They did n't adopt the styling of the D-Max with its sharper creases and lines ; instead , they seem to want the mu-X to flow . The body is n't boxy either ; this is a rather curvaceous SUV and has rather large 20 " wheels in the LS-E trim . There are no quasi 4x4 details like chunky black pieces of plastic trim or silver faux skid plates even for the 4x4 model . <p> This shift in how they designed the mu-X is a sign that Isuzu is moving away from their truck roots with this SUV . That 's actually quite courageous for Isuzu 's designers , as one of the reasons they have such a loyal fan base is because Isuzu has given them what they wanted . But for the brand to grow , they have to expand the curb appeal far outside the loyal clientele and take away sales from upmarket crossovers while offering the robust qualities of a truck . <p> 2 . High-Grade Interior <p> The moment I stepped into the mu-X ( in this case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality compared to the predecessor . The previous generation mu-X ( 2014-2021 in PH ) was never a vehicle that we considered impressive in terms of interior quality because much of it was plastic ... and not the impressive kind . <p> Today that all changes . Examine the materials and much of it feels and looks very high grade ( at least in the LS-E ) . The leather has a nice smell , the dashboard materials have a nice texture , and the gaps in the panels are very consistent ; actually , that last one we were able to test with a panel gap ruler . <p> The interior design and quality upgrade are as profound as moving from an apartment with flat-pack particle board furniture to a premium condo unit with solid wood tables and fixtures . That is not an exaggeration ; go see for yourself . <p> 3 . The Attention to Comfort <p> What truly surprised me is the attention that Isuzu paid to comfort . Since this was derived from the D-Max , the driving ergonomics are fantastic and a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment on the steering wheel you can set it to your body shape and height . The seat shape for the driver 's seat is also excellent , and that 's without touching the lumbar support yet . <p> The middle row is one of the highlights of the mu-X because they reworked the lower part of the B-pillar to give more toe room when going in . The seat cushioning is superb ; it 's not memory foam levels of soft , but it 's very comfortable . The fold-down armrest also has cupholders that slide out ; Isuzu did n't cut out from the top to give the passengers more surface to put their forearms on . <p> The only thing missing is a sliding function for the middle row , but that 's alright . There 's plenty of legroom in the middle anyway . And speaking of the third row , the mu-X now has our favorite one of the lot because of the comfortable proportions , the very adequate knee , and headroom , as well as the reclining function . Fully grown adults wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Ask me how I know . <p> 4 . The Tech Package <p> Being that this is an LS-E , it basically came with everything that Isuzu can put in . <p> Owners of the previous mu-X and/or Alterra may find it strange that the drop-down screen has been omitted even for the LS-E model , but here 's the thing : Isuzu customer feedback states that the rear screens are rarely used . So Isuzu instead focused on having a bigger 10.1 " head unit with Apple CarPlay , Android Auto , and Bluetooth . All variants actually get the same infotainment system and navigation , but the LS-E has 8 speakers while the other versions get 6 . <p> There are many USB ports all around including 2 for the middle row and a 220-volt outlet ( for the LS-E ) . so you can charge your laptop on the go . One major absence is a handbrake lever for all variants ; the reason is that Isuzu upgraded all mu-X models with an EPB or electronic parking brake . All versions even have auto brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold back on is safety . Apart from the stronger chassis ( more on that later ) , all versions of the mu-X have enough safety letters to fill up a Scrabble bag : ABS , EBD , BA , ESC , TCS , BOS ( brake override ) , HSA , and HDC . To put that in perspective , the previous generation base model mu-X did n't even have ABS . All models get at least 2 airbags as per usual , but the LS-E models get 7 : dual front , dual side , dual curtain , plus one more for the driver 's knee . <p> Like the D-Max , the mu-X gets a lot of ADAS safety features . The mid-grade LS-A has a blind-spot warning , a rear cross-traffic alert , a rearview camera ( no 360 , unfortunately ) , and rear sensors . In the LS-E that list gets expanded with auto high beams , lane departure warning , forward collision warning , autonomous emergency braking , and much more . The feature most drivers will like is adaptive cruise control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enhanced Utility and Versatility <p> What surprised us with the mu-X is Isuzu 's attention to the versatility when it comes to the cargo area which is much better than the predecessor . <p> The third and second rows are both fold flat and create a continuous space that is perfect for long cargo . I always bring a tape measure to these things , and the maximum length to the back of the driver 's seat is 79 inches , while the maximum length to the back of the second-row seat ( if occupied ) is 46 inches . That 's pretty spacious compared to the rest of the class . <p> The width occupied by the third row is 43 inches , which is also good . Isuzu reckons that a full golf set can fit in the trunk space that 's left if all rows are occupied because of a recess on the left panel that extends the width to 51 inches . What we also like is the rather discreet compartment behind the third row . <p> Maybe we should n't be surprised with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name after all : mysterious utility-X . <p> 6 . Enhanced Driving Performance <p> Even though the driving space was limited , we can already tell that there 's a significant improvement in performance . <p> One of the reasons behind it is the improved engine : the LS-E gets the 3.0L 4JJ3-TCX . It 's more powerful at 190 PS ( previous : 177 PS ) and has more torque at 450 Nm ( previous : 380 Nm ) . There 's also the RZ4E 1.9L that has been retained from the previous model for lower grade variants . As before the gearbox options remain unchanged : 6 forward speeds in either automatic or manual . Most are rear-wheel drive as only the top-spec model gets 4x4 with the off-road mode but no electronic diff lock . <p> The powertrain , however , is just one aspect of why driving is better . The ladder frame is stronger and lighter than before because of better and stiffer steel . The suspension is very much improved in front and in the back . The major difference is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all variants . <p> There were many upgrades to the ruggedness of the mu-X too with the extensive under-chassis protection for critical parts ( e.g. skid plate for the larger 80-liter fuel tank ) as well as the higher ground clearance at 235mm . And just like the D-Max , the water wading of this mu-X is 800mm because the air intake has been raised up to 1080mm . <p> The only real question mark is the tailgate . Yes , it 's motorized for the LS-E , but Isuzu opted for a rather different material . The windscreen in the back is glass , but the tailgate panel itself is n't steel or aluminum . It 's plastic ; polypropylene , to be exact . That was done to reduce weight , and Isuzu says it wo n't be an issue given the new chassis with the integrated bumper support directly bolted to the frame rails . If you want to see it , check out the video above . <p> What I think Isuzu achieved with the mu-X is centered around one key concept : futureproofing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are n't changed every five years ; more like 8 to 10 . And what Isuzu did was to anticipate that they have to make the mu-X competitive for longer , and so they poured their resources into engineering and designing a vehicle that is futureproofed for what will likely be another 8 or even 10 years until the next generation . <p> And given that many of the competitors are upgrades , Isuzu is coming in with everything they got . The only thing that can really hold them back now is the global chip and parts shortage , but that will hopefully be sorted out soon enough .

@@73570240 <h> Social media health myths are destroying the lives of teenage girls <p> Ronja Holopainen did n't mean to fall down the rabbit hole . But , like so many things online , it just happened . One day last spring , the 21-year-old medical student was scrolling through Instagram when she stumbled into the strange world of period misinformation . <p> Her journey started simply enough . Searching Instagram using the hashtags " period " and " menstruation , " she quickly came across a deluge of posts promoting unsubstantiated ideas , such as girls being able to regulate or predict periods based on their astrological signs . Visiting the accounts responsible for them appeared to populate her feed with even more falsehoods . <p> " When you get to one page , you start scrolling to the next and the next , and end up somewhere on the deep web , " she said . <p> The volume of distortions and inaccuracies shook Holopainen . So , she decided to meet them head-on . She was well-positioned to do so . For the past seven years , she has campaigned with the global girls ' rights organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , she set up an Instagram page -- theperiodmove -- to help girls climb out of the morass of pseudoscience that many of them have unwittingly stumbled into . <p> On May 1 , she published her first post : a soft pink grid detailing how misinformation seeps into discussions about menstruation . " Due to the taboo nature of periods , a lot of mis- and disinformation is being spread , " she wrote . " This may cause false and even dangerous beliefs . " <p> It 's no secret that our digital spaces are rife with conspiracy theories and fake news . But new research from Plan International suggests that disinformation is taking a severe toll on young women and girls , exposing them to ideas that are dangerous to their physical wellbeing , eroding their trust in democratic processes and negatively affecting their mental health . The report comes amid increased scrutiny of social media 's influence on adolescents , following a series of damning allegations from a Facebook whistleblower about Instagram 's " toxic " impact on teenage girls , including exacerbating disordered eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 26,000 girls across 26 countries about their exposure to disinformation and found significant numbers are harmed by online myths . In the United States , 80% of young women said misinformation has had a negative impact on their lives , while Brazil and the Philippines reported 91% and 95% , respectively . One-third reported that it has damaged their mental health , making them more stressed and anxious , and 20% said their faith in election results has been compromised . <p> The report also clearly showed that digital disinformation can affect the decisions that girls make about their physical health . For instance , a quarter of young women questioned whether to get vaccinated against the coronavirus . Like Holopainen , they also have also been confronted by a significant amount of erroneous health misinformation -- one , in Brazil , recalled coming across a post suggesting that tampons cause cancer . <p> The flood of reproductive health-related misinformation has introduced Generation Z to a new variety of influencer : physicians debunking online misinformation about sexually transmitted diseases , fertility , the human papillomavirus vaccine , birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos on TikTok and Instagram . But , for most doctors , myth-busting often takes place when they meet patients . <p> U.S.-based medical practitioners Trish Hutchison and Melisa Holmes routinely field an array of social media-driven questions on topics ranging from coronavirus vaccines to infertility .

Do n't do that . " <p> Some social media channels lay heavy emphasis on self-treatment and diagnosis , leading them to delay visiting a doctor until their conditions are more advanced than they need to be . Holmes pointed to a patient who developed a kidney infection after attempting to self-treat a urinary tract infection with cranberry juice , or young women who gave themselves skin conditions after using DIY remedies to treat what they wrongly believed were yeast infections . <p> " There 's so much self-treatment that 's happening based on Dr. Google that people are later getting health care from a trusted and licensed provider , " Holmes said .

But their union has been plagued by years of controversy , public disapproval and tabloid frenzy over a money scandal involving Komuro 's mother . <p> In an effort to appease a disapproving public , Mako turned down a one-off million-dollar payout from the government , which she was entitled to as a departing royal . <p> As the emperor 's niece , Mako was n't in line to the throne -- Japan 's male-only succession law prevents that from happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household must give up their titles and leave the palace if they marry a commoner . <p> Mako , who will no longer be known as princess , is n't the first woman to leave the Japanese royal family .

The Imperial household said the delay was due to a " lack of preparation , " but others suspect it was due to reports Komuro 's mother failed to pay back $36,000 she borrowed from her former fianc ? . <p> Komuro disputed the account , even releasing a 28-page statement earlier this year , stating his mother believed the money was a gift and that he would pay to settle the dispute .

Eventually , the couple jumped ship , leaving the British royal family in January 2020 . <p> But while Princess Mako 's " dramatic " exit from the royal family is somewhat comparable to " Megxit " -- the term for the British couple 's departure -- the similarities end there , said Ken Ruoff , director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Portland State University . <p> " British royal family members grow up among great wealth .

This might be the truth for the usual day job , but it 's even more so if you 're looking to start a business of your own . <p> So before you actually start , ask yourself : What are you passionate about ?

Look at your skills <p> The first thing you should do is consider what your own strengths and weaknesses are . Are you organized , proactive and patient ? Do you have problems communicating your thoughts and getting creative ? Being able to check your own skills allows you to focus on what your business already has and what it will need help with . <p> 2 . Look around your circle <p> Once you 've identified what your limitations are , you can start thinking about the people within your circle that can help fill in those gaps . Bring it that colleague of yours who 's still looking for a creative outlet , or your brother that loves to make to-do lists . <p> But while skill and knowledge in a particular field is important , you should also keep in mind that the people you work with should have similar mindsets . So when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you -- must be passionate about the youth and enriching their minds and experiences . <p> 3 . Look into partnerships <p> Starting a business is difficult , but it becomes even more difficult when you have to start from ground zero . So look into different options that will allow you to partner with established and trusted programs , which might then give your business a higher chance at success . <p> 4 . Get your game face on <p> Once you 've decided on your course of action , the only thing left to do is get started . Attend the necessary orientations and sessions , get the paperwork together , take the exams -- and you 'll be in it before you even realize . <p> Even if you like what you 're doing , you 'll still feel tired at the end of the day . Even when you enjoy all the tasks you have to finish and continue to believe the bigger picture you 're continuing to serve your students , there will still be moments of stress .

Koko Pimentel said forcing people to have the Covid-19 vaccines injected in their bodies will definitely face legal challenge on several grounds , and advised the Executive branch to just focus on ramping up vaccinations instead of imposing controversial sanctions like withholding benefits of the poor . <p> In the first place , the eight vaccines in the market , he noted , are all just covered by an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) , and a citizen may well invoke his right against taking it , even though some legal quarters say forcing vaccinations is justified by the police power of the State needing to ensure public health in a pandemic . <p> Also , Pimentel said in a radio interview , a forced vaccination at this stage may fall short of the " reasonableness " test required of such impositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Senators Risa Hontiveros and Kiko Pangilinan , also weighed in against the DILG proposal . <p> In a statement , Drilon deplored the " no vax-no subsidy " scheme for 4Ps members . <p> Denouncing the DILG 's " callousness , " Drilon agreed with Vice President Leni Robredo in suggesting that the Duterte government should offer incentives to get people vaccinated " rather than punish them .

He sounded like a radical , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and then he signed the Rice Ttrade Liberalization Act in 2019 . " <h> ' Subsidized rivals ' <p> The flooding of cheaper agricultural imports is compounded by the fact that " the big agricultural exporters subsidize their farm sectors " substantially , Bello said , citing as examples Thailand , the United States , European Union , and Vietnam . <p> " So much of their cost of production is taken up by government . But Filipino farmers do not enjoy " similar treatment , he noted . <p> " The others have socialist agriculture , that 's why they survive -- they make profits on part of their production , then dump this on other countries . Thailand and Vietnam have been dumping on us . " <p> He stressed that the problem of the farm sector does not arise from any inefficiency on the part of local farmers , but that " there 's no effective competition because they 're up against subsidized rivals .

@@73676233 <h> Nalzaro : And the saga continues <p> Politics , like a telenovela , is full of thrill , suspense and surprises . Last week , we witnessed developments in the political landscape both in the local and national politics . And the saga ( long and dramatic story ) continues today , Nov. 15 , as the last day of withdrawals and substitution ends . We can still expect more surprises today . <p> In the local scene , former Cebu City mayor and congressman Tomas Osme ? a withdrew his candidacy for congressman in the City 's south district . He was substituted by BG Rodrigo Abellanosa , son of outgoing south district Rep. Rodrigo " Bebot " Abellanosa . Tomas did not categorically explain his reason for withdrawing his candidacy , but this raised speculations that it may have something to do with his health . Another speculation is that it may be to appease Rep. Abellanosa , a close ally , who was disappointed because not one from his siblings is in the Bando Osme ? a Pundok Kauswagan ( BOPK ) lineup . <p> This after Abellanosa backed out from the mayoralty race upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . Abellanosa was initially groomed to be the BOPK 's mayoralty candidate but later on the party decided to toss former Councilor Margot Osme ? a . A reliable source said that a councilorial candidate from the BOPK will also withdraw his candidacy today and be replaced by Jose Abellanosa , another son of Bebot . <p> Meanwhile , Talisay City Mayor Samsam Gullas has switched places with his wife , Rhea . Samsam withdrew from the first district congressional race to seek reelection in Talisay City . His wife , who was supposed to succeed him , will run for Congress instead . Rhea is already a sure winner because she has no opponent . What she needs is only one vote . <p> Samsam 's reason for the switch is because Rhea 's opponent , Vice Mayor Allan Bucao , has been engaging in mudslinging and below-the-belt campaigning . Being a husband and a father , he can not just tolerate these kinds of personal attacks . He admitted that he was personally affected . Samsam , though , clarified that they are not afraid of Bucao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomer in politics , is ahead of Bucao in all barangays . <p> Well , whatever reasons Samsam has , it was a wise move to hold his political clout in the first district in general and in Talisay City , in particular . As I have said , Rhea is already a sure winner and Samsam will easily beat Bucao , a long-time ally . Why look for a headache ? Kung sa mga sugarol pa sa sabong , ' logro ' ning awaya in favor ni Samsam . Siete-diez . <p> Gov . Gwendolyn Garcia is still searching for a formidable running mate . A certain Dr. Maria Therese Heyrosa has filed for the vice gubernatorial position under the One Cebu party . But maybe we will be surprised today . Sources said the One Cebu Party was negotiating with Balamban mayor Alex Binghay to be Gwen 's running mate . But the latter politely refused the offer saying he wants to retire from politics . He did not even seek reelection . His son , Ace , a former mayor , is the one seeking the mayoralty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice mayor , as his running mate . Both are running unopposed . The One Cebu Party has also been negotiating with former Naga City Mayor Val Chiong but he also refused the offer . Their last option is outgoing second district Rep. Willy Caminero or maybe philanthropist Mariquita Salimbangon-Yeung . <p> In the national scene , the strategy adopted by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio is no longer surprising . The ending was clear . After she withdrew her candidacy as Davao City mayoralty aspirant and resigned from her regional party , Hugpong ng Pagbabago , she immediately joined Lakas-CMD . Last Saturday , she filed her certificate of candidacy ( COC ) as vice presidential candidate . Senator Bong Go , on the other hand , withdrew his candidacy as vice president but filed as a presidential candidate . Senator Ronald " Bato " Dela Rosa also withdrew his candidacy as presidential candidate of PDP-Laban saying it was a party decision . <p> What we will find out today is if President Rodrigo Duterte will push through with his plan to file his COC as vice presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Saturday that Digong will file his COC as vice presidential candidate today .

Last Saturday , Eleazar filed his COC as senatorial candidate substituting a certain Paolo " Pawee " Capino under Partido Reporma of presidential aspirant , Sen. Panfilo ' Ping ' Lacson . Lacson said he has high expectations for Eleazar if he wins a Senate seat in 2022 . <p> Lacson added that Eleazar is willing to continue his public service even after his retirement as PNP chief upon reaching his 56th birthday .

He just sent an email to Ayala group employees that he was stepping down as Ayala Chief Executive Officer , a position he has held for the last 26 years . He will still be around , albeit focused on chairman responsibilities . <p> And that was how it was during the last 6 months . But Fernando Zobel de Ayala ( FZA ) , who has taken over as CEO , just could not let the year pass without somehow formally honoring JAZA , and recognizing his impact on the company , on the community , and on the country . <p> And so last Wednesday , the whole Ayala group put up a special show depicting -- through film clips , stories , messages , poems , songs and dance -- the respect , gratitude , sense of attachment that people had for JAZA , and how deeply he touched their lives professionally and personally . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abunda-type interview , his daughter Mariana , son Jaime Alfonso and nephew Jaime Urquijoeven managed to show the lighter side of JAZA .

In FZA 's words , " they were a most adventurous period , riding thru various landscapes , climates and grueling stretches and reaching unprecedented heights . " <p> FZA continues : " JAZA 's tenure has seen Ayala 's market capitalization increase more than 6- fold with a similar 6-fold rise in net income .

As organizations , we are just living organisms ... organisms made up of individuals that are possibly evolving , keeping shifting and changing ... These individuals have to be nurtured , cared for , helped to grow strong and evolve in progressive ways ... <p> The most effective leaders are those who can build trust , empower , and in many ways think more of the institution than themselves .

When Fernando and I started in Ayala , AC and Ayala Land were one company . Manila Water did not exist . Globe was a telex company . IMI just had one plant in Manila . BPI took pride in its ATM network as their technology differentiator . Institutions need to evolve and change . We must never be scared to do that . We must encourage it and be comfortable with it in order to adjust to the changing needs , changing times and changing environment . <p> " Finally , we must be cognizant of environmental change and be able to adopt to it as well . The environment has changed and in many ways . Issues of inclusion , issues of the environment , issues of where capitalism is going and how good it is as a model , issues of governance , issues of climate . These are issues Fernando and I used to wrestle with . Now these ideas have become mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve . We have been thinking about these things for some time ... All the leadership team , the Mancom think very similarly about these things . I hope we stay that way , that we want to be part of institutions that leave their mark positively in our society . Vibrant , charting new paths . " <p> JAZA promised to keep connected . Echoing a favorite quote ( " What is urgent is seldom important and what is important is seldom urgent . ) , JAZA now would like to do some things that he had not been able to do because the urgent always got in the way of the important . " I look forward to connecting with you in new ways and helping you in turn connect with all your constituencies .

@@73719233 <h> ' Tax-the-billionaires ' tack receives mixed reactions <p> LAWMAKERS ' proposal to tax billionaires received mixed reactions from analysts amid opposition by government officials against the measure . <p> While admitting the proposed wealth tax can lead to revenue gains , the Department of Finance ( DOF ) is opposing the proposed wealth tax under House Bill 10253 ; it warned that passing this measure would lead instead to capital flight and " aggressive tax avoidance . " <p> Under House Bill ( HB ) 10253 , individuals with taxable assets that exceed P1 billion should pay a 1-percent tax while a tax of 2 percent is imposed on taxable assets over P2 billion and 3 percent for over P3 billion . <p> While the bill 's authors estimate that their proposal will generate P236.7 billion per year , the DOF said it projects a " more conservative " P57.6 billion in revenues . Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III has said that " losses incurred from other taxes are far more substantial . " <p> The DOF chief also lamented that implementing the wealth tax will be " costly and complex " since this would require additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax the Bank Secrecy Law and forge exchange of information agreements with other countries to determine the various aspects of a " super-rich " taxpayer 's wealth . <p> But IBON Foundation Executive Director Jose Enrique A. Africa said just because a wealth tax is complex does n't mean that it should not be done . <p> Africa argued that the growth of wealth among a few billionaires far outpaces the low income and assets of the poorest 70 million Filipinos . He added that modest reductions in the wealth of just around 3,000 billionaires can finance a huge expansion in government services , especially for ordinary Filipinos . <p> " The government 's job is n't to do as little as possible but instead to do what needs to be done , " Africa told the BusinessMirror . " The DOF should address the lack of manpower , the laws to be changed and the international cooperation needed instead of lamenting these and avoiding doing the work . " <p> Moreover , he told the BusinessMirror it would also be better if government studied how to fix tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Instead of retreating to paeans about simplicity , has the DOF considered international efforts to reduce the capacity of the rich to avoid taxes like a global asset registry , public registries of beneficial ownership , and tax transparency reforms ? Or maybe exit taxes on net wealth for those who renounce their Filipino citizenship ? , " Africa added . <p> Foundation for Economic Freedom President Calixto V. Chikiamco said the idea of imposing wealth tax is " nice but impractical " given that wealth comes in many forms , such as real estate , stocks , bonds , art , jewelry , bank deposits and even cryptocurrencies . <p> " How will the government be able to determine that on a global scale ? The wealth tax may even lead to capital flight as the rich park their assets in foreign countries outside of the reach of local tax authorities , " Chikiamco told the BusinessMirror . <p> " We should tax monopoly profits or unearned wealth , but wealth due to risk-taking and innovation should be rewarded , not subject to more taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chikiamco said it would be better to pass Package 3 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program ( CTRP ) to raise revenues and replace the outdated valuation system , which results in low valuations and low tax collection from the soaring price of real estate . Package 3 of the CTRP is also known as the Real Property Valuation Reform bill , a version of which both the Upper and Lower Chambers has . <p> " It 's essentially a tax on idle real estate since owners have to make the land productive in order to pay the taxes on updated valuations , " Chikiamco told the BusinessMirror . <p> Ateneo de Manila University John Gokongwei School of Management Dean Luis F. Dumlao believes the government can collect about P75 billion already from imposing a wealth tax on the 10 richest Filipinos on the Forbes list . <p> However , Dumlao doubts that the proposed measure would lead to aggressive tax avoidance as claimed by DOF . <p> He also said the proposed tax is a " duplication " of the existing progressive individual income tax and real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P2 billion will be subjected to a P10 million tax or something worth two luxury and/or sports cars . It is doubtful this P2-billion person will emigrate or commit a crime just to avoid P10 million , " Dumlao said .

@@73766239 <h> Celebrating small victories <p> Just as we are about to celebrate the coming Christmas season with renewed hope that things are getting better , we have been startled by news that another COVID-19 variant of concern is raising red flags in many parts of the world . <p> Little is still known about the Omicron variant , but it should serve as a reminder to everyone that it is too early to celebrate and to let our guards down . <p> There are those who say that the vaccines that we are getting right now are not effective against this new variant . Even the head of vaccine maker Moderna , chief executive Stephane Bancel , has said COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to be as effective against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus as they have been previously . He said that the high number of mutations on the protein spike the virus uses to infect human cells meant it was likely the current crop of vaccines would need to be modified , adding that it could take months to begin shipping a vaccine that does work against Omicron . The new variant is said to have 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six in Beta . <p> There are reports that the mRNA vaccines like Moderna 's and Pfizer-BioNTech 's were formulated using technology that would allow rapid modification . A spokesperson for Pfizer , Jerica Pitts , revealed that Pfizer scientists can adapt the current vaccine within six weeks and ship initial batches within 100 days in the event of an escape variant that eludes the immune system . <p> As for Moderna , reports say that it could update its current vaccine in about two months . Both Pfizer and Moderna plan to also test booster shots to see if they will bolster the immune system enough to fend off the new variant . <p> *** <p> The world can not prevent the coronavirus from mutating . <p> Take the case of pneumonia . There are two pneumococcal vaccines -- PPSV 23 , which protects against 23 strains of pneumococcal bacteria that account for about 90 to 95 percent of the strains that cause pneumonia in humans ; and PCV 13 , which is a conjugate vaccine that protects against 13 strains . However , it is still possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both shots since each is just about 50 to 70 percent effective only and efficacy varies based on age and how strong one 's immune system is . Pneumonia can also be caused by viruses and fungi , just like how the coronavirus is causing severe pneumonia in some . And by getting influenza , measles , pertussis , varicella , and even COVID-19 vaccines , one lowers his risk of being infected by the bacteria or viruses that cause pneumonia . <p> Among adults , the flu virus is said to be the traditional cause of viral pneumonia , while the respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of viral pneumonia in children . However , SARS-COV 2 or the virus that causes COVID-19 is now contributing to increasing cases of pneumonia worldwide . Meanwhile , the pathogen S pneumonia is reportedly the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia . <p> Symptoms of pneumonia were first described by the Greek physician Hippocrates around 460 BC according to one source . In 1875 , a German pathologist observed pneumonia bacteria under a microscope for the first time and in the 1880s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common bacterial causes of pneumonia . Inspite of many years of study and efforts to prevent and treat pneumonia , there are still about 150 million new cases of pneumonia each year , of which 11 million to 20 million or seven to 13 percent are severe enough to require hospital admission . Most of such cases occur in children . <p> More than 263.1 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019 , and 5.48 million have died . <p> Imagine how long it would take and how much will have to be spent before we can have a real understanding of the coronavirus and its many mutations . <p> *** <p> The coronavirus is not going to disappear , but in the future , it can probably be prevented and cured through cheaper means . <p> In the meantime , what are we going to do about it ? <p> Countries more powerful , richer , and with advanced technology are still grappling to find ways to contain the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained it are now experiencing new waves of infection and surges , and are back to imposing lockdowns . <p> According to Reuters , the US and Germany have joined countries around the globe in planning stricter COVID-19 restrictions because of the new Omicron variant .

It has suspended flights from South Africa , Botswana , Namibia , Zimbabwe , Lesotho , Eswatini , and Mozambique . <p> Our vaccination efforts continue , with more people now eligible to receive booster shots . <p> Meanwhile , our Departmentof Science and Technology ( DOST ) continues with its clinical studies to determine if virgin coconut oil ( VCO ) , lagundi , and tawa-tawa can indeed be used as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 . <p> In fairness to DOST , there have been promising results from the studies , so we should not be quick to dismiss the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Pe ? a said that in community-level trials , VCO showed promise as an adjunct supplement to suspect and probable cases due to its viral and immunomodulatory properties , adding that the most important finding is that those that are in the group that took VCO had an earlier recovery period . <p> In the case of lagundi , however , the results of the clinical trials were quite disturbing . According to a report from the UP NIH , there is an " insignificant difference in the clinical recovery time of mild COVID patients who were given 600 milligrams ( mg ) of lagundi formulation every day compared to the placebo group .

@@73792238 <h> A prudent buyer 's guide to acquiring real property <h> Amicus Curiae <p> By Zyra G. Montefolca <p> FREEPIK <p> The pandemic has greatly taught the practicality of investing in properties that appreciate in value over time , i.e. , real properties . To forestall , or at the very least mitigate , possible disputes which may ensue , below are some of the tips which a prospective buyer may have to consider before and after acquiring a real property . <p> CHECK THE PROPERTY 'S CERTIFICATE OF TITLE.It is prudent for a buyer to check the authenticity and existence of the certificate of title ( CoT ) with the Registry of Deeds ( RoD ) where the property is situated . In which case , the buyer will be informed if the property is subject to any encumbrances as can be gleaned from the annotations in the CoT , e.g. , real estate mortgage or notice of lis pendens . <p> A buyer should be cautious if the property is subject to a registered real estate mortgage . This is because a mortgage is a real right , which follows the property , even after subsequent transfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchaser or transferee is necessarily bound to acknowledge and respect the encumbrance . Consequently , the mortgage on the property may still be foreclosed despite the transfer . ( Garcia v. Villar , G.R. No. 158891 , 27 June 2012 ) <p> A buyer may also encounter a notice of lis pendens annotation in the CoT . Lis pendens is a Latin term which literally means a pending suit . Notice of lis pendens is filed for the purpose of warning all persons that the title to certain property is in litigation and that if they purchase the same , they are in danger of being bound by an adverse judgment . The notice is intended to be a warning to the whole world that one who buys the property does so at his own risk . This is necessary in order to save innocent third persons from any involvement in any future litigation concerning the property . ( Lim v. Vera Cruz , G.R. No. 143646 , 4 April 2001 ) <p> DETERMINE THE SELLER 'S AUTHORITY TO DISPOSE.Evaluating the CoT will enable the buyer to confirm if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the seller is a person other than the registered owner , he or she must be able to show that he or she is duly authorized to convey the said property . This is because " a person can sell only what he owns or is authorized to sell ; the buyer can as a consequence acquire no more than what the seller can legally transfer " pursuant to the principle that no one can give what he does not have . ( Nool v. Court of Appeals , G.R. No. 116635 , 24 July 1997 ) <p> Consequently , the buyer can demand that the seller , other than the registered owner , present his authority which may be embodied in a special power of attorney . <p> Further , even if the seller is the registered owner of the property , marital consent is also necessary if he/she is married . Articles 96 and 124 of the Family Code both require the consent of the other spouse or , in the absence thereof , a court authority , to validly encumber or dispose of a property belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absence of marital consent renders the sale void . <p> CONDUCT AN OCULAR INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY.The conduct of an ocular inspection is essential to safeguard the buyer . Although a buyer need not go beyond the CoT of the property , it is also a hornbook principle in law that where there are circumstances which would put a party on guard and prompt him/her to investigate or inspect the subject property , such as the presence of occupants or tenants thereon , the buyer is expected to inquire first into the status or nature of possession of the occupants , i.e. , whether or not the occupants possess the land in the concept of an owner . ( Philippine National Bank v. Heirs of Militar , G.R. No. 164801 , 30 June 2006 ) Consequently , the buyer is fully apprised if the property may be the subject of a possible dispute in the future . <p> IMMEDIATELY REGISTER THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY.After exercising the precautionary measures above and once the parties execute a Deed of Absolute Sale conveying the property to the buyer , the buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to safeguard the buyer in case the same property is sold to other persons , i.e. , double sale . The principle of first in time , stronger in right gains greater significance in case of a double sale of immovable property . When the thing sold twice is an immovable , the one who acquires it and first records it in the Registry of Property , both made in good faith , shall be deemed the owner . ( Rosaroso v. Soria , G.R. No. 194846 , 19 June 2013 ) n <p> The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author .

In photo : A spread featuring Alfajone 's shop offerings . Photo courtesy of ALYANNA NEBREJA <p> Hoarding on cute stationery is an obsession that I 've carried with me since childhood . I was the type of kid to linger around the craft and stationery aisles of National Book Store for fun . On good days , I could afford to walk out with a little paper or sticker knickknack to add to my collection . On other , more frequent ( read : bad ) days , I 'd exit with a long list of things I wanted to add to that same collection . <p> Oftentimes , it was difficult to find unique stickers , tapes , and notebooks that fit my taste , and the ones that I did like were usually imported from the U.S. , Japan , or Australia , and way out of my budget . I eventually learned to sift through the bins at Tickles , Book Sale , and stalls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebooks , and memo pads . Many of these , as I later discovered , were sourced from artists in Taiwan , China , Korea , and Japan , where the stationery industry is big business and materials are collected by people of all ages . <p> Back then , accessibility and lack of budget were the things stopping me from plunging into debt by way of stickers . When the pandemic hit and many of these materials became readily online at the tap of a button , I knew I was in ( DIY ) danger . I 'd already seen this coming in college , when specialty craft stores began setting up shop on Instagram and in malls , offering washi tapes and more specialized art materials for hobbies like calligraphy and watercolor art . But it was only at Sticker Con 2020 that I realized how much the market for local creators had grown . Armed with a reasonable sticker budget , a friend and I made a whole morning out of our trip to the convention center , going through aisles and booths manned by artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We were overwhelmed by all the options for self-designed stationery . At the con , the dilemma was no longer in the lack of design choices -- the decision-making process now boiled down to whether I wanted my stickers with vinyl , holographic , or scratch-proof glitter finishes , or if I wanted them as singles , peel-off , or as a single sheet . There were sheets specifically made for planners and design embellishments , different art styles and aesthetics . Needless to say , I did not stick to said reasonable budget . <p> TikTok and YouTube have contributed to this cute stationery revival ( I , too , am guilty of watching " journal with me " videos for hours on end ) , upping the demand for bujo ( bullet journal ) accessories and other decorative paper items like stickers and washi tapes . It 's a good thing , then , that in the past two years , more independent designers and illustrators have opened online shops independently and on major e-commerce platforms . <p> This year , I went down the sticker hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replenish my own stock ( I used up a lot of it after going back to journaling again in 2020 as a way of looking back at happier times and memories made before the pandemic ) . <p> The process of finding these involved asking artist friends and going wherever the algorithm would take me , so here are some of my favorites from the bunch -- a selection of artist-run shops . Browse through and find the perfect gifts for your stationery-loving pals . Or you can be like me and treat yourself to the little knickknacks you did n't get to have as a kid -- surviving another year means you earned it . <p> Paperaica <p> The artist behind Paperaica chronicles her own journal through her @raicadaily Instagram account , which is probably why her shop contains merchandise made to embellish a spread , including notepads and stickers that come in a variety of sizes and materials . <p> Some favorites include the planner sticker sheets , specifically the Corgi Butts Planner Stickers ( ? 65- ? 85 , depending on material ) and the Bookshelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the planner stickers allows you to choose the designs and material you want them to come in .

Some items are also available in store at Common Room Power Plant . <p> If you 'd prefer them in sticker form , they also come in sticker sheets ( ? 79- ? 95 per sheet of nine ) available in white matte , light kraft , premium matte , and transparent sticker paper .

@@73803238 <h> Lava once flowed at the site of an ancient lake on Mars . ( FILE PHOTO ) <p> ( CNN ) -- Lava once flowed at the site of an ancient lake on Mars . <p> The Perseverance rover landed on the planet just 10 months ago , but it has already made that surprising discovery . <p> The rover 's latest finding suggests that the bedrock it has been driving over since landing was once formed by volcanic lava flows -- something that was " completely unexpected , " according to mission scientists . Previously , they thought the layered rocks Perseverance took photos of were sedimentary . <p> The rocks that Perseverance has sampled so far also revealed that they interacted with water multiple times , and some of them include organic molecules . <p> These discoveries could help scientists create an accurate timeline for the events that have taken place in Jezero Crater , the site of an ancient lake , and has wider implications for understanding Mars . <p> The finding was announced Wednesday during the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans . <p> For years , scientists have questioned if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of material deposited by an ancient river , or igneous rock , which forms when lava flows cool . <p> " I was beginning to despair we would never find the answer , " said Ken Farley , Perseverance project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , California , in a statement . <p> Everything changed when Perseverance began using a drill on the end of its robotic arm to scrape away at the surfaces of rocks . <p> " The crystals within the rock provided the smoking gun , " Farley said . <p> Perseverance is armed with a suite of sophisticated instruments that can image and analyze these scraped rocks , revealing their composition and mineral content . Ones of these instruments is PIXL , or the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry . <p> In November , Perseverance used its instruments to study a rock , nicknamed " Brac " by the team . The analysis revealed large olivine crystals surrounded by pyroxene crystals , both of which pointed to the fact that the rock came from volcanic lava flows . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates the rock formed when crystals grew and settled in a slowly cooling magma -- for example a thick lava flow , lava lake , or magma chamber , " Farley said . <p> " The rock was then altered by water several times , making it a treasure trove that will allow future scientists to date events in Jezero , better understand the period in which water was more common on its surface , and reveal the early history of the planet . Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from . " <p> Now , the team wants to know if the rocks containing olivine were formed by a cooling lake of lava , or if they originated from a subsurface chamber of lava that was later exposed due to erosion . <p> " This was completely unexpected , and we are struggling to understand what it means , " Farley said . " But I will speculate that this is not likely the original crater floor . From the diameter of this crater , we expect the original crater floor is significantly deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible that lava flowed down into the crater , he said , but the original crater floor is below the rock they are driving over now . <h> Bringing back samples <p> So far , Perseverance has collected four rock samples with plans to collect up to 37 more . These samples will be returned to Earth by future missions , which will enable them to be studied in great detail and a variety of ways . Samples from Jezero Crater and its river delta could reveal if life ever existed on Mars . <p> Once back on Earth , volcanic rocks can be dated with very high accuracy , so these latest samples could help the team establish more accurate dates for features and events on Mars . <p> These rocks interacted with water over time to create new minerals . The minerals within the samples can reveal what the climate and environment was like and even the composition of the water billions of years ago on the red planet . <p> " That will tell us whether or not the water that existed there was potentially habitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postdoctoral scholar research associate in planetary science at the California Institute of Technology . <p> The rover also detected organic molecules in the rock it sampled , using its SHERLOC instrument , or Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman &amp; Luminescence for Organics &amp; Chemicals . <p> The presence of organic molecules does n't necessarily equal signs of past life , or biosignatures . Organics can be created biologically or abiotically -- a physical process that does not include living organisms . <p> The Curiosity rover , which landed on Mars in 2012 , has also discovered organics within its landing site of Gale Crater . Now that Perseverance has detected them , too , " this helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed , " said Luther Beegle , SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , in a statement . <p> While more investigation is needed to determine how these organic molecules were created , their presence gives the science team hope . That 's because it means that signs of past or present life could be preserved on Mars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When these samples are returned to Earth , they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years , " Beegle said . <p> And Perseverance has also been using its onboard ground-penetrating radar instrument , the first ever to be tested out on Mars . The Radar Imager for Mars ' Subsurface Experiment , or RMFAX , was used to " to peek into the subsurface and determine the structure of a rock under our wheels , " said Briony Horgan , associate professor of planetary science at Purdue University and a scientist on the rover mission . <p> The experiment was used as the rover drove across a ridgeline . The radar data revealed multiple rock formation with a downward tilt , which continue below the surface from the ridgeline itself . Instruments like RIMFAX can help scientists create a better geologic map of Mars to understand its history . <h> Investigating an ancient river <p> Perseverance had a banner year in 2021 and it will move on to even more intriguing territory next year : the ancient river delta . <p> This fan-shaped structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rover will arrive at the delta in about six or eight months . <p> The rocks in the delta are most likely sedimentary , trapping and preserving precious layers of silt from the river that once flowed into the crater 's lake . And the samples could reveal if organic molecules associated with signs of life , or even microfossils , could be hiding within the remains of the delta .

Prior to this projected figure , the lowest annual " natural increase " of the population was recorded between 1946 and 1947 , by around 254,000 . <p> The latest available official data indicated that as of May 1 last year , the country 's population stood at 109,035,343 .

Or maybe , with conscious awareness of February 's reverential highlights following , get spiritually recharged just as we inch forward to Lent 's " greatest love story ever told " ? <p> Christian believers may yet view February as a balmy " transition-month from the joyful feast of Christmas to the penitential fasting of Lent . " It opens with the celebration of " Candlemas Day , " principally commemorating " Our Lord 's Presentation at the Temple " held every 2nd day of February , or 40 days from Christmas Day . Known to be one of the oldest festivals , its earliest reference dates back to A.D. 400 in Jerusalem . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <h> Three-in-one event <p> Candlemas brings to mind an ostensibly three-in-one event : 1 the presentation of the baby Jesus to God in the Temple at Jerusalem . The Lord said to Moses , " Dedicate all the first-born males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " ( Exodus 13:2 ) ; 2 the Virgin Mary 's purification . A tradition that women were n't allowed to worship in the temple for 40 days after the birth of a boy , and 60 days for a girl . Thereafter , women were brought to the Temple for the purification ceremony , after which , they may attend religious services again . ( Leviticus 12:1-4 ) ; and 3 Jesus ' first appearance in the temple ... the Messiah revealed ! Simeon , a just and pious man , identified the Messiah while in the Temple , thus : " ... a Light to reveal your WILL to the Gentiles , and bring glory to your people Israel " ( Luke 2:29-32 ) . <p> The name Candlemas was derived from the traditional holding of festivities with lighted candles adopted mid-5th century ; instituted in the Western Church during Pope Sergius-I pontificate ( 687 -- 701AD ) . The day when also all the Church 's candles for the year are blessed . <p> The deeper significance of " lighted candles " is its celebrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophesied as " ... the Light to reveal your Will to the Gentiles " i.e. , to all nations in darkness !

" <p> And since the " Temple event " highlights the perfect model of a Christian family , February passes on as devotional " Month of the Holy Family " -- a dedication that advocates the spirit of a virtuous , domestic life against today 's challenges assailing family unity and sanctity of human life . <h> ' Day of Ashes ' <p> Notably , Feb. 17 this year marks the first day of Lent ... so-called Day of Ashes , or Ash Wednesday , which is always 40 days not counting Sundays before Easter . It is observed with ashes produced by burning palm branches from the previous Palm Sunday . The parishioners receive the ashes , cross-marked on their forehead as reminder of mortality , with the priest saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> Ironically , as if a graphic magnification of that mortality , the COVID-19 's aftermath of multiple cremations portrays a sobering scene of life 's evanescence . Not just a day but months of mournful crematory promptings that " such is how the glory of the world passes away " ; how shortsighted to be so obsessed in storing earthly riches " that moths and rust destroy and , robbers break in and steal " Matthew 6:19-21 , while missing out on the soul 's all-important priorities ! <p> Thus , we approach Ash Wednesday 's rites " ... sorry for our transgressions , wanting to use the penitential Lent season to correct our faults , cleanse our hearts , control our desires and grow in holiness so we will be ready to celebrate Easter with great joy .

Ylagan <p> PIKISUPERSTAR/FREEPIK <p> He is the regional head of a communications company , now working from home since the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) pandemic quarantine started . She is a Trust and Investment Officer in a commercial bank that has reduced and re-distributed staff to fewer branches ; her work is now done from home . A CEO of two call centers works from home now , directing and monitoring her team leaders online . A solo-practice lawyer also works from home , giving virtual ( online ) consultations for virtual fees ( effectively free ! ) that would have been materially receivable under a proper engagement contract . By the way , the lawyer also teaches online at three law schools . <p> There ought a be a law , the non-lawyers cry ! We are overworked and under-compensated in this work from home mode , where 24/7 we are now on call , day or night , by and for the office . We feel exploited ! The physical and mental wear and tear cancel out the supposed advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuting to and from work ; flexibility in doing your assignment or responsibility when and how , as long as you deliver expected output from you ; being with family the whole day instead of barely five waking hours ( when home early from work ) ; saving money on executive raiment and accoutrements , expensive after office hours recreation and fellowship with officemates . <p> We do n't need new laws for our new workplace and work mode , the lawyer says . At the executive level , compensation is output-determined from brainwork ( planning , organizing , leading and executing ) more than technical skills and physical labor . Work hours of executives are not specified as are the eight hours per day like for rank-and-file ( or 12 hours for some service work ) . There is no contractual security of tenure in employment of officer-level employees , as retention and promotion are qualitatively measured in terms of the trust and confidence of the company board in those in the higher levels of authority and responsibility in the organization . <p> Labor and employment laws and regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to evolve for the work-from-home rank-and-file employees . But there would be tedious disambiguation in the laws for these work-at-home rank-and-file employees and those rank-and-file employees in the same company who physically report to office premises . Working remotely works for the IT and services sectors , and not for production/operations workers in a company . <p> Employers would be most concerned about security control with the highly intelligent and technologically savvy , higher-paid remote employees . The ready answer of the techies would be that a log-in/log out on the computer by the online work-from-home employee would take care of administrative monitoring of hours spent , and the output of assigned work and responsibility will be the basis for quantity and quality of work done , as measured and recorded on the computer . Security measures embedded in the exclusive technical design of the company online system will safeguard against tampering with inputs and the data file by the remote employee . <p> Unauthorized access to layered information will trigger alarms in a well-designed and secured company IT system . Encryption software and remote-wipe apps on devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private networks can also encrypt data and provide secure access to a remote computer over the internet . These would keep files and data secure yet accessible to work-at-home staff . Employers of work-at-home staff have little to worry about information security risk , in this digital age , experts assure us . <p> Employers could be enjoying more advantages than their remote staff on the work from home modality urged by the COVID-19 pandemic . Except for the nagging fear of loose control over work-from-home workers , employers have enjoyed the leniency on their doing business while respecting general health restrictions . Calling on force majeure , businesses downsized operations and reduced staff -- some even totally closed shop temporarily and some permanently , to cut losses . Even after the heightened restrictions of the Expanded Community Quarantine ( ECQ ) were downgraded midyear last year to General Community Quarantine ( GCQ ) , businesses continued with their limited operations and staggered staff who were asked to come in only five days a week , every other week , as an example . A restaurant manager was asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no pay " was his tearful answer . He was suffering a 50% pay cut . No choice . Better than no work at all . The waiters suffer the same fate , where their P600 per reporting day would be effectively cut to a measly average P300 per day minus transportation . But they are not work-from-home employees . <p> That some businesses have already stopped operations and some drastically cut operations down in the harsh scourging of the pandemic would surely imply painful and lasting lessons learned in the trial by fire . Will businesses ever go back to the same practices towards the same objectives and strategies , after the pandemic restrictions and the New Normal is really normal ? <p> It was only last week that the initial batches of vaccines arrived in the Philippines , and symbolic vaccinations on seemingly hesitant health workers were heralded on national television . Almost half of Philippine citizens are not inclined to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot mainly due to safety concerns , according to a survey by pollster Pulse Asia in January . Still , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 109 million population in three to five years ; the government is capable of vaccinating only 20 million to 30 million Filipinos a year , the " Vaccine Czar " Carlito Galvez announced ( Rappler , Nov. 25 , 2020 ) . Does that mean the New Normal would become normal in three to five years yet ? The paranoid common people would probably feel that way , and the astute businessman will keep that in mind as a planning parameter on which way his business should go . <p> Businesses that have undergone downsizing will have realized how lean and mean operations can be effective , and they will henceforth more carefully proportion marginal costs with increasing net profits . The formulae have been loudly suggested by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions . The concept of " work from home " has been entrenched in the past year , as an efficient and effective way of carrying on the business in a time of physical restrictions of movement and presence . In fact , future hiring of employees will not now be hampered by physical accessibility of office premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another province , or even living abroad . And perhaps businessmen will now think offices do not have to be in the big cities . Imagine the traffic decongestion on the main thoroughfares in the metropolis ! <p> At the height of the ECQ and the total lockdown , the Lenovo global study revealed that businesses surveyed in the Philippines already required 26% of their employees to work from home as part of the mitigation measures against the virulent flu . In the United States , the number of those regularly working from home had grown by 159% , and the same increase is mirrored in other markets . Technology has been extremely helpful in creating availability of jobs and opportunities despite the isolation and restrictions on both employees and employers . Prior to the COVID-19 restrictions , the Telecommuting Act , Republic Act 11165 , was signed in 2018 so employees can work at home or remotely outside the workplace .

@@87222236 <h> Do we have a moral obligation to live for as long as possible ? <h> The Conversation <p> By Kimberley Brownlee <p> I am a 78-year-old woman with a loving husband , three sons , seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren . However , I was recently diagnosed with cancer . The initial surgery was successful , but I was left wondering whether I should opt for further treatment , and all the suffering it might cause , or take my chances without it . I have , after all , lived a long and happy life . While I have now thankfully been cured , I am still left wondering : do we have a moral obligation to live for as long as possible ? <p> -- Ann , Tarbert , Scotland <p> There are many answers to this question -- especially during a pandemic -- and probably no clear solution . But that does n't mean we should n't think about it . Indeed , by considering such questions we can discover some of the most enlightening perspectives on life . <p> So let me approach this issue as a philosopher -- and define first exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moral obligation or a moral duty is a morally required form of conduct . Obligations can be perfect , leaving us no wriggle room -- for instance , the duty not to kill unjustly . Obligations can also be imperfect , giving us some flexibility in when and how we honor them , such as the duty to be beneficent . Obligations can be context-specific , such as the duty to meet someone at 3 p.m. as promised . And , they can be general , including the duty not to steal without necessity or the duty to try to save someone 's life when we can do so at little cost to ourselves . <p> In my view , we can not have a blanket moral obligation to live for as long as possible regardless of our circumstances . Each life is unique and , for some people , continuing to live is a horrific experience . But , we can have an obligation to prolong our lives when certain conditions are met . <p> To add some clarity , here are some thoughts on two different sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These cases rely on some imagination , but then imagination is the tool that allows us to see dilemmas from alternative perspectives . <p> Imagine I am a solitary person , stranded on a distant and deserted island surrounded by a vast expanse of ocean . I have no one to love , no one who misses me , and my only hope of escaping the island and meeting another person again lies wrecked in the waves : the ship that brought me here . Now , I will likely want to survive , but that is a different thing . What we need to consider is whether , given my plight , I have an obligation to live for as long as possible . <p> I might , if my duties to respect myself include me prolonging my life . The German philosopher Immanuel Kant 's categorical imperative states that we have a duty to treat all people including ourselves as ends to be respected and not merely as means . But respecting myself need not entail striving to live an impressively long life . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result , I may live healthily for a long time . But that does n't mean that living for as long as possible must be my aim or responsibility . <p> Even so , I might still have an obligation to prolong my life for a different reason . The people who raised me and were sufficiently invested in my fortunes to ensure I survived into adulthood might have a claim on me . This would suggest that this Robinson Crusoe version of me should care for myself now , to honor their investment . <p> In his book Happiness , the Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard quotes the words spoken by a mother to her son shortly before her death : <p> Do n't think you 're paying me some kind of great tribute if you let my death become the great event of your life . The best tribute you can pay to me as a mother is to go on and have a good and fulfilling life . <p> But living a " good and fulfilling life " is not the same as living for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , not a long life , may be the best way to honor our guardians ' investment in us . <p> And what if those who raised me have passed away -- do they still have a claim ? Similarly , what if they are living , but will never know how I fared ? Will their lives be worse if I do n't prolong my life indefinitely ? Probably not . They likely think I am already lost forever . <p> But perhaps I am a remarkable person -- Mozart , say -- and I have been abandoned on this island . I have a musical genius that arguably I should n't squander , even though the music I compose in my head here will never be heard . My potential to craft masterpieces might give me an obligation to prolong my life but , of course , only for as long as I can create divine music . <p> Indeed , even if my talents are n't " divine , " I might have an obligation to " use up " the talents or blessings I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , wrote that : <p> When I stand before God at the end of my life , I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left , and could say , ' I used everything you gave me . ' <p> It 's an inspiring approach to life -- but , as the 17th century British poet John Milton argued : " God doth not need Either man 's work or his own gifts ; who best Bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ... They also serve who only stand and wait . " <p> Ultimately , as Milton suggests , no one of us has any greater claim to life than another -- even if we have no talents , choose to ignore the talents we do have , or simply " stand and wait , " we still fulfil our purpose . <p> Of course , most of us do not live alone on deserted islands . We do n't exist in isolation , but with and among others , at least until the pandemic forced us behind our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prolong our lives for the sake of the people we love and who love us . <p> When we have dependants , particularly young children in our care , we arguably do have a duty to try to keep ourselves safe and healthy for as long as they need us . But that does n't mean we have an obligation to live for as long as possible when they no longer depend on us . S Matthew Liao , a bioethicist at New York University , has argued that children have a human right during childhood to be loved , and that we all have a duty to ensure that children are loved because this is crucial to their lives and development . Once they have grown , our love-giving duties subside , but do not entirely disappear . <p> There 's a flip side to this , too . When we become dependent on our loved ones as we age , do we have an obligation to prolong our life or , alternatively , to end it -- so that we 're not a financial or emotional anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> This question is an easy one to answer . People should never think of themselves as a " burden " or a " problem to be solved . " Every human being has a right to life and to lead a life that is at least minimally decent , free from degradation , cruelty , undue harm , and unfairness . No one person has any more entitlement than any other to live in this world . We are all worthy of a place here , and older people should be treasured by their families , friends and societies . <p> Yet not everyone accepts this . The pandemic has held up a moral mirror to our treatment of older people and found it to be abysmal . Even though many countries have taken an age-attentive approach to vaccinations , older people have nonetheless borne much of the brunt of COVID-19 . <p> One final thorny question concerns doing versus allowing . Sometimes it 's unclear whether I am actively doing something , such as prolonging my life or seeking to end it , or simply allowing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course of treatment ( or not ) with the result that my life extends or comes to a close . <p> The availability of various medical options can make the people who love me feel that they have failed me : " I should have convinced her to have surgery . I should n't have let the medical staff opt for comfort-care only . I should have been her advocate . I should have pushed for her to stay in the hospital longer . " But , there is a natural arc to a life well lived , and well-being is not the same thing as biological self interest or longevity . <p> I have written all of this in the language of obligation since that was the language in which you posed your question . But the language of obligation is a strong one . <p> We might do better to ask whether we have good reasons to prolong our lives or whether we act virtuously if we seek to prolong our lives . Courage is a virtue that figures centrally at the end of life . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rage against the dying of the light . " But it also takes courage to bear our mild yoke and , contradicting Thomas , opt to " go gentle into that good night . " <p> Whatever your choices are going forward , I wish you and your family courage , grace , and happiness . And remember : life is yours to live and " death shall have no dominion . "

She also named Art as her executrix . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> The three witnesses to the will affixed their signatures on the left-hand margin of both pages of the will , but not at the bottom of the attestation clause . <p> The petition was opposed by Alda , who represented herself as the attorney-in-fact of " the 12 legitimate heirs " of the decedent .

Admittedly , the attestation clause fails to state the number of pages of the will . There was an incomplete attempt to comply with this requisite , a space having been allotted for the insertion of the number of pages in the attestation clause . Yet the blank was never filled in ; hence , the requisite was left uncomplied with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stated in the attestation clause is obvious : the document might easily be so prepared that the removal of a sheet would completely change the testamentary dispositions of the will and in the absence of a statement of the total number of sheets such removal might be effected by taking out the sheet and changing the numbers at the top of the following sheets or pages . <p> If , on the other hand , the total number of sheets is stated in the attestation clause , the falsification of the document will involve the inserting of new pages and the forging of the signatures of the testator and witnesses in the margin , a matter attended with much greater difficulty . <p> In this case , the number of pages used in the will is not stated in any part of the will . The will does not even contain any notarial acknowledgment wherein the number of pages of the will should be stated . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <h> Q : May Lix invoke substantial compliance as stated in Art . 809 of the Civil Code ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state the number of pages on which the will was written remains a fatal flaw , despite Article 809 . <p> The purpose of the law in requiring the clause to state the number of pages on which the will is written is to safeguard against possible interpolation or omission of one or some of its pages and to prevent any increase or decrease in the pages . <p> The failure to state the number of pages equates with the absence of an averment on the part of the instrumental witnesses as to how many pages consisted the will , the execution of which they had ostensibly just witnessed and subscribed to . <p> There is substantial compliance with this requirement if the will states elsewhere in it how many pages it is comprised of . In this case , there could have been no substantial compliance with the requirements under Article 805 since there is no statement in the attestation clause or anywhere in the will itself as to the number of pages which comprise the will . <h> Q : What other critical defects does the will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : For one , the attestation clause was not signed by the instrumental witnesses . <p> While the signatures of the instrumental witnesses appear on the left-hand margin of the will , they do not appear at the bottom of the attestation clause which after all consists of their averments before the notary public . <p> An unsigned attestation clause can not be considered as an act of the witnesses , since the omission of their signatures at the bottom thereof negatives their participation . An unsigned attestation clause results in an unattested will . <p> Second , the requirement under Article 806 that " every will must be acknowledged before a notary public by the testator and the witnesses " has also not been complied with . <p> In lieu of an acknowledgment , the notary public , wrote " Nilagdaan ko at ninotario ko ngayong 10 ng Hunyo 10 ( sic ) , 1981 dito sa Lungsod ng Maynila .

@@88126230 <h> Life with music in a pandemic <p> Sometimes I ponder over the future of music and the arts in this pandemic . <p> It was a whole new world when I chose to pursue music in 2019 . But the pandemic struck , and with barely any signs of improvement nowadays outside the development of vaccines , it 'll take a while before things can go back to normal . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> It 's times like these when the questions start rushing back . Am I in the right place ? Is my course still worth pursuing ? Am I even doing something " practical , " for lack of a better term ? Should I start working again ? But what about my scholarship ? Should I have shifted to law or pursued a master 's degree instead ? <p> Despite the abrupt but necessary inconveniences brought about by the advent of online classes , I realized that music does have its place in this pandemic , and that its future extends far beyond the traditional source of entertainment we usually associate it with . <p> Music , for starters , is a source of healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge during the pandemic , but strangely enough , a lot of our classes are thankfully tolerable thanks to the music we 've been studying . There 's something about it that soothes both the body and mind . There 's a reason why music therapy exists , which is not just an education-related tool but an actual medical tool that licensed therapists use for patients undergoing rehabilitation abroad . Music even plays an important role in " preparing " terminally ill patients . In a time when we 're all grappling with grief , uncertainty , and anxiety , music has served as a catalyst for healing people in their time of need , and I see its importance more than ever . <p> Music has had its own breakthroughs in the engineering and IT fields . We 've learned how possible it is to integrate technology with music through the production of new electronic instruments . With everyone being isolated , new apps have started popping up for the convenience of musicians ; there 's one app that lets you compose and collaborate with other musicians on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to sing with your friends without pesky lags . <p> Music also taught me to reconnect with my roots . Musicology classes might sound like a musical mix between literature and history classes , but they taught us the importance of preserving our rich cultural heritage after centuries of colonization and neglect . We learned the dangers of losing our oral and written history embedded in more than a hundred ethnolinguistic groups around the Philippines -- the Aeta , Tagbanuas , Manobos , etc. , especially given the dangers our Lumad brothers and sisters have been subjected to in recent years . <p> A big misconception about being a performer is that we are individualists who have to prop themselves up to be heard by the world . But choral and orchestral music taught me that teamwork exists and is a necessity . As performers , we are taught not to act like " stars " but to use our respective talents for a bigger audience . Also , being a conductor in an orchestra is more than just baton-waving and swaying ; have you ever tried doing bicep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an hour at different tempos nonstop . It 's an intensive workout and not one to be taken lightly . <p> Music theory is like combining academic math ( with a bit of physics ) with your auditory senses . Although it 's a difficult subject , it is through theory where the fundamentals of music are learned -- such as the fact that the 12 different pitches we 've been forced to familiarize with have found their way to various compositions across centuries , and we also see them in our OPM songs . <p> Through music , I learned the value of appreciating each moment in life and doing my best . Our performance exams involved performing in front of a panel and an audience through recitals , which tested our nerves and quick-thinking skills . In recent months , our patience was also tested as we had to record ourselves singing and keep the videos clean from background noise . That meant pressing the stop-and-play button numerous times every time a tricycle zoomed past our house . <p> And it is thanks to music that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music community in the Philippines is a small but booming one , which requires building friendships and forming relationships for various projects . During these past years , I 've met musicians who are not only gifted in music but are also passionate in other fields such as environmental science , film , nuclear physics , and law . But despite our differences , we 've learned to bond thanks to music , and during this pandemic , we 're helping each other through the odds . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> I still see hope and a future in music despite these difficult times . I hope many will feel the same way , too . <p> Lis Fortun , 29 , is from Cavite .
