Can we believe what we hear and then expound it as truth ? <p> THE INTELLECTUAL PROCESS What you are reading now is based on an intellectual process taking place as a result of knowledge gained by the writer . That knowledge had to come from somewhere . And that knowledge could not have come from anywhere else but from other people , that is , what other people had to say in the form of speech or their written word . Your very ability to read and understand this article was developed by what you have absorbed from others from the moment of your birth to the present . Your judgment of this article will be based on exactly that -- the intellectual process of knowledge . <p> If you are reading this , then it is up to you to believe it or not . Now you have a dilemma . Should you absorb what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then expound it to the world after making intellectual adjustments or should you flatly reject it and simply forget about it ? May I say at this point that either way you will not be able to get rid of what you are taking in . Once it is absorbed it becomes filed in the memory bank of your heart and that is where it remains , unless your mind makes a secretarial move and extracts it from the memory cabinet for further deliberation as to what to do with it . <p> AS A MAN THINKETH IN HIS HEART , SO IS HE You are what you think . What you think and believe will be based on what you heard . And what you read is an act of hearing . For example , if you heard that an individual by the name of Darwin said that you are the end product of a process of evolution from ape to man , then you will either believe it or not . If you believe it , then you are what you think , namely , an ape-man - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in life . However , the question is , where did Darwin get it from ? He obviously had to hear it from someone or such ideas from many , processed it in his mind and eventually believed what he came up with . Now half the world believes it too . <p> In like manner , everything you have absorbed in the form of words emanating from other human vessels has made you what you are . Your parents , schoolteachers , friends , foes , colleagues , employers , co-workers and authors have moulded you into what you are . Your personal demeanour will have developed as a consequence of these influences . Your built-in , mind-driven intellect will have been at the helm of all the decisions you have taken in life and those decisions will have been based on whether or not you believed others . Tricky , is n't it ? Just think , you are what others have made you and you are going to try and make others be just like you and probably get annoyed if others do n't believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not believing him . <p> THE BOOKS WE READ The books we read are the printed words of others . And as already stated , the words of others have impacted our lives . Their opinions have become our opinions and perhaps we have intellectually re-processed their opinions to disguise them as our very own . ( Golly , there appears to be no originality in our make-up ) <p> Yes , the world is one big cauldron of communication where everyone is trying to impress the next . We can look upon the world as a word exchange between the masses of humankind -- nothing new , just intellectually re-worked thoughts presented to each other . <p> Out of this melting pot of human " originality " has emerged a creature called " Modern Man " . This guy has convinced the majority of fellow-earthlings to believe in the cream topping of the word of man and nothing else . <p> There is another fellow who goes by the name of the Word of God , also known as Jesus Christ . He is the absolute original and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to hear it . Today , many have absorbed what He has to say in His Book , the Bible and now they live by it . He claims to be the Creator of man -- the very man who would rather believe what other God-created men have to say and write than the One who gave them life . Modern Man is leading the pack against Him and looks upon His followers as the gullible , feeble-minded sector of society . <p> And now I guess it is a matter of deciding what to believe - the Word of God or the word of man , bearing in mind that your spirit came from God in the first place and that your God-given spirit came equipped with the ability to hear from Him as well as your fellow man and a built-in free will to reject the one or the other . Then again , what you have read is only my word and belief being expounded to the world . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News24 are therefore their own and do not necessarily represent the views of News24 .

@@8232 <h> Evolutionary Myths <p> During the December break , I followed some discussions , and saw a well-read atheist , proclaim that the human embryo had gills , and this was proof of the link between man and fish ... <p> I could only chuckle at the idea . So I thought about discussing this and some other myths .. <p> In an article , Eric J. Blievernicht mentions being handed a book from his then retiring biology teacher . The following was stated there : <p> " The fish , reptile , and human embryos each form an internal skeleton , including vertebral column , skull , ribs , limb girdles , and limb cartilages . The gills open through the pharynx to the outside ... In the reptile and the human embryos , the pharyngeal gills are closed up , and lungs develop . " <p> Ibid , pp. 488-489 <p> He further mentions that a fellow student pointed to human gill slits as " proof " of evolution . One had to admit it was a good point . If humans really have gill slits as foetuses , that would indeed be powerful evidence for the evolution of man from fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this intellectual hangover from the 19th century confined to old biology textbooks and ignorant biochemistry students . I found the following statement recently in a book by Dr. Ian Tattersall , prominent paleoanthropologist and Head of the Anthropology Department at the American Museum of Natural History . His work included serving as Curator in Charge of the Hall of Human Biology and Evolution there . He writes : " Sometimes the process of individual development can also be informative : the fact that gill slits appear early in embryonic life among humans and other land-dwellers , for example , helps confirm that gills are a primitive character among vertebrates . " <p> The idea that human foetuses have gill slits is a part of what was known as the Biogenetic Law . " The idea that the embryo of a complex animal goes through stages resembling the embryos of its ancestors is called the Biogenetic Law . " This " Law " , also known as recapitulation theory , ( i.e. , " ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny " ) was formulated in 1866 by Dr. Ernst Haeckel , an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fared since then ? <p> In 1874 another German professor , Wilhelm His , showed that Haeckel had deliberately altered earlier sketches of human and dog embryos to support the Biogenetic Law . Professor His was ignored by evolutionists in spite of the " blatant fraud " and the exacting detail in which he was able to show how the fraud had been generated . Taylor comments : " His , whose work still stands as the foundation of our knowledge of embryological development , was not the first to point out the deficiencies of Haeckel 's work , nor indeed was he the last , yet Haeckel 's fraudulent drawings have continued to the present day to be reproduced throughout the biological literature . " <p> This dishonesty was admitted in the Introduction to the Centennial Edition of Darwin 's Origin of the Species : " When the ' convergence ' of embryos was not entirely satisfactory , Haeckel altered the illustrations of them to fit his theory . The ' biogenetic law ' as proof of evolution is valueless . " " <p> This myth has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and schools and universities . But what about the infamous " gill slits " shown in Haeckel 's sketches ? <p> A modern medical text states : " The pharyngeal arches and clefts are frequently referred to as branchial arches and branchial clefts in anology with the lower vertebrates , but since the human embryo never has gills called ' branchia ' , the term pharyngeal arches and clefts has been adopted for this book . " <p> Biologist Dr. Gary Parker states the following : " The throat ( or pharyngeal ) grooves and pouches , falsely called " gill slits " are not mistakes in human development . They develop into absolutely essential parts of human anatomy . The middle ear canals come from the second pouches , and the parathyroid and thymus glands come from the third and fourth ... another pouch , thought to be vestigial by evolutionists until just recently , becomes a gland that assists in calcium balance . Far from being useless evolutionary vestiges , then , these so-called " gill slits " are quite essential for distinctively human development . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so great and overwhelming , why did evolutionists need to continue to promote a 19th-century fraud to support their theory ... <p> Further information <p> The whole " ontogyny recapitulates phylogeny " principle has fallen into disrepute . It used to be trumpeted as a common-sense support for evolution , but many examples of this principle turned out to be based on superficial resemblances and misconceptions . That 's not to say that one can not learn about evolution by studying embryos , but the real picture is quite a bit complicated than human embryos having gills and tails . <p> In an unfortunate display of Creationist-type behavior , some Evolutionists ( and by capitalizing that term I mean to indicate **29;1179;TOOLONG , as distinguished from , say , scientists who study evolution ) have continued to trot out this canard . It 's an appealing notion , to be sure , but one that should probably be discarded in favor of stronger scientific arguments . In his Ontogeny and Phylogeny , Stephen Jay Gould pointed out that it is more accurate to say " ontogeny recapitulates ontogeny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling the adult forms of ancestral species , but may pass through stages similar to those of embryonic/fetal stages of ancestral species . The early stages of development are highly conservative ; evolutionary modifications are more likely to appear at later stages of development than later ones . Embryonic humans at very early stages resemble embryonic fish ( both having branchial clefts ) ; they never resemble adult fish ( having true gills ) . The facial muscles , pharynx , larynx , thyroid , thymus , mandible , facial bones , inner ear bones , tonsils and nasal cavity develop from pharyngeal arches . <p> The evolutionist says , " There 's no evidence of creation in the human embryo . Otherwise , why would a human being have a yolk sac like a chicken does and a tail like a lizard does ? Why would a human being have gill slits like a fish does ? An intelligent creator should have known that human beings do n't need those things . " <p> If the opening were really part of a gill , if it really were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be blood vessels all around it , as if it were going to absorb oxygen from water as a gill does . But there is no such structure . We simply do n't have the DNA instructions for forming gills . The throat ( or pharyngeal ) grooves and pouches , falsely called " gill slit , " are not mistakes in human development . They develop into absolutely essential parts of human anatomy -- the lower jaw , tongue , thymus gland , the parathyroid , etc . The middle ear canals come from the second pouches , and the parathyroid and thymus glands come from the third and fourth . <p> Without a thymus , we would lose half our immune systems . Without the parathyroids , we would be unable to regulate calcium balance and could not even survive . Another pouch , thought to be vestigial by evolutionists until just recently , becomes a gland that assists in calcium balance . Far from being useless evolutionary vestiges , then , these so-called " gill slits " are quite essential for distinctively human development . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the food that the chick depends on for growth . In humans , we grow attached to our mothers , and they nourish us . Does that mean the foetus 's so-called " yolk sac " can be cut off from the human embryo because it is n't needed ? The " yolk sac " is the source of the human embryo 's first blood cells , and death would result without it . <p> In the adult , you want to have the blood cells formed inside the bone marrow . That makes good sense , because the blood cells are very sensitive to radiation damage and bone would offer them some protection . You need blood in order to form the bone marrow that later on is going to form blood . So , where do you get the blood first ? The DNA and protein for making it are " common stock " building materials . And , since it lies conveniently outside the embryo , it can easily be discarded after it has served its temporary-but vital-function . <p> That 's what we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can provide food and blood cells to a chicken embryo can be used to supply blood cells ( all that 's needed ) for a human embryo . Rather than reflecting time and chance , adapting similar structures to a variety of needs seems to reflect creation . <p> The Human tail <p> Some of you have heard that man has a " tail bone " ( also called a coccyx ) , and that the only reason we have it is to remind us that our ancestors had tails . If one thinks the coccyx is useless , fall down the stairs and land on it . ( Some of you may have actually done that-unintentionally , I 'm sure ! ) What happens ? You ca n't stand up ; you ca n't sit down ; you ca n't lie down ; you ca n't roll over . You can hardly move without pain . In one sense , the coccyx is one of the most important bones in the whole body . It 's an important point of muscle attachment required for our distinctive upright posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coccyx is quite important in human development . True , the end of the spine sticks out noticeably in a one-month embryo , but that 's because muscles and limbs do n't develop until stimulated by the spine . As the legs develop , they surround and envelop the coccyx , and it winds up inside the body . <p> Once in a great while a child will be born with a " tail . " But , is it really a tail ? No , it 's not even the coccyx . It does n't have any bones in it ; it does n't have any nerve cord either . The nervous system starts stretched out open on the back . During development , it rises up in ridges and rolls shut . It starts to " zipper " shut in the middle first , then it zippers toward either end . Once in a while it does n't go far enough , and that produces a serious defect called spina bifida . Sometimes it rolls a little too far . Then the baby will be born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor . It 's just skin and a little fatty tissue , so the doctor can just cut it off . It 's not at all like the tail of a cat that has muscle , bones , and nerve , so cutting it off is not complicated . ( So far as I know , no one claims that proves we evolved from an animal with a fatty tumor at the end of its spine . ) <p> So hopefully this will help the individual that stated the little gem about human having gills in the embryonic stage .

@@14235 <h> Sustainable development <h> South Africa 's household recycling target <p> 7 January 2013 South Africa aims to have all households in the country 's large centres separating their own waste into recyclable and non-recyclable material by 2016 . Separating recyclables at household level is a requirement in terms of the Waste Act , and the National Waste Management Strategy requires that in four years ' time all metropolitan municipalities , secondary cities and large towns will have initiated programmes for waste separation at source . According to Dr Suzan Oelofse , a principal researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) , the participation of households in these programmes will be crucial to achieving the 2016 target . However , the results of two CSIR surveys show that South Africa 's municipal authorities face a daunting task in creating public awareness around the requirements of the Waste Act . The study revealed that only 3.3% of the country 's urban population regularly recycled household waste in 2010 . This finding is underscored by another study , also conducted by the CSIR , which shows that , of the estimated 19-million tons of municipal waste generated in South Africa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paper , tins and plastics . " It is alarming that two-thirds of the more than 2 ? 000 urban South African households surveyed do not know where to dispose of their household recyclables , " says CSIR research project leader Wilma Strydom . " Furthermore , the majority of the participants in the study said that they do not know how nor what to recycle . " <h> Urban South Africans do not recycle <p> The 2010 survey , aimed at understanding post-consumer recycling behaviour in South Africa , does not paint a very positive picture about urban South Africans ' attitude and behaviour when it comes to recycling . According to the survey : <p> More than 73% of South Africans living in urban areas reported no recycling at all ; <p> About 27% of urban South Africans reported some recycling behaviour ; and <p> Only 3.3% of the respondents indicated that they sort most or all of the selected five recyclables from their household waste and recycle it on a frequent basis . <p> The survey results also highlight an overall negative attitude towards recycling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space , lack of time , because it is dirty or untidy , or they lack the knowledge of what is recyclable and what not . Another reason cited was inconvenient recycling facilities . However , the survey results also indicate that South Africans might start to recycle and continue to recycle should it be convenient to do so . " The results show that a two-bag system - simply separating dry waste from wet waste like food scraps - combined with a regular kerbside collection service , would create the best opportunity to mobilise South Africans to start recycling , " says Strydom . " This should be complemented with communication and awareness-raising campaigns , as well as continued research to understand the drivers of recycling behaviour and how to motivate people to recycle . " <h> Taking the pressure off municipal landfill sites <p> Improved recovery of recyclables at household level would significantly alleviate the pressure on South Africa 's municipal landfill sites .

The maths is simple , says Oelofse : " The best solution for reducing pressure on available landfill space is a reduction in waste through waste minimisation and recycling . " In an attempt to estimate the mass of recyclables disposed of at municipal landfill sites in 2011 , Oelofse obtained landfill-based characterisation information from Cape Town , Durban and Johannesburg . This showed that landfill airspace is mainly consumed by green waste , recyclables and builders ' rubble . Mainline recyclables - paper , plastics , glass , tins and tyres - contribute 25% of the municipal waste generated in Gauteng and 22% in Cape Town . According to the Department of Environmental Affairs , an estimated 19-million tons of municipal waste was generated in South Africa in 2011 .

In the wake of a vicious blaze that caused major destruction , and while awaiting the outcome of an inquiry into policing in the crime-ridden area , the community is waiting to exhale . By KATE STEGEMANN . <p> In the aftermath of the fire that ripped through BM section on the one hand and next week 's judgement on the Commission of Inquiry into policing in Khayelitsha on the other , its clear that residents of Cape Town 's largest informal settlement not only face ongoing violations of their socio-economic rights , but that their rights to security are undermined by rampant levels of crime . Poor policing and a lack of infrastructure development go hand in hand . Instead of poorly planned reactions to well-publicised instances of fires , floods , rape and necklacing - after the fact - government needs to address the complex , systemic causes of unsafety and understand that security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest and most marginalised citizens will continue to bear ' die brand ' of inequality . <p> Images of destruction <p> Before the sun rose to herald in 2013 , a fire broke out in Khayelitsha 's BM section , leaving at least five people dead , an estimated 3,000-4,000 people homeless and a path of destruction in its wake . The bleak landscape of BM section that remains only hints at the years of inequality and underdevelopment it has faced . One week ago , a thousand-odd densely packed corrugated iron shacks perched precariously on soft beach-like sand , were engulfed in flames in a matter of minutes ; because they were surrounded by a maze of narrow pathways rather than roads , witnesses say fire trucks were unable to gain fast and effective access . Disaster Risk Management 's Wilfred Solomons-Johannes denies the delay and is confident the fire department worked hard to contain the blaze . Residents on the ground told Daily Maverick that the root cause and blame lie squarely at the feet of government who have failed to provide adequate housing and basic service delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-building the settlement . " Negotiations for additional land owned by SANDF have begun ... And block layout plans have been laid out , " she said . <p> Clean-up efforts <p> Fire victims cleared away the charred remains of their homes and worldly belongings . On Thursday 03 January 2012 , two days after the fire wrecked havoc on their lives , residents were assisted by Khayelitsha-based community members and NGO volunteers , including members of the Social Justice Coalition ( SJC ) . In contrast , Disaster Risk Management and City officials were conspicuous in their limited presence . Welcome Makele , pictured wearing a purple jersey , works for the SJC as a Community Advocate . He says : " The city has n't helped us . I am not happy . They keep on writing down the list of the victims instead of assisting them to rebuild their shacks or give them alternative space ...

They must come here more " . <p> Inside OR Tambo Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in OR Tambo Hall on Mew Way , near BM section . Fire victims have received blankets , bread , juice and baby food from City officials , but a lack of mattresses means many are sleeping on the cold , hard hall floors . Last week residents voiced their concerns that they have yet to get temporary documents from the Department of Home Affairs . They were also dismayed that it took Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille three days to arrive on the scene . The response to the emergency has been compromised by the often-present cross-party political mudslinging , most notably when ANC provincial leader Marius Fransman told some DA-led city officials last week to go " back to their white bosses " to tell them of the suffering of the fire victims . <p> December 2012 : Commission of Inquiry protest outside High Court <p> On Monday Jared Sacks reported for Daily Maverick that allegedly after the BM section fire , " police left unattended the charred remains of three dead bodies till well after 17:00 when investigators finally returned to the settlement " . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plight , Khayelitsha residents also believe instead of upholding safety in their communities , the police and criminal justice system violate their rights to security at every turn . In December 2012 , a few hundred people , made up mostly of Khayelitsha residents as well as politically active students and members of the public , protested outside the Cape High Court to show their opposition to Police Minister Nathi Mthetwa 's attempted interdict against the Commission of Inquiry ( CoI ) into policing in Khayelitsha .

@@14240 <h> South Africa <h> Pension fund curatorship : Conflict of interest substantial <p> Rockland curator 's report shows various issues with land valuation used for fees payable . <p> Jeanette Clark&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp7 January 2013&amp;nbsp23:31 <p> PRETORIA -- The conflict of interest that existed between the manager of a fund that reinvested six pension funds ' money was so substantial that it left room for the manipulation of share prices of a major investment and the performance and management fees that was based on the valuation of that investment . <p> In his report submitted to the Cape Town High Court , Rockland curator Pierre Kriel , <p> highlighted some of the discrepancies in the valuation of the Schaap Kraal properties . This property investment is the main asset under management in the Rockland Targeted Development Investment ( TDI ) Fund , in which six pension funds ( including the Telkom Retirement Fund and the Mine Employees Pension Fund ) invested some of their funds . <p> The Rockland entities , now placed under final curatorship , include Rockland Group Holdings , Rockland Asset Management and Consulting ( RAM ) and the TDI Fund . The pensions funds involved are the Engineering Industrial Pension Fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Paper Print Wood and Allied Workers Union ( PPWAWU ) National Provident Fund , the Mine Employees Pension Fund and the Sentinel Mining Industry Retirement Fund . Combined it appears that these funds have hundreds of thousands of contributing members . <p> In the curator 's report Kriel states that he agrees with the comments in the original inspection report that conflicts of interest " were substantial . " " This lead to the possibility to manipulate the acquisition and " resale " of shares in the Rapicorp companies , performance fees and other transaction ( sic ) based on overvaluing the Schaap Kraal properties and payment of fees not provided for , " the report reads . <p> At the heart of the matter is the fact that the valuation of the Schaap Kraal property is under dispute . <p> The property is about 472ha in size and adjacent to Mitchell 's Plain , 1.2km from the False Bay Coast . The latest valuation obtained by Rocklands Asset Management ( which manages the TDI Fund and is paid for this service in management and performance fees ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeke of Spiral Valuation Services CC , splits the value between the value of the property for urban township development ( R440m ) and the value of the sand for mining purposes ( R450m ) . The first problem pointed out by the curator , is that although the property is earmarked for urban development , it is still zoned as ' agricultural ' and the rezoning still has to take place . Approval for the mining of the sand has also not yet been granted , but still the valuations are based on these factors . Kriel also points out that although earlier valuations of the land indicated that " theoretically " there is 9m cubic meters of sand available for mining , to mine the area to significant extents will severely affect the potential of the area as an urban development . " Very limited mining should be considered should the area be considered for urban development , " a letter from the ICE Group , used in two of the valuation reports , read . <p> " Based on my consultation with the various consultants who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears that , if the township development does go ahead , at most 1m cubic meters of sand could be mined , " Kriel states in his report . He then contends that the valuation of the sand in each of the valuation reports should therefore be divided by nine , bringing the value down substantially -- in the case of the abovementioned valuation from R450m for the sand to only R50m . The higher valuations , however , were used to determine performance fees and management fees payable by the pension funds to RAM and its management , which includes among others director Wentzel Oaker . <p> Kriel states in his report that although the property appears to have potential , the regular increases in valuation do not appear to have been warranted and that it " was at least fallacious to utilise such valuations for purposes of calculation fees and payments to investors exiting the scheme or for acquisition of shares in the Rapicorp companies owning the Schaap Kraal land .

@@27238 wine industry ' optimistic ' <p> 14 January 2013 Following a few very tough years , the South African wine industry is optimistic on the back of record export levels , good prospects for this year 's harvest , the penetration of new markets , and growing praise from high-profile wine critics , says Wines of South Africa CEO Su Birch . South African wine exports for 2012 reached 417-million litres , 10-million litres more than the previous record of 407-million litres achieved in 2008 and a 17% increase on volumes in 2011 , Birch said on Monday . " The record levels are the result of a more favourable currency , as well as the global shortage of wines , stemming from a significant drop in the recent harvests of competitor wine-producing nations in Europe , Latin America , Australia and New Zealand , " Birch said in a statement . <h> Third-biggest crop forecast <p> Birch said all indications were that this year 's local crop could be the third-biggest in recorded history . " This is assuming that good weather conditions continue , there is a speedy and peaceful resolution to the farmworker strikes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size is despite a decrease in total plantings , thanks to one of the best winter seasons in the Western Cape for many years . " The South African Wine Industry &amp; Information Systems ( Sawis ) has anticipated that the 2013 wine grape crop should amount to 1 ? 384 ? 357 tons . <h> Bulk vs packaged exports <p> Birch said that while bulk ( i.e. non-packaged ) exports accounted for 59% of volumes in 2012 , this was in line with a growing global trend . She explained that over the past decade , bulk wine exports from the major New World wine-producing countries had risen from around 20% to over half of wine volumes traded , against the background of protracted recessionary market conditions . " The reality we face also confronts Australia , Chile , Argentina and even New Zealand . " She said while packaged wines generally offered higher returns , local producers had been forced to accept that to compete globally , they had to provide what the mainstream markets wanted . " Obviously we would prefer the accent to be on packaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of job retention in the packaging industry and also to maintain sustainable profit margins for producers . We are therefore greatly encouraged by the recent growth of packaged exports to North America , Japan , China , as well as several increasingly affluent African nations , all to regions where we have been increasing our marketing investment . " <h> Praise from high-profile critics <p> She said the industry had also been buoyed by the growing confidence in South Africa as a top wine-producing country among high-profile international critics , whose opinion carried great weight in the global wine business fraternity as well as with consumers . " Over the past few weeks we have had praise from the likes of Neal Martin , who reviews for Robert E Parker 's world-famous The Wine Advocate , and who has singled out South Africa as currently the most exciting New World wine country , as well as from Stephen Tanzer of the International Wine Cellar , the UK 's Oz Clarke , Tim Atkin MW and Sarah Ahmed and Germany 's Eckhard Supp .

" The local Fairtrade office has confirmed that South Africa now has the highest number of Fairtrade-accredited wineries worldwide , with 65% of Fairtrade wines sold globally coming from our country . " At the same time , Birch said , there was steadily growing support for the Wine and Agricultural Industry Ethical Trade Association ( Wieta ) , with increasing numbers of producers subscribing to its code of good conduct . This was particularly after the international market reacted positively to last year 's launch of the Wieta ethical seal , a world-first that provides a guarantee of fair labour practices . " Wieta accreditation for rigorously audited fair labour conditions has accelerated since last year and with the increase in producer and worker training sessions scheduled , prior to auditing sessions , we expect many more labels to qualify during this year , " Birch said .

@@43231 <h> FNB ups qualifying spend for SLOW lounges <p> Pretoria - In mid-2010 , at the height of World Cup fever , FNB announced a new " value add " -- the SLOW Lounge .

@@43232 <h> Mkhize to remain KZN premier <p> Durban - Zweli Mkhize will continue as KwaZulu-Natal premier and there are no plans to have him replaced before the 2014 election , the provincial ANC said on Tuesday . <p> Mkhize was elected treasurer general of the African National Congress at its national elective conference in Mangaung in December . <p> ANC rules dictate that he can not hold a position on both the national executive committee and the provincial executive committee ( PEC ) . <p> ANC KwaZulu-Natal secretary Sihle Zikalala said the provincial general council ( PGC ) would have to find a new chairman , but this would not affect Mkhize 's position as premier . <p> The ANC would also have to elect replacements for Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant , former provincial ANC Women 's League chairwoman Lungi Gcabashe , and State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele , all of whom were elected to the national executive committee . <p> Zikalala said nominations of members for the PEC had started and would be completed by the time the party held its PGC early in March . <p> Zikalala said the PEC met on Monday to discuss several issues .

@@43234 <h> SA 's unfolding digital TV nightmare <p> Confusion around the encryption and control of set-top boxes , and the complexity of subsidies of the boxes for poorer households , are threatening South Africa 's migration to digital terrestrial television . By Craig Wilson . <p> Lack of certainty around the encryption and access control mechanisms to be used for digital terrestrial television , along with how millions of set-top boxes will be subsidised for poorer households , looks set to throw South Africa even further off track in the already long-delayed , multibillion-rand project . <p> There is rising anger in both the broadcasting and telecommunications industries over the continued delays , which could mean South Africa continues to broadcast analogue signals well past the June 2015 deadline set by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) to complete migration to digital . <p> The prospect of protracted legal action involving e.tv and communications minister Dina Pule , coupled with the complexity of proposed access control mechanisms , the insistence that subsidised set-top boxes be locally manufactured -- despite the likelihood they 'll cost far more than units imported from Asia -- and confusion over who will pay for the subsidy are raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on the record , mostly for fear of losing contracts or falling out of political favour . <p> Government says it intends to subsidise 70% of the cost of set-top boxes for 5m of South Africa 's poorest homes , an exercise expected to cost at least R4,5bn . It is unknown where this funding will come from . One of the proposed sources of funds for the subsidy is the Universal Service &amp; Access Agency of South Africa ( Usaasa ) . However , the fund Usaasa administers is not large enough to fund the project fully -- it 's not clear how much money is in the fund , but industry players peg the number at between R1bn and R2bn . <p> Also , Usaasa 's funds do n't only come from broadcasters but from telecoms operators as well . These operators have raised objections to the fund being used to fund broadcasting . Operators will , however , potentially gain access to some of the radio frequency spectrum that will become available once the migration to digital broadcasting is complete . <p> Senior industry players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their need to work with government , say the task of determining who is eligible for a subsidised box is going to be a major headache . They say many people who are n't deemed eligible will argue they are . The process could be a nightmare to manage . <p> Altech UEC MD Rodger Warren <p> The department of communications continues to insist that the set-top boxes be locally sourced , saying the project would create local jobs and stimulate a black-owned manufacturing sector . Again , industry players question whether this plan makes sense , especially since many of the emerging manufacturers will simply be repackaging imported components rather than genuinely building boxes locally . <p> Access control Because government will spend billions of rand on subsidising set-top boxes , it is insisting they include access control mechanisms to stop them from being sold by the intended beneficiaries . Originally , this was limited to a location verification-type mechanism that would prevent them being used outside the country . However , this has been expanded to include facilities to manage subscriptions and turn the boxes on or off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be administered by a CA vendor . Sentech , which was instructed by minister Pule in May last year to manage the CA system , has proposed Nagravision as the vendor . It already uses Nagravision to manage some of its satellite services . <p> However , free-to-air broadcaster e.tv took exception to Pule 's decision to appoint Sentech , successfully suing the minister in the high court last year . That court 's judgment is now the subject of an appeal by the minister . This appeal process could take years , further endangering South Africa 's commitment to the ITU and prolonging the release of spectrum to broadband telecoms operators and the attendant benefits that will flow from that . <p> E.tv has argued that it and the SABC , along with future free-to-air broadcasters , should administer the CA system because they have the most to lose if it is not done correctly . <p> The broadcaster 's chief operating officer , Bronwyn Keene-Young , says it 's important that set-top boxes allow e.tv and the SABC to offer competitive services . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as free-to-air broadcasters is that our biggest competition is MultiChoice 's DStv . If we do n't have a platform that 's attractive , then free-to-air digital TV is going to be a non-starter , " she says . <p> Keene-Young says that if digital specifications and the CA system are not outlined and controlled carefully , users will not have a cohesive experience across different set-top boxes and this could impact negatively their view of free-to-air broadcasters and their offerings . " Encryption will ensure that boxes that do n't meet the specifications wo n't work . " <p> Subscription control must also be considered . The vendor that manages the CA system will be able to turn set-top boxes on and off and identify each box by means of an individual identifier . This means a potential goldmine of data on viewing habits for the vendor that administers the system . <p> E.tv chief operating officer Bronwyn Keene-Young <p> Altech UEC , a subsidiary of JSE-listed technology group Altech , is South Africa 's largest manufacturer of TV set-top boxes . Its MD , Rodger Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute with e.tv over the CA system , UEC will be able to build boxes that include any access control mechanisms government wants . <p> " How soon we can begin building set-top boxes is dependent on the department 's response to the court case , " Warren says . " Hopefully , the matter will be settled sooner rather than later . " <p> Warren says that the specifications for the boxes are " very unlikely to change " , even if Pule 's appeal fails and e.tv and the SABC end up managing the CA system . " If it had to change it would have to go back to the technical committee , " he says , adding that this seems " highly unlikely " given the additional delays that would incur . <p> " If e.tv wins , it will take time to go through the development phase , " Warren explains .

@@48235 battery quits <p> Recently I saw a neighbour looking angrily at the dead battery in his car . The battery looked well past its best and although I managed to get the car mobile with a jump start , I urged him to get the battery tested and reckoned it was time to buy a new one . <p> I would have suggested testing the battery before opting for a replacement , but the disgruntled owner did not seem in the mood for helpful suggestions , so after getting his car mobile , I left it to him to decide what to do . <p> The DIY way is pretty straightforward ; when a battery goes flat , remove it from the car and give it a full charge . If it charges very quickly from dead that is bad news , contrary to what you may think , because it normally means the plates are well past their best and a new battery is needed . <p> Conversely , if after 24 or even 48 hours on the charger it is still not fully charged , there must be a short inside . In effect the short will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the charger with no improvement . <p> If the battery charges with no problems , but still tends to go flat , you must find out what is causing the problem .

Set it to amps and activate the alarm/immobiliser . The meter will then show the current draw when parked . Check the manual for permissible current draw . If this is excessive , check the cause . <p> No problem ? Connect the battery and try cranking the engine . It should spin easily . If it does n't , the battery , or a starter or earth problem , could be to blame . Connect to another running car via jump leads and try again . If cranking speed proves okay , the battery is duff .

@@48236 <h> Nokia battles to weather smartphone storm <p> Reuters.A woman holds a Nokia smartphone in this photo illustration taken in Bucharest January 24 , 2013 . Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia plans to axe its annual dividend payment for the first time in over 20 years to shore up its cash position against falling sales . Nokia , which earlier this month flagged a return to underlying profitability on cost cuts and stronger sales of its Lumia smartphone , said on Thursday it finished the year with net cash of 4.4 billion euros ( $5.8 billion ) , down 22 percent from a year earlier . <p> Helsinki - Struggling Nokia Corp . turned a net profit of e202 million ( $270 million ) in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of $1 <p> billion a year earlier , but revenue fell 20 percent as it failed to make gains in the fiercely competitive smartphone market . <p> The Finnish company said Thursday that revenue dropped to e8 billion ( $10.6 billion ) from e10 billion as smartphone sales plunged 55 percent , and it gave a grim outlook , saying it would not pay a dividend for 2012 to save money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent to e3.33 in Helsinki . <p> Nokia expects operating margins in the first quarter to be " approximately negative 2 percent , plus or minus four percentage points , " citing increased competition and lower-than-expected demand for its flagship Lumia phones and cheaper Asha models , which have been popular in emerging markets . <p> Nokia said it sold 15.9 million smartphones in the quarter , down from 19.6 million a year earlier , including 4.4 million Lumia phones . In comparison , rival Apple Inc. sold almost 48 million iPhones . <p> Neil Mawston , a technology expert from Strategy Analytics in Boston , said Nokia 's share of the global smartphone market had fallen to a record low of about 3 percent . <p> " Nokia is on a recovery curve at the moment , " Mawston said .

@@57230 <h> ANC in Tshwane to court white support <p> Pretoria - The ANC in Tshwane will be courting more white people to join the party and to vote for it during the elections next year . <p> It has failed to recruit white members in recent years . <p> According to Tshwane executive mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa , who is also regional chairman of the ANC in Tshwane , the ANC in the Tshwane region has " failed dismally " to attract whites , despite its needing their support for a decisive electoral victory . <p> Ramokgopa was speaking in a wide-ranging interview with the Pretoria News on Monday , during which he also claimed that the ANC could no longer rely on its struggle credentials to convince voters to vote for the ruling party . <p> He said that differences among members before the ANC national conference in Mangaung last year were buried when President Jacob Zuma was re-elected . <p> " The one area where we are failing dismally as a region is to recruit non-Africans to the party . The stats show that we have the biggest number of whites compared with other cities . <p> " So it is an indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANC in the region . We are failing in our historic duty as the ANC in Tshwane to ensure that we are seen to be pursuing a non-racial society , " said Ramokgopa . <p> He was referring to an SA Institute of Race Relations study that found whites made up a larger percentage of the population in Tshwane than in any other major metropolitan area in the country . <p> He said that a non-racial society was not necessarily measured by the number of people in the party , but by the attitude of the ANC to other races and what it was doing to resolve racial conflicts in society . <p> " I think there 's a whole lot that we are doing , but it will be bolstered by recruiting as many white people as possible , " Ramokgopa said . <p> " It also makes sense that when fighting electoral politics , your spread is among as many races as possible . <p> " So the percentage of white people located in Tshwane are needed for an ANC victory . It 's important that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see beyond race , by looking at what policies we are propagating and advancing . <p> " They should look at our track record in government . " <p> Ramokgopa conceded that the emotive issues in the city , including the changing of street names and of the capital 's name from Pretoria to Tshwane , might be the reason why some white people in the city might have shunned the ANC . <p> " The thing about emotions is that they go beyond the realm of reason , it is about people 's feelings , association and heritage . <p> " ( Street and city name changes were ) another front for a source of conflict . I can not deny that , " said Ramokgopa . <p> " But it was never about harming or demeaning the heritage or contributions of other races . Instead it was about affirming the contributions of other sectors of our society , and that is why you have names of Afrikaners , Indians , academics and all other types of people in the new street names . " <p> According to Ramokgopa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the ruling party as it can no longer rely on its contribution to the liberation Struggle to secure votes . <p> " It will be a scorecard of our government over two decades . We must be able to demonstrate to the rest of the city , province and the country that indeed we deserve another opportunity to lead . <p> " In my own personal view , less emphasis will be on the history . History will always be acknowledged , I do n't think there is any doubt about the ANC 's contribution . <p> " But we have had 20 years in office . The centre of gravity will shift from our historical , political contribution to our time in government , " he added . <p> Ramokgopa , whose Tshwane region , along with the ANC in Gauteng , supported a change of party leadership at the national conference in Mangaung , said all differences in the ANC had been buried when the new leadership was elected . <p> " We showed that there could be those contestations in the party and that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , there 's only one leadership and that leadership in this instance is led by President ( Jacob ) Zuma . And if there are any elements who think they can exploit the differences that were there before Mangaung , they are ill-disciplined .

@@57231 <h> South Africa : Afcon 2013 : Ambush Marketing <p> Late last year Trade and Industry Minister , Rob Davies , announced that the government intended to declare the 2013 Afcon tournament a ' protected event ' in terms of the Merchandise Marks Act . This means that the severe ambush marketing restrictions that characterised the 2010 FIFA World Cup will apply to the African Cup of Nations football tournament , which will take place between 19 January and 10 February 2013 , and which will be coming to a city near you provided that you do n't live in Cape Town ? the host cities are Johannesburg , Durban Port Elizabeth , Rustenburg and Nelspruit . <p> But what exactly is ambush marketing ? ? In essence , ambush marketing occurs when a business tries to get mileage out of an event that it has n't sponsored . The most obvious way for a business to do this is to use the event 's branding ? the name , the logo , the strapline ? in relation to its own product. ? This is , of course , ? illegal . In the first place , it is highly likely that the organisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event 's branding , and that these registrations will cover a wide range of goods and services . So the unauthorised use of the branding will amount to ? trade mark infringement. ? In addition , the event 's branding ? will in all likelihood be well known , with the result that ? consumers seeing it used in relation to the business 's product ? will wrongly assume that the business is a sponsor of the event , or that there is at least some commercial relationship. ? So there will be passing off. ? This passing off will , in fact , also be an offence under the ? Trade Practices Act . <p> On top of all this , the business 's conduct may well contravene the ambush marketing provisions of the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) Code , which defines ambush marketing as follows : ? ? ' The attempt of an organisation , product or brand to create the impression of being an official sponsor of an event or activity by affiliating itself with that event or activity without having paid the sponsorship right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And last , but certainly not least , it is quite possible that certain aspects of the event 's branding such as the official logo will be declared prohibited marks under the Merchandise Marks Act , in which case it becomes an offence to use them without authority ? for the 2010 FIFA World Cup a whole host of words , phrases and images were declared prohibited marks , including the official World Cup logo , and terms like ' World Cup 2010 ' , ' South Africa 2010 ' and ' SA 2010 ' . <p> So ? using an event 's branding is an absolute no-no . Most businesses know this . But they do still like to create a link or at least an impression of a link with a big event . They try to do this subtly , without actually using the event 's branding . This conduct is sometimes referred to as ambush marketing by ? intrusion . The sponsors of the 2003 Cricket World Cup put pressure on South Africa to take steps ? to put a stop to this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thing came in. ? The Merchandise Marks Act was amended by the addition of the controversial Section 15A , whose heading - ? ' Abuse of trade mark in relation to event ' - gives a fair indication of what it is all about . Basically ? the section says that in the case of a ? ' protected event ' , it will be an offence for a business that is not an official sponsor of that event to ' abuse ' its own brand . The business will be guilty of abusing its brand if it associates ? its brand with the event , or if its brand even alludes to the event , in a way in which the business ? derives ? publicity or promotional benefit . <p> Section 15A ? is very broad and it could conceivably cover all manner of things : a business ? arranging for an aircraft to fly over a stadium with a banner adverting its business ; ? a radio station setting up an outside broadcast unit outside a stadium on match day ; a business handing out t-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hope that the t-shirts will be shown on TV ) . ? The 2010 FIFA World Cup was , of course , a protected event and , as a result , FIFA was able to persuade ? Kulula to stop using an advertising ? campaign ? which featured the use of the term ' Unofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What ' together with stylized pictures of the Cape Town stadium , soccer balls , vuvuzelas , a soccer player , and the South African flag . In another well-publicised case , the authorities ejected a number of Dutch models from the Moses Mabida ? stadium during a match involving the Netherlands . Their crime : ? wearing orange ? t-shirts ( the national colour ) , which was perceived to be a promotion for Bavaria beer , and a way of undermining official beer sponsor Budweiser . <p> In 2010 the authorities used municipal legislation to ? introduce certain ? practical measures to enforce the ambush marketing prohibitions - ? for example , exclusion zones were set up around stadiums and on roads leading to stadiums , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas. ? Whether or not this will occur with Afcon 2013 remains to be seen . What is clear , however , is that businesses will have to be very careful before trying anything that might be construed as ambush marketing .

" <p> She confirmed that there was an increasing trend in shark attacks but said this was not unique to Cape Town or South Africa , and that the same trend had been found in California , Florida and Australia . <p> The only strong correlation was the rapid human population growth in all these areas which meant there were more people in the sea and for much longer periods -- like surfers , who also spent much of their time behind the back line of waves . <p> Between 1960 and 2012 , there were 29 shark " incidents " in Cape Town waters -- these included bites on surfskis -- of which six had been fatal . This equated to 0.55 attacks a year , with 0.11 annual fatalities during this period , Kock said . <p> There was a lot of generalised information about attacks but all shark species had been lumped together in this and the science was not strong .

" Do n't go swimming at Strandfontein behind the breakers .

With Old Mutual 's support , the evolution and enhancement will happen much faster , " says the CEO . <p> Things have n't been all that peachy for the sexy cash management tool , as one of its original funders Hasso Plattner Ventures Africa pulled out during its Series B funding stage due to non-performance . <p> " When you have a bunch of funders there is a likelihood that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

While that drama has died down , the company will hope that its alliance with Old Mutual , which is a trusted name in finance , will help calm the waters . <p> According to Davel , " the wave died down the minute Nedbank launched their own product My Financial Life .

We do it as a duty because we have to . And every single man we sleep with takes a piece of our souls . And when you see a prostitute , just remember that she could be your daughter , your sister , your mother . She could be your niece or granddaughter . If a customer who buys girls could realise how damaging it is to a woman and to her body , he might not do it any more .

We hook ladies from prostitution , bring them through a healing process through deliverance , get them the counselling they need , the real emotional and physical help they need . " <p> Lobert 's Durban visit came about after she met Pam de Menezes and Christie Desfontaine , members of popular band The Arrows . <p> " I took them on an outreach through the Las Vegas strip , where everyone gambles and there are girls selling their bodies .

" <p> Although Lobert did n't get a chance to see the local sex trade up close , she is hoping to come back soon and spend more time interacting with local women on the streets . " I love this country . I 've only been here a couple of days . I see the people who live here , I 've tasted the food . I 'd love to come over a little longer . I really feel there 's a deep hurt in South Africa that only God can heal . " <p> Having been to " hell " and back , Lobert now wants to use her own life story to win over other lost souls . <p> " It comes to a point where you 're so tired of being sick and tired , where you ca n't move a muscle out of bed . I started overdosing cocaine . I basically hit the wall . But I just could n't sell my body any more . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed and live any more . <p> " And I knew that if I 'd continued I would be killing myself , because it hurt so much . It 's being at the very bottom in darkness .

" <p> Hookers for Life has had numerous success stories . <p> Seeing a woman quit prostitution and understand " how much God loves her " gives her the most satisfaction . <p> " In Las Vegas there 've been so many women that have come and gone through our ministry .

The other reason they have given us , by the way , is to be protected against unfair discipline . Only 3% of our members have said that they join our unions mainly because of benefits . <p> The second reason that we have to deliver on wages and working conditions is that this is the best way to build workers ' power to transform our industries and society as a whole . This is our interpretation of decent work agenda . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NUM General Secretary , comrade Frans Baleni .

You have set an excellent precedent for all is us once more in that in future , and now , we must consider doing the same . The first target must be that man called Loane Sharp of Adcorp who , week in and week , out attacks the working class with his ideology of a quarter loaf is better than none . Yet he will never agree to earn R278 a week . <p> If we ca n't stand together in our individual unions and in the Federation as a whole to demand - and win - significant improvements for our members , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other social demands . <p> 2012 was an extremely tough year for all of us in the working class . We bore the brunt of a society and economy under extreme strain , in the context of a global capitalist crisis . Capitalist crises always produce bosses who scramble to restore their profitability at the expense of workers . No wonder we are now fed donkeys , giraffe and buffalo . Some people obviously have no problem in eating cats and monkeys . We however object if these are labelled as beef . Minister Rob Davies must get to the bottom of this . The greedy capitalists behind this scam must face the full might of the law ! <p> We have analysed our situation over and over again . Going forward let 's leave endless analysis to the philosophers . Our task as revolutionary COSATU is to embark on a campaign that is capable of uniting all workers irrespective of their narrow differences and combine their strength with marginalised communities to change our situation . We have to learn from our mistakes , identifying our weaknesses , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with workers , members or not . <p> There are some critical challenges that the Federation faces in organising , collective bargaining and servicing which I would like to highlight . These are shared challenges faced by all of our affiliates , and it is hoped that SACTWU will also give active input into the COSATU Organising , Collective Bargaining and Minimum Wage Conference which is taking place in ten days time . <p> Let me spell out some of the challenges : - <p> The first challenge is trade union membership and density <p> While the Federation has grown enormously over the years to reach 2.2 million members , we are still a long way off our 2015 target of 4 million members . South Africa has a trade union density rate of 30% . That means two out of every three workers are not organised ! We have a huge task ahead as a Federation , especially amongst the most vulnerable and exploited workers . <p> Despite the enormous challenges that SACTWU has faced in the past decade , with your sectors shrinking as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain your membership at 85,000 between 2009 and 2012 . This is presumably because you have devised an innovative programme of employing " growth organisers " . But there are still thousands of workers eligible for SACTWU membership who are either not unionised , or are in other unions . In particular you have the challenge of organising the thousands of workers who are now outsourced home-based workers . So SACTWU can not relax ! Above this , SACTWU must vigorously pursue a merger with SACCAWU . This is the decision of both unions which has been allowed to fizzle out . <p> The Federation needs SACTWU to help recruit workers into other affiliates . Without strength in numbers across all sectors we are not going to succeed in our task of improving wages and working conditions . Your union has already led the way and thrown a challenge to the rest of the affiliates of COSATU in making a very generous pledge to FAWU of R1 million towards organising farm workers . <p> The second challenge is service to our members <p> Our members have told us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for joining a COSATU union was for protection against dismissal and unfair discipline ( 38% of our members ) , followed by improving wages , benefits and working conditions ( 33% of our members ) . The remaining 29% of members told us that they joined the union to change society ( 9% ) , or because of peer pressure or a closed shop ( 5% ) or because of union benefits ( 3% ) . <p> The Survey results for SACTWU are interesting - 28% said protection against dismissal was the most important reason for joining the union , and 31% said improved wages and conditions was tops . This is a slight reversal of the overall picture within COSATU , where protection from dismissal comes up highest . The percentage saying benefits was the most important reason for belonging to the union was 11% in SACTWU - much higher than for any other union . <p> Even if there is a slight variation between the SACTWU picture and the overall COSATU picture , the statistics still tell us clearly that we have to put our efforts first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage bargaining . And yet the statistics we have from the CCMA show us that only 46% of cases referred by COSATU affiliates to arbitration were won in favour of workers . It would be interesting to know what the case statistics for SACTWU members who fall under bargaining councils are . <p> Our members have indicated that they are reasonably happy with the way in which unions are taking up disciplinary cases , health and safety issues , retrenchments , racism , discrimination against women , and supporting people living with HIV and AIDS . <p> But our members are not satisfied with the outcomes of wage negotiations . Only 40% are satisfied across COSATU and 41% in SACTWU . Workers are also not very satisfied with our achievements in skills development ( only 51% satisfied ) , or our support for temporary and casual workers ( 50% satisfied ) , or with our fight for better child care ( 48% ) . And they 've given us the real thumbs down on how we are taking up public transport ( 31% satisfied ) . What our members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks in all areas of service . <p> The third challenge is that of trade union representation and democracy <p> We had a lot of good news from the Naledi survey of COSATU members but also some not so good news . On the one hand it was encouraging that almost three quarters of members felt they could influence their shop stewards to act on their behalf . But only 33% felt they had a lot of influence . In the case of SACTWU , 35% said they have a lot of influence over shop stewards . <p> This means that many members feel disempowered . It is this disempowerment , combined with dissatisfaction with service , that creates conditions for worker to follow opportunistic individuals . We have so much work to do to reverse the tide of tiny powerless unions springing up all over the place . There are presently 193 registered unions in South Africa , with multiple unions mostly in the sectors that are the least organised . <p> So we have to step up our shop stewards ' and membership education programmes . SACTWU has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another to a phenomenal 117,000 members . No other COSATU affiliate comes anywhere close to this really remarkable figure . But if the reporting was accurate , SACTWU has n't targeted shop stewards for training . <p> Another worrying indicator is that 35% of our members have told us that there has not been a shop stewards election in their workplace in the past four years . The SACTWU figure is roughly the same at 36% . <p> Perhaps the most serious indicator of a problem in systems of representation and democracy is that one third of our members have told us that they have not attended a union meeting in the past year . SACTWU members I 'm afraid paint the worst picture amongst affiliates , with 60% reporting that they have n't attended a meeting in the past year . We should be having general meetings in all work places at least once a month . <p> The general meeting lies at the heart of our mandating and report-back processes . These general meetings should not just take place during wage negotiations - they should take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill an agenda - whether its developments in skills , collective grievances , health and safety , or whatever . In big workplaces , it is a good idea to break the regular general meetings into smaller sectional meetings , giving workers the opportunity to air their views . General meetings should never be a one way street of reporting by shop stewards . <p> Our next challenge is corruption <p> Before addressing this challenge I must tell you I am not disturbed by the faceless and spineless people who , under the cover of being media sources , are running a media campaign that suggests that the recent CEC decided that I should be investigated for financial impropriety . They allege that I or my family benefited in the sale and the purchase of the COSATU buildings . I have issued a challenge to these forces of darkness whose agenda is so blatant , that they must bring forward to COSATU or the police or CorruptionWatch evidence to back up these allegations . <p> I have offered that should there be such evidence I will immediately resign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't produce this evidence then they must accept that I was elected at the congress by workers and that this must be accepted as a reality . <p> I know the real reason why these faceless individuals are attempting to tarnish my image in the newspapers and through whispering campaigns . All of them have a reason to hate me so intensively all of a sudden . The interest of the sources peddling lies is that we must all look the same and that all must say a stone is bread and bread is cheese . I would rather leave a life of a street beggar than to lose my integrity and in the process condemn workers into a deep dark hole . <p> Corruption in our ranks is something that we do n't really want to talk about . But our members have spoken through the Naledi survey , and we have an obligation to tackle it . " Corruption " for our members can mean many things , from selling out to management without any financial exchange , through to the abuse of union funds , creating privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is of huge concern that one third of our members across all affiliates allege that there is corruption in their union , and 12% say they have actually personally seen it . The figures for SACTWU are roughly the same , with 11% saying they have seen it , and 31% saying they believe it exists . <p> Now whether or not this statistic is a reflection of reality is not the point . If such high numbers of members think that there is corruption , then we must be worried about trust . And we must leave no stone unturned to find out the truth in every instance where an allegation is made . We can not be calling on government to take action against corruption and then sweep it under the carpet in our own house . <p> We must accept that where trust is low , relationships in the organisation , and the organisation itself , becomes unstable . Transparency in all matters of money in our affiliates is a must . <p> But getting back to the agenda of the day , that is collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to tackle , partly through our collective bargaining strategies . <p> On low pay and minimum wages <p> The spotlight has been on low pay in the past year like no time before . <p> You know about low pay in your own sectors and have been talking in your Commissions about strategies to reverse this . But I want to direct your attention to low pay in other sectors too . <p> While the minimum rate for farm workers has now been raised by 52% to R11.66 per hour ( or R525 a week or R2274.82 a month ) this is still way below a Living Wage . Independent research conducted by the University of Stellenbosch for the parties in the farm worker negotiations has shown that for a family of 4 ( 2 adults and 2 children ) needs to spend R2307.96 a month on food if it is to have a reasonably balanced diet and a reasonable ( though still insufficient ) intake of energy . <p> Instead poor families are forced to live on a diet of maize porridge , bread , sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living costs . The research shows that even if the demand of R150 a day was met , workers would still be in poverty and unable to afford a balanced diet . <p> The recent increase in the minimum wage of farm workers brings it up to more or less the same level as the minimums for wholesale and retail workers , taxi workers , hospitality workers , security workers and contract cleaning workers . However , domestic workers have been left behind with a minimum wage of R8.95 an hour ( or R402.96 a week ) in the metros and bigger towns , and R7.65 an hour in other areas . Wages in your own sectors are of course similarly low . <p> We have to beat poverty through decent pay for all workers . Low pay is not helpful to an economy . As the research on food requirements shows , workers who are paid starvation wages do not buy . And if millions of workers have no purchasing power , then production suffers . If production suffers , then jobs are not created . <p> So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade our government that a radical shift in wage policy is needed . We have an excellent example to draw on in the form of Brazil , where radical increases in minimum wages have resulted in job creation . Of course we have to link our demand for a radical shift in minimum pay to the demand for support for local production and protection against cheap imports . SACTWU is absolutely spot-on in targeting SARS and the Department of Trade and Industry in your campaign for local jobs . <p> The issue of dramatically raising low pay is one of the key things we will be discussing at the COSATU Collective Bargaining Conference in ten days ' time . <p> We also face a huge challenge in wage gaps <p> Not only does South Africa have the title of most unequal society i.e. between the richest and poorest , which I talked about in the beginning , but we also have other serious gaps to contend with . <p> We have a gap between minimum wages set by Sectoral Determinations , and those agreed on through collectively bargaining . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , whereas for Sectoral Determinations it was R2118 . <p> In most sectors we have big gaps between the lowest paid in the bargaining unit and the highest paid in the bargaining unit <p> Our strategy of going for annual percentage increases across the board has increased these gaps , to the serious detriment of lower paid workers . It is time we consider strategies to close these gaps , including making across the board Rands demands , which are also easily understood by workers . The 11th National Congress already has told us that we should no longer demand percentages but rands and cents . <p> Finally ( for today at least ! ) we face a challenge of there being insufficient centralised bargaining <p> The number of workers covered by bargaining council agreements has been reducing . Only 2.4 million of the workforce is covered by bargaining councils , and many of these councils are not national . More workers are covered by Sectoral Determinations than by bargaining council agreements , i.e. 3.5 million workers . <p> There is also an ongoing battle with government to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sectors are mostly covered by centralised bargaining , but the fact that some sister unions , such as SACCAWU still have to battle in an environment where 96% of workers are not covered by centralised bargaining , is a challenge for the Federation as a whole . <p> We therefore need to campaign for compulsory , wall-to-wall centralised bargaining in all of our sectors . This is another issue up for discussion at the COSATU Conference in March . But of course centralisation must be accompanied by the democratic processes that I spoke of earlier . <p> To end , let me give you the details of the COSATU Organising , Collective Bargaining , and Minimum Wage Conference . The dates are 12th to 15th March and the Conference is to be held in Boksburg . There will be around 600 delegates , including some non-affiliates , representatives of our allies , labour service organisations , and international guests . Based on your membership , you will be entitled to 20 delegates , as least half of whom must be workers , and one third women . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your sectors . <p> We will be using the conference as a platform to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses in recruitment , organising , servicing , and collective bargaining . We hope to use it to begin to develop best practice in recruitment and collective bargaining , based on shared ideas and experiences , and to identify the key tasks in building a culture of solidarity across the Federation . <p> And as important as any one of the other aims , we hope that the conference will give all delegates an opportunity to participate and have their voices heard . I really look forward to having SACTWU 's input at the COSATU Conference , based in large part on your deliberations over your own two days ' Conference . We dare not fail in our obligation to meet our members ' expectations of us . <p> Comrades , I want to thank your office bearers for inviting me to this very important event . I wish you well in your remaining deliberations. @ @ @ @ @ 
@@121237 <h> A Canooze on the Berg River <p> Watkins is the author of Adventure Hikes in the Cape Peninsula and Off the Beaten Track . <p> March 3 2013 at 10:13am <p> By KAREN WATKINS <p> Cape Town - No rapids -- what a relief ! Especially for those of us who have n't paddled much . After all , the Berg River is internationally known for its murderous four-day iconic marathon . <p> We were on the final exploratory trip , paddling 30km from Hopefield to Velddrif . It was also the official opening of the five Cape West Coast Biosphere trails : the Darling Stagger , Five Bays Trail , Eve 's Trail , Wheels of Time and the Canooze . <p> Having been asked to meet some distance from the river , at the West Coast Fossil Park , we were curious to know why . After scones and introductions , guide Wendy Wentzel pointed to a map and remarked that five million years ago the Berg River took a different course from the one it travels today . Not only was the sea level 90m higher but short-necked giraffe , African bears and four-tusked elephants roamed forests and vleis here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd stepped back in time and should be in ox-wagons . Eighth-generation farmer Julian Melck welcomed us with his sister Sue , who was visiting from Cape Town . Over drinks in what used to be the bakery , now the Turn and Slip pub , she regaled us with stories of their childhood , holding a dead skaapsteker and chasing a governess down a passage , or locking another in the school room ( now one of the guest rooms ) . <p> Dinner was a regal affair , with us seated around a family heirloom in the Victorian dining room . On the menu , roast boar washed down with Niet Voorbij from Muratie , a Melck farm in Stellenbosch . <p> The next morning was masked in a veil of mist as we explored the farm and came across three lambs , umbilical cords still attached . High on a hill is the cemetery for the Melck family , who have been on the farm since 1770 . <p> The solitude was rudely broken by people arriving for the opening . We tucked into a delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brunch prepared by women from Mamre , Darling and Langebaan . <p> The send-off was wet . Have you ever tried to get into a canoe ? Nervously climbing onboard and trying not to embarrass ourselves in front of photographers and the crowd , we set off . <p> The initial stretch was narrow as we negotiated broken branches from above with others protruding through fast-flowing water . It is lined with gum trees in the process of being cleared by land-owners . Soon we heard our first fish eagle . We also saw a night heron , pied kingfishers , snake-necked cormorants , pelicans , dabchicks and a noisy family of Egyptian geese . <p> Lunch was perfectly timed , prepared by Cape Biosphere guide Morgan . Okay , so we 'd only eaten a short time before , but we 'd worked up an appetite and tucked into buffet-style local fare served from the back of a bakkie . <p> The morning paddle had been shrouded in trees but the afternoon stretch opened up to reveal a plain of wheatfields and distant hills . A highlight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doornfontein 's rambling farmhouse was another festive affair , with soup made of dried porcini mushrooms followed by lamb shank and orange crepes for dessert . Exercise , fresh air , delicious food -- it 's no wonder we slept well . <p> Fortified with another delicious breakfast , it seemed all too soon before it was time to leave . A highlight of the Canooze are the people . We had come as strangers and they embraced us into their world , making us feel like we belonged . <p> Setting off from Melkplaas lower down the river we did not paddle far before siting a goliath heron . According to specialist river operator Ant they have a 2.5m wingspan . Shading his eyes with one hand he said this changes to 1.5m when they fly into the sun ... argh ! <p> The river was wide , the water shallow in places and the riverbank lined with wild flowers ; we stopped often to regroup , chat and identify birds . <p> At the popular fishing location De Plaat we spied spoonbills , stilts and red bishops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juvenile from an unidentified bird that mock charged it . <p> Passing under a railway bridge we watched a seemingly endless iron-ore train go by on its way from Sishen to Saldhana . <p> After taking on water and deciding his body was not made for canoeing , first-time paddler Matt and his partner Denise opted to miss the final stretch . Here the river was dotted with houses and jetties as we paddled past islands inhabited by hundreds of red-knobbed coots . <p> The estuarine stretch is lined with flamingos ; some resemble musical notes on telephone wires against a thunderstorm sky . Awesome ! <p> The estuary breaks up , and entering Bokkom Laan we stopped to watch an aerial display by three pied kingfishers . <p> We reached Velddrif 's bridge , dubbed the " Portals of Agony and Ecstasy " by exhausted and elated competitors in the marathon , when the heavens opened . Thankfully a hot shower awaited us in a chalet at the Riviera Hotel , followed by seafood platters in the restaurant . <p> Wessel Rauch of Darling was impressed with the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal casual attention and professionalism . Having done much canoeing he felt like he 'd achieved something , although his back and bum were sore . <p> For Sakkie de Villiers it was the mix of hospitality and nature as well as the heritage and sense of place at Kersefontein . <p> Denise said the farms were stunning and the distances and stops just right . At times the river flowed strongly and paddling was a breeze , while on the wider stretches the wind made us work . <p> All too soon it was time to say goodbye and transfer back to Kersefontein .

Every day we are laughed at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have built world class stadiums in our nine provinces and they are nothing but white elephants and it pains me that two years down the lane we and PSL have still not found the solution . There are numerous models we could incorporate in resolving this expensive problem but we not even looking into them . I sometimes sit and wonder what kind of small- minded individuals run PSL and SAFA . <p> These people are making a mockery of this sport but still claim that they know it . There is a saying that those who can , do , and those who ca n't , teach . There is a difference in knowing how to play football having played it your whole life and knowing how to run football as a business . <p> England and Spain are far smaller than South Africa but their football leagues are very exciting mainly because those two countries have an appreciation for the skills and knowledge held by the ordinary people . It is these people who are responsible for the development of their leagues to greater heights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters . In South Africa we have Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates . <p> The only team that comes close to copying what is done in Europe is the Bloemfontein Celtics . Bloem Celtics has great following and translates to an electrifying atmosphere resulting from amazing energy even when their team is losing . This is what I suggest we do , bearing in mind that in our PSL we have 16 clubs and 16 in the Mvela Golden League : <p> 1 . Build support base around the so called ' 2010 stadiums ' : We have stadiums built for the 2010 World Cup which are not functioning like they are supposed to , take Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane , Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg , Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit , Green Point Stadium in Cape Town . We need to allocate these stadiums as home bases to our clubs so that the clubs are able to build home base support on those cities where the stadiums are . Yes there are stadiums in cities where there is no football team but to get this right and effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those cities so as to take advantage of this project . These stadiums will not necessarily give first preference to the teams already in the PSL , they will be allocated fairly and also based on which team is willing to move to make use of the stadiums . <p> FC Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia laying in the Russian Premier League has its homebase stadium , Dynamo Stadium in Makhachkala while the players are all based in Moscow , training in Moscow which is a 1000 miles away from Makhachkala due to armed conflict in Makhachkala and also because they want to take advantage of the civilisation there . <p> It is also amazing to learn about the culture of football in London , in Madrid and in Barcelona . London as just one city has fourteen professional football teams ; each has its own stadium where they play their home-based matches . Out of that fourteen teams , six of them ( Chelsea , T. Spurs , Arsenal , Westham United , QPR and Fulham ) playing in the EPL which is top flight and viewed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every time there is a football match in those stadiums ; they are always packed with people . Each of these clubs have the diehard following which is not compromised like we are here in South Africa where we are either supporting Orlando Pirates or Kaizer Chiefs and when none of these two are playing we sit and think which one should we support in a match but we will not be wearing the jersey of that team . There could be matches in all of them in one day ( obviously not at the same time ) but they will all be packed to capacity . Bearing in mind that these stadiums all carry more than 20 000 people , they manage to fulfil that . Why can we not do that in South Africa ? <p> 2 . Have meaningful home games which reflecting the true meaning of what we call the home ground advantage : Every time I watch the PSL games I feel frustrated and drained because our games are always a joke and I mean this literally because I strongly believe that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make sense to me to have Kaizer Chiefs playing against the Maritzburg United in Port Elizabeth at the Nelson Mandela Stadium in an ordinary PSL fixture . None of these two teams are from Port Elizabeth . If Port Elizabeth does not have a team in the PSL , why should the Football suffer ? They should find their own team to represent their people , their culture and then we will have these meaningful games . This is already happening in rugby , why can it not happen in football ? And yet PSL is hoping that the stadiums will be packed to the rafters . That is a pipe dream ! It will never happen even if the game was a decider for a title . Kaizer Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates is just about the only game that gets SA standing and having it here in Johannesburg all the time makes great sense as it will also bring sense to business around as people would be travelling to Johannesburg to see this game . We can not move it around not unless it is a cup final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Community Shield or how they do in Spain when it is the Copa del Rey . PSL can not continue running our football with emotions rather than with business acumen and having it making business sense . In this way a lot of companies will want a part of this by seeking to advertise , sponsor or offer more competitions and more money which will enhance our football to a respectful level like it is done internationally . <p> 3 . Do away with the blanket approach in selling tickets and sell season tickets to ignite excitement : When we have meaningful home games , the supporters will see sense in buying season tickets for the PSL fixtures . Businesses will buy tickets as entertainment for their partners and clients . Schools , organizations and others will take advantage commentary surrounding the game which adds to the hype , excitement and momentum about the coming games which will be reported by the media . That will help our football . There are many ways of selling tickets which will generate real income ; we can not sell all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer security to people going to watch the games . Even SAA or 1Time or any other airlines do not sell the tickets at the same price . You could be sitting on the same seat next to a person who paid less than you paid for the same flight and that is how business works and adds to the exclusivity of having a ticket before anyone else . Our match tickets in the PSL are never commodities , we need to change that . <p> Having said this little , our football would grow and reach amazing heights and our matches will bring back the excitement we saw in years past .

@@133232 <p> Israel 's cloistered but politically powerful ultra-Orthodox community has for decades maintained a separate education system , where boys and girls study holy texts and secular studies take a distant back seat . <h> Related Links <p> London - Echoing with joyful song and with a congregation bent on leading better lives , this London church is like any other - except there 's no mention of God . <p> Britain 's atheist church is barely three months old but it already has more " worshippers " than can fit into its services , while more than 200 non-believers worldwide have contacted organisers to ask how they can set up their own branch . <p> Officially named The Sunday Assembly , the church was the brainchild of Pippa Evans and Sanderson Jones , two comedians who suspected there might be an appetite for atheist gatherings that borrowed a few aspects of religious worship . <p> Held in an airy , ramshackle former church in north London , their quirky monthly meetings combine music , speeches and moral pondering with large doses of humour . <p> " There 's so much about Church that has nothing to do with God - it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " said Jones , a gregarious 32-year-old with a bushy beard and a laugh like a thunderclap . <p> The Sunday Assembly 's central tenets are to " help often , live better and wonder more " - themes that would not be out of keeping with the teachings of any major world religion . <p> At last Sunday 's service , which had a volunteering theme , songs included " Help " by the Beatles and " Holding Out For A Hero " by Bonnie Tyler . <p> The " sermon " was given by the founder of an education charity , while in a section called Pippa Is Trying Her Best , Evans had the congregation in stitches as she reported on her attempts at voluntary work . <p> The service ended with big cheers and - this is Britain , after all - shouts of " Who would like a cup of tea ?

" I think people really want somewhere they can go and meet other people , which does n't involve drinking and which you do n't have to pay to get into .

" The only thing is , they 've said they 'll have to think about what to do if it gets bigger , " Evans laughed . <p> The assembly met the approval of local vicar Dave Tomlinson , who came from his church two miles away to see what his new rivals were up to . <p> " Being here , I felt there was as much of what I call ' God ' as there was in my own church this morning , " he said . " Everything we 've said here would be completely at home in my church . I hope it grows and sustains .

@@133237 <p> Sports brands have been doing a good job of making personal fitness hip in recent years while at the same time encouraging people to record and broadcast their activity using a range of performance metrics and gadgets . <p> The Nike+ SportWatch GPS is the perfect embodiment of this trend . Unfortunately , it 's better on the drawing board than it is on the track or road . <p> Launched in 2011 , the Nike+ SportWatch GPS has gone through a number of iterations that have seen new colours introduced and firmware updates that have added functionality like support for Nike 's mysterious metric it calls NikeFuel points , and the ability calculate and display average pace . <p> Whether it 's because we 've bought into the hype , or because we 're attempting to keep the ageing process at bay , members of the TechCentral team have been running a great deal in the past year and , like many enthusiastic amateurs , we 've been using our smartphones to track our outings and analyse our progress over time . It 's little wonder , then , that we leapt at the chance to try Nike 's GPS watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to measure time and distance while calculating both instantaneous and average pace , and an LCD display , the SportWatch is essentially a wrist-sized , massively crippled mobile phone . <p> Sure , there are plenty of other sports watches on the market that offer the same sorts of features and add others -- such as the ability to measure and record your heart rate -- but for the budding running enthusiast it 's going to mean replacing a smartphone and accompanying running application . <p> We 've been using the Nike+ Running smartphone application for months , and its online interface is the same one that the SmartWatch uses to store and compare information for each outing . <p> The Web interface is excellent , showing you everything from replays of your recorded runs and the various milestones you 've reached to tabling your progress over time and showing you how well you measure up against your friends . <p> Getting the SportWatch 's data into the Nike+ database requires plugging it in to the USB port on a computer and using a piece of proprietary software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same piece of software allows you to adjust settings such as whether the display is black text on a white background or the reverse and to turn off the infuriating default beeping that otherwise accompanies every press of a button . It also allows you to pick which measurement you 'd like featured on the watch face while you 're running . <p> The software and the degree to which the SmartWatch can be customised are underwhelming . Nike could easily have offered half a dozen clock faces or even simply a selection of typefaces for the two line digital display it 's settled on for displaying the time . Instead , there 's just one typeface and just one layout . <p> Also , it should be possible to change which metric gets prominence on the display without having to tether it to a computer . <p> Nike+ SmartWatch GPS shoe sensor <p> The Nike SportWatch GPS charges and connects to a computer via USB <p> We reviewed the white version of the SmartWatch -- arguably the least practical colour for a device you 're likely to wear daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its size and weight . The SportWatch is a centimetre thick and , at 66g , it feels heavy for a wristwatch . <p> We 'd also have liked the device to measure heart rate , either through the wearer 's wrist or using an included sensor . Instead , in order to measure your heart rate you 'll need to invest in a Polar Wearlink+ Heart Rate Transmitter . <p> Still , Nike does get some credit for including a sensor that can be placed in a shoe for instances where GPS coverage might be poor or when using a treadmill . The sensor is designed to fit in a slot beneath the insole of specific Nike shoes , but we found tucking it in the top of a sock equally effective . <p> Tapping the SportWatch 's display activates the backlight , and there are three buttons on the left-hand side to toggle between the various display options and settings . The top two allow you to navigate up and down through the menus , while the third , silver button is used for making selections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end a run . <p> Perhaps our biggest gripe about the SportWatch is that the time it takes to secure a GPS signal varies enormously . The first time we used the device , it took more than three minutes to get a GPS lock ; the second time took just 10 seconds , and the third attempt took about a minute . <p> The average person who runs no more than eight hours a week should have to charge the SportWatch only once a week . This is done using the USB connection that forms part of the clip at the end of the wrist strap . <p> Overall , it 's tough to recommend the SportWatch over a smartphone that has the Nike+ application or an equivalent like RunKeeper , especially as a smartphone also allows you to listen to music and , in our experience , is no less accurate in its measurements . <p> The only obvious benefit of the SportWatch is that it allows its wearer to see information at a glance , something that 's more difficult with a smartphone in a pocket or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike most smartphones . <p> With a recommended retail price of R1 899 , the SportWatch becomes an even more difficult proposition : for the same price , you could buy a capable heart-rate monitor , an armband for a smartphone , and a number of post-run breakfasts . <p> Nike is to be commended for its efforts with the SmartWatch , but until the company can make the device slimmer , include functionality a phone ca n't replicate , and latch onto GPS signal sooner , we 're going to stick to our smartphone apps . -- ( c ) 2013 NewsCentral Media <h> Why TechCentral ? <p> We know that as a prospective advertiser , you are spoilt for choice .

@@140230 <p> With the launch of Ka-band satellites the debate of C versus Ku-band versus Ka-band has come to the fore , with varying opinions of the advantages of each technology against that of another . These considerations are valid and , in terms of a pure technology debate , very critical to consider . <p> Dawie de Wet , CEO , Q-KON <p> However , more importantly , to some extent , is the relative business aspects of these technologies . Whereas the technology debate is focused more on the translation of satellite bandwidth measured in MHz to data throughput measured in Mbps , the business debate extends the domain from MHz all the way to profit &amp; loss . <p> In order to have a quantified discussion of the advantages of C vs Ku vs Ka-band it is necessary to model and capture the specific relationship that translates MHz to profit &amp; loss . <p> Modeling this relationship requires that all business and technical parameters are included such as market demand predictions , price elasticity , satellite link budget engineering , operational cost models and equipment price influences . <p> Such a business model that integrates the market , technology and business domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the optimum intersection point of these three domains .

Ku-band will add advantage within environments that require high volume communications and extra bandwidth , whilst Ka-band is competitive in smaller , less intensive environments . <p> Service Providers and end users should take care to consider and review technologies in perspective to the business model and not purely based on the technology perceptions .

The key to the success of this operation lies in the nature of the deposit , says George Fennemore , Barrick 's Manager of Corporate Social Responsibility and regional permitting specialist for the company . Like most Nevada mines , Cortez contains large deposits of ' invisible ' gold , where the ore holds microscopic particles rather than veins or nuggets of gold . But to understand the present day deposit it is necessary to look at its history . <p> Mining in the Cortez district began in 1862 , says Fennemore .

" The process is simplified when you do n't have to deal with those refractory elements which interfere with gold production , " says Fennemore . In his opinion these studies helped to grow the industry significantly through the final two decades of the last century , particularly in the Nevada goldfields .

The cyanide heap leaching process we use was developed here at Cortez and was found to be very effective in removing microscopic gold even from low grade ore deposits , especially deposits that were oxidized -- ores that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " The Cortez deposits tend to be low in sulfide and carbon deposits and very conducive to heap leaching . <p> Not all the gold in the Cortez district is held in these oxidized deposits , but a significant proportion of it is , and there is much more of it than was ever suspected when the nearby Pipeline deposit was being mined in the 1990s using truck and shovel methods . " We have continued to look for these large scale oxidized deposits , " he explains . " They are well suited for the mining fleet and for the processing that was already available on site . By going back into productive districts and drilling a bit deeper we were able to locate the Pediment deposit back in 1999 . Further drilling revealed the adjacent and larger Cortez Hills deposit . That was when we finally understood that there was a large gold deposit at depth . " A minority of the gold at Cortez Hills is indeed found in refractory rock . This is transported 75 miles to the company 's specialized mills at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem an expensive option , but it makes sense when one considers that construction of a new refractory mill would cost upward of a billion dollars . <p> Barrick took six years to complete its drilling program and establish a deposit in the region of 9 million ounces coming in at a very satisfactory grade , with some areas exceeding one once per ton of ore . The permitting process began in 2005 with applications to both federal and state agencies , and the operating permit was finally received in November 2008 . <p> The entire process was complicated by the fact that the area became the focal point for a Native American rights organization 's struggle over land that is now managed by the US federal government . Besides gold , the area was also rich in historical and cultural resources . While Cortez Hills contained no Native American settlements as such , it was located on traditional migration routes . Artifacts were found in their thousands , dating back thousands of years . " We executed one of the largest archaeological programs that had ever been done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the archaeology and history through that area . " Over eight months the site was populated by archaeologists armed with trowels and going inch by inch across the area of the proposed mine . In all , nearly 400,000 artifacts were recovered , many from historic mining in the area . Cataloguing these items was a massive task for the Nevada State Museum which continues to stabilize , curate , and preserve them for posterity . <p> There 's never a mining development where there are not some objections from community , environmental and commercial interests , and Cortez Hills was no exception . Barrick 's legal success over objections gave no particular cause for satisfaction and George Fennemore in fact sees the dialogue as a prime way to engage legitimate concerns and hopefully allay them . " Because we utilize public land for our mining , this gives the opportunity for any interested party to comment . Anyway the dialogue is not just about our mining operation but in general how the government handles resources . " This is a particularly big issue in Nevada where 90 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest mining operation on federal land in the USA and the main permitting process handled through the US Bureau of Land Management is bound to attract considerable public comment . That may not always be comfortable but it does provide a forum . In the end , local interests should receive primary consideration in view of the undeniable economic boost the project and all its associated activity generates . <p> By midsummer of 2009 construction was in full swing , using a 78-cubic-yard P&amp;H 4100 , multiple 57 cubic-yard P&amp;H 2800 shovels and a fleet of 27 400 tonne Liebherr haul trucks . Though it took till the end of that year before the ore body was uncovered and gold recovery could commence . This was a fast track project . It took just under a year to get from virgin ground to the ore body , says Fennemore . " We process the ore from both the open pit and the underground mine below it at our existing facilities which are about nine miles away from the pit itself , so we opted to build the longest conveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The conveyor designed and supplied by ThyssenKrupp Robins can transfer 1,000 tons per hour from the Cortez Hills to the existing heap leach facility -- it includes a belt feeder and five conveyors . A 90 foot long variable speed belt feeder transfers primary crushed ore to the first of the 5 conveyors . The most complex conveyor of the system is the seven mile long regenerative overland conveyor that runs at 900 feet per minute with a 2 mile long downhill section with a descent of 900 feet . A unique control system was developed to achieve the right belt tension between the drives . The conveyor can now transport ore from both the open pit and the underground mine which was constructed over the same period . The underground ore body is reached via twin declines at six degrees gradient , and the underground mine has been designed so that its highest levels will eventually coincide with the bottom of the open pit . <p> Having established that all possible work had been done to preserve the archaeology on the site it was also important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would benefit from the work being done . The area was covered with a young second growth forest , Fennemore says , and when the time came for these trees to be removed the Shoshone people were consulted and the timber made available to indigenous communities for firewood and other uses . <p> It is important to get interventions of this sort right , George Fennemore believes . " It is easy for a big corporation to overwhelm a small community so we work very diligently to pay attention to the land users , other water users , and employers -- for example when we harvest trees we are careful to work with local woodcutters and not wipe out their business by dumping a load of firewood onto the market .

@@140236 <p> Brian Chesky does n't have a home . He has spent the last three years sleeping on strangers ' couches , in spare rooms and in vacant holiday homes . <p> In 2010 Chesky decided that the best way to improve Airbnb 's service was a tried and trusted method called " eating your own dogfood " - in other words using your own product as often as possible . And so , since then , he has been relying on Airbnb to find places in which to sleep . <p> Airbnb sounds like a crazy idea when you first hear about it : a service that lets you rent out spare beds or spare rooms in your own home to complete strangers who find you on the internet . And indeed it was a very hard sell . Speaking at this year 's South By South West Interactive ( SXSWi ) conference , Chesky described Airbnb 's slow and often bumpy genesis . <p> " We actually launched three times , " he said , " no one noticed the first two times , so we launched again . " At the first launch , at the SXSWi in 2008 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Chesky himself . <p> Things have clearly changed for the company since then . More than half of the hundreds of audience members put up their hands to indicate they 're using the service for their current visit to Austin , Texas , where SXSWi takes place . <p> For Chesky this success is about more than just a good business model - it 's about a fundamental change in the nature of the underlying economy . " We 're part of the era of the sharing economy -- which is what comes after the era of mass production , " he explains . <p> This idea crystalised for Chesky when he described Airbnb to his grandfather , who replied " Of course ! " Chesky suddenly realised that his business model was actually a very old one , that predated the era of the mass travel industry and hotel chains . If you wanted to travel to another city 70 years ago , it was perfectly natural to arrange to stay with a local family or in a boarding house . <p> Today Airbnb has hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for several years Chesky and his partners were struggling to feed themselves . He recalls how , during the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver , Colorado , the team made up novelty cereal boxes called " Obama Os " and sold them for $40 each as mementos , generating $30 000 in much needed funding for the company . <p> Chesky calls this his " low point " and jokes that " at no point in the Facebook story was Mark Zuckerberg hot gluing hundreds of cereal boxes in his apartment . " But the stunt is also what won them funding from Paul Graham , a respected venture capitalist . Graham was n't buying their pitch until Chesky 's co-founder showed him the Obama O 's box . <p> When he saw the box and heard the story he was impressed . " You guys wo n't die , you 're like cockroaches , " and so Graham accepted Airbnb into his Y Combinator seed funding programme . But shortly after they joined the programme , Graham gave them some advice - leave California and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princely 100 customers . <p> Graham told them : " It 's better to focus on the 100 people who love you , instead of one million who kind of like you . " And so the team moved to New York and went from door to door visiting each of their customers and taking photos of their apartments . <p> This process taught the founders a huge amount about how they needed to adapt their model , and how best to serve both hosts and renters . By 2010 Chesky took it a step further - he decided to live exclusively in spaces rented via Airbnb . And he has been doing so ever since : " Right now I am essentially homeless " he says , grinning broadly . <p> As far as Chesky is concerned , Airbnb is n't selling places to sleep so much as memories . " We are in the business of meaningful experiences . I remember every family holiday I had as a child . " This was confirmed when a customer told him " Brian , AirBnB makes my life seem longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the same experience himself when he visited Paris in 2010 . The experience of staying in a real person 's home was so memorable compared to a bland , anonymous hotel room . This ethos of shared resource use is driving what Chesky calls the sharing economy or the " physical manifestation of the internet " . <p> He elaborates : " If you think that mass production is going to change , then you realise the sharing economy can replace it . " And indeed the idea of shared use of everything from cars ( ZipCar ) to private jets ( NetJets ) is creating new businesses around the world . <p> Whether or not you believe that Chesky 's vision of the future of the economy or not , it 's impossible not to get caught up in his idealism and enthusiasm . " If you build a company that employs love , then the customers will feel that love , and so will the investors . " @ @

The precedent-setting FDA registration is also the ultimate goal for HG&amp;H Pharmaceuticals . Like Zembrin ? , Crofelemer ( trade name Fulyzaq ) is a poly-molecular botanical medicine , but developed from the latex of an Amazonian tree . Crofelemer was approved in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hard science <p> The Research and Development team 's excitement over Zembrin ? is anything but hype .

Two earlier randomized , double-blind studies with groups of healthy adults , one in Cape Town and the other in Canada , show Zembrin ? to be safe and well-tolerated . The first study , purely a safety study , reported unsolicited positive effects on wellbeing , including improved coping with stress and enhanced sleep in subjects taking once-daily doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented at the World Psychiatric Association Congress in Prague in 2012 , concluded that Zembrin ? significantly improved cognitive flexibility and executive function , suggesting that the extract may also have therapeutic potential in cognitive ageing . <p> The Canadian clinical investigators believe that Zembrin ? should be studied as a treatment for neurodegenerative disorders , including Alzheimer 's disease . <p> Elev8 tablets containing 25mg Zembrin ? were approved for sale as complementary medicine by the South African Medicines Control Council ( MCC ) and have been available through most pharmacies since September 2012 . <p> In March 2013 , Zembrin ? was recognised as the ' most sustainable ingredient ' at the prestigious annual Natural Products Expo West held in Anaheim , USA . Zembrin was noted as one of the leading ingredients pioneering the next great foundation of new product development . <p> Self-care <p> South African medical practitioner , botanist and ethnopharmacologist Dr Nigel Gericke together with Deon Hofmeyr , a horticulturalist and entrepreneur , with backing from H.L.

There was a brief mention of an obscure South African plant called Sceletium without much known about its effect -- which he found intriguing , and determined to investigate on his return home . <p> Gericke and a small group of friends consisting of ethnobotanists , doctors and psychiatrists then experimented with various doses of the plant .

@@152238 <p> In the autumn of 2004 a young woman came to my office , clearly very distraught . I recognised Gloria* from a session with struggling students earlier that week . The session focused on preparing students for their mid-year exams . <p> Stakes were high , because students who failed the exam would enter a year-long academic support programme . Up to this point Gloria had been failing all her assessments and only a miracle would pull her through . <p> She walked up to my desk and put a photo of herself in front of me . Taken at a cultural ceremony , it showed a radiant young woman in traditional wear looking almost defiantly at the camera . " This is me , " Gloria whispered . <p> I realised she was trying to convey to me that the person in front of me was not the person in the photograph . She felt alienated and she did not know the way forward . <p> Gloria was the top performer of her region , and when she left her rural home to study medicine at the University of Cape Town , her community rallied behind her . She received weekly phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dreams on her . <p> When she failed the first assessment , she tried even harder , locking herself in her room to study . Regardless of her efforts , she failed again . At this stage Gloria did not want to communicate with people from home any more . She felt ashamed , helpless and scared . Most of all , she felt very alone . <p> There are many similarities between Gloria 's story and the one Nomusa Mthethwa related recently in the Mail &amp; Guardian of her failure at university despite coming from an excellent schooling background and a supportive home environment ( " How could I have failed varsity ? " , January 11 ) . <p> Unlike the picture painted in that story , though , the faculty of health sciences at the University of Cape Town offers excellent support ? services to students . During orientation week , substantial time is spent familiarising students with campus life and introducing them to the new ways of thinking and engaging in their new disciplines . <p> Each first-year student is assigned a mentor . Material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychological support is made available during the course of the first semester and there is an early-detection system in place to offer struggling students academic support . <p> Lecturers meet students on a regular basis to advise them on ways to improve their marks . Students who are unsuccessful in their first semester are placed in a specialised academic development programme , one that has produced excellent results , and the faculty has a very high graduation rate . <p> Nevertheless , the question remains : Why do seemingly well-prepared , top-performing students sometimes fail their first year , despite their good marks ? The common-sense answer is that the rote-learning , mimicking practices of their schooling have not prepared them . <p> Although this is true , and outcomes-based education has not changed these practices , the answers are often more complex , and hidden , particularly for working-class and rural students . Recent research my colleague Professor Rochelle Kapp and I conducted at the University of Cape Town showed that first-generation students in particular have to negotiate significant academic , linguistic and identity challenges when they enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities the institution is offering them . They are confident about their potential to succeed and they position themselves accordingly . <p> Some , however , discover within the first few weeks that they can not easily decode and decipher their new context , both because of the linguistic challenges of working in their second language and because they have to negotiate values , attitudes and beliefs substantially different from their home discourses . <p> Many of these challenges are posed by the curriculum . Although classroom practice is based on small group discussions and engagement , students are often silenced by the speed and fluency of the exchange and by their own lack of confidence . Many are also shocked by practices within the institutional culture . They start to feel " different " from the rest of their peers and yet , based on results from the study , do not want to be treated differently , such as by being assigned to less diverse groups during learning activities . <p> As one student remarked : " We got exposed to a new environment where we can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through it . " <p> Realising their underpreparedness , students tend to become withdrawn , simply mimicking the rituals associated with academic life . Rather than seeking help , many place their faith in hard work and religion -- but still they are not successful . <p> After failing the first semester , they enter the academic support programme , adding on an extra year to their studies . With that comes the devastation and embarrassment of telling friends and family . <p> Our research documents the multiple crises students negotiate at different stages in their first year . Much of this " emotion-work " is ? hidden from the institution and students speak about their transitions only afterwards , with considerable hindsight . <p> So , what is the role of a university in this regard ? Though we need robust and responsive support structures , we also need to recognise that these can reproduce dominant discourses and construct students in deficit terms . If institutions do not actively foster a sense of belonging and connectedness through transformation of classroom and institutional culture , they run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of missing out on the multilingual resources that these young people bring with them to the institution . <p> This will result in silencing a substantial number of students , and furthermore , will place significant burdens on individuals to negotiate a lonely journey that comes with considerable emotional toll on their learning . <p> * Not her real name <p> Elmi Badenhorst is the deputy convenor of the MBChB intervention programme ( see " Intervening for success " ) and a lecturer in the department of human biology , faculty of health sciences , University of Cape Town .

I 'm not big on licenced games that try cash in on people 's established love either , so I was expecting this new game based on Abrams ' rebooted Star Trek continuity to not be very good . It has exceeded my expectations ... by being far worse than I had ever anticipated . <p> It starts off well enough . The Starship Enterprise and its crew find itself embroiled in a crisis of galactic proportions when the evil , warmongering reptilian race , the Gorn , steal a ridiculously powerful device that the Vulcans had hoped might find them a new home .

They 're both pretty well rendered too , looking very much like their real-life actors .... provided they 're standing still and not moving their mouths . Their interplay and banter stands a highlight in a game that 's 10 hours of insipid , depressing lows . <p> It could have been good . The Star Trek Universe is ripe for the picking to make a game that 's not unlike Mass Effect ; a personable leader , a crew of interesting characters and one of the most famous spaceships in the history of media , it could have been a game that followed the Star Trek ethos of diplomacy with combat as a last resort .

Joining that is a bare-bones XP and upgrade system , where scanning objects grants XP that can be used on a number of pointless upgrades to combat , weaponry and mindless fiddling . <p> There 's a further attempt to deviate from the standard run-and-gun gameplay by throwing in other terribly unfun elements , like a level where you 're forced to swim to your objective . Water-based levels are seldom a good idea , but they 're worse when the engine they 're running on just is n't built for it .

@@250232 <h> South Africa <h> Is B-BBEE status carrying weight for Durban oil companies ? <p> New lease requirements may impact negatively on SA 's fuel security . <p> Kentse **25;598;TOOLONG May 2013&amp;nbsp15:40 <p> JOHANNESBURG -- Under the new lease system proposed by the Transnet National Ports Authority ( TNPA ) it seems that in future , companies requiring space on Durban Island View will have to leverage their Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment ( B-BBEE ) status to receive lease extension approval . <p> TNPA is currently in the process of reviewing the lease approval process for companies that occupy space at the Durban Island View . Island View houses the liquid bulk precinct and its tenants include oil companies such as BP , Shell and Easigas . Those which do not meet the requirements set out by TNPA would ultimately lose out on the opportunity to bid for the space . <p> Fanie Tshifularo , executive director at the South African Petroleum Industry Association ( Sapia ) confirmed that bilateral discussions were currently underway and said that an open bidding system had been proposed where companies would effectively compete for space . <p> Corporate affairs general manger at Transnet , Lunga Ngcobo , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal any details about the new lease negotiations or what the requirements would be .

" Tshifularo also added that contributions towards job creation and rural development would also be considered . <p> In 2012 , an audit of the Fuels Charter by the Department of Energy ( DoE ) looking at compliance in the petroleum and liquid fuels industry , found that the overall compliance rating was just 48% . The Liquid Fuels Charter was drafted in 2000 and sets out targets for transformation in the industry , which covers the seven major oil companies in South Africa -- PetroSA , Sasol ( JSE:SOL ) , Chevron , Total SA , BPSA , Engen and Shell . <p> The increasing demand for space <p> Tshifularo said that currently in Durban availability and demand for space are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area but now have to compete for space with new players . This is the conundrum that Transnet faces as it attempts to accommodate new players that need to import products , Tshifularo said . <p> Nonetheless , in the midst of the negotiations process , two weeks ago Total SA announced that it had extended its lease on the island for 15 years . In response to whether TotalSA was receiving special concession , Ngcobo just stated : " in 2012 after TNPA signed the contract with Total , with regard to the lease of their premises in Durban , it realised there was a need to embark on a lease clean-up process . " <p> Tshifularo said that he was baffled by how TotalSA managed to get a lease extension but added that this would not affect the discussions . <p> The major concern for Sapia is whether these new changes will disrupt the security of oil supply as these would be long term leases .

He added that in the future hopefully this would not be an issue , as Transnet was under the process of developing a new port . Island View is currently being renovated , along with the entire port ; whether or not this will create the desired space is not clear .

@@255236 <h> Future of labour relations in SA <p> Labour relations may have reached a defining moment in South Africa 's history . Many share the view that over the past few years , unprotected strike action has escalated into an uncontrolled , violent and unlawful landscape , led by a mob mentality in the absence of formal and recognised leaders . <p> A proponent of this view is Chris Jacobs , who specialises in conflict resolution at OIM , SA business performance specialists . According to Jacobs , " On the one hand , this is the result of major social frustration . Unfortunately , it is the workplace that has become the warzone , with grave consequences for employers . On the other hand , it is also a result of complacency which has set in with and between businesses and labour leaders , as well as legislation which has not adapted to the changing circumstances . " <p> Jacobs believes that in order for the SA labour relations landscape to change to one of normality , stability and order , " ... employers need to re-establish constructive relationships with all employees , not only union leaders , and manage both legislative challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is imperative that sound employee relations strategies be developed rather than short-term re-active tactics . " <h> Levels of change <p> Jacobs argues that change needs to happen at the levels of union , employee and employer . A recent Human Sciences Research Council ( HSRC ) study revealed that South Africans ' trust in trade unions dropped sharply from 43% in 2011 to 29% in 2012 . According to Jacobs , this trend is in line with developed economies . Unions face serious challenges , which include diminishing membership numbers , a disconnection from their members and unhealthy competition with each other . " This has led not only to the destabilisation of the workplace but also intimidation , injury and loss of lives . Even though this is nothing new , it now happens even more so in organisations within the same ' broad circles/domain ' , " says Jacobs . <p> " In the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) , affiliates such as NUM and NUMSA , FAWU and SACCAWU to name a few , are fighting it out for the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of one country-one federation-one industry-one union has been allowed to be trashed by affiliates . If affiliates do not even respect the policies of its mother organisation , how will they respect the policies of companies in which their members operate . The workplace has become a battleground again like in the 1980s , to the detriment of the employer . Unions need to seriously re-establish contact with their members , and take responsibility for their own actions and those of their members . " <h> Centralised or decentralised bargaining <p> According to Jacobs , centralised bargaining is another labour practise that is currently experiencing a crisis - this is a reality that needs to be faced and appropriate strategies need to be followed . <p> " Centralised bargaining was traditionally favoured by the bigger unions that were in favour of the concept of majoritarianism - the union that forms the majority has all the organisational and bargaining rights . In the process , such unions became the sole voice for all employees . This defeated the objective of workplace democracy in essence . In cases where this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to decentralised bargaining as it puts them in a position to deal with site specific issues and gives them a voice which they would not have had in a winner-takes-it-all situation of centralised bargaining , " says Jacobs . <p> Jacobs explains that site-specific bargaining is more demanding of employers , as they often have to invest the same effort into each discussion , but is more rewarding in the long term , as potential conflict situations can be avoided . " We 've often seen that in many cases a relationship is built with a union and an employer with a centralised bargaining approach , but there is no recognition of other unions playing a role in the workplace . This creates tension between employees , unions and the employer . " <h> Proactive steps towards change <p> Despite all the challenges , Jacobs is optimistic about the possibility of positive change in the current labour relations landscape , but points out that " ... the wheels turn slowly . For example , the 1995 Labour Relations Act ( LRA ) was designed for the circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been appropriate then , is largely out-dated now , especially as workplace democracy is not being upheld . This needs to be revisited . Currently we have a whole chapter in the LRA , chapter four on Workplace Forums , which is rarely applied if at all , save for two or three definitions . No workplace forums , as intended by this chapter , currently exist . " <p> Jacobs says employers and unions can not wait for legislative changes before taking action . " Companies must ensure that they have a sound Employee Relations ( ER ) and Human Resources ( HR ) strategy in place and act proactively , not reactively when conflict situations arise . This means that the current mindset of business leaders has to change ; they can no longer see ER as the ' soft side ' of the business . Last year showed that the absence or lack of a pro-active strategy can cost millions and cause the loss of lives . " <p> According to Jacobs , the first step in creating an ER strategy is to ensure a fair workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having policies , practices and procedures in place that are legally correct and suited to the company 's culture . This can include disciplinary codes and employment equity practices , and must be consistently applied to create the right climate and culture in the workplace . Furthermore , appointed leaders have to guide the way and create a climate beneficial to peace and harmony in the workplace . <p> " Staff need to understand where the company is heading in terms of vision and strategy and they must know how this translates into goals that apply to them . This includes discussing the company strategy and organisational values , analysing team goals and targets , participating in collective risk identification and problem solving , sharing and debating company information , as well as focusing on relevant strategic and learning topics . " <h> Communication and training <p> Jacobs suggests that management should actively take up the role of primary communicator . " Open and honest communication directly with the workforce , rather than relying on unions , will allow correct and consistent messages to be communicated . It will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases where staff members are dissatisfied with , or reject union leaders , and thus also their messages . For these purposes structures need to be established throughout the organisation to communicate the right messages . Moreover , leaders need to be trained to communicate effectively and to deal with issues before they get out of hand . " <p> The aim is to foster holistic business understanding among the workforce , through training on global , political and economic realities ; labour rights and responsibilities ; sector-specific developments ; new legislation ; productivity and people management . <p> " Lastly , employee relations practitioners , shop stewards and leaders in general need to be up-skilled in industrial relations and conflict resolution through interactive workshops . This will equip them to interpret trends and to identify , understand and deal with potential conflict situations before they happen , " concludes Jacobs . <p> LEGAL DISCLAIMER : This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards ( e.g. defamation , slander , or other such crimes ) .

By Craig Wilson and Duncan McLeod . <p> Telkom looks set to shut down its telex network because of lack of use and ever-shrinking revenues from the ageing service . The move is expected to affect as many as 26 employees . <p> The move comes as a long-running legal battle finally heads to the high court in Pretoria next week . Telkom is facing a multibillion-rand lawsuit , along with a lengthy series of charges laid at a range of agencies , from a disgruntled telex supplier , Phutuma Networks . <p> In August 2009 , Phutuma served a summons on Telkom for damages arising from a tender published in November 2007 for the outsourcing of telex services as well as a solution to support ocean-based shipping . <p> In its 2012 annual report , Telkom said Phutuma had accused Telkom of awarding the tender to a third party -- a London-based company called Network Telex -- without a fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed an amount of R3,7bn , raising this later to R5,5bn . <p> The matter has been postponed a number of times and is now set to be heard in the high court in Pretoria on Monday , 20 May . <p> Over the years , Phutuma has lodged several further complaints , one with the public protector , another with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa 's ( Icasa 's ) complaints and compliance committee and yet another with the competition commission . <p> According to internal Telkom documents in TechCentral 's possession , its reasons for discontinuing its telegraph services -- telex falls under this -- are that the technology has reached the end of its life , that there has been a substantial decline in the number of customers making use of it , and that the service is no longer profitable . <p> Furthermore , the documents suggest that Telkom has obtained approval from Icasa to discontinue the service .

" <p> Local interest The attempt officially kicked off at 9am on Wednesday , May 1 , for which no preparation was allowed beforehand , while many of the team 's peers were reaping the benefits of a mid-week public holiday . <p> Ten days and 12 hours later , the film was complete and Shotgun Garfunkel premiered at the Bioscope in Johannesburg 's Maboneng Precinct on 11 May . Not only was the screening well-supported -- eager watchers lined the aisles -- but second and third screenings had to be scheduled to accommodate local interest . <p> Much of this support was generated through the team 's online community , which was centered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hard work of one man in particular behind the scenes . <p> " When they first told me about this project , I knew it was going to be a game changer , " said Mike Sharman , who heads up digital communications agency Retroviral . " The sheer belief in the project and its unique selling points ensured that securing talkability in the online space was always going to be achievable . " <p> His prediction could not have been more on the money , as enthusiasm and resourcefulness characterised the public 's contribution to the project . When Team #FastestFilmSA needed anything , the response was overwhelming . <p> " During one particular scene , there were n't enough extras to participate in a busy club scene . I tweeted a call to action for extras , which was retweeted almost 100 times and resulted in the hashtag #FastestFilmSA trending nationally . Volunteer extras started arriving within minutes , and the empty set transformed into a busy bar almost instantaneously , " said Sharman . <p> ' Last-minute planning ' This kind of real-time support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filming schedule was tight . " We could n't waste a second , " said van Jaarsveldt . " The last-minute planning without any money made it tricky , but people were amazing and they really came to our aid . " <p> While timing and scheduling proved to be somewhat of a nightmare , this pressure also forced the team into a more streamlined creative process . <p> " We were not going to fail . However , the movie came out , we were going to make a movie in 11 days , " explained Barbuzano . " You do n't have time to think ' This ca n't work ' or ' I look fat in these pants . ' You just do n't have time for the static and the bullshit . " <p> Van Jaarsveldt concurred . " Actors , extras , locations , logistics -- it was all a challenge . But not being able to plan also offered up amazing , creative solutions . We were presented with challenges and we had to pool our resources to figure them out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only epitomises the #FastestFilmSA project , but also the greater South African creative community , demonstrating that while resources may be lacking , creative drive in the local arts sector is in abundance . <p> " South Africa has massive potential -- we just are n't all given the opportunity to express it , " said van Niekerk . " We have a history of storytelling , a good culture of creative work and our crews are amazing ! " <p> " It just proves what can be done when people want to do something , " said Van Jaarsveldt . " South African crews are among the best in the world . Our technical guys are just amazing and it shows the guys overseas that we can genuinely compete - even with some quirks , Shotgun Garfunkel is still a competent , entertaining film . " <p> Making movies about fun South Africa " It also shows that we do n't only have to make movies in South Africa about our history , about people who are sick , about people who are dying . There 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven and incredibly creative -- if we just had the chance to show it , " added Barbuzano . <p> According to Van Niekerk , lack of budget , opportunity and decent platforms to showcase work are the greatest stumbling blocks to South African creatives . " Our country has such a small market for the kind of work we want to make , so it 's incredibly difficult to get the necessary funding . That 's why we made a plan -- and now we have a feature film under our belts ! " <p> Van Jaarsveldt does n't mince his words when it comes to factors that are stifling creative progress , particularly in the film industry . " It always comes down to money . Time equals money . The only reason we could do this is because the guys only had to offer up four days . Six weeks to shoot a feature is a long time if you need to pay your bond and school fees . " <p> " People are also inherently greedy beings and self-enrichment is a major issue in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creating a sustainable industry rather than quick bucks , fancy cars and nice shoes . Let the money end up on the screen , not in your bank account . " <p> Although Team #FastestFilmSA have made a record-size splash purely by getting Shotgun Garfunkel from script to screening in under 11 days , this is hardly the end of the road . <p> " Once the official world record accreditation has been received , the next step is to submit the film to global festivals like Sundance , Tribeca and Cannes next year , " said Sharman . " This is where the true potential of this achievement will be realised if it punches above its weight against the world 's best indie films . "

@@277240 <h> Nissan Juke gets CVT , all-wheel drive <p> . Nissan Juke crossover now available with constantly varaible automatic transmission and all-wheel drive . <p> Nissan has added auto-transmission and all-wheel drive variants to its existing four-model fun-'n-funky Juke crossover range - but , seeing as there is nothing conventional about the Juke , it has done it differently . <p> To start with , the self-shifter does n't have any gears at all - it 's a belt-drive constantly variable transmission , while the All-Mode all-wheel drive is n't set up for bundu-bashing but for increased grip and better steering at highway speeds on , well , highways . <p> SEAMLESS ACCELERATION <p> Unlike a conventional transmission , which has a choice of different ratios , any one of which can be engaged to suit the speed of the wheels relative to the engine revs ( hence the term ' gear change ' - that is exactly what you 're doing ) a CVT transmission has a steel drive belt running between two cone-shaped pulleys facing in opposite directions . <p> If you move the belt across the faces of the pulley , one will increase in size as the other decreases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the belt at a constant tension so it does n't slip - or snap . <p> With a bit of input from the ECU and yaw sensors , the transmission can find the ideal combination of torque and revs for any circumstances and move to it without disengaging anything , so you get smooth power delivery with no ' shift shock ' and , if you can keep slippage to a minimum , the potential for impressive fuel-efficiency . <p> CVT transmission has no gears . Instead a steel drive belt runs between two cone-shaped pulleys .. <p> In the Juke , the system measures gradients and cornering loads as well , and even uses patterns of movement to figure out whether the car is in city traffic ( keep it smooth , sister ) or on a fun-to-drive winding mountain pass , where you want maximum torque every time you power out of a corner . <p> ALL-WHEEL DRIVE <p> Available only on the 1.6 DIG-T turbo model , the All-Mode 4x4i system distributes torque between the front and rear axles , up to a maximum split of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - including steering input , yaw rate , lateral acceleration and wheel speed - and also manages power between the two rear wheels via and electronic limited-slip differential so as to reduce understeer while cornering . <p> And to underline the on-road orientation of the set-up , its antics are displayed in real time with graphics on the instrument panel , just as the turbo boost gauge lets the driver know exactly what the engine is doing . <p> The new 1.6 Acenta+ CVT auto adds seamless shifting to the existing entry level model , for more relaxed driving , while the 140kW/240NM 1.6 Tekna AWD CVT auto model pairs the new transmission with all-wheel drive for extra grip and better road holding . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

This was deemed a national security incident . The Ministers of the Justice , Crime Prevention and Security ( JCPS ) Cluster instructed on 2 May 2013 that a team of Directors-General investigate the circumstances that gave rise to the incident , and report their findings within seven working days . The members of the Investigating Team , referred to in this report as " the team " , were the following : <p> 1.1.2 Ms N. Sindane : Director-General of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development . <p> 1.1.3 Mr T.S . Moyane : National Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services . <p> 1.1.4 Dr C.G. Swemmer Acting Coordinator for Intelligence ( co-opted ) . <p> 1.2 Terms of Reference <p> The Terms of Reference governing the work of the team were the following : <p> 1.2.1 Determine the sequence of events prior to , during and after the landing of the chartered commercial aircraft at Air Force Base Waterkloof . <p> 1.2.2 Assess the actual events in the light of the established legislation , regulations , government and departmental protocols . <p> 1.2.3 Interview and interact with relevant persons to establish facts , and factor in investigations currently under way . <p> 1.2.4 Make findings and recommendations to avert similar occurrences in future . <p> 1.3 Methodology <p> In conducting the investigation the team approached the incident in four phases , namely the pre-amval phase , arrival phase , post-arrival phase and exit phase , and conducted its work according to these phases . <p> The methodology adopted included the scrutiny of relevant documentary evidence ; the scrutiny of departmental submissions ; interviews with officials and individuals involved in the matter ; investigations conducted within affected departments ; and in loco visits . <p> The visits consisted of the following : <p> 1.3.1 On 9 May 2013 : to the Chief of the South African Air Force ( SAAF ) , Lieutenant-General F.Z.

The Investigating Team briefed the JCPS Ministers on the content on 17 May 2013 , which concluded the Team 's mandate . <p> 2 . CHAPTER 2 : SEQUENCE OF EVENTS <p> Based on the submissions received , the team understands the sequence of events to have unfolded as follows : <p> 2.1 Pre-Arrival Phase <p> In the pre-arrival phase , the following are the standard operating procedures that would be followed by departments in preparing for the arrival of a WIP or VIP flight at the base : <p> 2.1.1 Air Force Base Waterkloof would only receive flights classified as military flights , WIP flights or VIP flights . The former would include Heads of State and/or Government and Ministers . No commercial or charter flights would receive permission to land except in an emergency situation . The Standard Operating Procedures for the issuing of such clearances issued in July 2007 state clearly in paragraph 7(b) : Note that only military personnel , Head and Deputy Head of State may make use of AFB Waterkloof . <p> 2.1.2 The Embassy or High Commission would forward a Note Verbale to the Office of the Chief of State Protocol requesting the assistance of government with the visit . <p> 2.1.3 The Air Force Command Post would interact with DIRCO for clearance of state visits or VVIPs prior to issuing the clearance for continuation of the nature of the visit . <p> 2.1.4 Under the Customs and Excise Act of 1964 , Section 7(1A) ( a ) , non-military and non-VIP flights seeking to land at an airport other than one of the ten customs and excise airports , would need to obtain special permission prior to landing from the Commissioner SARS to do so . This would especially be the case when the passengers are not subject to the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act of 2001 . <p> 2.1.5 Once clearance had been granted , the base would notify departments with immigration , customs , health , and phyto-sanitary responsibilities of the pending arrival to enable them to be in attendance at the time . This notification would take place in writing and/or via telephone notification . All the above departments would be notified for all incoming and outgoing flights . However , full protocol would only be provided during state and official visits . <p> 2.1.6 DIRCO would convene and chair an interdepartmental meeting to deal with official state visits ; the meeting would include the Presidential Protection Unit for visiting VVIPs and Special Envoys . <p> 2.1.7 Protection for vehicle convoys of visiting delegations would be arranged at the national level by way of activation of the National JOINTS when the route crosses provincial boundaries . This is the responsibility of the National Commissioner of SAPS . <p> 2.1.8 The Department of Home Affairs would issue visas to the visitors against return flight tickets if travelling on a commercial flight , or if confirmed to travel on a charter flight . <p> The sequence of events in the pre-arrival phase in this specific matter is as follows : <p> 2.1.9 In February 2013 Mr Tony Gupta approached the Airports Company South Affica to enquire about the use of O.R . Tambo International Airport ( ORTIA ) for the arrival of " at least five heads of state , ministers and senior Indian Government officials " invited to a four-day wedding event at Sun City ( Source : ACSA Report ; NICOC Report 1 May 2013 ) . The Chief of State Protocol , Ambassador V. B. Koloane , attended a meeting of the Gupta family representative , Mr Tony Gupta ; the Acting Chief Executive Officer of ACSA , Mr Bongani Maseko ; and Minister of Transport Mr Ben Martins . At the meeting Mr Tony Gupta requested " to use facilities at the airport to welcome guests from India who were to attend a wedding " ( Source : Statement by Minister Martins 13 May 2013 ) . It was concluded that it would not be possible to use ORTIA given the request for an elaborate welcoming ceremony ; this was a space used by the Department of Home Affairs for checking passports . Minister Martins agreed with ACSA 's explanation ( Source : NICOC Report I May 2013 ; written statement by Minister Martins ) . <p> ACSA suggested that alternatives be considered , among them Lanseria or Pilanesberg airports . It was later determined that the runway at Lanseria was being upgraded . At a follow-up meeting and after enquiring with SM , ACSA informed Mr Gupta that the apron at Pilanesberg could not accommodate an Airbus A330-200 ( Source : ACSA Report ) . <p> 2.1.10 In early March 2013 the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans was approached by Mr Atul Gupta . The Minister 's Political Advisor , Mr Michael Ramagoma , was also approached by Mr Ashu Chawla on behalf of the Gupta family ( Source : Response to questions by the Gupta family lawyer Mr G. van der Merwe 14 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.1.11 During the latter half of March 2013 the Political Advisor of the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans approached the Chief of the South African Air Force , Lieutenant- General F.Z. Msimang , to determine the regulations governing the landing and taking off of civilian aircraft at Air Force Base Waterkloof . The Chief of the Air Force informed the Political Advisor that it would be irregular for an aircraft carrying Indian wedding guests to land at the base . <p> The Chief of the Air Force advised the Political Advisor that the matter should not be entertained any further . This was at the time of the military developments in the CAR , and of the air force helicopter crash in the Kruger National Park ( Source : Submission by the Chief of the Air Force dated 10 May 2013 ; confirmed by Mr Mike Ramagoma in his interview with the Team ) . <p> 2.1.12 On 2 Apr11 2013 the Chief of State Protocol contacted the Political Advisor to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans to enquire as to progress with the request . The Ambassador stated that he was " under pressure from No. 1 " on the matter . The Political Advisor stated that he was not in a position to respond at that point in time ( Source : Political Advisor 10 May 2013 ; confirmed by Ambassador V.B. Koloane on 1 May 2013 and in the interview with him on 16 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.1.13 On 3 April 2013 Mr Ramagoma met with Mr Chawla to inform him that the Minister had denied permission for a landing at the base ( Source : Political Advisor 10 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.1.14 Mr Chawla then liaised with individuals in the Indian High Commission for assistance ( Source : Response to questions by the Gupta family lawyer Mr G. van der Merwe dated 14 May 2013 ) . On 4 April 2013 an individual at the Indian High Commission applied by faxed letter at 15h38 to the Air Command Unit at the Air Force Command Post for Overflight and Landing Clearance for a " Chartered Flight " at the base ( Source : Fax IHC 4 April 2013 ) . The accompanying document containing details is titled " Request for Diplomatic Overflight and Landing Clearance : South Africa " . The purpose of the flight is cited under item 9 as " Delegation Visit " ( Source : Indian High Commission Request 4 April 2013 ) . <p> 2.1.15 on 9 April 2013 the Chief of State Protocol telephoned Sergeant-Major Ntshisi at the Air Force Command Post to enquire as to progress with the clearance request from the Indian High Commission . Ntshisi informed the Ambassador that the base could only receive flights transporting " Heads of State and their deputies " . The Ambassador responded that there would be " four to five Ministers on board " . He added that the Minister of Transport , Mr Ben Martins , had been given instructions " by the President to assist the Gupta family " ; that the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans " has no objection " ; that ' at a meeting of the Minister of Transport , the CEO of ACSA and the Guptas " he had been " told to assist " ; and that " this was a unique case " . <p> Ntshisi requested " a note or a letter " from the Ambassador . The Ambassador responded that ' the challenge was that this could not be put in writing " . He added that he had met with Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson the previous week to " show them around the area " ; Ntshjsj should contact the Lieutenant-Colonel to confirm this . The Ambassador stated clearly that this was for " the Gupta family wedding " . He instructed Ntshisi to call him back . <p> On 13 May 2013 , the Director-General in The Presidency stated that at no point did the President give instructions to Ambassador Koloane or discuss the issue of the landing of the aircraft with him . Regarding the specific questions posed to him relating to the prea rrival phase , he denied that The Presidency had ever received a request for landing at Waterkloof Air Force Base from any person whatsoever . <p> 2.1.16 Sergeant-Major Ntshisi then telephoned Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson to enquire about the " 217 Indian delegates " . He was informed that she was not available and would return the call . <p> 2.1.17 Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson returned Sergeant-Major Ntshisi 's call . Anderson stated that she had just spoken to the Chief of State Protocol , who had informed her that Ntshisi had rejected the request . She questioned him as to how he could have refused such a request from the Chief of State Protocol . Ntshisi clarified that he had requested written confirmation . Anderson then stated that " in confidentiality ( sic ) , I must be very careful now , our Number I knows about this . It is political . Allow them . I 'll phone the Ambassador back to find out who 's the senior minister " . Ntshisi asked Anderson to confirm that the base could only receive flights carrying Heads of State and Ministers . Anderson responded that it depends on the visit type , and that it would be acceptable for a " private visit if DIRCO approves . It is not a problem . Yes my dear , they can " . <p> 2.1.18 The Chief of State Protocol then called Sergeant-Major Ntshisi and stated " I believe you have spoken to Colonel Anderson ? " Ntshisi confirmed this and stated that he would go ahead with the clearance immediately . Ntshisi asked whether he should fax the clearance to Mr Matjila ( Mr William Matjila - Directorate State Visits DIRCO ) . The Chief of State Protocol asked where Ntshisi was at the time and was unable to understand the explanation given . He then requested Ntshisi to e-mail a copy of the clearance to his private e-mail address and to his official e-mail address . <p> 2.1.19 Mr William Matjila , Senior Foreign Affairs Assistant at DIRCO received a call from the Chief of State Protocol instructing him to assist with the clearance of the Indian delegation . This was the first ever and last call from the Chief of State Protocol , Ambassador Koloane to him . <p> 2.1.20 In response to the request for a letter from Sergeant-Major Ntshisi , Mr William Matjila forwarded an e-mail sent to him by Ms. Marilyn Morris , Secretary of the Chief of State Protocol . It stated : " As per your discussion with Ambassador Koloane with regards ( sic ) to the request for flight clearances and landing at Waterkloof AFB for the Indian Delegation , kindly note that Amb Koloane telephonically approved the request " ( Source : E-mail DIRCO at 08h33 dated 9 April 2013 ) .

He diverted to the base and found in excess of 50 vehicles there to transport the guests . In the interview on 16 May 2013 Ambassador Koloane was no longer sure of the number of cars present , although he noted that there were no familiar VIP protectors in the cars . <p> Some of these vehicles had already departed for Sun City upon his arrival . He was informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson and three individuals from the Indian High Commission that the arrival and processing of the visitors had proceeded smoothly . No DIRCO protocol officers were present ( Source : NICOC Report 1 May 2013 ; Interview with Ambassador V.8 .

Members of the SAPS Flying Squad were present outside the base ( Source : Interview with Flight Sergeant Van Bentheim 10 May 2013 ; SAPS Report 10 May2013 ) . <p> 2.2.22 SAPS Gauteng deployed 31 cars and 62 members for route security ; half the cars and members were allocated to the in and out trips . Gauteng Province developed a highway patrol matrix to guide the process . Extraordinary deployments were made that necessitated the utilisation of members who were not on duty . These additional deployments , which were not planned for , cost the department approximately R47 000 . The Gauteng Province SAPS provided route security from ORTIA and Air Force Base Waterkloof up to the boundary with the North-West Province at the Brits Toll Plaza . The North-West Province Flying Squad consisting of five cars and six members was deployed from there to Sun City . A total of 26 security vehicles were deployed by the event organiser from ORTIA to Sun City for the convoy and guest transport . A total of 70 security vehicles were deployed by the event organiser from the air force base to Sun City ( Source : SAPS Report 10 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.2.23 The convoys passed through the Brits Toll Plaza .

The meeting was attended by NICOC , SSA , SAPS , Defence Intelligence , DIRCO , The Presidency , Home Affairs , Justice and Constitutional Development , SARS and GCIS . <p> The meeting took the following decisions : <p> ( I ) Directors-General should interact with their Ministers and advise against attendance at the wedding at Sun City . <p> ( ii ) The National JOINTS should be convened at 21h00 to take control of the operation from the two provinces . <p> ( iii ) The Provincial Joint Operational Committees ( Pr0vJOCS ) should be activated to action the decisions of the National JOINTS . <p> ( iv ) SAPS should determine immediately whether the visiting " ministers " were receiving VIP protection or not , and corrective measures should be taken . <p> ( v ) The aircraft at the base should be removed immediately . <p> ( vi ) A port of entry should be identified for the departure of the visitors ; that port should under no circumstances be Air Force Base Waterkloof . <p> ( vii ) Home Affairs should immediately re-authenticate who had arrived and where they were staying , and ensure that this correlated with the eventual departure register . <p> ( viii ) SARS should immediately travel to the venue to issue customs declaration forms . <p> ( ix ) GCIS should arrange a government press conference on 3 May 2013 to address the matter , and all communication with the media should only take place through GCIS . <p> ( x ) Directors-General should immediately brief their respective Ministers on the outcomes of the meeting ( Source : NICOC Report I May 2013 ) . <p> 2.3.4 A meeting of JCPS Ministers took place on 2 May 2013 .

Tambo International Airport on the instructions of the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans . The transfer was done in accordance with normal procedure ( Source : ACSA Report ) . The Civil Aviation Authority ( CM ) imposed a fine of R80 000 on the airline for the flight not having had a Foreign Operators Permit ( Source : CEO CAA 10 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.3.6 On 2 May 2013 the Director-General of DIRCO had a telephone discussion with the Indian High Commissioner , Mr V. Gupta . The High Commissioner stated that there were no Union ( national ) Ministers on the flight , but only state ministers . He added that the Gupta family had not asked him to assist with the arrangements for the visiting delegation ( Source : DIRCO Report dated 2 May 2013 . <p> 2.3.7 SAPS undertook a criminal investigation , On 3 May 2013 two Metro Police officials were arrested for using their official firearms during the escort arid protection of the Gupta family wedding ; it was determined that the registration plates of three of the vehicles used to escort the wedding party to Sun City were false ; the private security company which protected the convoy on the way to Sun City was not registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority ( PSIRA ) as a service provider ; and it was determined that the security officials at the wedding were using their own firearms . It was also determined that an individual working for a bogus company had invoiced Mr Tony Gupta for the sum of R512 000 for protection services . Criminal investigations are taking place in all of these cases ( Source : SAPS Report 5 May 2013 ) . The Gupta family indicated that they had made it clear that they were prepared to pay for all services rendered by the state , and repeated that they are still prepared to do so ( Source : Response from the Gupta family lawyer Mr G. van der Merwe dated 14 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.3.8 On 3 May 2013 the Director-General of DIRCO called in the Indian High Commissioner to discuss circumstances and procedures followed regarding the landing . It was pointed out to the High Commissioner that a Note Verbale had not been presented prior to the landing consistent with diplomatic protocol . The Indian High Commissioner responded that the failure to present a Note Verbale had been a lapse and that the point made was a valid one ( Source : DIRCO Report 3 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.4 Exit Phase <p> During the exit phase the following transpired : <p> 2.4.1 Six check-in counters were set aside at ORTIA to process the visitors ( Source : DHA Report 7 May 2013 ) . Immigration procedures were complied with , except that the seven state ministers had left on a chartered flight to Cape Town and would leave on a commercial Emirates flight to return to India ( Source : DIRCO Report 3 May 2013 ) . It was also determined that one of the arriving visitors originally listed as crew had in fact not yet left South Affica ( Source : DHA Departure and Reconciliation List 7 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.4.2 SARS reported that no customs transgressions , apart from the late declarations , had taken place ( SARS Report 10 May 2013 ) . <p> 2.4.3 On 8 May 2013 it was determined that the diplomatic passport numbers of three of the arriving visitors differed from the passport numbers provided to the South African High Commission in New Delhi by Sahara Computers ( Pty ) Ltd ( Source : Undated Sahara Computers letter to the South African High Commission New Delhi ; DHA Departure and Reconciliation List attached to DHA e-mail dated 7 May 2Ol3 ) .1j <p> 3 . CHAPTER 3 : ANALYSIS <p> The analysis pertains to each of the four phases . <p> 3.1 Pre-Arrival Phase <p> The first interaction occurred in February 2013 between Tony Gupta , the Chief of State Protocol , Ambassador Koloane , Minister Ben Martins and the Acting CEO of ACSA . The Conclusion of this meeting was that it was not possible for ACSA to accede to the request to allow the Gupta family and their wedding guests exclusive access to the arrivals area for the purposes of their welcoming ceremony . The hosting of the arrival ceremony would not be possible as the Gupta-charted Airbus would land during the peak arrival time of international inb ound flights . <p> Shortly thereafter the Gupta family approached the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans and the Minister 's Political Advisor . This direct approach and request for the use of a strategic entry point for a wedding was improper because this amounted to a request for untoward assistance . The refusal by the Minister based on the advice by officials was therefore correct , as she is not ordinarily involved in these approvals . <p> The subsequent interaction on 2 April 2013 between the Chief of State Protocol and the Political Advisor to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans on the wedding of the Gupta family was again improper . During the interaction the Chief of State Protocol abused the name of the President of the Republic in an effort to exert pressure on the Political Advisor . This amounts to misrepresentation <p> Between 2 and 4 April 2013 , the approach transitioned from one characterised by the involvement of government officials in a family matter to an official diplomatic approach . This transition was effected by Mr Ashu Chawia , a fact confirmed by the Gupta family lawyer . This approach , which led to the abuse of the diplomatic channel , was a deliberate manipulation of the system to further wedding objectives couched as official business . The collusion between Chawla and an individual in the Indian High Commission to abuse the diplomatic channel to request flight clearance on 4 April 2013 is of concern , and improper in a number of respects . <p> Firstly , the Indian High Commission failed to provide a Note Verbale to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation ; this was a serious infringement of diplomatic protocol . The Indian High Commission admitted as much to the DG DIRCO in a subsequent interaction . <p> Secondly , the request was one for " Diplomatic Overflight and Landing Clearance " ; this amounts to a misrepresentation of the nature of the visit . Thirdly , the purpose of the flight was listed as " Delegation Visit " ; this was again a misrepresentation of what was a wedding . It must be noted that the glossary of diplomatic terms found at . eDiplomat.com defines a delegation as " an official party sent to an international conference or on some other special diplomatic mission " . The United Nations Institute for Training and Research 's 2005 " Glossary of Terms for Diplomats " defines a delegate as " a representative of a state or organisation who has been authorised to speak and act on its behalf and who has been duly accredited to a conference " . <p> The occurrences of 9 April 2013 are the key to understanding the subsequent developments . They revealed a number of serious concerns . It can not be coincidental that after this abuse of diplomatic channels , the Chief of State Protocol took it upon himself to facilitate an illegal request for landing . <p> First , the Chief of State Protocol spoke directly to the Command Post ; it was not normal practice for the Chief of State Protocol to interact directly with the Command Post to enquire as to progress with a specific clearance . <p> Second , the Chief of State Protocol stated that there would be four to five Ministers on the flight ; this was a misrepresentation of the facts , as the Ministers in question are State Ministers , the equivalent of Members of the Executive Council ( MEC ) in South Africa , not national Ministers which could have been accorded a different status . <p> Third , the Chief of State Protocol mentioned the Minister of Transport , the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans , and the President in an effort to pressure the Command Post to issue the clearance ; this was improper and inappropriate , and amounted to abuse of the political cJout and office of members of the National Executive . <p> Ambassador V.8 . Koloane on 1 May 2013 and 16 May 2013 confirmed that neither the President nor officials in the Presidency whether junior or senior , Ministers and Directors-General in DIRCO and Defence and Military Veterans had instructed him to assist with the landing of the aircraft . He said that he did this because he is obliged to assist official and non-official visits involving Ministers of other countries . <p> Fourth , the Chief of State Protocol stated that this was a unique case in an effort to justify a request with which the responsible official in the Command Post was clearly uncomfortable . <p> Fifth , the Chief of State Protocol retorted that he could not put his sensitive motivation in writing , a clear indication that he was aware of the fact that the request was dubious . <p> Sixth , the Chief of State Protocol indicated that he had interacted with Lieutenant- Colonel Anderson on the matter , and that she could provide clarification ; this amounted to abuse of an official working relationship to advance the interests of private parties . <p> Seventh , the Chief of State Protocol admitted that the request was for the " Gupta family wedding " , an admission that the status of the visit was clearly not official , diplomatic or military , and that the incoming party was not a delegation in the official understanding of the term . Whilst under normal circumstances , both official and private visits by Ministers , VlPs and WlPs are afforded protocol services , the numbers of accompanying parties in this instance was out of the ordinary , and therefore did not qualify for such treatment . <p> The instruction issued by the Chief of State Protocol to Mr William Matjila , Senior Foreign Affairs Assistant in his office at DIRCO , which the Ambassador confirmed in an interview on 16 May 2013 , to assist with the clearance of the Indian delegation was the first ever telephone contact from the Chief of State Protocol to this official . The Senior Foreign Affairs Assistant requested written confirmation for him to execute the instruction of Ambassador Koloane . Mr Matjila subsequently received an e-mail from Ms Marilyn Morris which indicated that Ambassador Koloane had telephonically approved the flight clearance request of the Indian delegation ( Source : E-mail from Ms M. Morris to Mr W. Matjila dated 9 April 2013 , 08h33 ) . Mr Matjila confirmed in an interview on 13 May 2013 that no Note Verbale was received from the Indian High Commission . <p> It can be deduced from the opening exchange between Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson and the Command Post that the Lieutenant-Colonel had in the interim spoken with the Chief of State Protocol , because she questioned Sergeant-Major Ntshisi as to why he had rejected a request from the Chief of State Protocol . Ambassador Koloane confirmed the events as recorded . <p> Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson also stated that " Number 1 " was aware of this request : this again amounted to misrepresentation of the person of the President and his Office in the matter . The Director-General in The Presidency made it clear that no one in The Presidency ever gave an instruction in this regard . This included the Private Office of the President . Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson 's statement can not be a coincidence in light of the conversation between Sergeant- Major Ntshisl and Ambassador Koloane , which she was not privy to . <p> This had an effect of bringing the person and the Office of the President into disrepute . Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson also undertook to follow up with the Chief of State Protocol to obtain the name of the Minister who would be on the flight ; this was an attempt to satisfy the request by the Command Post . <p> When questioned as to the fact that the base only receives flights carrying heads of state and ministers , the Lieutenant-Colonel obfuscated and stated that this would depend on the status of the visit ; she then transferred ultimate authority for the decision to DIRCO ; this amounts to disregard for official policy as to the use of the base . <p> The request from an individual in the Indian High Commission on 9 April 2013 to provide for the re-fuelling of the aircraft compounded confusion as to the exact status of the pending visit . The application described the visit as VVIP , which was a clear misrepresentation of the facts in the extreme . <p> There are a number of concerns with the content of the RSAO5 External Clearance issued by the Air Force Command Post on 9 April 2013 . The requestor was stipulated as an Indian delegation , despite this being a wedding party . The movements are classified as VIP , again a misrepresentation of the status of the incoming party . Despite the supposed VIP status , security was listed as not applicable . Lieutenant-Colonel S.J. van Zyl who signed the clearance , stated in his submission to the Investigating Team that parking and landing fees were waived as the flight was misrepresented to be official . <p> The misrepresentation of this fact resulted in the base not levying the landing and parking fees , although we note attempts to reverse this through the re-levying of the landing and parking fees . The Standard Operating Procedures of the Air Force Command Post require that if these fees are waived4 a reason must be stipulated on the clearance , and the clearance should be forwarded to the Secretary of Defence to grant the waiver ; this was not done . It must be noted , in addition , that the Officer Commanding Air Force Base Waterkloof does not have the authority to approve or deny clearances for landings ; this authority belongs solely to the Air Force Command Post . <p> One of the conditions for the issuing of the flight clearance was obtaining a Foreign Operators Permit ( FOP ) from the Department of Transport ( DOT ) . <p> The absence of SARS at the base when the flight arrived has emerged as a concern . SARS was listed as a recipient of the fax sent by the base on 23 April 2013 to departments to notify them of the arrival of the flight . It has subsequently emerged that the SARS recipient of the fax was using a private fax to e-mail number to receive official communication of this nature , and had in fact left SARS a year prior to this incident . His details had , however , not been removed from the Air Force systems . <p> This may go some way to explaining SARS 's absence , as well as statements by personnel at the base that they had experienced difficulty in ensuring SARS 's presence in recent months . Upon investigation it was determined that this official had continued to receive faxes about incoming international WIP and VIP flights during the year since he had departed from SARS . This represented a major risk and could have potentially had far-reaching consequences for the security of incoming and outgoing flights . <p> An individual in the Indian High Commission requested the Chief of State Protocol on 24 April 2013 to facilitate arrangements for the reception at the base . This amounts to the use of a senior government official to arrange a wedding reception at a strategic entry point and was a major security violation . How this was done without raising alarm raises concern around the vigilance of officers at the base , particularly since the company involved was not vetted . <p> It is noteworthy that contrary to the statement by the Chief of State Protocol that he attended a meeting at the base on 24 April 2013 with Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson and a member of the Indian High Commission , Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson denies that the meeting took place at all . <p> Clearly , someone is not telling the truth . <p> On 25 April 2013 , an individual in the Indian High Commission applied for clearances for helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft as a continuation of a legend of an official delegation , when all and sundry knew by this point that it was a wedding . The officer responsible approved the landing as this was part of the so-called diplomatic package . This had the potential of compromising national security . <p> It must be noted that Lieutenant-Colonel S.J. van Zyl , who signed the clearances , stated that this approval was granted because the RSAO4 and RSAO5 clearances were regarded as a single package and hence approved as one . It was also noteworthy that Lieutenant-Colonel van Zyl only started working in the Air Force Command Post at the end of February 2013 and was dependent on the advice of junior officers . <p> Regarding planning by the SAPS , it must be noted that in terms of the Safety at Sports and RecreationaJ Events Act ( SSAREA ) , Act 2 of 2010 , the SAPS was obliged to plan for , and secure the wedding as foreign and local Ministers were attending the wedding . <p> The failure to communicate by the two SAPS provinces is cause for serious concern , and was made worse by their non-observance of established protocol in seeking the approval of the National Commissioner . The Gauteng SAPS explanation that they were dependent on the North-West Bojanala plan is disingenuous , as they failed to obtain a copy of the plan they were supposedly dependent on . <p> 3.2 Arrival Phase <p> A number of issues arose during the arrival phase . <p> The manner in which the aircraft was managed upon entering South African airspace until it landed at the base was in full compliance with all procedures mandated by ATNS in keeping with international conventions , procedures and protocols . <p> Concerning the supposed late arrival at the base by the Chief of State Protocol , and his subsequent statement to Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson that he had forgotten the date of arrival , Lieutenant-Colonel S.J. van Zyl from the Air Force Command Post stated in his submission that the Command Post informed Ambassador Koloane of the estimated arrival time by e-mail . It is noteworthy , that during the arrival and welcoming at the lounges , no VIP 's were identified or brought to the attention of the officials present to perform this function . <p> This was in contrast to the listing of the flight on the Mission Board as a VIP flight . After the landing of Flight JAI 9900 , Colonel Visser noted in the interview with him that he , Colonel Fredrikson and Lieutenant- Colonel Anderson had " agreed that the flight should never have landed there " . It is ironic that Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson could agree with the observation of Colonel Visser in light of the fact that she was party from inception to the planning of this visit . Colonel Visser also noted that no celebrations had ever taken place upon the arrival of a foreign flight at the base in his recollection . <p> The Immigration Act requires that civilians entering the country present themselves physically with their passports to the immigration officials . This was not done , as Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson and the " Indian delegation " facilitated the processing of the passports as a batch in the absence of the visitors . These people were therefore accorded , in keeping with the legend , the diplomatic privilege of having their passports processed in their absence in addition to the use of the two red carpets and officials to welcome them . <p> The failure to conduct customs formalities arising from the absence of the SARS at the base was an infringement of the Customs and Excise Act of 1964 . <p> 3.3 Post-Arrival Phase <p> Despite the requirement that the flight be issued with a Foreign Operators Permit prior to arrival , this was not done En the case of Flight JAI 9900 . It was confirmed by the Department of Transport that no application was brought by the operator for the FOP . The absence of an FOP on arrival resulted in SACAA levying a fine of R80 000 on the airline . This represents an infringement of civil aviation regulations and a condition of the flight clearance <p> A range of concerns arise from the involvement of the SAPS and a private security company in transporting the visitors to and from Sun City . The predisposition of the SAPS officers involved in the operation left much to be desired . There was no attempt to determine the identities of the individuals providing route protection and escort ; there was also no attempt to verify the vehicle licence plates or their use of blue lights . <p> It is clear from subsequent arrests that members of the SAPS and Metro Police were moonlighting during this operation . The use of official firearms during the operation is an infringement of the Firearms Control Act . The use of false vehicle number plates was an infringement of the Road Traffic Act . The use of an unregistered private security company was an infringement of the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority Act ( PSIRA ) . <p> The use of fitted blue and red lights in private security vehicles was also illegal , especially in the context of the existence of the so-called " Blue Light Gang " . in addition , Major- General Taioe of SAPS found two BMWs fitted with blue lights . He also found three ' VW Golf Gil 's and one Isuzu Bakkie which were fitted with blue lights . These belong to a civilian who as such is not entitled to have his vehicles fitted with blue lights . Furthermore , this individual was the subject of various criminal investigations that were subsequently dropped . The charges that had been proferred included two cases of impersonating a police officer and one of fraud . <p> The investigations conducted by the SAPS into the above matters indicate irregular invoicing of the event organiser using the name of a company that does not exist . It can be surmised that this could have taken place to take certain business transactions off the company 's books and evade tax obligations , a common trait in organised crime . <p> The investigation reveals a number of discrepancies with the diplomatic passport numbers for certain of the visitors that were submitted by Sahara to the South African High Commission in New Delhi , and the actual passports used by these individuals . This matter is under investigation . Further , it has been determined that one of the visitors listed as crew did not leave the Republic with the rest of the visiting group , but is still in the country . This too is the subject of an investigation . Both are extremely irregular and leave much to be desired in the context of national security . <p> The reference to an invitation from the Free State Provincial Government was opaque , as no member of this party travelled to the Free State for any such meeting . However , an Indian State Minister was received by the Free State MEC for Agriculture three days prior to the arrival of the Gupta wedding party ; this Indian Minister therefore arrived and departed from South Africa completely separate from the Gupta wedding party , despite attending the wedding at Sun City . <p> The Indian High Commission then stated that the seven Ministers visited Cape Town prior to departing from the Republic on an Emirates flight from there . This raises a question as to compliance with the visa conditions and adherence to the provisions of the Immigration Act . This matter is work in progress . <p> 3.4 Exit Phase <p> During the exit phase , procedures that would normally apply , and those instructed by the extended NICOC Principals Meeting of 1 May 2013 , were partially complied with . Not all those who arrived with the flight departed on the outgoing flight ; and SARS had not acted against the pilot for failing to comply within three hours of landing with the requirement that he inform SARS of the same in line with Section 7(1A) of the Customs and Excise Act of 1964 . Jet Airways must be familiar with these conditions as they operated in South Africa until 2012 . <p> 4 . CHAPTER 4 : FINDINGS <p> The findings of the Investigating Team are the following : <p> 4.1 In February 2013 the Gupta family approached the Airports Company South Africa and requested landing rights and an elaborate reception for the wedding party . This would have disrupted the functioning of O.R . Tambo International Airport at the time of landing , particularly the operations of the National Immigration Branch at the airport . As a result , this was turned down . In March 2013 the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans and her advisor were approached by the Gupta family on different occasions , On 3 April 2013 this request was also turned down . The Gupta family then resorted to the use of the diplomatic channel with the support of an individual in the Indian High Commission who re-designated the wedding entourage as an official delegation to enable them to use the Air Force Base Waterkloof under the cover of diplomatic privilege . It is an undisputed fact that there was no official Note Verbale from the Indian High Commission to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation , and therefore due process was not followed . An individual in the Indian High Commission communicated directly with individuals at the Air Force Command Post . The collusion of officials resulted in the irregular approval of the flight clearance . <p> 4.2 Members of the National Executive were not required to issue any instructions , did not issue any instructions , and did not create the impression that they ought to have issued any instructions . This is evident in information at our disposal . <p> 4.3 The aircraft in question was cleared for landing and the correct clearance procedures were followed , but based on false pretences as a result of the manipulation of the process by the Gupta family , individuals in the Indian High Commission , Chief of State Protocol Ambassador V.B. Koloane , and Officer Commanding Movement Control at the base , Lieutenant-Colonel C. Anderson , who shared a common purpose and acted in concert . This had the potential of damaging the good diplomatic and deep historical relations South Africa enjoys with India on the bilateral , multilateral , international and BRICS levels . <p> 4.4 There are seven functions of the Air Force Base Waterkloof . They are operations ; training flights ; WIP flights ; foreign heads of state , envoys and dignitaries ; registered military aircraft ; diversion airfield for commercial aircraft ; and conducting air shows . <p> 4.5 As a result of the nature of these functions , the Air Force Base Waterkloof handles both civilian and military aircraft . This notwithstanding , the landing of the flight was a direct result of manipulation of processes and was undesirable . <p> 4.6 The Air Force Base Waterkloof is a strategic military base that resorts under the Defence Act , Act 44 of 1957 . The Air Force Base Waterkloof is not a National Key Point and is not governed by the National Key Points Act , Act 102 of 1980 , which is managed by the SAPS . This being a strategic military base , which also serves as an entry point into South Africa , it has even more stringent security measures . <p> 4.7 The landing of Flight JAI 9900 following the exercise of undue influence had the potential to compromise the credibility of the Government of the Republic , and could have caused severe reputational damage to the state itself . The exercise of this undue influence undermined good governance , legislative stipulations , regulations , departmental protocols and standard operating procedures . <p> 4.8 The activities of Ambassador Koloane and Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson were a serious dereliction of duty in that they were advancing the objectives of this project to the detriment of their official responsibilities . Their activities also indicate the bringing to bear of undue influence on state officials , systems , equipment and infrastructure . This influence happened despite the denial of the exercise of undue influence by the legal representative of the Gupta family . The roles of the two individuals had a similar effect in that due to their seniority and knowledge of departmental systems and processes in their respective areas , they both grossly abused and undermined these processes . <p> 4.9 All requirements in terms of health clearances , baggage scanning and a firearms check were complied with . <p> 4.10 The use of private security vehicles to ferry disembarking passengers from the aircraft to the lounges was a security breach . <p> 4.11 The use of red carpets to welcome the arriving guests was not in line with protocol prescriptions , which require that these are used to welcome visiting Heads of State and/or Government , the Minister of Defence and other senior diplomatic visitors only . <p> 4.12 Further to the above deviations , there were two additional deviations from normal DIRCO processes in this instance : there was no review and/or recommendation from the Political Desk in DIRCO on this particular request ; and the interdepartmental coordination process that normally ensues did not take place . In its stead the Chief of State Protocol facilitated a visit for the Indian High Commission and the service provider to the base . <p> 4.13 The Chief of State Protocol was assisted by Lieutenant-Colonel Christine Anderson , Officer Commanding Movement Control at Air Force Base Waterkloof . By calling Sergeant-Major Ntshisi at the Air Force Command Post on 9 April 2013 , she inverted command and control and unduly influenced the processing of the clearance . She is in a Level 4 post that gets instructions from Level 3 . She abused her rank on Sergeant-Major Ntshisi when she said he could go ahead with issuing the clearance . She was just supposed to await the decision of the Air Force Command Post on that application . <p> 4.14 In light of the challenges faced during the landing , including poor visibility as a result of cloud cover , as well as the fact that landing guidance systems on the runway are being reconfigured , the situation held potentially catastrophic consequences had there been an unforeseen incident or accident involving the wedding party . <p> 4.15 The activities of some of the persons involved were driven by the undesirable practice of the exercise of undue influence , and abuse of higher office . These activities posed a threat to the culture of professionalism that ought to characterise a caring and professional public service rooted in the Batho PeIe principle . The incident is antithetical to the notion of a capable state and the requirement that it be served by professional public servants with foresight to understand the implications of their conduct for the reputation of the state . <p> 4.16 While the flight was in South African airspace , all procedures , protocoJs and instructions from air traffic control were complied with . The dramatised reports in the media , including social media , about the flight taking a tour over South African cities and disrupting air traffic are therefore unfounded . <p> 4.17 The police , in terms of SSAREA , having initially refused to police the wedding as a private matter , were within their rights to treat the matter as requiring police involvement . However the lack of involvement of other departments deprived them of information and better insight into this wedding . Consequently , the SAPS in the North-West Province developed a plan for the protection of the event , although there is concern at their failure to report to the National Commissioner , who would have activated the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Structure ( NatJOINTS ) if deemed necessary , in keeping with established protocols . This could have provided another opportunity for the relevant role players to review the nature of the event and policing plans . <p> 4.18 The involvement of law enforcement agencies under the auspices and leadership of the South African Police Services , in providing convoy protection services was authonsed , but involved officers who were moonlighting contrary to regulations . The officials from the Metro Police who carried their firearms irregularly to protect the event are only authorised to bear their firearms within their respective Metro jurisdictions . Their use in this instance was a violation of regulations . Some of them also drove vehicles that were fitted illegally with blue lights . <p> 4.19 In the interest of the safety of alt road users and taking into account that 121 vehicles were deployed by the event organiser , it was necessary that law enforcement officers take charge of the convoy to Sun City . However , due to the lack of vigilance of the SAPS members deployed for escort duty , who did not identify the drivers as non-SAPS members , they placed reliance on those drivers . This made it possible for the cars fitted with illegal blue-lights to push people off the road , cause delays and inconvenience other road users . The public outcry that followed was therefore justified . <p> 4.20 The following transgressions of the law took place , amongst others : <p> 4.20.1 SAPS Act , Act 68 of 1995 : Contravening of Section 67(2) ( a ) : Conspiring or inducing or attempting to induce a member not to perform duty or act in conflict with his duty ; and Section 68 : Falsely pretending to be a police officer . <p> 4.20.3 Companies Act , Act 71 of 2008 : Section 214(1) ( b ) : Person with a fraudulent purpose knowingly provided false or misleading information in any circumstances under this Act ; and Section 214(1) ( c ) : Knowingly a party to an act of omission by a company calculated to defraud a creditor or employee of the company , or a holder of the company securities , or with another fraudulent purpose . <p> 4.20.4 Firearms Control Act , Act 60 of 2000 : Section 120(1) ( a ) : Failure to apply for renewal of a **26;265;TOOLONG authorisatjon before end of period determined by the Minister . <p> 4.22 It is now confirmed that all helicopters used in the operation were organised and funded by the Gupta family , and were neither SAPS nor SANDF helicopters . All of the black BMWs used in the convoys were hired from a private company . <p> 4.23 Overall , the total deployment of government personnel during the operation was 194 persons and 88 vehicles . 296 private security officers were deployed at the expense of the event organiser . The organisers also deployed two fixed-wing aircraft and seven helicopters to ferry their guests from the base to Sun City . This was authonsed as a package linked to the already-issued clearance for Flight JAI 9900 . <p> 4.24 It is commendable , notwithstanding the manipulation by a few , that public servants in affected government departments and structures raised concerns without fear , favour or prejudice , some of them repeatedly , as to what was transpiring . However , their concerns were neither addressed , nor acted upon by those in positions of authority over them bent on manipulating the system . <p> 4.25 Overall , the system for the management of foreign visits and the requisite permits , policies and procedures are in place and functioning . That is why flights arrive and depart on a daily basis without incident . The breach in this instance was a consequence of manipulation by the responsible persons , who contemptuously manipulated the system to advance the wedding objectives at all costs . <p> 4.26 SANRAL and SAPS reports reveal gross violations of the Road Traffic Act in that a number of the Range Rovers used shared the same registration numbers ; three black BMWs had false registration plates ; and two Mercedes Benz shared registration numbers . These and other criminal activities uncovered in this investigation are a manifestation of a deep-seated organised crime culture waiting to be unleashed on the country . <p> 5 . CHAPTER 5 : RECOMMENDATIONS <p> The Investigating Team provides the following recommendations for consideration : <p> 5.1 . All affected departments and entities must complete their investigations into this matter as soon as possible to ensure that justice is seen to be done , and the required disciplinary measures are fully implemented where deemed necessary . Criminal cases invoMng public officials or private persons must , as a matter of priority , be pursued to their logical conclusion . <p> 5.2 To avoid any overlap of mandates and confusion over the management , command and control of bases including Air Force Base Waterkloof , it is not desirable to declare these National Key Points , as it would subject them to the control of the SAPS . These are military installations that must continue to resort under the Defence Act and serve the existing seven functions listed in paragraph 4.1.4 above . <p> 5.3 Government , led by the Department of Public Service and Administration , should develop and implement a public service awareness campaign to discourage the negative culture of name dropping in the form of in ' per use of names of the National Executive in the public sector . In addition , the definition of acts of misconduct should be amended across government to include name dropping as gross misconduct . <p> 6 . CHAPTER 6 : CONCLUSION <p> In conclusion , the landing of flight JAI 9900 at Air Force Base Waterkloof has brought to the fore serious issues that need immediate attention . These include the identified culture of undue influence , underpinned by poor ethical conduct and a lack of professionalism described in this report . <p> We believe that the unified public voice which condemned the incident , together with decisive government action , serves as a useful basis for the development of a partnership between our people and their government in the fight to combat crime and corruption in our country . <p> Notwithstanding the negative findings , the work of the Investigating Team has brought to light the many public servants who conscientiously and faithfully perform their duties and daily tasks , and whose work is a credit to the country that they serve . <p> Issued by Government , May 22 2013 ( Transcribed from PDF - as such there may be errors in text. )

Opening a debate on the National Treasury budget vote in Parliament , Gordhan warned that unless a way was found to restore calm and confidence in South Africa 's mining sector , investment and jobs would be under threat . " The present uncertainty in the labour relations environment in mining and other sectors requires concerted action by organised labour , business , civic leaders and government , " the minister said . <h> ' We are all in this together ' <p> " There is no room for complacency here : we are all in this together .

There are many countries that have greater instability , but their economic narrative is extremely positive .

@@287234 <p> The Toyota 86 is a machine that attracts only the most polarised of opinion . It either gets written off as a gutless substitute for the traditional hot hatch or a brilliant coup ? that serves up proper rear wheel-drive thrills for relatively little money . Now unlike some of my peers , my stance is of the latter . Yes , it does n't have a lot of power and , yes , a Polo GTI will obliterate it in a robot-to-robot drag race . But everywhere else the 86 is a bloody marvellous piece of driving kit . It 's uncomplicated , handles brilliantly and lets you explore the limits of grip without having to worry about a violent death . Give me the money and I 'd immediately go out and buy one . Or would I ? <p> You see Subaru , the chaps who teamed up with Toyota to engineer the 86 in the first place , has the BRZ . And by all accounts it is exactly the same car , just with a few subtle tweaks thrown in to give you a vague sense of differentiation . The front apron , for example , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Toyota . It also comes equipped with a rear boot spoiler as standard plus a slightly different set of chrome-licked side strakes . If this is n't enough to distance your BRZ from the more common 86 , Subaru gives you the option of bolting on a rather nice front splitter designed by the go-faster gurus at their STI division . But you 'll have to cough up R10 000 for the privilege . <p> Yet perhaps the single greatest thing about this modern-day exercise in badge engineering is the presence of a rorty sports exhaust system . Again , this is optional on the 86 ( check out their extensive TRD performance catalogue if you 're keen ) but Subaru has thrown it in as part of the list price . And , goodness me , does it sound wicked . Push the start button and your ears are suddenly met by this deep and joyous rumbling that is vaguely reminiscent of an old air-cooled 911 . <p> Keep your right foot planted to the firewall and all the cabin plastics literally vibrate with a hair-prickling growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is purely psychological but I also think these loud pipes give the naturally aspirated FA boxer engine a slight performance kick . Not in terms of raw power , gains would be negligible , but in delivery . Compared to the 86 I tested earlier this year , the BRZ actually feels a lot freer revving . <p> So how does the Scooby handle out on the black stuff ? Well compared to its Toyota doppelg ? nger the BRZ is noticeably less tail happy . Knowing that their loyal customer base is accustomed to the characteristics of their symmetrical all wheel-drive system found in products like the Impreza and Forester , Subaru went and made the front suspension slightly firmer . Which , as you may or may not know , increases a car 's tendency to understeer . Consequently the BRZ behaves in a far more neutral manner when driven with anger around everyday mean streets . <p> Pile into a corner , get too enthusiastic on the gas pedal and that nose will just slowly start washing out . It 's all very safe , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the traction control turned off , I found that the BRZ seldom felt the need to emulate the behavior of its laterally obsessed brother . Look , I 'm not saying you ca n't get that rear-end to breakaway in a satisfying drift , you can , it just requires a more concerted effort . Other than that , there 's not much difference between the two at all . You still get the same brilliant seating position , beautifully weighted six-speed manual gearbox and meaty , feelsome electric power-assisted steering . Even the pedals , perfectly crafted for the art of heel-and-toe , remain unchanged . <p> So would I pick the Subaru over the Toyota then ? Um , no , I would n't . Because being something of an oversteer addict ( there ai n't no cure ) , I just prefer the more overtly sideways orientation of the 86 . It 's also cheaper too -- a high-specification model costs exactly R55 400 less than the Fuji Heavy Industries equivalent . This gives you some change to bolt on a few TRD accessories . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left over to throw at fuel or an impromptu track day . <p> But this is n't to say that the BRZ is , in anyway , an inferior machine -- far from it . The Subaru is safer for rear wheel-drive newbies , more predictable on the limit and , for the moment , considerably more exclusive . It also comes with a far more generous five-year/105 000km maintenance plan versus the four-year/60 000km deal tagged to the Toyota . Worth paying a premium for ? Only you can decide . <h> Comments <p> Simple fact is the BRZ handles better than the FRS , rides better on the highway , and turns faster lap times because it is NOT so tail happy . Not to mention Subaru World Rally Blue -- a color the FRS do nt come in . <h> About <p> Thomas Falkiner is the motoring writer for both the Sunday Times and Times newspapers .

@@313231 <h> Time for Cassel Mathale to go <p> INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERSExpelled ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema has reportedly sent out an e-mail announcing he needs money to start a new political platform . File photo : Bongiwe Mchunu <p> One of the important decisions taken by the ANC after the Mangaung conference was the disbandment of the national executive committee of the ANC Youth League and the ANC provincial executive committee ( PEC ) in Limpopo . <p> It was a commendable and necessary decision given the serious internal problems of the youth league and its inherently oppositional relationship with the ANC national leadership . <p> In Limpopo , the process leading to the conference at which the disbanded PEC was elected was found to have been fraught with substantial irregularities . <p> An interim provincial task team have been put together and given nine months to reconstitute and relaunch branches , sub-regions and regions and , ultimately , convene a provincial elective conference to elect a new leadership . <p> This is , or should be , the sole mandate for the task team -- not governing the province . There was a rumour after their appointment that they had taken a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped or be made with their consultation . <p> They denied this , but whether that decision was made or not is beside the point . <p> The problem is the mind-boggling decision to retain , at least for now , Cassel Mathale as premier , after removing him as a provincial leader of the ANC . <p> In a way , the continued control of the levers of state power by Mathale and his cronies in the provincial , district and local government administrations renders the dissolution of the PEC just about null and void . <p> Except for the departments under administration , they will continue to appoint their own surrogates to important public service positions . In this context , one can understand the frustrations and concerns of the interim task team in this regard . <p> While the focus of the task team is to rebuild and unite the ANC in the province , they should not be distracted by issues of governance in carrying out this critical task . <p> The survival of the ANC in Limpopo depends on the outcome of their work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint someone to serve until the elections next year . <p> That premier must be mandated to stop the rot in the Limpopo provincial administration and improve service delivery . <p> That premier should also , in consultation with the task team , appoint , where necessary , new district and local mayors throughout the province with the same mandate . <p> As ANC deployees , they will remain accountable to the ANC task team until a new PEC is elected . <p> The case against Mathale is overwhelming . First , over a year ago six of the provincial government departments were put under national administration . The provincial treasury had run out of funds to finance basics such as salaries , food for hospitals and schools , furniture for schools and many others . <p> Clearly the point was that Mathale and his team were incapable of governing Limpopo . <p> Second , the On-Point Engineering corruption case in the Department of Roads and Transport in which the public protector made damning findings were never acted upon by Mathale . On the contrary , he promoted MEC Pinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bigger and more influential economic development and tourism portfolio . <p> Third , no disciplinary action whatsoever was taken against officials involved in the fraudulent and corrupt procurement transactions in the departments of roads and transport , health and welfare , education , and housing . <p> On the contrary , he is alleged to be doing everything in his power to stop the national Public Service and Administration Department from acting against those officials named in the reports of the public protector and other investigations . <p> If the ANC leaders fail to act timeously against Mathale , as they did with his friend Julius Malema , they will continue to lose both organisational and public confidence and trust from the people of Limpopo and South Africa . <p> * Jack Mokobi is an independent analyst on media and politics .

@@313233 <p> At the epicentre of every practice session the Proteas have had in the past four years was a man with almost no public profile . Throwing thousands of balls in the nets , talking , discussing , hitting slip catches and high ones ... and then running the fitness sessions and warm-downs afterwards . <p> Rob Walter was there in Amsterdam last week and at the Swalec Stadium in Cardiff , again , doing what he has done so successfully during the Proteas ' rise to Test champions . This time they are attempting to win the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy . Like head coach Gary Kirsten , he is on his last tour of duty before beginning a new career as head coach of the Titans . <p> The " backroom " composition of international cricket teams is not decided by the captain and coach , but by finance committees and budgetary constraints . The days of " manager and coach only " have long gone . Physiotherapists and even psychologists are now de rigueur , as are fitness trainers . Everyone has to have a " label " , so Walter was given " strength and conditioning coach " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Any player will confirm this , especially Hashim Amla , who has taken to thanking him on Twitter . <p> The appointment of Paddy Upton as head coach of the underdog Indian Premier League franchise , the Rajasthan Royals , raised a few eyebrows in coaching circles , and Walter 's recent appointment as successor to Matthew Maynard at Centurion was more evidence that the coaching world may be changing . Walter holds a level three coaching certificate and will be completing the elite level-four course in August . His respect for " traditional " methods is complete . He also says things are changing . <p> " Technique has been blamed for too many things over the years . Of course it is important , but the way a player thinks affects his technique , too . A batsman walks to the crease at 30-3 and thinks ' I must not get out , I must not get out . ' That is bound to affect his technique . So he nicks it to slip and it 's 40-4 . <p> " The coach then throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Problem solved . Except when 30-3 comes around again and he starts the same thought process which got him into trouble the first time . This scenario has been known about for many , many years . The challenge is how to tackle it and overcome it ; that 's what excites me , " Walter says . <p> No difference to preparations Prone to understatement and , like Kirsten , firmly of the belief that coaches should stay " out of the limelight " , when Walter describes the squad 's mood in England as " pretty good " then followers should have few concerns . More worrying would be " great " or especially " perfect " . Like all the best coaches , Walter believes that perfection exists only in the pursuit , never reality . It can always be better . <p> The format of the Champions Trophy is a good coach 's dream . Every match is vital . Victory or defeat against India in Thursday 's opening match will make no difference to preparations for the second match against Pakistan on Monday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us in the background are no different , " says Walters . <p> So what will happen when the invisible colossus and the visible one , Kirsten , are no longer there ? The players are in no doubt about the size of the double whammy when they leave . <p> " Gazza will be a huge loss , but nobody is bigger than the game or the team . They will move on , our places will be taken by good people and the team will prosper . There are far too many brilliant cricketers in this team to be affected by the change of any coaching staff . " <p> The value of the five days the team spent with explorer Mike Horn in Switzerland before last year 's tour of England was hard to understand for anyone not involved . The players said it played a role in winning the series and climbing to the top of the Test rankings . It was valuable enough to persuade Kirsten that a scaled-down version was worthwhile before this three-week tournament . <p> " The enormity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do .

When he tells the players the stories , it makes it a little less easy to complain about the pitches we 're playing on , " says ultra-marathoner Walter with a charismatic , sardonic smile . <p> There are " issues " ahead for the team in the next few weeks . Play an extra batsman and ask JP Duminy to bowl the majority of the fifth bowler 's 10 overs ? Keep faith in Colin Ingram at number three ? Is Rory Kleinveldt good enough to bowl at the death ? Will the world media 's macabre fascination with Protea " chokes " affect the players ? <p> At least they know they are unlikely to lie , poisoned , on the floor of the Amazon jungle for four days waiting to die .

Now that these leading indicators have emerged , we see capital in various forms starts to chase these opportunities . <p> I see the next decade being defined by ' fixing the big problems ' now that we have the basic tools to do so . Given this view , the potential is enormous for entrepreneurs and investors who can collectively leverage technology to address the key problems faced by a historically underserviced market of one billion plus people .

If , for example , we fail to solve the electricity challenges , there will be a limit on the addressable market for products and service if devices ca n't be recharged reliably and cost-effectively . <p> Second , there is a real talent gap for this industry and if we 're not able to solve how to develop the necessary skills quickly enough , we again risk limiting the potential of the businesses being invested in .

Very few countries , companies and institutions have women at the helm . It 's certainly not a challenge unique to Africa or to the continent 's tech industry . Depending how one defines it , the ' tech industry ' is relatively young and we do n't have a lot of hard facts on the composition of the leadership teams especially in private companies .

Since the tech industry is in its infancy in Africa , the rules can be redrawn both by women and by institutions . Women who are interested in exploring a career in tech should strive to seek out any opportunity to learn , gain experience and contribute . I 'd encourage everyone keen on shaping our continent 's future to focus more on what they can contribute individually and collectively than on perceived status quo such as imbalance of men and women .

There are so many talents here in Nigeria that do not know how to access fund to get their idea off the ground . Though there are so many micro finance banks that claim to be giving money to start ups , they only fund companies that are already growing . They hardly fund tech companies because most of these banks ' officials see investment in start up tech companies as too risky . I was a victim of this in a business plan competition few years ago .

@@362238 <h> Barack Obama 's six deadly sins <p> APPresident Barack Obama with members of the US national security team , receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House . Since being sworn in as president , Obama has changed his tune in numerous ways , and in some respects has gone beyond his predecessors follies , says the writer . Picture : AP <p> The most powerful man in the world , Barack Obama , is visiting South Africa , and a controversy has erupted at the University of Johannesburg following the decision to award him an honorary doctorate . Students , trade unions and Muslim groups have voiced their protest . <p> It is important , under these circumstances , to present a solid case for the prosecution , acting as a Counsel for Damnation in " trying " the first black president of the US for six " crimes " of omission and commission . <p> The first crime for which Obama will be tried is rank hypocrisy . Two years before becoming president in 2008 , in his book The Audacity of Hope , he sought to educate Americans about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy " in Latin America and the Caribbean ; its proxy wars that propped up corrupt autocrats throughout the Third World ; and its " extraordinary rendition " of terror suspects to countries in which they could be tortured . <p> As he noted : " Manifest destiny also meant bloody and violent conquest -- of Native American tribes forcibly removed from their lands and of the Mexican army defending its territory . <p> " It was a conquest that , like slavery , contradicted America 's founding principles and tended to be justified in explicitly racist terms , a conquest that American mythology has always had difficulty fully absorbing but that other countries recognised for what it was -- an exercise in raw power . " <p> Before becoming president , Obama also condemned the truculent George W Bush 's invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a " dumb war " . At the time , Obama showed a clear understanding of the need to address the root causes of poverty that allow terrorists to find fertile ground for recruiting followers . <p> Under his leadership , Obama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " slogan which marked Bush 's crusading militancy . For a while , Obama seemed to have restored his country 's reputation across the globe . <p> Some of Obama 's foreign policy actions have , however , now come to resemble his predecessor 's homicidal belligerence . Obama 's first military action as president , within days of taking office , was to sanction two missile strikes against Pakistan which killed 22 people , including women and children . <p> Three more US missile strikes a month later , in February 2009 , killed another 55 people . <p> In his first three years in office , Obama ordered targeted assassinations of suspected terrorists through an average of one drone strike every four days , compared to Bush 's average of one strike every 40 days . <p> While Bush ordered about 50 drone strikes in eight years , Obama has ordered 375 strikes in four-and-a-half . <p> These actions have mostly been conducted in the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan , and by last month they had killed an estimated 3 500 people , including hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalities . <p> In September 2009 , Obama also ordered the assassination in Somalia by US commandos of the alleged ringleader of an al-Qaeda cell in Kenya . As a result of these actions , critics have noted that Obama has come to represent " Bush with a smile " . <p> The second " crime " for which Obama should be charged is for continuing Bush 's militarisation of US engagement with Africa . <p> " Extraordinary rendition " of suspected terrorists abroad has continued ; 1 500 American soldiers remain in Djibouti to track terrorists , while officials of America 's Germany-based Africa Command ( Africom ) have continued to swarm around the continent in search of enemies . Africom now spends $300 million ( R3.03 billion ) a year on 100 training programmes and exercises in 35 African countries . <p> The Pentagon is using the command to intervene on the continent to fight terrorism , and in the case of the Libyan intervention to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 , to promote " regime change " . <p> Africa should be wary of a self-appointed American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate " mad mullahs " . <p> The Obama administration has also dispatched drones to Somalia and Mali . With a continuing focus on a militarised US policy , Obama drastically cut Aids funding to Africa by $200m last year . <p> The third charge against Obama is condoning and coddling autocrats despite his pledge during a July 2009 speech in Accra to promote " strong institutions , not strong men " . <p> A month earlier , Obama delivered a speech in Cairo in which he spoke out forcefully for democratic values in Islamic countries , but then diluted his message by arguing that " each nation gives life to this principle in its own way " . <p> He thus appeared to support autocratic stability over democratic freedom , and as Lebanese-American intellectual Fouad Ajami observed : " The Arab liberals were quick to read Barack Obama , and they gave up on him . They saw his comfort with the autocracies , his eagerness to ' engage ' and conciliate the dictators . " <p> The Obama administration continued to provide Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year mummified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance provided to all 48 sub-Saharan African countries combined . <p> Clearly fearing the uncertainty of a possible Islamist takeover in Cairo , Obama spoke out of both sides of his mouth during the 2011 " Afro-Arab Spring " until it became clear that the political wind was blowing the way of the protesters . <p> Just before Tunisia 's 23-year autocracy of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011 , Obama 's administration had approved $12m in military aid to the regime . <p> Not wanting America to be caught on the wrong side of history again , Obama belatedly threw in his lot with the Egyptian people . But despite his lofty rhetoric following Mubarak 's ousting , this was an unedifying spectacle . <p> Autocratic regimes in oil-rich Gabon and Equatorial Guinea also remain staunch US clients . <p> The fourth " crime " for which Obama must be charged is turning a celebration of peace -- his Nobel Peace Prize speech in Oslo in December 2009 -- into a justification for war . Obama was controversially made a Nobel laureate after only nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of two inherited American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , with the ennobled president explaining why it was " necessary " to use force to bring about peace . <p> Sanctimoniously employing the concept of " just wars " to explain why he could not be guided by fellow Nobel laureate and civil rights leader Martin Luther King 's example alone , he noted that non-violence could not have halted tyrants such as Adolf Hitler . <p> In stark contrast to his earlier recognition of the historical imperial actions of the US , Obama glorified his country for having " helped underwrite global security for more than six decades " . <p> He went on , rather inappropriately in the context of a Nobel peace speech , to criticise Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions , while reserving his own country 's right to act unilaterally , thus echoing Bush 's doctrine of the " pre-emptive " use of force . <p> The fifth " crime " for which Obama should be prosecuted is peddling negative stereotypes about his ancestral home , with his father having been a Kenyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks about Africa in broad-brushed , Afro-pessimistic strokes : " There are times when considering the plight of Africa -- the millions racked by Aids , the constant droughts and famines , the dictatorships , the pervasive corruption , the brutality of 12-year-old guerrillas who know nothing but war wielding machetes or AK-47s -- I find myself plunged into cynicism and despair . " <p> The African references in Obama 's Nobel speech in 2009 perpetuated similar stereotypes , with the Kenyan-Kansan referring to Somalia as a " failed state " of terrorism , piracy and famine , as well as talking of genocide in Darfur , rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and repression in Zimbabwe . <p> The sixth " crime " for which Obama must be charged is historical ignorance and lavishing praise on an anti-African racist . <p> In his 2009 Nobel speech , Obama controversially referred to Albert Schweitzer ( who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 ) as among the " giants of history " , placing him alongside previous peace laureates such as Martin Luther King , Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schweitzer was a French-German doctor who set up a mission hospital in Gabon in 1913 to help the local population cure diseases and convert African " pagans " to Christianity . <p> He worked tirelessly in Gabon -- with some spells in Europe -- until his death in 1965 . Schweitzer , however , is widely viewed as a racist who frequently referred to black Africans as " primitives " and " savages " . As he put it : <p> " The native moves under patriarchal authority . He does not understand dealing with an office , but dealing with a man . " <p> Schweitzer also despised Islam -- the religion of Obama 's grandfather -- dismissing it as having " never produced any thinking about the world and mankind which penetrated to the depths " . <p> As Kenyan scholar Ali Mazrui - himself , ironically , the Albert Schweitzer Professor at the State University of New York -- noted about the German doctor : " He could be accused of behaving as if the only good African was a sick one . " <p> Despite Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa policy has represented more continuity with , rather than change from , a discredited past . <p> In spite of the pretty poetry heard during the 2008 US presidential campaign by the most cosmopolitan and worldly of the 44 individuals to have occupied the White House , Obama has ruled in pragmatic prose . <p> He is a dyed-in-the-wool politician who has consistently demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice core principles at the altar of political survival . For his six " deadly sins " Obama will surely suffer the curse of Africa 's ancestors . <p> * Adekeye Adebajo is executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution , Cape Town , and author of The Curse of Berlin : Africa After the Cold War . <p> ** The opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of Independent Newspapers <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@362240 <h> NEWS &amp; ANALYSIS <h> The " real " matric pass rate ? <p> James Myburgh <p> 30 June 2013 <p> How the provinces really perform if you control for the culling of weaker pupils <p> South Africa is a country with a notoriously dysfunctional school system . Up until quite recently however the sole criterion for publicly evaluating the success of government 's educational policies was the annual matric pass rate . There has thus been an ever-pressing temptation for ministers of education at national and provincial level , and the officials and principals under them , to try and manipulate the results in an effort to secure increasing pass rates . <p> One of the ways this has traditionally been done is for schools to " cull " their weaker pupils before they reach matric , thereby inflating the pass rate . In a January 2012 paper Dr Stephen Taylor noted that one way one could control for this tendency - in evaluating trends in the matric pass rate - is by dividing the numbers of pupils passing matric in a given year by the number of Grade 10 pupils two years previously ( see here - PDF ) . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured , not against the number of Grade 12 pupils who wrote the exam , but rather against the number of pupils in Grade 10 two years previously ( before a whole lot of them dropped out the system ) ? <p> This is not , Taylor notes , a perfect measure as there are high levels of grade repetition in Grade 10 , compared to earlier grades , " which causes a bulging of grade 10 enrolments . " It is the trend then which is important , rather than the absolute figure . <p> What emerges then when one applies this form of measurement to the 2012 matric results ? <p> The matric pass rate last year increased to 73.9% from 70.2% in 2011 ( see Table 1 ) . The ratio of successful government matriculants to Grade 10s in public schooling ( two years prior ) was 37.5% - up from 35.2% the year before ( see Table 2 ) . Thus the trend of an increasing matric pass rate holds , even if one uses 2010 Grade 10s , rather than just those who ultimately wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 1 : Trends in the matric pass rate nationally and by province ( 2008 to 2012 ) <p> 2008 <p> 2009 <p> 2010 <p> 2011 <p> 2012 <p> EASTERN CAPE <p> 50.6% <p> 51.0% <p> 58.3% <p> 58.1% <p> 61.6% <p> FREE STATE <p> 71.6% <p> 69.4% <p> 70.7% <p> 75.7% <p> 81.1% <p> GAUTENG <p> 76.3% <p> 71.8% <p> 78.6% <p> 81.1% <p> 83.9% <p> KWAZULU-NATAL <p> 57.2% <p> 61.1% <p> 70.7% <p> 68.1% <p> 73.1% <p> LIMPOPO <p> 54.7% <p> 48.9% <p> 57.9% <p> 63.9% <p> 66.9% <p> MPUMALANGA <p> 51.7% <p> 47.9% <p> 56.8% <p> 64.8% <p> 70.0% <p> NORTH WEST <p> 67.9% <p> 67.5% <p> 75.7% <p> 77.8% <p> 79.5% <p> NORTHERN CAPE <p> 72.7% <p> 61.3% <p> 72.3% <p> 68.8% <p> 74.6% <p> WESTERN CAPE <p> 78.7% <p> 75.7% <p> 76.8% <p> 82.9% <p> 82.8% <p> NATIONAL <p> 62.2% <p> 60.6% <p> 67.8% <p> 70.2% <p> 73.9% <p> Table 2 : Ratio of matric passes over Grade 10 enrolments ( two years prior ) by province and year <p> 2008 <p> 2009 <p> 2010 <p> 2011 <p> 2012 <p> EASTERN CAPE <p> 20.4% <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 32.1% <p> 29.0% <p> 29.0% <p> 31.3% <p> 32.3% <p> GAUTENG <p> 43.9% <p> 42.2% <p> 44.5% <p> 46.6% <p> 46.8% <p> KWAZULU-NATAL <p> 35.4% <p> 34.4% <p> 39.1% <p> 38.5% <p> 41.3% <p> LIMPOPO <p> 27.2% <p> 22.5% <p> 30.1% <p> 27.9% <p> 30.7% <p> MPUMALANGA <p> 28.3% <p> 26.8% <p> 32.6% <p> 35.2% <p> 37.8% <p> NORTH WEST <p> 32.1% <p> 28.5% <p> 30.3% <p> 29.3% <p> 34.1% <p> NORTHERN CAPE <p> 31.1% <p> 26.3% <p> 33.9% <p> 32.9% <p> 32.4% <p> WESTERN CAPE <p> 39.9% <p> 38.3% <p> 44.2% <p> 48.6% <p> 52.5% <p> NATIONAL <p> 32.4% <p> 30.8% <p> 34.8% <p> 35.2% <p> 37.5% <p> The more interesting comparison is between the provinces .

@@364235 <h> PARTY <h> Why I 'm joining the EFF - Kenny Kunene <p> Businessman says he taking up the plight of the poor and putting the life of sushi and his army of women behind <p> To all economic freedom fighters and the world , here 's an announcement : <p> As most people know , I recently wrote a letter to President Jacob Zuma discussing some of my concerns about what the ANC has become under his leadership . At the end of that letter , I asked a question , once a famous challenge by Vladimir Lenin : " What is to be done ? " <p> I later did an interview on Kaya FM to clarify some of the points in the letter and also raised other issues , among them that ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is known to speak privately about how he considers the election of Zuma a mistake and that his actions are harming the organisation . <p> Gwede went on Kaya the same day to deny it and instead of discussing my concerns , he discussed me and told South Africa all about my many perceived failings - but nothing he said was news to anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and been even more open about . The fact is that personally attacking the people who criticise you ca n't make the criticisms they may have about you disappear . <p> Many open letters were also , in return , written to me . Most of them chose the route of insulting me , but about my complaints there remains a deafening silence . <p> The ANC itself responded , though they attempted to make it sound like a general statement instead of responding to me directly . Their response did n't deal with any of the issues and just made it worse when you consider they wrote about the unauthorised landing of a " helicopter " at Waterkloof , when surely everyone knows by now it was a passenger plane from India . <p> I raised the concern that the report into spending at Nkandla will be covered up or made classified , and recent developments would indicate I was right to be concerned . <p> I later was told by Sunday World that I 'm being investigated for fraud . It 's about a letter that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real merit to any of it . The Financial Services Board and the JSE already cleared the company concerned . So , as I was expecting , this is just the first step in the salvo of state-led attempts to threaten , scare and intimidate me . Of course , this has done the most to actually back up my concerns that the ANC under Zuma rules by fear now . <p> We all know how tough life becomes once you dare to cross this government . Just as Frank Chicane , Vusi Pikoli , Gerrie Nel and Glynnis Breytenbach . Your reputation and your livelihood is constantly on the line . <p> So I know to expect the worst . I 've learnt from people like these what happens when you get charged . But how long are we going to continue allowing these people to scare us . I got so many calls from people warning me : " They are going to deal with you . " People know this is a government that " deals with people " . But is that something we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , the question of what is to be done remains as pertinent as ever . <p> So I have applied my mind to this question and have taken the decision to be part of a collective working hard and tirelessly to give birth to the Economic Freedom Fighters movement in order to not only take on the challenges facing the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable but to show the ANC that it 's not just me who feels the way I do . Millions of others do too , and their votes will make that much clearer than anything I could write in a letter . <p> I am like Paul , who used to be Saul , but saw the light on his way to Damascus . The life of sushi and my army of women I put behind me . I see this as a challenge and a blessing that God has given me to have so many followers to make sure I contribute to the development of young people . <p> I am now going full-time into politics as a member and a revolutionary cadre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reckoned with and to contest the next election . Why this movement ? The answer is that the majority of people I have interacted with are telling me we need an alternative voice in this country that will be revolutionary . <p> The formation of the Economic Freedom Fighters movement is therefore not the decision of Julius Malema , Floyd Shivambu or Kenny Kunene . It is the better , alternative voice of South Africans who are fed up with living without hope that things will ever change for the better . <p> I therefore invite all South Africans who are tired of being lied to , manipulated and treated with arrogance to join the only revolutionary party in this country .

@@443238 been urged to investigate a New York hedge fund for sanctions-busting after it funded a $100-million loan that allegedly helped Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe to steal the 2008 elections . <p> The Mail &amp; Guardian revealed last year that Och-Ziff Capital Management Group , one of the world 's largest asset managers , was the mystery investor whose purchase of $150-million of stock in a controversial mining firm enabled the latter to throw Mugabe 's regime a $100-million ( about R1-billion now ) lifeline in return for platinum mining rights . <p> Contrary to listing rules , Och-Ziff 's stock purchase was not disclosed at the time . The loan allegedly made it possible for Zimbabwe 's functionally bankrupt regime to embark on a campaign of mass intimidation and vote-buying ahead of the 2008 presidential run-off , leading frontrunner Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw , handing the election to Mugabe . <p> Now a British nongovernmental organisation working on human rights in business has built on the M&amp;G expos ? , showing that Och-Ziff may have broken US sanctions by making the transfer . It has called on the US treasury , which monitors the sanctions , to investigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 , prohibiting transactions with Mugabe and others it accused of " undermining democratic processes or institutions " . These were extended in 2008 , not long after the elections , to bar transactions with any senior government official and many others allegedly responsible for human rights violations . <p> The NGO , Rights and Accountability in Development ( Raid ) , said in a report last week that " there is evidence that finance originating from Och-Ziff went to the government of Zimbabwe ; and that the government of Zimbabwe is synonymous with the Mugabe/Zanu-PF regime - comprising sanctions targets - who used the finance to undermine democracy , commit human rights abuses and retain power for their own benefit " . <p> The report held that " specifically designated nationals " ( SDNs ) named in the US sanctions were " directly implicated in the planning and orchestration " of Operation Makavhoterapapi , the intimidation campaign in 2008 . <p> And " not only did SDNs benefit from the loan , but certain designated entities were parties " to the platinum rights transaction for which Och-Ziff 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been crucial in this respect . The state-owned Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation , which was central to the transaction , was designated on July 25 2008 , only three months after Och-Ziff 's stock purchase . <p> Raid said it had written to the US treasury to ask that it investigate whether US sanctions were broken , and to Och-Ziff to clarify questions including the nature of the due diligence it had done before the transaction ; the purpose and timing of its investment ; and " the extent to which it knew , or should have known , that it was providing funds whose ultimate beneficiary was the Mugabe regime and SDNs " . <p> Och-Ziff has maintained that it was no more than a passive investor , implicitly pointing fingers at the Central African Mining and Exploration Company ( Camec ) , the London-listed firm in which it invested and which in turn provided the loan to the regime as part payment for platinum rights . <p> This week a spokesperson said : " Och-Ziff has no connection to Zimbabwe politics whatsoever and made no loan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in a private placement of shares in a London-listed public company Camec , and as a passive investor had no role in the direction of the company .

Still on the elections token , its dawn for RSA 2014 elections , it is unarguable that the global audience will direct its interest to this African state which is symbolic in the African continent in relation to its economy and cutting edge constitution . <p> In this lively African political arena , the interest is always about who will " win " not who will " lead " failure to separate between winning and leading is tragic , what we are not aware of is winners enter competitions to win something they will enrich themselves with whilst leaders are concerned about discharging the responsibilities delegated to them as well as meeting the set objectives . The biasness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of cardinal organs such as youth . <p> It is akin to a norm for governments in African countries to publish reports centred on youth unemployment , statistics relating to economic growth or downturn , etcetera , according to my own surveillance , African countries that dare publish reports relating to their successes in terms of youth development amounts to negative zero , I understand that Mathematicians contend that zero is neutral , neither positive nor negative , however I will override that principle in order to convey my deepest disappointment in African countries , but then in the end who is to be blamed for this youth alienation , youth or leaders ? It is understandable as to why mature African leaders in the mature African leaders club ( African parliaments ) show such low levels of energy as far as youth development is concerned , youth themselves are rivalries to their own youth , youth in Africa are misdirected souls who fail to refine their own dreams , contain themselves and plan their own prosperity , it is clear that no one has time look after astray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tried , it 's tested and proven that African youth are economic slaves and they seem to be appreciating every bit of it , African youth are not economically liberated and are inclined to seeking survival and career jobs as opposed to becoming the producers of those jobs , this has been said repeatedly and has even become boring . An average number of 6 out 10 young people foreknow being employed as a way of nurturing one 's career , being out of the poverty line whilst others foresee it as a way of living that lavish lifestyle they always visioned , one should be aware that when you go work for someone , you are that someone 's slave and they minute they decide to cut you off your job or decide not to recruit you , you become their little economic slave , nonetheless , youth is still inclined on drafting resumes against business plans .

Youth are eager to receive a quick buck without much effort , their businesses miscarry in the first financial year simply because instead of exhibiting their products to the entire public , they choose to go after tenders that they absolutely have no experience in the services they are required to provide , once the state decides not to contract them , their business appetite evaporates , then the blame game tiptoes in ; " The government is not doing much to support emerging entrepreneurs " coming to think of it , would have it been economical if the government inflated millions of taxpayers money on an inexperienced youth owned company to bring us inferior services ?

I consequently loose respect for such youth whom I always assumed they would represent our interest and ensure that our interests are included in decision making processes but rather choose to engage in unsolicited , unruly and cheap politics band . There are so many stories that can be shared about youth in politics of which the stories in question makes one 's hair stand on end such that their role in politics I choose to say its spongy . <p> AFRICAN YOUTH AND THE TEMPTATIONS <p> Temptations are inevitable to all of us but us as youth ; we entice fate of temptations from where it 's fixed .

@@481233 <p> South Africa 's latest 24-hour news channel , ANN7 , has provided a lot of ammunition for the internet the last couple of weeks . Its launch was nothing short of disastrous with teleprompter and anchor malfunctions aplenty , rendering the brand the laughing-stock of the greater internet community . Its attempt at damage control did n't help and has further weakened any chance it had at redemption . With the intention at a good-natured article , I think there is plenty for startups to learn from this back-firing launch of a young brand ( read : company ) . Let 's take a look at what we can learn " on ANN7 tonight " . <p> There 's no such thing as the perfect launch ... <p> ... but it ca n't be a complete f-up . You 'll hear a lot of advocates that say it 's important to be first to market , rather than perfect your product/service and miss the boat . But there is a fine line between being first to market and screwing up your launch holistically . This is especially true if you have played the media game well and have a lot of hype around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , had high-profile South African ties which gave it a level of exposure most new projects might not have garnered . Good for the channel , it leveraged those connections with the Gupta family and President Zuma 's son to get people to take notice before it even launched . As you drive into Cape Town , for instance , a giant billboard greets you with the lead image of this article ... but it 's all for nothing once you fail that first impression . <p> Preparation and keeping it simple <p> Similarly , you need to test your product or practice your service to gauge functionality , and what its strengths and weaknesses are . It 's that old holy grail -- the minimum viable product ( MVP ) . While I 'm an advocate that not every startup suits or needs a MVP , ANN7 certainly could have used some feedback from a smaller group before going live with the entire channel . Rather do something simple , and well , than take on too much too early . Google did n't start out with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All it was at the start was a simple search engine , and a good one at that . In the same light , ANN7 should not have started a 24-hour channel before knowing it could pull off at least one segment without a hitch . Start simple , and expand from there . Tying in to this is investor pressure . You do n't want it so early on ( incubator and accelerator startups aside ) and I would suggest bootstrapping until you reach that MVP . As news anchor Chantal Rutter Dros confirmed on Twitter , ANN7 launched without being fully prepared because of contractual obligations ( read : investor pressure ) . <p> This is a biggie . First impressions matter . Can you unsee those awkward glances or the misreads on ANN7 's early broadcasts ? Every point of contact a potential customer/client has with your brand can help or hurt your company . Consider that ANN7 is compared more with a comedy channel , undermining the very image it was trying to cultivate as a cutting-edge newsbroadcaster in Africa . ANN7 can not undo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer in its control thanks to the nature of the internet . You , as a company , want to control the way your image is perceived and interacted with as much as possible , particularly in the early days when reputation is all you have . Micromanage that , seriously . The internet is an unforgiving critic and once unleashed it is untameable . ANN7 's attempt at damage control is futile , and actually further hurts its reputation . Do n't let it get to that point . <p> The right team , and the importance of teamwork <p> There is a disconnect on ANN7 . For example between the person working the teleprompter and the anchor , and even between the co-anchors themselves . You want to get the best team you can get , clearly ANN7 's presenters are not the best available in South Africa -- the Daily Maverick has it on good authority that they are actually mostly models . Stronger teamwork and communication though , could have alleviated their inexperience and seen them operate at a somewhat more professional level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right positions . In a startup , roles are often amalgamated because its more likely than not made up of a small team , but allowing people to play to their strengths will get you better results on all fronts . <p> Failure . Own it or quit . <p> ANN7 should not have tried to take down its bloopers from YouTube . By not accepting its faults and failure it is further tarnishing not only the brand , but those tied to it . As an entrepreneur who is perhaps launching your first startup you need to consider your personal brand . That is the brand that will transcend that first company , and the brand that will get you more ( or less ) business than any other . If you fail , learn from it and own it , perhaps even work it into your future pitches , you 'll be surprised at the respect you might get . Trying to hide and cover up a failure can only aggravate the situation , especially in the early aftermath . You are not defined by failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bio <p> Ronan Steyn has a love for all things technology , with a particular focus on startups , gadgets and games .

A lot of work that government does is n't considered newsworthy and government press releases are often rejected because they are labelled as propaganda . " <p> This situation may have pushed the government into a corner , but it has also opened a door for the rich and powerful Gupta family , who saw a business opportunity in the media sector , he said . <p> Rigid editorial policies " It 's not a government strategy but an entrepreneur the Gupta family who sees this big client the government and hopes he can appeal to the reasonableness of this frustrated client who has Cabinet briefings , government cluster briefings and departmental briefings , but none of that is covered in mainstream media , " said Manyi . <p> " The entrepreneur thinks he can flesh out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's exploiting it .

The difference is our own citizens are tired of crime and tired of people talking about negative things . <p> The SABC 's new 24-hour satellite news channel has received mixed reviews , but Motsoeneng said he had specified that he needed more positive stories , and these news stories were now flowing in . <p> " I need to find a way for all people to believe in what I am saying .

I hear what you are saying about a story on Nkandla . If there is an investigation going into the matter , I do n't think we should follow the hullabaloo , but rather wait until that investigation is finalised . <p> " We can highlight that the public protector might be investigating , but we ca n't come to a conclusion before the report is concluded .

@@485234 <p> Union federation Cosatu goes into this weekend 's tripartite alliance economic summit with the ANC and the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) perhaps the most divided it 's ever been in its nearly 28 years of existence . <p> The aim of the summit , which takes place in Centurion outside Pretoria , is for leaders to thrash out differences over economic policy . <p> Those supportive of suspended Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi are pushing for a hardline approach to the National Development Plan -- the government 's long-term strategy to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030 -- whereas those aligned to federation president Sdumo Dlamini prefer a softer and more inclusive approach . <p> This summit could also signal whether Cosatu will be supporting the ANC in next year 's general elections as a united or a fractured force . <p> The Food and Allied Workers Union , the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Municipal Workers Union ( Samwu ) , Cosatu affiliate unions which support Vavi , say the development plan was at odds with the alliance 's perspective on the need for a radical economic shift . <p> Unions calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Union of Mineworkers , teachers ' union Sadtu , transport union Satawu , and public service union Nehawu . <p> Bureaucracy <p> The Food and Allied Workers Union general secretary Katishi Masemola blasted the plan as a " product of bureaucracy in government " and said it was drawn up by an unelected committee of " 20 hand-picked individuals constituting the national planning commission " . <p> " A unilateral government implementation on such a significant blue-print that will affect children 's futures and the coming generation can not be left to the wisdom of a few people to determine , " said Masemola , quoting his union 's national executive committee resolution on the plan . <p> " Even more critical , the ANC can not be unilateral in adopting ... the National Development Plan and imposing it on society without taking strategic allies , and certainly Cosatu , into confidence . " <p> Following its central executive committee , which rejected Vavi 's suspension and called for a special congress to resolve Cosatu 's internal issues , Samwu called for the redrafting and fundamental overhaul of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects they say are in conflict with alliance policies and the Freedom Charter . <p> Cosatu 's acting general secretary , Bheki Ntshalintshali , acknowledged that the federation was deeply divided but denied the suspension of Vavi would have an adverse effect on the negotiations at the summit . <p> " I do n't believe that the ' GS ' would be speaking in his own voice if he was still here , " said Ntshalintshali . <p> Many voices <p> " There will be many voices at the summit representing Cosatu . To be heard you need many voices . No individual can win the debates in the alliance . " <p> However , senior alliance leaders told the Mail &amp; Guardian that partners whose aim was to " smash " the National Development Plan were likely to face hostility from supporters of the plan at the ANC-led summit , which starts on August 30 . <p> Although the majority of unions affiliated to federation Cosatu are divided about the National Development Plan , the ANC and the SACP appear to be committed to the policy . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussions that would put alliance partners on the same page . <p> The summit was postponed last month amid reports that a dispute over the plan led to the collapse of the meeting .

Cosatu 's senior leaders said it would be a " fundamental error " to push ahead with the plan 's implementation when such flaws had been exposed . 
@@485235 <p> There is concern in the higher education sector about the Higher Education and Training ( HET ) Laws Amendment Act 2012 . A recent discussion of the Act on the Forum@8 programme on SAfm on July 24 attracted a large number of callers . The minister of higher education and training , Blade Nzimande , gave the impression throughout the programme that there is no problem with the legislation and accused vice-chancellors and other critics of lying when they claimed there had been inadequate consultation . <p> The HET Laws Amendment Act 2012 introduces into the Higher Education Act provision for a new type of national institute . It extends both the powers of the minister to intervene at a university in crisis and the grounds on which the minister must act . It allows the minister to appoint an assessor to investigate a university that is showing symptoms of an approaching crisis . The independent assessor has the power to summon personal testimony or documentation , or to exclude observers from attending any meeting he/she might call to investigate and interrogate such evidence . <p> We are writing to set down just a few of the more salient points that worry many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the process that was followed to bring it into law without an appropriate period of consultation with the higher education sector . <p> Different <p> It is important to understand that this legislation started out in a very different form from the Act that was finally signed into law by President Jacob Zuma . The Bill , as published for comment in March 2012 , was about enabling the minister to establish one or more national institutes with specific scopes of application , and a technical change to the National Qualifications Framework Act . It said nothing about suspending councils or vice-chancellors . Higher Education South Africa ( Hesa ) , which comprises the vice-chancellors of all public tertiary institutions in South Africa , was consulted on this draft Bill in good time . <p> That Bill went before the portfolio committee in September 2012 . At the meetings of the portfolio committee that month , while comments were being presented , the minister -- without any consultation with the sector -- introduced for the first time new amendments beyond the initial scope of the Bill . These amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they extended the powers of the minister to intervene and the grounds on which to do so . <p> The portfolio committee gave interested parties only two weeks to comment on these new amendments . This was clearly inadequate , given the nature of the amendments and their far-reaching implications for higher education institutions . The Council on Higher Education , Hesa and others sought an extension for further consultation on the proposed changes . They appeared before the portfolio committee in early October to argue for this , and to argue about the substance of the new amendments and drafting problems in the new Bill . <p> However , the minister persisted and both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces passed the measure -- with further amendments that , in our view , aggravated the position -- in quick succession , paving the way for it to be passed into law in December 2012 . <p> Limited <p> So although it is true , as Nzimande claims , that Hesa was consulted on the early version of the Bill , there was no prior consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them once the new Bill was tabled . The Council on Higher Education , in its October submission to the portfolio committee , pleaded for an opportunity to study the proposals and advise the minister on the merits and implications of these changes . <p> It is not that we disagree with every facet of the new Act , or the spirit of most of the amendments . We agree that the minster has a responsibility to intervene if there is serious failure in public universities ; that the minister needs the power to enforce interventions on universities in distress ; and that crises such as serious financial mismanagement or corrupt governance can do serious , sometimes irreparable , damage to a university , requiring expensive government bail-outs and setting back higher education in the country . <p> So we can accept that the law needed more clarity on procedures in relation to independent assessors and administrators . However , we disagree with the minister on numerous points introduced by the Act that , in our view , contravene the constitutional rights of universities and those who manage them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister 's independent assessor to impose a blanket embargo on any documents , records or evidence disclosed to the assessor . This constitutes a violation of the right of those affected by the investigation to answer allegations . As such it also compromises the integrity of the assessor 's proceedings . <p> Unwarranted <p> Section 49A ( 1 ) gives the minister unwarranted powers to suspend a university council or its vice-chancellor , even when that university has no evidence of being in distress . It allows the minister , in effect , to decide who should be admitted to or employed by the university , and which staff members should be promoted if he/she is of the opinion the university is not doing this equitably . This would result in a direct violation of the institution 's academic freedom and autonomy , whereas the checks on unfair or illegal practices by a university are already adequately available in other legislation such as the chapter 9 institutions and the equality court . <p> We do n't believe Nzimande has ill intentions in creating such wide powers . In part these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been corrected during a proper consultation process . However , if these clauses are left unchanged they open the possibility for abuse of power by a less benign future minister . Fortunately , the minister , university vice-chancellors and chairs of councils have been meeting to discuss a way forward . They have agreed to set up task teams to address the problems with the Act as it now stands . Members of the task teams will be drawn from universities and the department of higher education . In this way we are hopeful that the government and the higher education sector can find common ground , leading the way to better legislation . <p> Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane is the chair of council and Dr Max Price is the vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town .

He comes from the Matabeleland South province and is credited with turning around Zanu-PF 's fortunes in the Matabeleland region , something for which Mugabe is likely to reward him . <p> Lending credence to speculation that Khaya-Moyo may be on his way to higher office are indications that Mugabe has backed the appointment of Jacob Mudenda to become the next speaker of Parliament . <p> Khaya-Moyo held ambitions for the speaker 's post in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MDC ) Lovemore Moyo . By not casting his hat into the speaker race now , Zanu-PF insiders say this indicates that Khaya-Moyo has set his sights on the vice-presidency . <p> Trevor Maisiri , a senior analyst from the International Crisis Group , said Zanu-PF would also want to consolidate its gains made in the two Matabeleland provinces in the elections and would do so by appointing someone from the region . <p> " Khaya-Moyo looks the most likely . He holds the most senior post in the party on the side of former Zapu members . The party would also want to consolidate its political grip and even extend it to the remaining domains held by the MDC , " Maisiri said . <p> If Khaya-Moyo is elevated , it could cause further jostling in the party as Zanu-PF officials line up to take up his post of national chairperson .

Its only local competitor , Safripol , produces about one-third of its output . <p> The tribunal began its second round of hearings in Pretoria this week to decide whether Sasol has been charging too much locally for propylene and polypropylene , chemical components needed for the manufacture of plastic products ranging from garden furniture to plastic bottles and lunch boxes . <p> Sasol produces propylene , a plastics molecule that can be bonded to other molecules to form a polymer , as part of its synthetic fuels process . Propylene is used in the production of polypropylene . <p> The Competition Commission alleges that Sasol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and that Safripol and Sasol have engaged in price fixing to the detriment of local plastic manufacturers . <p> Intensifying efforts to lower input prices The department of trade and industry has been intensifying its efforts to lower input prices to boost local manufacturing . The DTI requested a probe into the polymer sector in 2007 after it became concerned that companies were charging excessively high prices . <p> The Commission found Sasol had exerted its market power to charge domestic consumers prices that bore little relation to the value of its products . <p> In its submission to the tribunal , the commission said the DTI has identified polypropylene conversion as the most important part of its chemicals sector development strategy , which is part of the department 's Industrial Policy Action Plan . <p> Several companies , including Usabco , trading as Addis , SA Leisure and Plastamid , testified that they have struggled to remain competitive because of the high polypropy ? lene price . In Plastamid 's case , its plant eventually closed , resulting in the loss of more than 120 jobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant . <p> Apart from a requested fine of 10% of the company 's South African annual turnover and exports from 2009 , which in Sasol Chemical Industries amounted to about R22-billion , concerns about the negative impact on manufacturing could give weight to a request by the commission for the price of polypropylene to be regulated . <p> Investigation The investigation by Brazil 's Federal Secretary of Foreign Trade , the equivalent of South Africa 's International Trade Administration Commission ( ITAC ) , follows a complaint by the Brazilian-founded petrochemical company , Braskem , that Sasol is dumping polypropylene in that country , making it hard to compete . <p> Brazil is investigating similar charges against India and South Korea . South Africa is estimated to export about 60% of the polypropy ? lene it produces . <p> Another investigation has been launched in Brazil to establish whether Sasol is being unfairly subsidised by the South African government , according to documents in the Mail &amp; Guardian 's possession . <p> But Sasol 's spokesperson , Jacqui O'Sullivan , this week denied that the company concerned , Sasol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period under review , namely April 2011 to March 2012 " . <p> If Brazil decides Sasol has been assisted by subsidy programmes such as the Export Marketing and Investment Assistance Scheme , the Critical Infrastructure Programme , the Support Programme for Indus ? trial Innovation , or the Manufacturing Investment Pro ? gramme , to name just a few listed in the complaint , import duties could be levied on Sasol 's products . <p> Documents also show that regional programmes in Mpumalanga and the Free State , aimed among other things at improving polypropylene beneficiation and coal processing , are also being scrutinised . <p> Probe into the dumping allegations Brazil has already found there is sufficient merit to warrant a formal investigation of the dumping allegations . <p> A trade lawyer Grant Herholdt , director at ENS said : " The formal investigation includes a detailed analysis of both industries in both countries and allows for comment and participation by interested parties .

" <p> Denial Regarding the tribunal investigation , which is expected to be concluded only in October this year , Sasol has denied that it is overcharging local manufacturers . <p> Adriaan Roland Janse van Rens ? burg , general manager of the polyolefins business of Sasol Polymers , said in an affidavit that , although the company is charging import parity prices , it has based this price on a South Korean pricing model , which is at the bottom of the scale compared to other countries , and does not include costs of production . <p> The Competition Commission believes that Sasol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funded by the state to ensure a supply of petroleum products , which continues despite fuel production now having been secured . <p> Advocate Arnold Subel , in his submission for the commission , cited Sasol 's access to the gas pipeline between Mozambique and South Africa as a case in point . <p> Subel , in the first round of hearings in March this year , said that Sasol was charging import parity prices , not because it needed to compete locally with international suppliers but because it 's the " highest possible price that Sasol Chemical Industries was able to , and did , set " . <p> The only other local polypropylene producer is Safripol , which has limited capacity and buys its additional propylene , needed for the manufacture of polypropylene , from Sasol . <p> The commission argues that Sasol 's dominance and its import parity pricing , which , until 2008 , included the 10% duty and was higher than its export price , limited the growth of the plastics manufacturing sector . <p> Strong performance Sasol has continued to show a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up from R142.4-billion the year before , and earnings are expected to rise 20% to 30% for the 2012-2013 financial year . <p> A witness at the commission , Gavin Gerber , managing director of the Plastamid section of the AECI group , said in an affidavit that high local pricing made impossible the expansion and survival of Plastamid 's division that made talc-filled polypropylene used in motor vehicles for door panels and dashboards . <p> After Sasol and Safripol turned down a request from him in about 2009 to drop prices by about 30% -- the amount manufacturers believe they are being overcharged -- Plastamid 's plant was closed . Polypropylene made up 70% of the cost . <p> Pieter van der Walt , director of operations of SB Plastics , in his submission also said that polypropylene , the core raw material for his goods , was the biggest contributor to costs .

@@511230 <h> Hoffman 's complaint : why it was bound to fail <p> Pierre de Vos <p> Pierre de Vos <p> Pierre De Vos teaches Constitutional law at the University of Cape Town Law Faculty , where he serves as deputy dean and as the Claude Leon Foundation Chair in Constitutional Governance . He writes a regular blog , entitled ' Constitutionally Speaking ' , in which he attempts to mix one part righteous anger , one part cold legal reasoning and one part irreverence to help keep South Africans informed about Constitutional and other legal developments related to the democracy . <p> 11 Sep 2013 10:25 ( South Africa ) <p> The Judicial Conduct Committee this week dismissed a complaint by Adv . Paul Hoffman against Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng stemming largely from a speech the Chief Justice made on judicial transformation . As the compliant was based on shaky legal grounds , this , I contend , was the correct decision to reach . Here is why . <p> My inbox is flooded by emails of people asking for free legal advice . A few of these emails contain heartrending stories of injustice and human rights abuses . Many more contain rambling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights . Judging from the latter kind of emails there are quite a few delusional narcissists out there who keenly believe that they are being persecuted and that the world would come to an end if the persecution is not stopped . <p> It is not always easy to distinguish between the former and the latter kinds of emails . Those who suffered real harm are sometimes inarticulate and unable succinctly to focus on the relevant facts . Those who are merely delusional can sound very convincing . <p> Which brings me to the dismissal of the complaint lodged against Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng by the Institute for Accountability 's Paul Hoffman . Allegations of misconduct by the Chief Justice will alarm many people -- especially given the controversial manner leading to the appointment of the Chief Justice . But such allegations can also be spurious , stemming from the unexamined fears and preconceptions of the accuser , and may not be based on plausible legal grounds . <p> It is therefore important to analyse the allegations made by Adv . Hoffman and the manner in which the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to ascertain whether we are dealing here with a serious matter that threatens the independence and integrity of the judiciary or merely with an egotistical but entirely harmless set of allegations properly dismissed by the JCC . <p> The complaint was dealt with in terms of the relevant provisions of the Judicial Service Commission Act . The Act -- amended in 2008 -- now provides for an elaborate mechanism to deal with complaints against judges . At the heart of this mechanism lies the principle that it is always better for judges to be directly involved in determining the merits of such complaints against fellow judges in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of the complaints process . <p> Section 17 of the Act therefore states that whenever the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) receives a complaint against a judge which may , if proven , amount to a serious but non-impeachable transgression by that judge , a member of the Judicial Conduct Committee ( JCC ) must investigate the complaint in order to determine the merits of the complaint . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed of the Chief Justice , who is the Chairperson of the Committee ; the Deputy Chief Justice ; and four judges , at least two of whom must be women . But where a complaint is against the Chief Justice he must recuse himself . Adv . Hoffman 's complaint was duly referred to two members of the JCC -- Judge President HMT Musi and Judge C Pretorius -- who decided the complaint was entirely without merit . A study of the reasons given for this decision suggests ( to me at least ) that the complaint may have had more to do with the personal animus between the Chief Justice and Adv . Hoffman than with high principles regarding the integrity of the judiciary . <p> Section 14(4) of the Judicial Service Commission Act sets out the grounds upon which any complaint against a judge may be lodged . These grounds include , amongst others , incapacity ; gross incompetence ; gross misconduct ; a wilful or grossly negligent breach of the Code of Judicial Conduct ; or any other wilful or grossly negligent conduct that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including any conduct that is prejudicial to the independence , impartiality , dignity , accessibility , efficiency or effectiveness of the courts . <p> The complaints lodged by Adv . Hoffman were dismissed as not implicating any of the grounds listed in section 14(4) . There was therefore no case to answer by the Chief Justice . <p> First , the Chief Justice was found not to have breached the Judicial Code of Ethics which prohibits a judge from engaging in a public debate about a case and from participating in public debate about matters relating to the judicial profession in a manner that would undermine the integrity of the judiciary . <p> This was so , because the " frankly expressed " remarks of the Chief Justice was not on the subject of the merits of a particular case but about judicial transformation , a practical , on-going issue that has been debated for a long time and will continue to be debated by judges and members of the public alike . The Code , it was found , clearly did not prohibit any judge from engaging in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were bound to sit uncomfortably with sections of the legal profession and the judiciary " . <p> This seems to be just about right to me . To hold otherwise would have had an enormously chilling effect on judges and would have made it almost impossible for judges ever to give public speeches on anything but the most anodyne topics . I , for one , would have never made the effort again to organise an annual human rights lecture , knowing full well that the judge I invited would not say anything remotely interesting . <p> Secondly , the argument that the Chief Justice had brought the judiciary into disrepute because he involved himself in the " politics and policy aspects of affirmative action measures in a manner unbecoming to a judge " was similarly dismissed . As the panellists of the JCC pointed out , the matter of judicial transformation is a matter of great public interest . The JSC , headed by the Chief Justice , has been embroiled in controversy about its role in giving effect to judicial transformation and the supposed non-appointment of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel of the JCC , impossible for the Chief Justice to avoid talking about the matter and he was therefore perfectly entitled to participate in the discussions about the transformation of the judiciary and the legal profession . Because this touches on sensitive constitutional issues of race and gender , the debate was bound to have political connotations . <p> It seems to me this finding must be right . The boundary between law and politics can at best be described as a porous one . Almost all legal questions ( well at least the legal questions that I am interested in ) have political connotations . For example , questions about how a company should be managed in terms of the companies act can be profoundly political , implicating one 's view on capitalism , exploitation of workers and a number of other highly politicised issues . <p> Similarly , whether the law should recognise the unequal bargaining power between consumers and companies who they enter into contract with , is a profoundly political question , implicating the economic ideology of the participants . Surely this can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the Constitution in transforming the law of contract ( or the Company Law , for that matter ) to eradicate the inherent injustice in the capitalist , laissez-faire inspired fiction that freedom of contract exists between two inherently unequal parties ? <p> The one aspect of Adv . Hoffman 's complaint that may have appeared plausible , relates to words alleged to have been uttered by the Chief Justice towards Adv . Hoffman in The Hague earlier this year . The alleged words -- " you can continue to challenge me but you will continue to be frustrated " -- if indeed uttered , seemed to have been the result of an ongoing and increasingly acrimonious dispute between the Adv . Hoffman and the Chief Justice . <p> Adv . Hoffman had , according to his own admission , written to the Chief Justice to demand clarity from the Chief Justice on his fitness to hold office . As the panel pointed out , this was a rather startling thing to do . I am not aware of any lawyer ever having done so before in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone is entitled to lodge a complaint against any judge with the JSC -- but engaging a judge -- including the Chief Justice -- in a private correspondence in which one alleges he is unfit for office seems to have displayed a rather startling lack of decorum . <p> As the panel pointed out : " It is indeed shocking to hear that an advocate could write letters to a sitting judge demanding that the judge explains his fitness to hold office . " In any case , in the absence of knowledge of the broader context in which the words were uttered it would be impossible to know what was meant by the words . At the very least there was no indication that the words was meant to refer to cases being heard before the court and not to the various efforts made by Adv . Hoffman to ridicule and humiliate the Chief Justice . <p> In my humble opinion , it might well be that a more astute , unflappable and emotionally generous judge would not have used the words that the Chief Justice was alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the political setting and the obvious contempt in which Adv . Hoffman holds the Chief Justice , it was a strategic blunder on the part of the Chief Justice not to hold his tongue . But I would have been rather surprised if fellow judges of the JCC had found that these words constituted a breach of conduct prohibited by section 14(4) of the JSC Act .

And it goes to the core of the regularity and legality of this tender , " Marcus argued . <p> Judgment was reserved . <h> The case so far <p> Bidders Allpay and Cash Paymaster Service were two of several bidders for the R10-billion tender to administer the country 's social grant system . <p> The winning bidder , in this case Cash Paymaster Service , would be responsible for ensuring that about 15-million indigent South Africans receive their monthly social grants for five years . <p> Cash Paymaster Service was awarded the tender -- a decision Allpay challenged in the North Gauteng High Court in August 2012 , on the basis of alleged irregularities in the tender process . <p> Allpay alleged that Cash Paymaster Service should not have been awarded the tender because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not submit separate provincial bids for all nine provinces , Sassa had not verified its BEE partners ' capacity to perform their obligations . <p> Allpay also claimed the bid evaluation committee had a problematic composition . <p> ' Illegal and invalid ' The company wanted to interdict Sassa from implementing the tender and for the court to review the contract . <p> But Sassa made an application to the Supreme Court of Appeal . At this point , Allpay tried to introduce " new " evidence of corruption -- a recording of a conversation with a whistleblower who was a secretary for the bid committee . The official called the tender process " farcical " and alleged that Hulley was being paid by Cash Paymaster Service to swing the tender in their favour . <p> But the Constitutional Court heard on Tuesday that the whistleblower backtracked slightly , telling Sassa that he did not intend to imply that the process was corrupt , and that he merely meant that " shortcuts " were taken . <p> Cash Paymaster Service also told the court that it did not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " new " evidence , calling it " hearsay " , and it upheld Sassa 's appeal . It found that although the tender had been peppered with irregularities , this was not grounds for it to be cancelled , as these irregularities were " inconsequential " . <p> ' Just another tender case ' This is the ruling that Allpay wants the Constitutional Court to review . <p> Marcus argued on Tuesday that this was " not just another tender case " , as suggested by the appeal court . <p> " The magnitude of the tender aside , the appeal court failed to engage with the substantive requirements of section 217 of the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act PFMA . " <p> He said the irregularities were not inconsequential but go to the " core " of fair tendering and the spending of public funds . He said the appeal court had " closed its eyes " to these issues . <p> Section 217 requires procurement to be " in accordance with a system which is fair , equitable , transparent , competitive and cost-effective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The constitutional issues to be decided by the court , according to Allpay , were threefold : firstly , what types of administrative irregularities might cause a tender to be declared invalid ?

The third constitutional issue was how the courts should deal with evidence of serious irregularity . <p> ' Hearsay ' But Cash Paymaster Service and Sassa said the order should not be reviewed because Cash Paymaster Service remained the rightful winner of the award , and the " hearsay " allegations of corruption could not be introduced during review proceedings . <p> Cilliers added that while the " administrative action " may have been " less than perfect " , this did not constitute sufficient grounds to scrap the entire tender . <p> Both respondents also said there were no constitutional matters for the court to decide . <p> Sassa said Allpay had merely " dressed up " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues fall to be decided on the facts , as was done by the appeal court , " Cilliers said .

@@516235 <h> Why Zuma stood up to the big guys <p> ReutersRussia 's President Vladimir Putin welcomes President Jacob Zuma before the first working session of the G20 Summit in Constantine Palace in Strelna , near St Petersburg , last week . <p> Multilateralism among the Brics countries hides a number of ulterior motives from members big and small , says Peter Fabricius . <p> Pretoria - The Presidency seems very chuffed that Russian President Vladimir Putin singled out President Jacob Zuma for special praise at the G20 summit in St Petersburg last week , as a champion of small nations opposing US-led Western plans to attack Syria militarily . <p> Putin told reporters that Zuma had done a " remarkable thing " at the summit by highlighting the unintended consequences of a unilateral military strike on Syria . Zuma had said small nations felt increasingly vulnerable and unprotected because , " It seems like a more powerful country can use force at any time at its own discretion " . <p> " And he is right , " Putin added . " That is the direction things are going . " <p> Zuma 's spokesman , Mac Maharaj , told City Press that Zuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international institutions " . After that , " everybody felt free from the other countries to take that side " . <p> So , Zuma told Obama , Hollande and the rest where to get off . And inspired a revolt of the smaller countries . Which maybe -- it 's not quite clear if the implication goes that far -- prevented Obama from winning G20 support for his Syrian plans . <p> Well . That 's certainly powerful diplomacy . <p> Forget , for a moment , though , that South Africa was already firmly in the Russian camp before the G20 summit , not only through their joint membership of Brics but also because of what seems to be a growing affinity between the Russian and South African governments and between Zuma and the strongman Putin in particular . <p> Brics -- the Brazil , Russia , India , China , South Africa forum or bloc of emerging nations -- has , as perhaps its primary raison d'etre , a strongly felt need to counterbalance what it perceives as the dominance of the US and its Western allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa decided to join Brics when Russia elevated the grouping to summit level in 2008 and gave it a political profile , as a force to challenge the West . <p> Frustrating an American move to bomb Syria would be a textbook Brics manoeuvre and so it is hard to imagine that the Brics leaders -- who met separately , in St Petersburg , as they do at all G20 summits -- did not caucus Zuma 's intervention . In any case , it should have come as no surprise . <p> Zuma and Putin 's invocation of multilateralism to oppose Obama 's Syrian attack is of course a powerful argument in itself . But it does not take deep insight into diplomacy to observe that a resort to multilateralism often masks national interests . In Russia 's case , as we know , that national interest is that Syria is a strategic ally , providing Moscow , for instance , with its only warm-water military port . <p> It is somewhat ironic that at the first Brics summit in Russia in 2008 , the leaders all duly intoned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of India and Brazil in international affairs , and understand and support their aspirations to play a greater role in the United Nations " . <p> That was an oblique reference to the aspirations of India and Brazil to get permanent seats on an expanded UN Security Council , an aspiration South Africa shares . Similar declarations have been issued at all subsequent Brics summits -- but all couched in the same fuzzy language , because , of course , Russia and China , the two current permanent Security Council members in Brics , have no intention of diluting their power there by admitting any other countries to the charmed circle . <p> So much for multilateralism . <p> For the ANC government , too , multilaterism can be something of a mask . Putin , who is growing increasingly assertive in world affairs , is the world leader the ANC has long been waiting for , to stand up to the US and the West . <p> He also embodies for some , one suspects , nostalgia for the old Soviet Union , which was the ANC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , ironically , cleared its path to power . <p> Presumably the ANC will not follow Putin too far down the road of nostalgia , by imitating the strongarm tactics he uses to maintain complete control at home . <p> * Peter Fabricius is foreign editor of Independent Newspapers . <p> The Mercury <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

Very frustrating to say the least . <p> Fortunately , each hero is assigned a default deck that helps you to play quite effectively . You are able to create your own decks , however , and assign them to the hero of your choice . In fact , when entering the ' Arena ' ( one of the playing modes ) you are forced to choose a deck . Choosing a deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to forge into an unbeatable strategic unit is incredibly complex . I 'm not ashamed to admit that I have been thoroughly defeated on quite a few occasions , but I 'm definitely looking forward to learning how to improve . <p> Hearthstone currently has three game modes that you are able to play , including the ' Practice ' mode which allows you to battle against an AI player to hone your skills and to unlock new ones , gain experience and even unlock some of the heroes themselves . This is a great way to learn each hero and , of course , to test any decks you assemble . The ' Play ' mode , meanwhile , allows you to match skills with an online of a similar level . <p> Lastly , the ' Arena ' mode forces you to select a hero and then create a deck specific to that Arena event . The Arena event is an iterative combat against other online players until you have been defeated three times . It does cost money ( either in terms of game gold earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rewards are definitely worth it . <p> I think Hearthstone is a great game but I have a few problems with it , first and foremost being the micro-transactions . I 'm not a fan of micro-transactions and I believe that prowess in a game should be earned and not simply bought . Of course , this is a subjective viewpoint and one that is contrary to popular concepts on the sustainability of the games industry . My second issue with Hearthstone is the fact that you have to be connect online to play . Granted , whilst the ' Play ' and ' Arena ' modes are dependent on online opponents , I would like to practice offline . <p> Third ( and this might not be a problem and it may be my lack of skill ) is the fact that the outcome of some games seem to be dependent on the luck of the draw . There have been a few instances where I have simply not been able to do anything and the cards that are drawn at the start of each turn are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last point may be a deficiency on my part instead of on the part of the game . <p> Currently in closed beta , Hearthstone : Heroes of Warcraft is shaping up to be a fantastic game and I can highly recommend it to everyone when it 's available to more players later this year .

Gearburn brings you the **76;1167;TOOLONG guide ( WILIDUBBPMJTSTM Guide 9 ? ) for choosing between the many smartphone flavours . <p> Option 0.5 : Apple iPhone <p> OK , we 'll go there . Apple . <p> If you want nice hardware , classy styling and tightly integrated software and cloud services , and are n't too fussed about owning technology that 's been neither terribly interesting nor innovative in many years , go for iPhone . If you like Apple stuff , and want more , get an iPhone . If you want objectively derivative tech , and prefer the choice of the indecisive , get an iPhone 5S . Or try the 5C , an iPhone 5 in a cheesy plastic case , but with no FM radio . So much for Apple 's developing market aspirations . <p> Right . Now that Apple 's out of the way , we can move on to options that do n't force you to be borged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , no less real than those who believe one should n't engage in drunk driving or forced labour . <p> Option 1 : BlackBerry 10 <p> Why to consider it : <p> Despite the many flaws in the apps and interface , the OS 10 operating system is excellent . Unbreakably reliable ( more than can be said for some of the dubiously engineered apps ) , and providing an elegant way to send and receive messages from a variety of services , from email to instant messages and social media services . There 's an excellent keyboard with predictive text , which includes the ability to select , copy and paste easily accurately . Everything else you want in a smartphone works as expected . Hardware is good , not great . Camera is at best " meh " . But the material selection is eminently sensible -- a woven synthetic back that 's slightly rubbery for good grip and accidental drop bounciness . And you get the famous Blackberry Red Notification Light of Sauron . <p> Why not to consider it : <p> The interface niggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- although OS 10 has got steadily better since launch when the native Maps was pants , integration between the " Hub " ( unified inbox ) was spotty , and WiFi connection management was buggy as hell . Adding Google and other accounts is now effortless ( previously we had to use CalDAV and CarDAV ) . Mail app is now up to snuff . You can now paste a number in to the phone app . BB Maps is now faster -- although still does n't cache locally ( hello ! ) and often does n't show the names of main roads , just the street code . <p> So if everything has been fixed ... why the reservations ? Because there 's still niggles that should be fixed already . That should have never made it to production . The smart woven case for the Z10 that is insanely tight . That many of the top apps ( Twitter , WhatsApp ) are present and accounted for , but are clearly last on the priority list , and are missing important features . App interfaces on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because even though we talked to a few shops who said they 'd not seen problems with hardware related returns , four separate handsets we used had hardware problems . Oh , and the Z10 's screen is a fingerprint magnet . <p> Bottom Line : If you want the hands-down best messaging , emailing and scheduling phone , get the BlackBerry . For the corporate animal in the office environment , it 's a great option . It 's small enough to be handy , eschewing the 5 " screen madness . And the BB 10 operating system is just so rock solid . It 's not snazzy , it just works . And you can pick a full-keyboard Q10 if you need to type fast , a lot . <p> Option 2 : Windows Phone <p> Why to consider it : <p> The Windows Phone environment is very good , albeit with a couple of Microsoft interface design head-scratchers . But you do get it on Nokia hardware , which makes up for almost any criticisms . The Lumia 920 was a bit of a miscalculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad to charge , do n't plug it in ) making it bulky and heavy . But oh , the screen ! Bright , vivid , readable even in bright sunlight . The camera is sharp , with faithful colour balance and a minimum of ugly glassy digital artifacts . <p> The polycarbonate body 's a stand-out , and very tough . And even the Windows Phone environment has a lot going for it . Excellent browser ; fast-rendering and smooth . Fast switching between applications . The Lumia 925 fixes all the drawbacks of the 920 , and makes the camera even better . And comes in metal for a more polished look . It 's just fantastic hardware . <p> Why not to consider it : <p> If you 're an app junkie , the Windows app ecosystem is poor . You get the main ones , but it 's the red haired stepchild of the phone world . The Windows Phone interface itself is very , very good but has some of those " WTF , Microsoft ? " over-thinks . Why have a dedicated search button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often are you really searching on your device for info ? Those Live Tiles are a great idea , poorly executed . Mostly they 're not live -- they do n't communicate any information about the app they link to . Mostly they 're just big blocky labels . <p> Like so much of Windows , you often do n't know what their phone is doing , because it hides info from you ( " making things simple " ) . I was downloading something ... where did it go ? What 's happening ? Notifications for new messages are not displayed conveniently , no notification light . Email client is very half-baked -- along with integration with Exchange . Hello , Microsoft ! That 's a key reason people might go for Windows Phone . The UI design is clean and elegant , with bold text labels instead of pictograms . Except you often ca n't tell whether something is just a piece of text , or a control you can interact with . Text selection and editing is hit and miss where it 's not haphazard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the hardware , if nothing else . Windows Phone is good , but not great , but good enough to not get in the way . It does the smartphone job . But just for the screen , camera , industrial design and slickness of execution , I 'd buy a Lumia . And if you 're a keen photographer or photoblogger , the Lumia 1020 camera is just jaw-droppingly good . <p> Option 3 : Android <p> Why to consider it : <p> One word ... choice . Also a bit of a Hobson 's Choice . Well , more of a Hobson 's Dilemma . There are so many choices of Android hardware it can become a monster of a decision . A bewilderbeast . Some of the hardware is spectacular . The HTC One . A sleek , aluminium beauty with a heart of lightning and jewels . Kick-ass speakers . The Galaxy S4 Active . Chintzy but awesome . And the Sony Xperia Z1 . Waterproof , breakproof , and with a truly phenomenal camera and superb screen . Or , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred bucks . And still powerful , packing all the Jelly Beany goodness of Android . Or Kit Katty sweetness in a couple of months . <p> Why not to consider it : <p> The integration of hardware , software and apps is very often cracked and flaking . Firmware updates come sporadically , and rapidly fall off the cliff once the device is launched , selling and interest moves on to the new new thing . So while you get a great deal of choice and functionality , you also get frustrating bugs and tech fails as most Android phone makers are so busy chasing trivially useful " features " , they have little focus on quality of user experience . <p> Bottom line : Android is the biggest thing in phones . You ca n't really go wrong . It 's where you get the fastest innovation , and greatest variety of hardware , features and functionality to choose from . And if things break , there 's oodles of Android-tastic technuts around to help you . <h> Author Bio <p> Roger is a tech fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clever , beautiful things that make our lives a little bit more amazing .

But once small businesses sort of are qualified for that funding , it 's actually relatively easy for them to get that funding . So there are lots of reasons why that could be the case . If we look in general at , let 's say , a small business , you are a sole proprietor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank or whatever as a particular consumer . So if the banks look at their risk profile when it comes to consumers , they are going to think of you also in that way . Look , in general consumers are very highly indebted . We can see that unemployment rates are very high in the economy still -- 25.6% in the second quarter of this year . So the bank would look at things like that . The consumers are highly indebted , and I think banks are much stricter now on their lending criteria than they were in the past . So I think that 's why we saw that problem . But I think once a small business actually went over those hurdles it was actually all right for them to get that particular loan . <p> HILTON TARRANT : Small businesses also not completely inward-looking and just focused on South Africa . Increasingly they are looking northwards for growth . <p> BUSI RADEBE : That was a very interesting insight . We saw that small businesses were actually looking to the rest of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think of how our exports have actually almost collapsed , you would think : oh , where do I look to actually export a small business ? When I look beyond our borders to developed markets , actually growth rates there are n't so good and things are n't going so well . But we saw that our small business owners are very smart and were looking to the rest of Africa , where economic growth rates are actually doing wonderfully . And I think that was a nice thing to see . If we look at it , our biggest trading partner is the eurozone , I think something like over 25% of our exports go that way , and there they are actually going through not such a great time . If you look at data coming from the eurozone , yes , they did get out of the recession the second quarter of this year , but the growth rate is actually still negative for 2013 .

A day before this fateful event , two detectives , Ishmael Fofona and O , are standing in the canopied jungle of Ngong looking at what used to be the body of a man that is so badly devoured that it looks more like " an animal carcass " . <p> Black Star Agency , the company the two detectives run , is just about breaking even and this case , thrown to them by Yusuf Hassan , the local Criminal Investigation Department chief , will keep them occupied and their bills paid . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first presidential election campaign and the disputed 2007 plebiscite in Kenya that pitted opposition leader Raila Odinga against the then incumbent president Mwai Kibaki . <p> I met Ngugi at OR Tambo International Airport on his stopover from Cape Town , to which he had been invited for the Open Book Festival . <p> In Kenya 's relationship with Obama , Ngugi saw schizophrenic tendencies : " We loved him , yet that could n't translate into how we looked at our own leadership . <p> Kenya 's new president , Uhuru Kenyatta , and his deputy , William Ruto , will be tried by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for their role in the post-election violence of 2007 . <p> In the book , it seems that the dead man in the forest has something to do with the bomb explosion . Initially , the detectives think al-Qaeda is involved , but the evidence suggests some assistance from black American Muslims .

They tie up Ishmael , his Rwandan girlfriend and Mary , O 's girlfriend . <p> In a dramatic rescue mission , one of the four is killed . But almost at that very moment , this killing is amplified at a national level when tribal militias start harassing people not from their own tribes . <p> As in his other novel , the story that begins on one continent leads across the Atlantic . <p> You could say that the story 's arc has similarities to Ngugi 's own personal narrative . He was born in the United States in 1971 , the son of acclaimed Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o . The younger Ngugi went back to Kenya when he was a few months old and returned to the US for his university education . His doctoral studies were on Nigerian writer Amos Tutuola and John Clare , an 18th-century English peasant poet . <p> Ngugi has always been intrigued by why his father and some of his contemporaries , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular writers such as David Mailu and Charles Mangua stayed at home at the height of the dictatorship . It was n't because Mailu and Mangua had been recruited to compose verses and hymns in praise of Kenya 's post-colonial lords ; if anything , their works were strident critiques of the social and political rot in post-independence Kenya . But the novelists managed to submerge the politics of their rollicking stories by setting them in the underworld of prostitutes and pimps who did n't seem to care about the world of politicians . <p> Ngugi 's decision to frame his stories under the rubric of crime shows the limitations of literary fiction . " The violence of neighbour against neighbour ... how do you deal with this in realist fiction ? " he asks . <p> Of crime fiction , Ngugi says that " it 's a very flexible genre " . I could have been sitting in one of Ngugi 's classes at Cornell University , where he teaches literature . <p> Killing Sahara is at once fast and slow , moving from the city to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the US via Mexico . It 's a clever book , written by an acutely self-conscious author , who knows when it 's time to move a narrative along when it is getting tangled up . <p> Yet there are times when he leaves it a tad too late , and inessential strands of the story end up over-elaborated . Sometimes this movement involves flitting across continents and worlds , of the living and of the dead . <p> You ca n't be sure what to accept because people , their loyalties and what they are about are likely to shift at any given point . While it works most of the time , sometimes you can hear the supporting pillars of his narrative creaking . <p> Unlike his first book , which took happenstance and coincidence to an exalted level , Ngugi 's latest shows more control . <p> This is a novel with a moving , deceptive centre . In light of the violence in Kenya now , it constructs an elaborate geometry that connects the expatriate , violence and extremism ; criminality and people who murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@545234 <h> South Africa : Correctly Applying The In Duplum Rule <p> The in duplum rule has been part of South African law for more than 100 years , being applied through South African case law from as early as 1830 . Literally translated , in duplum means ' double the amount ' . This common law rule provides that interest on a debt will cease to run where the total amount of arrear interest has accrued to an amount equal to the outstanding principal debt . It was developed in response to considerations of public interest , and seeks to protect borrowers from exploitation by lenders who permit interest to accumulate unchecked . It also has the effect of encouraging lenders to exercise their rights to be repaid , promptly and without delay . <p> The National Credit Act ( NCA ) , No 34 of 2005 , incorporates a statutory version of the in duplum rule in section 103(5) , which is commonly referred to as the statutory in duplum rule . This section provides that " Despite any provision of the common law or a credit agreement to the contrary , the amounts contemplated in section 101 ( 1 ) ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a consumer is in default under the credit agreement may not , in aggregate , exceed the unpaid balance of the principal debt under that credit agreement as at the time that the default occurs . " The amounts referred to in section 101(1) ( b ) to ( g ) include : initiation fees , service fees , interest , the cost of any credit insurance , default administration charges and collection costs ( charges ) . <p> The in duplum rule , in both its guises , has been the subject of much academic debate and juristic opinion . As the application of these rules has very real , and sometimes costly , ramifications , particularly for an impoverished debtor , the focus of this debate and challenge has been particularly prevalent in the field of credit agreements and the new creditor protection regime ushered in with the NCA . <p> The statutory in duplum rule is not a mere ' codification ' of the common law in duplum rule and differs from the common law rule in a number of significant respects . As already mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpaid interest , whereas the statutory rule includes a number of costs , in addition to interest , which in aggregate may not exceed the unpaid principal debt at any point while the consumer is in default under a credit agreement . The statutory in duplum rule is , as such , more onerous on credit providers in that the ' in duplum limit ' will be reached much sooner than the common law limit would have been reached . <p> Importantly , the common law in duplum rule does not bar interest from accruing again once the outstanding interest has been reduced below the ' in duplum limit ' . In other words , if a payment is made and the amount outstanding is reduced below the outstanding principal debt , the in duplum rule will no longer apply and interest can start running until it reaches the ' in duplum limit ' once again . Whereas the statutory rule applies for the entire duration of the default , meaning that as long as a consumer remains in default of his/her payment obligations , the credit provider is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer may reduce the outstanding charges through repayments , which is in stark contrast to the common law rule . <p> As a result of its wider ambit , the statutory rule provides greater consumer protection , whilst credit providers are left considerably worse-off . <h> The interaction between common law and statutory in duplum <p> Does the statutory rule override the common law rule or can both rules apply simultaneously ? Alternatively , is there an election regarding which rule to apply ? <p> In the Nedbank case the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed that the statutory in duplum rule is by no means a mere codification of the common law rule . The SCA stated that this is explicitly indicated in the introductory words of section 103(5) , " despite any provision of the common law ... to the contrary . " Instead , according to the SCA , the statutory in duplum rule embodies a distinct rule , which effectively extends the ambit of the common law rule that is applicable to a limited category of agreements ( ie those agreements regulated by the NCA ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the common law rule still applies . In other words , the statutory in duplum rule applies to all credit agreements under the NCA , to the exclusion of the common law in duplum rule , and there is no election as to which rule to apply . Importantly , credit providers are precluded from trying to contract out of the statutory in duplum rule . <h> Statutory in duplum : practical difficulties <p> There remains a lot of uncertainty regarding the application of the statutory in duplum rule in practice , which has resulted in much litigation and resultant judicial interpretation . For example , there is no clear indication of all the charges that may fall within the ambit of section 101(1) ( b ) to ( g ) . In practice , it is still unclear what range of costs would qualify as " service costs " or " collection costs " . Would collection costs include the costs of third-party debt collection agents that have been appointed ? It is necessary to understand the ambit of each of the charges listed in section 101 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in duplum calculation for section 103(5) . <p> As section 103(5) is applicable for the entire duration that the consumer is in ' default ' , credit providers must have a clear understanding of when a default as contemplated may arise , the events that encompass a default , as well as the events that extinguish that default . This may be particularly pertinent in the circumstances where credit providers ' restructure ' a consumer 's debt in an effort to assist consumers to meet their obligations ( for example , through a change in the repayment terms ) ? does this restructuring end the default in question , or does the original default persist ? <p> Another interpretational difficulty has arisen in the context of credit life insurance , which is included in the calculation of the in duplum amount . Very briefly , credit life insurance is a form of insurance paid on a loan , where , upon the occurrence of certain insured events ( such as death , disability or retrenchment of the debtor/insured ) , the insurer will pay out the outstanding capital on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance is usually required by credit providers as per section 106 of the NCA as a condition to providing credit to consumers . There is the very real possibility that the application of the in duplum rule , which is intended to protect the debtor , may actually prejudice the debtor in these circumstances ? in that the statutory in duplum rule may prevent the consumer from paying , and the credit provider from receiving , any premiums on the consumer 's credit life insurance policy . For the entire duration of the default after the in duplum limit has been reached , the creditor will not be obliged or be able to pay any premiums towards the credit life insurance . <h> Statutory in duplum in practice : compliance <p> The statutory in duplum provisions are being misinterpreted and incorrectly applied by many credit providers , placing them at risk of a breach of section 103(5) . This may be a consequence of the confusion between the application of the common law in duplum rule and the statutory in duplum rule , and the interpretational difficulties accompanying the statutory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that credit providers are being placed at risk of non-compliance with section 103(5) of the NCA . <p> This statutory in duplum rule applies to all credit providers providing credit in terms of the NCA , including banks , motor vehicle and asset finance companies and all financial institutions that extend credit as part of their business . A failure to adhere to the statutory in duplum rule will result in a breach of the NCA , exposing credit providers to regulatory censure . In addition to this regulatory risk , a breach of the statutory in duplum rule may also expose credit providers to reputational risk and financial risk . The consequences of failing to properly apply the statutory in duplum rule can be significant and it is therefore very important that all credit providers consider how section 103(5) of the NCA is being applied in their businesses and are they compliant and further consider whether any remedial action is required to correct any potential contraventions thereof . <p> KPMG has designed a methodology to assist credit providers in identifying and remedying breaches of the statutory in duplum rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breaches and potential breaches of the in duplum principle with our clients ' product environments and details the processes to be applied in remedying such breaches . <h> About Finn Elliott <p> Provides legal and regulatory support to clients in the financial services sector on their regulatory oversight , including legal opinions and advice on FAIS , FICA , NCA , FMA , CISCA and JSE Rules . <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter .

Photo : Supplied <p> Johannesburg - Chicken producers and grocery retailers offered some comfort to consumers yesterday about the impact that the new poultry import tariffs will have on the price of what is South Africa 's major source of protein . <p> Pick n Pay said that the full impact of the tariffs , which increased by 8.75 percentage points on average , was likely to be felt sometime closer to the first quarter of next year . <p> The retailer said it sourced over 90 percent of its groceries and most of its poultry products from South Africa , and only where this was not possible , due to unavailability of leg portions without brine , it then imported those portions . <p> Peter Arnold , the merchandise director at Pick n Pay , said that the prices the retailer charged for chicken were no longer profitable but as most South Africans got their protein from chicken , the retailer would continue to bear the cost . <p> " Chicken is a loss leader to Pick n Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how popular it is .

For those OOH players who have not yet taken the taxi , it may very soon leave them behind . <p> Rapid urbanisation <p> According to SAIRR/ World Bank two-thirds of South Africa 's population now lives in urban areas with that proportion having increased from 52% in 1990 to 62% in 2011 . Higher economic growth , employment and access to services has made moving to urban areas very attractive . The most rapid growth has taken place in South Africa 's smaller cities , mostly due to small initial populations and increasing economic activity due to better employment opportunities . <p> This has had a massive impact on commuting with a total of 21,6 million people commuting on public transport every week .

@@558237 <h> Business on a budget : 5 tech tips for digital startups to cut costs <p> The internet is full of advice on how startups should cut costs . Much of them start with ' start from home ' and lead to ' cut down on the fancy furniture ' and ' go green ' . Some go as far as suggesting ' keep manpower thin ' . In an era of global warming , ' go green ' is a solution not only for startups but for all small enterprises and large conglomerates too , an activity that cuts across industries -- very important to earn carbon credits . Start from home , may sound like an ideal situation , yet it requires a lot of disciplining and deprives employees and often clients of a formal work and discussion environment . A garage instead could be a better solution . Yes , cutting down on fancy furniture , and browsing through deals sites for furniture or travel tickets may not be such a bad idea . <p> However , we have five better solutions and we are restricting to technology solutions . Pay heed . <p> BYOD <p> Bring your own device ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality where organisations are encouraging employees to bring in their own devices -- mobile phones , tablets , notebooks -- to work . Something that started as an HR appeasement is a reality now . Startups can highly save on investments into these gadgets . However , this comes with its own set of challenges , which range from providing IT solutions to varied OS and brands to fund fresh rookie employees who do n't own these devices . Providing IT solutions to a small team should n't be much of a problem . The problem will come once the team grows in proportion and there are as many OS brands to support . However , the IT solutions cost would be much lesser than the initial cost of investment into the devices . <p> Startups do tend to encourage first-time job-seekers and keep the experienced skill as thin as possible to cut down on salary costs . Some of these fresh recruits may not own any , one , or more than one of these required devices . Startups , at the time of hiring can offer to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fresh recruits . This funding can be recovered through an arranged agreement between the two parties , such as regular deductions from salaries . Startups also benefit in this arrangement from owning depreciated value gadgets and upgradation costs for obsolete software/hardware . BYOD also allows work accessibility from anywhere outside the office , including home . But if the device needs to go for repair , who pays ? That is the question you should lay down in the employment contract . The cost could be shared as it 's being used for both personal and official purposes . <p> Go opensource <p> It 's given that if an employee is eventually owning the device , s/he will buy a brand of her/his liking , which may come with proprietary OS and proprietary apps . Much of these OSes and apps will come with a personal use license , which would make it illegal to be used in the office . Startups could encourage usage of opensource OS -- largely in the Linux space to overcome OS and applications ' license costs . These can be managed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the personal preferred proprietary OS on another partition . Another partition could manage the common files -- documents and music and video files -- which would be accessible to both the OSes on the system . <p> If the employee personally prefers the opensource environment , you have saved half the trouble . Our recommendations are Ubuntu , Linux Mint , elementary OS and if someone wants an environment as close to Windows to cut down on the learning curve , you can go for Linux OSes in the KDE environment like Kubuntu or Chakra . <p> We will not say that opensource will save on anti-virus licences , even though the Linux environment is less prone to viruses and many of the software channels maintained by many of the opensource OS brands have an anti-virus solution and firewall embedded within the OS itself that are updated regularly . But if you are working in a networking environment , computing security is the last thing where one should look at cutting costs . If you trust your OS software channel , go by it or else invest in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free anti-virus solutions available too -- Avira , Avast and AVG , and most of them have Linux versions . <p> However , opensource comes with its own set of challenges . Much proprietary software may not find support on opensource OSes , for example , Adobe Creative Suite , which includes apps like Photoshop and Illustrator . Or for that matter , Microsoft Office . Even though there are applications like Wine . Wine works as a Windows emulators to run Windows compatible programs on Linux , but chances of failure to emulate are high . But emulation still incurs a license cost and it eventually defeats the opensource purpose . The opensource fraternity is huge and there are many equally good equivalents for many of these programs . LibreOffice and Openoffice.org are two very good alternatives for Microsoft Office . GIMP is a very good free alternative for Photoshop . While Adobe does n't maintain Linux binaries , Corel does have Linux versions but that too come at a cost . A very good free substitute for Illustrator and Corel Draw is Inkspace . If your startup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good alternatives for Dreamweaver . <p> Evolution is free and equally competitive as MS Outlook . Thunderbird and Geary Mail are other good free native mail clients . <p> Also , for your website , you can use free and opensource publishing solutions like WordPress , Joomla and Drupal . If you need a site , which will be largely used for content publishing , announcements , or to maintain an official blog , WordPress is the best and the easiest . If you need more functionalities or want to put up an e-commerce site , interactivity with customers and more , you can try your hands on Drupal and Joomla . <p> Ride the cloud <p> First and foremost , cloud computing comes at a cost and is not free . In fact there are many good cloud based office suites too -- Google Drive and Zoho are quite competitive alternatives to MS Office . Personal use file sharing services like Dropbox , Google Drive , Skydrive , Ubuntu One and Copy could be handy as they offer free space anything between 2 GB to 20 GB and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more free space . <p> However , a startup with a centralised cloud server would need more space and a support that is serviced on priority and is regularly monitored . A cloud service could cost cheaper than the locally installed server costs , which includes investment into the physical server ; real estate cost for server installation , which can be saved or put to other better use ; continuous electric supply to keep the servers running and server cooling solutions ; battery backup and subsequent maintenance cost for all of these . These all become the headache of the cloud solution provider . A cloud server cost would be much less than all of these above costs put together , even if you add the data transfer cost to access the cloud server . As such , you have to invest into a data package for your enterprise , so the added cost of server access may just go up marginally . Amazon , IBM , Google , Rackspace and Microsoft are some pioneers in the cloud computing space . <p> While cloud makes the data and enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time of the day , it also solves the problem emerging from the first solution -- BYOD . What do you do when an employee leaves the company ? S/he is taking the device along , and along with it could go the data . So once , cloud computing comes into play , much of the data is residing on the cloud , to which user accessibility could be easily and immediately denied . IT solution providers may just check the device for mandatory checkups for any local backups , but would be saved from troubles of wiping the data or taking office backups and transfers to new machines owned by employee replacements . <p> Go social <p> By going social , we do not mean have Twitter , Facebook , Pinterest accounts . They are given . They will help you save on communication cost and create buzz . But they wo n't help much in getting you businesses . Instead of investing on banner ads and paid newspaper ads and listings . Much of these investments will be a spillover . Instead , use online forums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter , upgrading knowledge . LinkedIn is a vast repository of forums that would be relevant to your work domain . Whether you are an app developer , hardware manufacturer , digital marketing agency , web developer or mobile solutions provider , there are many active forums catering to them . You can make a pitch for a business in these forums or find a freelancer to outsource smaller projects which may not need a full-time employee . <p> Virtual communication <p> Last , but not the least on our savings list is usage of web communication tools . Costs on SMSes could be saved hugely through usage of apps like WhatsApp , WeChat , Line and Viber or any other equivalent like Nimbuzz and Fring . Preference for an app over another would largely depend in which region your office is located , which market you are targeting and which app is largely used by your industry peers and clients in these markets . The best thing about most of these apps are that they are tethered to the mobile number of the users , hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation . <p> Now , how about some cost savings on travel . Use Skype to save on long-distance travel . Registration is through a username and Microsoft has no plans as of now to tether it to a mobile number . While Skype offers good video and voice quality , its user interface still comes from the Flintstones ages . Another equally good app to save on international voice call costs and roaming costs is Viber , which is tethered to the mobile number . Video on Viber is available , as of now , only on its desktop app versions , which too may compare inferiorly with Skype . Google Hangouts too emerge as a good alternative . Since Hangouts replaced Google Talk , it 's going through a lot of tweaks and changes , which are yet incomplete and that could be a deterrent as of now . There are speculations that Hangouts too could be used as an SMS app , once tethering it to a mobile number is allowed . <p> Travel costs could also be cut down by using virtual meeting rooms like videxio.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual meetings , vyew.com also has free version , which is ad supported .

@@558239 <h> Why presidents should read <p> ReutersWhereas former president Thabo Mbeki ( right ) was well-read , his successor , Jacob Zuma , is the opposite , says the author . <p> The debate over our anti-intellectual president has raised deeper questions about what it means to lead , writes Richard Calland . <p> Cape Town - An interesting and useful debate has emerged in the past few days about whether the president reads and whether the head of government should ideally be an " intellectual " . <p> A wide range of views has surfaced , among them those who argue that given the complexity of modern government and the role the president must play on the global stage , he should be well-read so that he can be , and can appear to be , well-informed and in command of his subject . <p> Others have argued that what the president has or does not have on his bedside table is either irrelevant or none of our business . The educational qualifications of a president , they argue , are irrelevant to how he conducts himself : what matters is the quality of his political judgment . <p> Some commentators have reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- someone whose grasp of ideas comes not from books or education , but " from the ground " and is , therefore , more connected with real life and so , more authentic . <p> The view that I express in my new book , The Zuma Years , and expressed in a speech last Thursday at the Cape Town Press Club , was based on what a senior cabinet minister told me : that the president does n't read , or does n't read in sufficient detail , the briefing documents necessary for him to maintain a firm grip on his Cabinet . <p> Curiously , the Presidency felt obliged to put out a statement on Friday denying my argument . Has a presidential spokesman anywhere in the world ever made a formal statement saying , in effect , " the president does read " ? <p> Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj missed my point . I was contrasting President Jacob Zuma 's style and approach to that of his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , who read everything and who was , therefore , able to keep his Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely caught out , as Zuma often is , when asked about the detail of policy . But as Eusebius McKaiser pointed out in his column on Monday , " Choosing bad reasons to damn Zuma " ( See related articles above ) , this did not necessarily make Mbeki a better president . <p> This is why the debate is useful as well as interesting , because it forces us to consider what are the skills and attributes we want from our leaders and what are the implications of having one sort of leader over another . As we enter an electoral campaign period , this is especially valuable , however uncomfortable it may be at times . <p> After all , there have been some very powerful political leaders around the world who could not be described as well-read . And Max du Preez , another commentator from this paper , tweeted amusingly last week that president PW Botha was once asked what he read and replied " the Bible and Farmer 's Weekly " . <p> US presidents Ronald Reagan and George W Bush were hardly intellectuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but love them or hate them , they were effective communicators , able to strip away the technical detail to speak directly to their core political constituents . <p> But they had a massive staff of highly skilled advisers to support and guide them . <p> In my book , I describe how part of the Polokwane " revolution " included the re-structuring of the Presidency . The victors of Polokwane were intent on ensuring that Zuma did not have the same power over his Cabinet as Mbeki . <p> The " kitchen cabinet " of advisers ( the policy co-ordination and advisory service ) that Mbeki had so painstakingly built up , was dismantled . Now , as one senior government adviser told me : " We know the president gets advice , we just do n't know where he gets it . " <p> This has implications for accountability , too . On what basis is the president making the choices that he does if he does n't read the briefing documents with sufficient detail and does n't have a strong team of officials to read , digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my argument is that in the modern world , where government is so complex , a president needs to be sufficiently on top of his or her subject and have sufficient grasp of the issues that the Cabinet is discussing to be an effective leader . Senior officials and Cabinet ministers expect it and find it hard to respect a political principal who does not have that grasp , however " organically grounded " their instinct for political decision-making may be . <p> The last point is a more complex one about what such leadership signals to people . Rather rudely , I told my Cape Town audience that Mbeki was the embodiment of the " philosopher king " and Zuma 's approach was " the epitome of anti-intellectualism " . <p> I have been attacked for this , accused of snobbery .

@@575232 <h> Related News <p> Forza Motorsport 5 has received a lot of buzz since its first unveiling as one of the upcoming Xbox One 's most important launch titles . We 've seen promises of amazing visuals , stunning car models , clever SkyNet powered A.I and more . <p> Now , while the majority of gamers are taking a good look at what 's on the carbon-fibre-weaved surface of Forza 's next-gen instalment , hard-core Forza fans , petrol-heads and racer-junkies like me are more concerned with what 's happened where it matters most ... under the hood . <h> Race Prep <p> So , after picking up the new Xbox One controller , ogling the pretty cars in the selection menu and loading up the track , I finally got to do something I 've wanted to do since I first saw Forza 5 ... turn the assists off and see what it looks like when it does n't look like it 's being driven around the track by a robot . <p> For the sake of our test , I was able to get not one , but three laps of the Mazda Laguna Seca race circuit and to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three laps in completely different kinds of cars . <p> I chose to drive the Ford Focus ST , known for its understeer in corners , the Mercedes 300SL which as a classic would give a good feel of a heavier , older rear wheel drive sports car and then finally , the Ferrari F12 ... agile , aerodynamic and loaded with enough horses for us to film a couple of epic spaghetti westerns . Best of all , I have access to this same track and these same cars ( with the exception of the F12 which I swapped out for the 599 GTO ) in Forza 4 , which I then drove to compare with FM5 once I was back at my own setup . <p> What I 'm going to try really hard to do in this article though is to not harp on about how incredible the new feedback-enabled triggers are on the Xbox One , and sing about the massive difference that they make to your driving experience by feeding extra information into your brain via your index fingers . I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Putting Rubber Down <p> While Forza has always leaned more to the side of a sim , it was always pretty well known that the cars , while close to their real-life counterparts , felt like they had just a bit more grip than they should have and even proved it when put it up against real life lap times and its rival GT5 in a brief test we did a while back . If you have ever been around a real track in a car that was fitted with semi-slicks rather than its standard road tires , you will know exactly what I mean . <p> On my first outing , I dove into the first left hander of Laguna Seca with the Focus , making sure that I got on the brakes light and early so as to not go flying off of the track with the large rAge crowd behind me watching ( you need to show the crowds you 're a pro at times like this ) . So after making my way out of the sand trap that I was deeply and embarrassingly embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . Upon braking into the corner , my mind was temporarily stunned by the amount of information travelling up my fingers through the new Xbox One triggers , letting me know that I had just locked up my front wheels and was now tearing up a strip of the rubber attached to them . Honestly the amount of feedback I received from the trigg ... ahem , sorry ... let us carry on . <p> The new physics system feels significantly different to previous titles , that 's for certain . In the Focus it was now much more difficult to carry the right amount of speed through the bends to not understeer ( fading outwards while cornering ) into the corners but then also not suffer massive amounts of torque/under steer out of the bends when putting the power on . This was something that plagued early Forza games , especially during the earlier parts of the career modes , as the slower cars let you mostly flatten the accelerator pedal and just coast the car around most corners of the track without any real fear of losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pure delight for true racer fans , because it means we have new levels of balance and finesse to perfect when lapping our favourite circuits . If you want to turn all of the assists off , then be prepared to put on your big-boy-pants and concentrate . Understeer is now a much bigger factor , thanks to the fact that in all of the cars , there was a much higher feeling and even visible amount of force on the cars that caused them to get unsettled while cornering . Again , if you have ever lapped a track in a real car as a driver or a passenger , you will know that you start really feeling the limits of a car when you realise that all four wheels are doing this light jiggle underneath you while under load . Finding the balance that keeps the car fast and settled is a big part of what makes lapping a car so enjoyable , and from what I felt in the demo the physics are able to deliver a much more satisfying and realistic feeling of force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of rubber to the road , especially thanks to the feedback you get from the new Xbox trigger feedback . Oh , those wonderful triggers . <p> Iv'e been on this site for 4 years now and till today i still do n't know whether your PS or Xbox fanboy , that 's what i liked about u .

" <p> The huge plus for Griquas with Fourie 's appointment is that he has more insight into which of the Kimberley-based side 's players qualify for Super Rugby based on their skill set . This means more players from the Northern Cape capital could be considered for Super Rugby next season . <p> " Our main goal is to make the Cheetahs Super Rugby side an even stronger unit , " Fourie said . <p> " We 've had quality players like Willie le Roux , Lourens Adriaanse , Ligtoring Landman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> " We look to get even more players from Griquas involved because it is good to have depth in certain positions .

With his family in the crowd , he gave off a modest bow as his performance ended . <p> Nadia Van Der Westhuizen was next up on the roster , and her performance was a little underwhelming to say the least .

I think the problems stemmed from the song choice . She clearly thrives in the realms of power notes and high keys- why would you give her a song where she is singing in a low , uncomfortable key for the majority of the performance ? I could sense her discomfort from the go , and this was emphasized when she mistimed her " big " moment in the main chorus . While I do feel that Nadia was a little out of her depth in the finals , I feel that , had she been better advised , she would have given us a better performance- a more accurate testament to her talent . <p> At this point I was thinking , " We have n't seen a dancer !

@@597233 <h> Director leaves Aids nutrition company <p> SuppliedJohn Ellis , a director of the embattled Aids nutrition company Edge to Edge Global Investments , has resigned . Photo : Supplied <p> Durban - John Ellis , a director of the embattled Aids nutrition company Edge to Edge Global Investments , has resigned , saying most of the shareholders ' allegations of fraud and misappropriation were against him and although he denied these , he deemed it " in the best interests of the company " . <p> However , the shareholders - who claim Ellis and his fellow directors , wife Kathy and Pretoria-based Jan Louw have duped them out of between R70m and R80m - are persisting with their application to liquidate the public company because they want to know what happened to their money , believing the directors have splurged it on a luxury lifestyle . <p> The shareholders succeeded with their application before Judge Esther Steyn , in terms of the new Companies Act , for permission to wind up the company based on allegations of fraud and the misapplication of assets . <p> And while the directors have now brought an application for leave to appeal against that decision - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the shareholders , led by influential businessman Tony Pinfold , lodged their liquidation application on Friday . <p> In an opposing affidavit that came before Judge Shyam Gyanda , Louw argued that the Ellis resignation " deals with the complaints of the shareholders " and negates the need to liquidate the company . <p> In his resignation letter , Ellis says : " The company is on the verge of finalising the most important clinical trials and it is of paramount importance that this process must not be shipwrecked at this stage . " <p> The clinical trials - or alleged lack of them - are just one of the issues raised by the shareholders seeking answers to what happened to their money . <p> In their application before Judge Steyn - and repeated in the liquidation applications - are allegations that they were told that their money was to be used to develop a nutrition pack , " a possible cure for Aids " , to be sold across Africa . <p> However , they claim this was a lie , as was the promise that the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack . <p> The alarm was raised when now-former staff said they had not been paid , the offices were shut and it emerged that no financial statements had been produced in two years , in contravention of the law . <p> Pinfold says in court papers that the directors had constantly avoided answering questions and their " disingenuous attempt " to frustrate the court applications were " shocking " against the background of their fiduciary duties as directors of a public company . <p> " It is an indication that they have something to hide , which is yet a further indication of their fraudulent conduct , since otherwise they would co-operate fully and furnish convincing answers to the allegations , " he said . <p> Louw persists with the line that all is well and that the financials , when produced " in four weeks " , will prove this . <p> He also claims that " the most important trials in the product " are on the verge of being finalised but more capital is required . <p> " Should the company be wound up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a probable and significant contribution towards combating HIV and Aids would be shipwrecked due to this . <p> " On the allegations that the public must be protected ( from being induced to invest ) , we can give an undertaking that no further shares will be issued or sold pending the finalisation of the application . <p> " I stress the company urgently needs extra capital to finalise the last leg of research and clinic trials ... but we will endeavour to procure this without selling or issuing more shares , " he said . <p> Judge Steyn is to hear the application for leave to appeal on October 29 and Judge Gyanda indicated on Friday that he would deal with the liquidation application on the same day . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@605232 <h> South Africa <h> Investing for retirement is not rocket science . Just do it <p> New products make it cheaper than ever . <p> Sasha **28;1170;TOOLONG October 2013&amp;nbsp13:39 <p> For many South Africans the first time that they think seriously about funding their retirement is when their parents retire . And these days that usually comes with the sobering reality that their parents have n't provided sufficiently for retirement and need financial support . <p> This need comes at precisely the time that families are most indebted -- they have car and bond or rent repayments to meet ; school fees or day-care fees to pay , and probably a decent amount of credit-card debt to service as well . The thing that inevitably suffers is long-term saving . <p> I was lucky . My mom managed our household budget like a grandmaster plays chess -- with total concentration . If you need any indication -- the wax paper around my school sandwiches was wiped off daily and had to last the week . <p> My parents are still careful with their spending , but they have retired comfortably , they can afford the odd luxury and place no demands on their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imbibe more of those lessons . I was almost 40 when I started to tot up my various retirement investments -- and found the usual suspects : a PPS investment here and a Liberty RA there . If I was to rely on them I 'd have to die young . <p> So here I am , at 44 , scrambling to put enough aside for retirement . I save over 20% of my gross salary and wo n't be retiring anytime soon , or at all if research by retirement fund provider Alexander Forbes is anything to go by . The research indicates that you now have to save almost 20% of what you earn over a 40-year period to buy an adequate pension . <p> The moral of the story is to start saving with your first pay check . And unless you contribute to a pension scheme at work , the best way ( for most people ) to do this is through a retirement annuity ( RA ) . Do n't be tempted by friends who tell you that you can beat the market if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost you dearly . <p> There are two reasons that RAs are the way to go when it comes to long-term savings . One is that an RA offers tax advantages to individual savers ; and the other is that you can not access these savings until you are 55 -- and nor can your creditors . More often than not it 's these advantages that outweigh the tax benefits . <p> Of course , when it comes to costs , there are RAs and RAs . You 'll want to go for one of the ' new generation ' unit-trust based products . These were launched in response to the costly traditional insurance-based retirement annuities and are available through the unit trust companies . <p> But even in this universe the difference in fees charged and sheer number of choices can be overwhelming . At least all fees -- such as those paid to the product provider , also known as the linked investment service provider or LISP ( for example Discovery Invest or Allan Gray ) and those paid to the fund manager ( for example Coronation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While fees have come down , the total cost of retirement investing in SA currently is still around 3% . It does n't sound like much but over 40 years this could absorb as much as 75% of your return . <p> The good news is that a few financial companies are trying to reduce the costs of saving for retirement further . The government is also putting the entire industry under pressure to reduce these costs . <p> The best known example is 10X Investments which offers investors one solution which varies according to your age . Its maximum investment fee is 1.03% ( incl VAT ) and this covers all fees including platform fees , admin fees and so on . <p> Satrix , ETFSA and ITransact also offer RAs underpinned by index trackers , but none are quite as cheap as 10X . <p> But take note , there is a new unit-trust based product on the market -- and investors would be mad if they did n't look at it more closely . It is by far the cheapest retirement product on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her team of rocket scientists at Sygnia Asset Management ( incidentally the second largest institutional multi-manager in the country with assets under management in excess of R100bn ) dropped a bomb on the long-term investment industry . <p> This was in the form of a basket of retirement products , including RAs , targeted at the retail investor which are priced at an unbeatable all-in price of 0.4% per annum , including VAT . As the fee includes the provision of the retirement product , administration and asset management , there wo n't be a retirement product in the country anywhere close to that . <p> Sygnia 's retirement products are underpinned by passive unit trusts which Wierzycka says provide a simpler and more cost efficient means of index tracking than ETFs . <p> So , as Wierzycka herself told me , if you have n't got a pension plan going , find a suitable product , invest 20% of your gross income in it , and forget about it -- without further ado . <p> And by all means , if you want to invest in shares or unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your long-term savings .

Anything that undermines education and training , and that misaligns this with the needs of the economy , undermines black advancement . <p> 10 . Once the requirements of growth , jobs , education , training and alignment with the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . This will primarily advantage black South Africans and do more for BEE than any initiatives undertaken by the ANC thus far . <p> 11 . Within this context we need to incentivise business to ensure opportunities , training and promotion for disadvantaged South Africans . <p> This is neatly summarised by the slogan we had 50 feet high on billboards in Gauteng : " We support BEE that creates jobs , not billionaires . " This position has not changed and will not change . <p> The issue has come to a head in recent months as we apply these principles to two Bills before parliament . <p> These are : <p> - The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Amendment Bill , which deals with patterns of ownership and incentives to increase participation in the economy . <p> - The Employment Equity Amendment Bill which deals with demographic diversity in the workplace . <p> A key difference is that the BBBEE Amendment Bill generally creates a context of incentives while the EEA Bill largely creates a context of coercion . This distinction is a critical difference when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Bill it embodied many of the principles we believe in . However there was one crucial stumbling block . As drafted , the Bill had race-based definition of " disadvantage " . Although " race " is still often synonymous with " disadvantage " this is changing rapidly . Race classification is thus becoming increasingly problematic as a reliable determinant of which South Africans are disadvantaged , and which are not . <p> Our representatives on the Trade and Industry Portfolio Committee , Dr Wilmot James and Geordin Hill-Lewis , met Minister Rob Davies to raise our concerns . After receiving assurances that the Minister intended to embrace genuine broad-based empowerment ( in line with the National Development Plan ) we decided to support the Bill . As enabling legislation , it is largely compatible with our principles . The Bill passed in the National Assembly with our support on the 20th June 2013 . <p> Then , on October 11 , Minister Davies released the final Codes of Good Practice which , despite his earlier assurances , entrenches narrow , race-based crony enrichment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " re-empowerment " of individuals until they have benefited from share transfer schemes up to a value of R50-million . The previous threshold was R20-million . The cynical intention of the Codes is to enable the politically connected to become even wealthier , through equity transfers , at the cost of broad-based empowerment . This totally contradicts the stated intention of the Bill , and does not comply with the DA 's principles . <p> So , when it came up for debate in the National Council of Provinces , the DA took a stand against the Bill . In other words : we supported the Bill in the Assembly when it offered the potential to introduce incentives for genuine broad-based empowerment . We opposed it in the NCOP when it had become clear that the ( subsequently issued ) Ministerial Codes would simply use the Bill as a fig-leaf to disguise more race-based crony enrichment . <p> There is nothing contradictory about this position . We took the correct positions on the basis of the evidence available to us at each stage , within the framework of principled criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the circumstances change , I change my position . What do you do ? " <p> Now to the Employment Equity Act . Here we dropped the ball . From its inception , this Bill completely contradicted the framework set out above . Not only is it based on racial coercion , it will undermine growth , reduce jobs , drive away investment and work against black empowerment . It will be subject to political manipulation , and undermine our chances of building the " capable state " which the National Development Plan identifies as a top priority . <p> So , how did the DA come to vote for it in the National Assembly ? Good question . <p> The best way I can answer this is by reference to Malcolm Gladwell 's fascinating analysis of plane crashes in his book Outliers ( p183 - 185 ) . Gladwell 's purpose is to show the importance of communication and teamwork ( or the lack thereof ) and the accumulated significance of independently irrelevant , small mistakes , that combine to create disaster . <p> He says : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they happen in the movies . Some engine part does not explode in a fiery bang . The rudder does n't suddenly snap under the force of take-off . The captain does n't gasp as he 's thrown back against his seat ...... Plane crashes are much more likely to be the result of an accumulation of minor difficulties and seemingly trivial malfunctions . In a typical crash , for example , the weather is poor - not terrible , necessarily , but bad enough that the pilot feels a little bit more stressed than usual . In an overwhelming number of crashes , the plane is behind schedule , so the pilots are hurrying . In 52 percent of crashes , the pilot at the time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more , meaning that he is tired and not thinking sharply . And 44 percent of the time , the two pilots have never flown together before , so they 're not comfortable with each other . Then the errors start - and it 's not just one error . The typical accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthermore , are rarely problems of knowledge or flying skill . It 's not that the pilot has to negotiate some critical technical maneuver and fails . The kinds of errors that cause plane crashes are invariably errors of teamwork and communication . One pilot knows something important and somehow does n't tell the other pilot . One pilot does something wrong , and the other pilot does n't catch the error . A tricky situation needs to be resolved through a complex series of steps - and somehow the pilots fail to coordinate and miss one of them . " <p> That applies , with eerie accuracy , to what happened in the process leading up to the NA vote on the EEA Bill . Our representatives on the portfolio committee were inadequately prepared . The many and varied submissions on the Bill were rushed through the portfolio committee in four meetings . The long parliamentary recess intervened before the Bill went to the National Assembly and so we were unable to debate the implications of the Bill adequately in caucus ; when it did come before caucus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted on in the house , the explanatory memorandum produced by our spokespeople was defective . To make matters worse , we had five minutes ( literally ) to consider seven different Bills . <p> A number of sequential errors . On their own , none would have led to a crash . In a cumulative sequence , they did . <p> I , as the captain of this plane , must take responsibility . And I do . I believe it is best to acknowledge mistakes and seek to rectify them . <p> My colleague , DA Parliamentary Leader Lindiwe Mazibuko , has also acknowledged the deficiencies in the caucus management system that allowed for these errors to slip through and compound themselves . She and the Parliamentary leadership have proposed far reaching changes to the way Bills are " triaged " and managed from their inception through to their discussion in caucus . <p> That is why we will propose amendments to the Employment Equity Act Amendment Bill in the NCOP and vote against the Bill if we do not succeed in effecting these changes . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly . We should have done this from the get-go because this Bill will harm rather than promote redress . <p> Of course , our opponents will seek to use this to their own ends . Some of them will say we have abandoned our non-racial principles . Others will say we have abandoned our commitment to redress . Neither is true . Both these commitments are compatible and mutually reinforcing . The framework at the start of this newsletter demonstrates how we reconcile these commitments . <p> Our position remains exactly as described in this framework . We will analyse every empowerment initiative on a case-by-case basis , by asking the question : does this broaden opportunity for disadvantaged people ? Or does it seek to manipulate outcomes for the politically connected ? If it broadens opportunity , we support it . If it is used to camouflage yet another enrichment scheme for cronies , we reject it . <p> Sadly the ANC will pass the Bill into law anyway . But that is no excuse for the DA 's deficient handling of it at its inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining passage of this Bill . We can not support an approach that will create more unemployment and poverty and less empowerment for those who genuinely need it . History would be damning in its judgment if we did . <p> This article by Helen Zille first appeared in SA Today , the weekly online newsletter of the leader of the Democratic Alliance .

By KEN BORLAND . <p> He was speaking in the context of his team needing to " muscle up " against the Springboks , but the warning applies just as much to the visitors as they take on the Six Nations champions in their home conditions with 10 members of the triumphant British and Irish Lions team in their ranks . <p> And Springbok coach , Heyneke Meyer , is clearly not taking any chances as he has named what he considers to be the best match-day 23 available to him . He has spoken about using this European Tour to " give guys opportunities " , but that wo n't be against a Welsh team that is growing as a force in world rugby and is eager to improve their record against South Africa . <p> The Springboks have beaten Wales in 24 of their 26 meetings , losing 19-29 in Cardiff in 1999 and drawing 6-6 in the same city in 1970 . But since 2008 , the South Africans have come precariously close to being mugged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours have been 20-15 , 34-31 and 29-25 , while in the last match between the two countries , the Springboks squeaked home 17-16 in their World Cup pool game in Wellington . <p> So there is no doubt Wales are able to beat the Springboks on Saturday , and there is absolutely no room for aping about as Meyer looks to build on the encouraging form shown in the Rugby Championship . <p> Edwards thinks the current Springbok team is the best since the 2009 outfit that beat the Lions tourists he was involved with , and believes they are not just about brawn , but that they also have plenty of attacking options and skill out wide . <p> The backline Meyer has chosen for the weekend is certainly an intriguing one , and features the same personnel that played in the controversial 2011 World Cup quarterfinal defeat to Australia . <p> The return of Jaque Fourie to outside centre allows him to rekindle the most successful midfield partnership in Springbok history with captain Jean de Villiers , and the attention will be on whether the Japan-based 30-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> JP Pietersen returns to the Green and Gold from the same country as Fourie , and the former Sharks wing is expected to make a massive difference to the Springboks ' ability in the aerial battle , as well as the attacking spark and defensive steel he brings . <p> Possibly the most surprising selection , though , is that of Pat Lambie as the starting fullback . After the match-winning hand he played in the Currie Cup final , the Sharks star was always going to come into the mix , but most observers thought he would be challenging Morne Steyn at flyhalf . <p> But instead Meyer has ditched Zane Kirchner - arch-enemy number one in many supporters ' eyes - and Lambie 's more diagonal attacking runs will hopefully bring greater success than his predecessor 's tendency to run and jiggle straight into tackles . <p> There 's also an obvious case for using the running skills of Lambie in the flyhalf position when the Springboks are on attack , while the weather conditions will probably dictate a territorial game will be paramount and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nicely . <p> The unavailability of the inevitably-injured Jannie du Plessis means the exciting young talents of Western Province 's Frans Malherbe will be on display in the Springbok number three jersey for the first time , while Meyer has resisted the temptation to rush Pieter-Steph du Toit , the other hero of the Currie Cup final , straight into the starting line-up . <p> The greater experience of Flip van der Merwe has seen him preferred in the number five position , but there will be tremendous excitement when Du Toit canters on to the Test stage for the first time . <p> Wales should certainly not be underestimated . Fullback Leigh Halfpenny , wing George North , centre Jonathan Davies , scrumhalf Mike Phillips and prop Adam Jones were all prominent when the Lions buried Australia 41-16 in the decisive Sydney Test in July . <p> Their backline is an entertaining mix of powerful runners like North and Davies , and the flair of Halfpenny , whose dancing feet are inside prolific goal-kicking boots , Phillips and inside centre Scott Williams . <p> Sam Warburton has returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lions decider and , even though the Springboks ' breakdown play has improved dramatically , the Wales captain is going to be a key figure on Saturday . <p> The breakdowns are allowed to be way more of a contest by the northern hemisphere referees - Alain Rolland , who red-carded Warburton for a tip-tackle in the World Cup semi-final humdinger between the Welsh and France , is the man in charge on Saturday - but the Springboks will at least know the score thanks to the presence of Francois Louw , one of the stars of European rugby with Bath , and the specialist coaching of Scotsman Richie Gray . <p> The challenge is going to be a tough one for the Springboks but Meyer , with an eye on the 2015 World Cup in the same conditions , would n't want it any other way . <p> " I will be disappointed if the skies are clear .

@@641234 <p> The Democratic Alliance is fighting to show a united front in the internal fallout over the party 's apparent mistaken voting for the Employment Equity Act Amendment Bill . <p> DA parliamentarian Ian Ollis told the Mail &amp; Guardian on Monday that the party 's vote and subsequent media hype was a small blip in an otherwise successful election campaign and recent registration drive . " It 's electionitis : people get tense ahead of elections , " he said . " This will all blow over soon . " <p> But the incident , which saw the opposition party backtrack over their voting on the Bill , appears to have divided the party ideologically and seen at least two heads roll in a hasty reshuffle within the party 's shadow cabinet . <p> The Bill , with its race-based elements , flies in the face of the DA 's traditional opposition to racialised policy or legislation . The party 's support of the Bill angered its liberal members , particularly former leader Tony Leon who said the apparent race-based approach to empowerment put the party at a " crossroads " . <p> Mistake On Friday , Helen Zille said the DA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative errors , time constraints and misinformation . <p> " We dropped the ball ... Our representatives on the portfolio committee were inadequately prepared . The many and varied submissions on the Bill were rushed through the portfolio committee in four meetings . <p> " The long parliamentary recess intervened before the Bill went to the National Assembly and so we were unable to debate the implications of the Bill adequately in caucus ; when it did come before caucus , on the day it was due to be debated and voted on in the house , the explanatory memorandum produced by our spokespeople was defective . To make matters worse , we had five minutes literally to consider seven different Bills . " <p> She said the DA would propose amendments to the Bill in the next stage of the legislative process , at the National Council of Provinces ( NCOP ) and , if that failed , vote against the Bill . <p> " We will then also vote against the Bill when it returns to the National Assembly . We should have done this from the get-go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> However , former DA stalwart and political commentator Gareth van Onselen said Zille 's defence was disingenuous , pointing to a year long failure to engage with the Bill during which it was available for scrutiny . <p> " There can be no doubt this was not a matter of poor preparation at all , and Zille is being devious in saying so , it was a matter of profound ideological disagreement , ? " he said in a scathing column in Business Day . <p> Van Onselen believes the members who voted for the Bill , particularly the DA representative on the labour committee Sej Motau , did so in full knowledge and support of the Bill 's race-based element , and in ideological opposition to Zille and the party 's traditional position . <p> In her newsletter Zille said the party 's two representatives on the labour committee were " inadequately prepared " and their explanatory memorandum to the national caucus , on which basis it would have adopted a position , was " defective " . But Van Onselen argued that " if you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not ' inadequately prepared ' -- they made numerous contributions -- just they had the wrong position " . <p> Following Zille retraction , Motou said on Friday : " All I will say is that I stand by the vote .

@@641235 <p> The Assassin 's Creed franchise actually needs no introduction -- it has been one of the most successful gaming enterprises in the last couple of years . The Series has taken gamers on a whirl-wind journey through different time periods in history in search of answers and the elusive Templars . <p> A screenshot from Assassin 's Creed IV Black Flag ( image : Ubisoft ) <p> While the franchise has seen a number of titles , the fourth official game made its way to market last week . Gamers are in store for something completely different . <p> Assassin 's Creed IV Black Flag takes players into an era of swashbuckling pirates -- and for the first time the franchise took a step back in time , instead of following the natural progression of history . <p> Players will take control of Edward Kenway , father of Assassin 's Creed 3 villain Haytham Kenway ( who was the father of AC3 's protagonist Connor ) , as he navigates his way around the dangers and profitability of the Golden Age of Piracy . <p> What we like about it <p> Given a run-through on the controls and how to command Edward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the game . From the offset , players will realise that they are in for something special . <p> Those familiar with the franchise will find the controls refreshing , as not much has changed .

The Jackdaw can be upgraded and engineered to make use of better cannons , sails and hulls . Players will even be able to customise the wheel and battering ram . <p> Sailing the seas in search for Royal convoys to attack for large amounts of coins , or just cruising along the coast opens up a new dimension to the AC franchise . Where players were largely land-based for most of the franchise , they now have the ability to get their toes wet whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards . <p> In terms of plot , the title takes a step back and highlights the beginning of Kenway 's assassin career , and also explains a number of things from Assassin 's Creed 3 . While the plot is not as complicated as that which would define a Jeffery Archer novel , it has its fair share of twists and turns . Players will have to complete a number of different mission types to progress through the story , but the most annoying aspect is probably the tails and foot chases -- which have seemed to increase in the iteration ( explained below ) . <p> However , with that said , Assassin 's Creed IV Black Flag is one of the first semi open-world games that actually does pirates right , incorporating almost every aspect of pirate clich ? s into the title -- except , sadly , for the parrot on the shoulder . <p> What we do not like about it <p> Although the controls are easy to grasp , a problem still persists that has been plaguing the franchise : the characters seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anything , even when it not the intention of the player . It is as if the trigger points for wall-climbing are so sensitive , that when a player even remotely approaches a wall , it triggers the need to go up or over . Edward needs to slow down a little bit , which will make it more enjoyable -- especially during high-speed foot races . <p> While it is a constant and nagging problem throughout the franchise , there are also a number of inconsistent or odd choices being made by the characters -- or rather by the script writers . During the course of the title , players take to the high-seas in search of loot , missions or whaling . Players will also be able to attack enemy vessels and salvage their loot . <p> With some careful manoeuvring and cannon-firing , the enemy ship will go down . Now , the player will be presented with three choices : use the fallen ship to repair the Jackdaw , lower the player 's wanted level or send the vessel to the player 's fleet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger than the Jackdaw -- so why does Kenway not opt to use the larger vessel instead ? It makes strategic sense , but players are stuck with the smaller Jackdaw throughout the entire title . <p> Naturally the Jackdaw can be upgraded , but the cost of these upgrades are often so high , that players will benefit by just taking their chances with an enemy and hope for the best . In terms of graphics , the title has its moments where the graphical capabilities shine through -- even in just a glimpse -- but for the most part the current-gen consoles are starting to show their age . <p> Conclusion <p> It might seem a bit harsh , but Assassin 's Creed IV Black Flag is your typical Assassin 's Creed title , with no real innovation or changes -- except for the open-sea missions with the Jackdaw ( which is by far the highlight of the title ) . But that is what players like about the title -- they know exactly what they are going to get , even if it is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly enjoyable to dig into , despite for some awkward level designs and cheesy Abstergo Entertainment missions incorporating the Animus .

In fact , using the very scientific method of reviewing all my Ads of the Week , I 've decided on a " Top 10 " countdown of the best of the Best Ads of 2013 . Here they are , with no apologies , and no prizes : <p> Yellow Pages and agency 360eight hit this one out of the park for what may have previously been considered a conservative brand . In a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek ' mockumentary ' of the life of Henri Delatissier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted its very user-friendly website at www.yellowpages.co.za . <p> The message of the ad was simple : in a pinch , you do n't want to find Henri when you urgently need a plumber ( or a doctor or whatever ) . So the normal search engines wo n't be of much use . What you need is a site that allows you to find suppliers in your area . So , in this unique , humorous and clever ad , Yellow Pages brings its message home . <p> Like many in my shortlist , this ad uses humour to great effect . It features a fantastic actress who looks like a kugel from Sandton , but -- in a wonderfully South African role-reversal -- uses her command of isiZulu to put another customer in her place . ( The target of her diatribe is a woman who thought it would be safe to criticise the ' kugel ' for being indecisive . ) <p> It 's all about assumptions and stereotypes , while establishing the brand as a fast-food competitor that appeals to the everyman . <p> This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a dramatic , emotionally powerful recreation of Flight 1549 , the Airbus A320 that was forced to land in the Hudson River after a bird strike put both of its engines out of commission in January 2009 . <p> Filmed in New York , with awesome CGI done here in South AFrica , the TVC is a showcase for agency Brandlab and director Ian Gabriel of Giant Films . <p> The ad celebrates the soft-spoken Captain ' Sully ' Sullenberger 's heroic and professional actions in the face of extreme danger ; actions based on rational thinking and experience that saved the lives of 155 people . <p> he payoff line , that links the event to the banking group , is : " In the right hands , anything is possible . " <p> Humour , with a very distinctive South African twist , makes this ad one that 's sure to appeal to its target market . Normally , marketers want to make the brand the hero but , in a daring role-reversal , this piece of absurdist wackiness shows the product being demonised and abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou " , the ' mockumentary ' documents the life of Kreepy Wrangler Kris Jnr , who has dedicated his life to ridding South African pools of this ' wild animal ' -- the Kreepy Krauly . <p> The ad is made for YouTube , rather than TV , which allows for a longer , three-minute mini-movie that shows potential to go viral . It 's interesting and exciting to see the internet medium being used for entertainment that also has a message . <p> The video production was by Team Best , and the digital and seeding was done by Retroviral Digital . <p> A little girl stands up in front of her school and delivers a speech critical of the government -- surely one of the seminal moments in SA ad history this year . <p> The speech was a conglomeration of statements made by school children , as gathered by an independent research firm hired by the bank . The ruling party was deeply offended by the campaign , as was The Presidency . <p> We all know that the advert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , but it 's important to look at the marketing , brand and creative merits of this campaign . <p> To back up the campaign , FNB had a site www.youcanhelp.co.za , as well as social media footprints on Facebook and Twitter . ( #littlehelps ) . The website is still running , with ' stories of help ' as part of the bank 's continued involvement in social activism . <p> Before the political brouhaha , which evoked a whole range of emotions to the ad -- from anger to fear , and more politically measured responses -- came what I believe were more authentic , emotive responses . There was a genuine bristle of excitement ahead of the airing of the ads and the campaign certainly created a massive buzz . <p> The agency was MetropolitanRepublic . <p> So , that 's the first half of my ' Top 10 ' .

@@2011235 <p> Despite some market hesitation around the use of generic medication , there has been a 14% increase year-on-year since 2004 in the use of generics . <p> Affordability <p> " More and more South Africans are using generic medications purely because of the price.This is mainly driven by the funding industry which benchmarks what they will pay for a specific medicine for treatment of a certain disease , " says Dr Jacques Snyman MD : Integrated Risk Solutions at Agility Global Health Solutions ( Agility ) . This means that more patients now have access to medicines than before purely due to affordability as more medicines have become available on lower scheme options . <p> " According to current scheme data the level of generic use in South Africa is approximately 55% . This means there is significant scope for growth as the norm in Europe is closer to 75% , " says Dr Snyman.It is important to note that this is by and largely due to the fact that universal cover along the vein of the proposed NHI model has been entrenched in Europe for some time , and thus a single provider , the state , determines what will be reimbursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines registered by the regulatory authorities are of the same quality as branded medication . " Despite the fact that the active ingredient in both is of exactly the same weight , volume and quality of manufacturing , consumers tend to feel they are not obtaining the same quality of drug when using a generic . " <p> Evidence of consistency <p> According to Dr Snyman , for generic medication to qualify , there needs to be a certain amount of consistency to that of branded medication . " Clinical studies are conducted to determine , for example , if the drug absorption and movement of the molecule is similar to that of the innovator brand medication . Once you have evidence of consistency it has to be approved by the relevant regulatory authority . Only then do you have a generic multi-source equivalent . " <p> Dr Snyman notes that the misconception around generic medication also often derives from the substantial difference in price in comparison to branded medicines . The reason behind the price difference is due to the fact that the branded medication manufacturers have to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original , where this is not required for the generic form . <p> Within the industry , Doctor 's tend to predominantly prescribe the branded medicines as they are familiar with the brands . The trust and efficacy of the product has also been built over time . " Branded medication manufacturers spend money and time on marketing the clinical benefits rather than the cost benefits , which is appealing to doctors who are driven by research and evidence , " explains Dr Snyman . <p> You have a choice <p> From a consumer perspective , most do n't know the difference between a generic and a branded drug . It is therefore important that consumers educate themselves about the choice between generic and branded medication . " By law it is the pharmacist 's job to tell you there are generic drugs available and that you have a choice between the generic and branded option . However , it is also up to the consumer to enquire , " adds Dr Snyman . <p> Another option recently made available to consumers is so called clone medicine which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in different packaging . This helps to bring the cost down and is an option should you still want the " brand manufacturers " medicine . <p> Dr Snyman concludes , " Generic medicine provides consumers with the access to affordable medicines . Medical scheme members are encouraged to use generics or clones of medicines as this will not only assist in making their savings last longer but can also translate into reduction in co-payments .

@@2014234 <h> Can Nigeria Hit Bull 's Eye With Eco-Conservation ? <p> Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in the world , a country rich in natural and cultural heritage and a booming economy . Yet , serious issues of poverty , environmental , health and housing problems also plague it day by day making various stakeholders break heads while trying to make the life of Nigerians better . <p> As the President Goodluck Jonathan has now flagged-off a construction of a N960 billion housing scheme , life in Nigeria has given other innovative ideas for tackling some of the country 's challenges . Nigeria in recent years has made its steps towards eco-conservation by building its first house made completely out of plastic bottles . It seems that this time the bull 's eye has been hit by creating something unique and path breaking . <p> In a small village of Yelwa in northern Nigeria this solution provided a shelter in a poverty stricken country , found a way to refuse high costs of construction and suggested an idea how recycling can be used to build something that many Nigerians greatly desire . <p> A Kaduna-based NGO Development Association for Renewable Energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa Community Trust , a London-based NGO , has decided to put environmental hazards into a project to build an environmentally friendly house made from plastic bottles . <p> According to DARE , drinking tap water is considered unsafe in Nigeria . Many people , therefore , prefer bottled water . It means that millions of plastic bottles are dumped into landfills and waterways every year causing erosion , pollution , irrigation blockages and health problems . <p> Many Nigerians also suffer from the lack of affordable housing opportunities . According to Nigeria 's Federal Mortgage Bank , the country lacks around 16 million units that require at least $300 billion to meet the needs of the countrymen . <p> These issues spurred DARE to innovate and provide an example how some of the country 's challenges can be tackled by transferring " one man 's trash to another man 's fortune . " <p> The plastic bottle houses are insulated , sturdy and inexpensive . While the concrete foundation is laid to provide stable and firm grounds for the structure , the rest of the house is entirely made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil or construction waste , compacted with a stick to form a sort of ' brick ' and laid down in rows . They are then bound together with mud to construct walls . The sand filled bottles are considered to make houses almost twenty times stronger than brick constructions , making them resistant even to earthquakes . At the same time , sand also insulates the houses from the heat by maintaining a cool room temperature perfect for scorching Nigerian climate . Another boasting point is the bulletproof characteristics of the house . Despite the fact that some people around the world may find this fact entertaining , for violence stricken northern Nigeria such feature may be a blessing in disguise said Yahaya Ahmad , the project coordinator , to Physorg.com . Finally , the cost of the house is considered to be one third less expensive than houses built by brick and concrete . <p> These houses are also designed to produce zero carbon emissions as they are to be wholly powered by solar panels and methane gas from recycled human and animal waste . <p> . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single house consisting of a living room , bedroom , kitchen and toilet . These plastic bottle houses are built in a typical North Nigerian circular style and look spectacular from outside with the round bottoms of the bottle exposed in the rays of the sun . <p> Apart from eco-conservation , the project also provides opportunities for uplifting the street children from the life of poverty by providing them with work . Instead of begging , the children can fill the bottles with soil and get paid for it . <p> While at the start of the program in December 2011 the project has received sceptical responses , it now counts over 20 readily-available houses that have become landmarks of attraction for spectators from across the country . <p> As Nuhu Dangote , a trader who travelled from the state capital Kaduna to see the house , said : " I wanted to see this building for myself as I was surprised to hear it was built from plastic bottles ... the whole world should come and look at it .

The project is also aiming to embark on a new stage -- building of a school hall in Seluja at the Africa School of Excellence that will consist of 220,000 plastic bottles . " The project would take over 200,000 bottles out of landfills into education , " said Katrin Macmillan , a British environmental activist involved in the project . <p> Plastic bottled houses take this dangerous waste that takes hundreds of years to biodegrade and make it useful in ways of housing , employment , environmental protection and health . While Nigeria has already embarked on a path of reaching eco-friendly solutions to its challenges , it can become a model for other African countries how eco-conservatism can provide a combined way out of many African problems .

@@2019230 <p> According to Bloomberg data Tencent has delivered a return of 82.55% during the past year . <p> Drikus Combrinck , portfolio manager at PSG , says the Tencent share price , is also trading at record levels . <p> The bulk of Naspers 's net asset value of the last few years as well as the growth in its share price was derived from its stake in Tencent . This does not mean however that its other divisions have failed shareholders , although its print media division has been under pressure -- in line with international trends , he says . <p> Combrinck says Multichoice has performed fairly well and the company 's subscriber base in Africa outside of South Africa is growing . <p> Naspers also has a number of other investments in web-development businesses similar to Tencent in its early days , in emerging markets . <p> Valuation <p> Barker says the Naspers valuation has lagged behind the recent surge in the Tencent share price . <p> " At the moment if you back out the market value of Naspers 's listed investments , which is its stake in Tencent and its stake in Mail.ru , then the current Naspers share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , net of its debt , is essentially zero , " he says . <p> But the value of these businesses is clearly not zero , he says . <p> Combrinck says there will always be a discount on Tencent 's value if bought through Naspers .

Holding it through an investment holding company like Naspers , would always imply a significant discount to value . <p> Sustainable ? <p> Combrinck says the last few years have shown that the company 's performance is not sustainable over the very long term . <p> He says the question is probably when the music will stop for Tencent , since Naspers derives most of its value from the company . <p> However , Naspers is currently developing a number of other investments and Tencent wo n't be the only large contributor to value creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinvested a lot of its cash into existing businesses which have resulted in top-line growth , but it has n't really flowed through to the bottom line . <p> While this is some cause for concern , there is still a bit of a " discount cushion " in the Naspers share price if something goes wrong at Tencent , he says . <p> Barker says as long as the Tencent share price remains strong , the conclusion would have to be that the Naspers share price should go higher . <p> " The only thing that would stop that is if you saw a decline in the value of Tencent and I am not sure that you are going to see that , frankly . " <p> Barker says the bottom line is that if an investor has a long-term investment view , which is important when playing the stock market , the share still offers value . <p> He says the factors boosting Tencent and Naspers 's other assets , are the growing availability and usefulness of the internet in emerging markets . <p> " That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He says it plays to both internet and broadband penetration which are growing and also to expanding consumption in emerging markets , which is expected to run for some time . <p> Still a buy ? <p> Combrinck says Naspers 's current price-earnings ratio of over 50 , does not take into account that web-based development costs have to be accounted for in its income statement . <p> In terms of accounting standards , the bulk of these costs may not be capitalised , because it is difficult to quantify the value created for the company when it develops a website . <p> If these expenses are stripped out and figures are normalised , the price-earnings ratio is closer to 30 , which is in line with what a growth company like Naspers should trade at , he says . <p> " It is not overly expensive at these levels but I think there is still a lot of risk inherent in a company like Tencent .

In that sense , it 's probably best to be realistic ( rather than outright condemn ) and make an appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even parental participation . <p> Lourens Jordaan <p> I recently learned of a woman who bought her 10 year old GTA5 . She said that she knows what the game is about . The point is that no ten year old can be ready for the very mature content within GTA5 . Every body is free to raise ( read screw up ) their kids however they want , but that borders on the corruption of a minor . That I will condemn . <p> Her Highness the Hipster <p> mixed feelings on this one . I read a lot of really graphic material as a young kid , and often watched R rated movies , too . my mom knew what i was reading/watching , but also knew I was mature enough to handle it . that said , there were other movies/books that were rated as more appropriate that i often found more upsetting or that she would tell me to wait on . I think it 's a matter of knowing your child and what will affect them negatively . <p> Lourens Jordaan <p> I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from accessing the material , and you make him understand that he is not allowed to play the game , he 'll still find a way to do it , but he 'll know you disapprove . That way you can limit his exposure to the few hours at a friends house . If you buy it for him , knowing it 's not age appropriate , then he has unlimited exposure to potentially harmful material . Even though I think my child is mature enough to have access to the material , knowing that there is the potential of harm would give me pause . Of course parenting concerning age appropriate matter is not limited to the above .
