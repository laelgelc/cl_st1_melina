@@7610237 <p> By the end ... it was a sobering reminder for Chelsea that when it comes to the hierarchy of European football there is no longer a place for them at the top table . They might have unfathomable riches , fierce ambitions and some high reputations , but so do teams such as Paris Saint-Germain and , for a second successive season , the French champions had the personnel to reach the quarter-finals to a celebratory chorus of La Marseillaise from the away end . <p> Laurent Blanc 's team still look short , perhaps , of the smooth excellence regularly witnessed by the crowds at Barcelona , Bayern Munich and , on their good days , Real Madrid , but they were still a good degree superior to Chelsea and , in the process , it was another fine night to be Zlatan Ibrahimovic . In this fixture last year the Swede was sent off after 31 minutes . He looked affronted by the memory , laying on PSG 's opening goal for Adrien Rabiot and effectively killing the tie with the close-range volley that made it 4-2 on aggregate and meant Chelsea needed to score three times in little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibrahimovic never played well against English opposition but he made sure of showing his better qualities here . ? ngel Di Mar ? a was not far behind in the list of outstanding performers , no matter the mistake that led to Diego Costa making it 1-1 , and the 2012 winners must have left the pitch knowing it might be a long way back to the top . Tenth in the Premier League , Guus Hiddink talked about " lost terrain " and admitted it might be some time before their next European tie . <p> Chelsea put in a spirited effort and will reflect on the attack , a minute or so before Ibrahimovic 's goal , when Kevin Trapp made two saves in quick succession to keep out Willian and Eden Hazard . Ultimately , however , Chelsea 's leading players did not rise to the occasion and they lost their defensive structure , as they have so many times this season .

As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2014-15 double player of the year after another peripheral performance . <p> Chelsea thus could not keep up their fine record of saving themselves in this kind of assignment , having gone through eight times in the previous 13 ties when they have lost the first match . It is coming up for five years since they last played a home match in this competition without scoring and if we are being generous , perhaps it might have been a different conclusion if Costa had remained on the pitch . <p> Hiddink talked of them being " too respectful " in the opening part of the game and having lost 2-1 in Paris three weeks ago , the first telling blow came after 16 minutes . Di Mar ? a had quickly made it clear he was determined to have a prominent role and it was his pass that sent Ibrahimovic clear on the right . Kenedy , Chelsea 's young left-back , had deserted his post . Branislav Ivanovic did not follow Ibrahimovic 's run and these small lapses had considerable ramifications . Ibrahimovic slid the ball across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy even before Rabiot applied the final touch at the far post . Ibrahimovic knew the pass had been weighted beautifully . <p> With a 3-1 aggregate lead , PSG promptly threatened to make it a stress-free night , knocking the ball around with the confidence that might be expected of a team who have turned Ligue 1 into a procession . Costa , however , was focused and forceful from the start . He has seldom looked better since last season 's opening months at the club and in the middle part of the game there were glimpses of the stubborn streak that has been the hallmark of the more productive Chelsea teams . <p> After 27 minutes , Di Mar ? a had a sudden and unexpected wave of his old Manchester United form , dithering in the centre of the pitch and allowing Pedro to dispossess him .

Costa took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva with great determination and aimed a low shot beyond the oncoming Trapp . <p> Unfortunately for Chelsea , Costa 's exertions finished with him aggravating the tendon problem that kept him out of the game against Stoke last weekend and that was a significant setback given the problems he was creating for PSG 's all-Brazilian defence . Bertrand Traor ? bounded on , offering youthful energy , but he did not have Costa 's simmering presence and Chelsea missed their leading scorer . <p> The game was still open at that stage but midway through the second half Di Mar ? a reminded everyone of his penetrative qualities with some brilliantly effective wide play . Thiago Motta 's pass was expertly delivered in the buildup and the Argentinian , operating for the most part in an elusive central role , had peeled away on the left .

One day , as a man was passing by elephants held by a circus troop , he suddenly stopped , confused by the fact that these massive creatures were held captive only with a thin rope tied to their front leg . There were no chains , no cages . It was obvious that the elephants could , at any time , break away from their bonds . But for some reason , they did not . <p> He asked their trainer as to why these animals merely stood still and made no attempt to get away . " Well , " trainer said , " when they were very young , we used the same rope to tie them up . At that age , it was enough to tie them down . As they grew up , they have been conditioned to believe they can not break away . They believe the rope will still hold them back , and because of that , they never try to break free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote , birds in cages believing that flying is an illness and grown elephants tied down by the same rope that held them in their infancy , believing it still has power over them . <p> It is crazy to realise that no matter what our backgrounds are , we have been raised to keep silent , to appreciate the status quo , to stay quiet and toil incessantly in order to fill our material needs , rather than to get into trouble with the authorities . <p> This is glaringly obvious when one observes Malaysian university students . University is where students have the opportunity to explore ideas , challenge the status quo and learn new ideas . It is a place where we can afford to fall , pick ourselves up and move on wiser . <p> Nonetheless , when it comes to challenging political thought and engaging in student activism , university students in Malaysia have been rendered impotent since 70s , no thanks to the UUCA . Recent examples of the state of our higher education system can clearly be seen in examples such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest hint of a progressive student movement . <p> Interestingly , and unfortunately enough , we observe the same mentality with students ( even non-scholars ) who have the privilege to study in universities overseas . We see educated , ( sometimes ) liberal , middle/upper class Malaysians going overseas to study with this very same mentality . <p> Years of propaganda and instillation of fear in Malaysians have formed an imaginary chain around them even when free of iron fist of Malaysian authorities . It has become apparent that young Malaysians go overseas with the same state of mental oppression . <p> Take for example what we have done in KPUM ( United Kingdom and Eire Malaysian Law Students ' Union ) in the past year and what Cassandra Chung 's ( also a proud KPUM alumni ) petition has recently done . Essentially , we decided that we should start taking a stand on the things we believe is right and just . <p> As students who have been privileged enough to be exposed to World Class education , and are able to realise the full extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we decided to act on our academic opinion and personal conscience . These are basically things that NORMAL student unions and student bodies in overseas universities would do . <p> It is in fact the very purpose of their existence as student interest groups . It is not rocket science that student groups should speak up . But it would seem that recent developments have gotten gasps of horror among the Malaysian students ' circle in the UK . <p> " Oh no they are getting themselves into trouble , " " oh no she will be arrested , " " oh no the authorities will be after them , " " oh no , how young and unwise , " " HOW BRAVE , " " oh no what if the High Commission calls her in , " <p> This baffles me . You can speak your mind , create petitions in the UK and university authorities and students would hardly bat an eyelid on the matter , and neither will they think for a second that you have embarrassed your country . Most would understand that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The pure fact is that there is nothing the Malaysian authorities can do to you when you are overseas and privately sponsored . There is absolutely nothing that can be done to you personally . Please wake up and realise that there are no chains around your legs and that they are all imaginary . <p> The last time Malaysian students were threatened with any action upon their return to Malaysia was in the 80s and that was before the time of the internet , which is probably why you have never heard about it . The rest of us came back to this " cage " fine and unscratched . <p> I can not understand how privileged Malaysians , especially privately sponsored , would gasp at such actions and admire those who would speak up . I think it is an absolute waste of opportunity when you are strategically placed with no restraints , which is so much better off than your counterparts in Malaysia , and yet do nothing ! <p> At this point , it is only appropriate that I quite the famous phrase by Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph is for good men to do nothing .

I 'm particularly proud to see the ripple effects of how UKEC ( United Kingdom &amp; Eire Council of Malaysian Students ) and now Nottingham Malaysian Society taking their baby steps forward after KPUM started to flap its small wings in its small ways last year . <p> I hope that following " Cassandra-gate " that more Malaysian students and student groups overseas will realise that the " rope " on their ankles is merely imaginary and that they will be able to use their very privileged position to push for a better Malaysia from where they are , because really there will not be a better opportunity than this . <p> Epilogue <p> To be very fair to the target audience of this article , there may be counter-arguments about how pressure is also mounting about academic success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may be arguments about how many would prefer to stay outside these matters for future employment reasons . <p> There are also arguments about how some are simply not interested and you can not force them to be interested . My question would then be whether these reasons justify the apathy . What are the options left then ? Do we just let " politicians " and " activists " do their job and complain when they do n't ? Or do we just carry on with life ? <p> Either way , I believe this is worth discussing . <p> * Pang Jo Fan is former president of KPUM 2014/2015 . <p> ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail Online .

@@7748231 <p> AAhhh . How ... miss my school days . I studied at Tarcisian Convent , Ipoh ( All my TCS homies say heyyyooo ! ) . And bruh , it was one of the best periods of my life . So I have listed down 20 things I learnt from my all-girls school . <p> 1 . A pinafore can be styled in about 54 ways . <p> I 'm not even kidding . We all be wearing the same pinafore but when you look closely , you can see we all have our different styles . EG : the buckle opened , collars spiked up , unbuttoned buttons , the buckle open with the zip undone all the way . Some go the extra mile and wear the pinkest , most neon-est bra which can obviously be seen through the white shirt . <p> 2 . There 's a little Lesbian in all of us . <p> We are all mostly straight but girls from a convent school or an all-girls school can relate to this . Y'all have that senior who you look up to and " admire " . Sounds familiar ? That 's what I thought . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school and I can remember all those small cat fights and enemies I had in school . And , I also know that those things does n't last . Now , whenever I meet them , I 'm more than happy to say Hi and exchange a few words of care . <p> 4 . If you buy milo ais during recess , you 're rich AF . <p> Milo ais was expensive back then about 70 cents , i think ? But it was a huge sum of money to spend on a drink and when one of your friends buy one , you ca n't help but think that they are probably super wealthy . <p> 5 . Being a prefect means you break the rules without getting caught . <p> I was a prefect and I have used that to my advantage more than once . Go late for class and when the teacher asks why , I 'd say , " Tugas cikgu " . Pretty much all the prefects can relate to this . Teachers day celebration and the entire prefectorial board is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kononnya helping out with the preparation . Aaahh good days . <p> 6 . Staybacks are not always for studying purposes . <p> How many of y'all stayed back in school just to loiter around with your friends ? Rightttttt . We 'd be hanging out at the padang , sipping our coke and just enjoying the fact that you 're at school doing nothing . <p> 7 . Friends come in all shapes and sizes . <p> No , I do n't mean fat or skinny . I mean they all have different attitudes and multiple personalities . But we accept everyone just the way they are and embrace everyone 's weirdness . Cause let 's face it , we convent girls are pretty weird . <p> 8 . Male teachers <p> HAHA . DO N'T EVEN DENY THIS ! We shipped everyone with any of the male teachers . My school had 3 male teachers and I pity them , man . I remember one of my friends had to give out an award to a male teacher for Teacher 's Day and the entire hall shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hilarious as hell . Yeah , we handle testosterone pretty well . *pats back* <p> 9 . Crying is for the weak . <p> Those from a co-ed school or a boy 's school may think that when you step into a Convent school , all you can hear is girls crying with all the simultaneous PMS that 's going on . BUT BRUH , let me tell you something . A girl from a convent school does not cry easily . Go test it out if you dare . <p> 10 . We slayed during PJ ( Pendidikan jasmani ) <p> And by slayed , I mean we played musang dan ayam or harimau dan kambing . Where the tallest girl becomes the Mak Ayam . LMAO Now , let me tell you . If there was a olympic game of musang dan ayam , Malaysia will be grabbing all the medals . <p> 11 . Period announcements . <p> " Hey , why she did n't come school one week adi la ? " " Oh , you do n't know ah ? She got her period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house arrest " . *In an extremely loud voice* And BOOM , the entire school knows . When you come to school the next week , better be ready with a face mask to cover your humility . Harhar <p> 12 . Girls can carry heavy things . <p> Boys are practically mythical creatures in a convent school and ai n't no one needs them to carry heavy things . We girls can carry anything . Once , me and my friends even carried our friend who could n't walk . How bout that ? <p> 13 . Different groups/gangs do exists . <p> We all have our different gangs who we usually hangout during recess with . You know , that one table or spot during recess which is reserved for your gang . Someone else better not take that spot . <p> 14 . Study groups barely work . <p> Study groups do n't work unless exam is tomorrow and you need to pass badly . Study groups are usually 10 minutes of flipping the book and 50 minutes of chatting about everything . <p> 15 . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Birthday parties are a pretty big deal in convent school and if you get invited to one , you 'd be the happiest person . Discussing what to wear and what to buy for the birthday girl . The parties are usually pretty simple with games and food . NO we do n't get drunk or anything like that . pfft . <p> 16 . Silent reading is actually not silent at all . <p> My experience with silent reading is that its the time to gather up everyone and talk ghost stories . My teachers are cool af as they let us do what we want during silent reading most of the time la . Silent reading is probably the noisiest period . <p> 17 . Tuition centres made us realise that an all girl school is heaven . <p> Cause boys are annoying . Kiddingggg <p> 18 . Goodbyes are hard . <p> That last day of school . We balled our eyes out . I remember in form 2 , at the end of the year my entire class were in tears because the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd still be in the same school , just different class . Geez , attached much ? <p> 19 . Meetups are even harder . <p> After school , it 's SO DAMN DIFFICULT to get everyone together and probably never will . <p> 20 . High school friends last a lifetime . <p> High school friends are definitely gon na be there to annoy me for the rest of my life and maybe even after . You know the saying , " Best friends are made in High schools " ? You do n't know ? That 's cause I just made it up . Harhar . TBH , it 's amazing how friends from high school stay as friends despite going on different paths and not meeting up for long periods . That 's true friendship right there ! <p> And that 's the 20 things I learned from studying in a Convent school . If you liked it and could relate to it , do let me know .

@@7767232 <h> Advertisement <p> MARCH ... -- For the past 15 months Brazil 's prosecutorial authorities have been trying to nab former president Luiz In ? cio Lula da Silva , or Lula , more popularly . He 's accused of corruption during his term in office between 2003 and 2010 , particularly for owning of a luxurious condominium in S ? o Bernardo do Campo , a posh beachside suburb near S ? o Paulo . <p> He had not paid for it . And between 2011 and 2014 he 's alleged to have amassed bribes totalling US$8 million ( RM32.49 million ) . <p> Investigators claim the conduit between Lula and his corrupters is Petrobas , the state oil company . On March 8 Marcelo Odebreacht , head of a major construction firm , was sentenced to 19 years imprisonment for corruption . Join the dots . <p> Meanwhile , investigating judge S ? rgio Moro widened the dragnet , laya jato ( literally meaning car wash ) . So far it has snared top politicians and business people in the Petrobas scandal . And ordinary Brazilians have found rare solace in their country 's justice system , bagging scores of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilma Rousseff , who replaced Lula , is besieged by a growing public revolt . Millions of Brazilians have marched on their streets in more than 400 cities to show Rousseff their distrust , displeasure and disgust for her incompetence and worsening corruption in Brazil , one of the BRICs often lauded to lead world economic growth this century . But what chance that this sort of juridic will rub off in Russia , India and China ? <p> Form has it that Vladimir Putin would never move against his cronies unless he has reason to permanently silence them . Nor would he allow Russian institutions to investigate him . He owns them . <p> But China 's President Xi Jinping seems a cut above his BRICs counterparts . He has taken the sledgehammer to corruption . Or has he ? <p> It 's hard to get an accurate number of Chinese officials and business people who have been investigated and either jailed or executed for corruption . The most high-profile so far are the former Chongqing Communist Party boss Bo Xilai and his wife , Gu Kailai . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century . <p> The Sinologist John Lee claims all 200,000 party officials investigated in 2013 were found guilty of corruption . And one or two other heavyweights , like Zhou Yongkang , bureaucrats and executives of state-owned firms were also investigated in Xi 's campaign of " swatting flies " and " killing tigers . " <p> Crackdowns like this give Xi a popularity bounce but the chimera ca n't be missed . Most corruption cases involve " small fry " even by China 's standards . Televised courtroom trials amount to " sacrificial lamb " shows , and for good reason . <p> The Chinese Communist Party 's longevity relies on questionable forms of political legitimacy that 's overwhelmingly lent by party members . The party 's leadership showers upon them considerable largesse in an embroidery of patron-client networks . <p> They reciprocate by assuring the CCP 's untroubled rule . Nowhere is this mutuality more glaring than among China 's urban elite . They 're amenable to the party co-opting them , knowing the authoritarian system will yield to their material advantage . <p> By the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 legislators were among nearly 1,300 Chinese who had accumulated US$500 billion ( RM2.028 trillion ) in combined net worth . That 's almost twice Malaysia 's US$338 billion GDP . <p> And nearly all of the 85 million CCP members have direct or indirect business interests . Worse is still ahead . China 's economic model looks broken . <p> Xi will need magic powers to stamp out corruption in his party that 's also poisoning the economy , particularly the state-run sector that he keeps bailing out . His biggest worry should be is the inevitable re-ordering of the Chinese social structure . <p> Curiously one country in Southeast Asia , though not exclusively , has been exhibiting similar toxicity with Chinese characteristics -- Malaysia . Like Xi , prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has been personalising power while he endures growing pressure on him to resign for corruption allegations . <p> His Malay party Umno is much like China 's CCP : It breeds corruption within its rank and file , with the largesse controlled by Umno 's hierarchy . Increasingly this either has or soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him insurmountable dictatorial power , more than former strongman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad ever had . <p> As long as Najib and Umno keep dishing out the largesse and provide jobs for Malays within a hopelessly bloated , inefficient and politically pliant bureaucracy and government-linked companies sector , Najib will ride out the corruption storm . <p> That 's not the same as saying that he has the stomach to staunch the manic corruption that historically runs through Malaysia 's veins . Nor would he , like Xi , book top politicians , bureaucrats and business cronies for corruption . Najib is content to offer in piecemeal " small fish " to placate the Malay majority . <p> Even business in Malaysia recently re-iterated that it 's least worried about corruption and good governance , but political " stability " is critical . Naturally . Stability is code for certainty that the old political-business nexus keeps flourishing . <p> Malaysia 's rentier capitalists will keep reeking billions of dollars through opaque state contracts and avoid paying taxes . Domestic capital and profits will flee to tax havens or purchase questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly failed to bring a rigorous system of democracy and accountability to countries like Malaysia .

Rule of threes <p> Death strikes not once , twice , but three times ... and celebrities are hardly immune . This well-known death superstition states that deaths , especially those of the famous , occur in groups of three . Sadly , you need not look far for an example .

At the end of a funeral ceremony , red thread is passed around to signify the end of the ban . This red thread is also tied on the doorknobs of guests ' homes to ward off evil spirits . <p> 3 . Three on a match <p> Here 's a reason to quit smoking : If you 're third in line to light your cigarette from the same match , you just might wind up dead . While the exact source of this death superstition is unknown , many trace it back to wary soldiers from the wars of the late-19th and early-20th centuries : the first to strike a match would catch the attention of the enemy ; as the second soldier lit his cigarette the enemy took aim ; by the time the third soldier was ready to light up , the enemy fired away . <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the Victorian era , mirrors were believed to reflect one 's soul .

Beware the birds <p> Cultures around the world have long associated birds with the spirit world . Sparrows are believed to carry souls into the afterlife , and to kill one brings bad luck .

@@8489239 <h> Translated by Google ... : <p> WASHINGTON ( April 26 ) : The top U.S. banking regulator on Tuesday released its proposal for establishing a Net Stable Funding Ratio , a final piece in the puzzle to strengthen banks ' liquidity in case they come under financial stress . <p> The ratio is intended to ensure liquidity over a one-year horizon , compared with the liquidity coverage ratio of 2014 , requiring banks to hold high-quality assets that could be readily converted into cash within 30 days . The ratio will " discourage reliance on more volatile short-term funding , " the FDIC said in its proposal . <p> " During the financial crisis , a number of large banking organizations failed , or experienced serious difficulties , in part because of severe liquidity problems , " said FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg . " The proposed rule would reduce the vulnerability of large banking organizations to the kind of collapse in liquidity that occurred to the crisis . " <p> The proposal is in line with the international Basel standard set in 2015 , according to the FDIC . It differs primarily by providing a narrower definition of a " high-quality liquid asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The NSFR would apply to bank holding companies and depository institutions with US$250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or US$10 billion or more in foreign exposure . <p> The Federal Reserve Board will release a less-stringent version for holding companies with at least US$50 billion in assets that are not considered as big a risk to the financial system , the FDIC said . <p> The ratio would not apply to smaller holding companies , community banks , and nonbanking firms the federal government has designated " systematically important . " <p> Fifteen holding companies would have to comply with the full rule , and another 20 with the modified version , according to the proposal 's cost-benefit analysis . <p> The regulator expects the ratio , effective as of Jan 1 , 2018 , to inspire few industry changes , estimating nearly all companies are already able to meet its requirements . <p> Banks , though , are concerned about an " already crowded field of recent rules targeting liquidity risk , " said Jeremy Newell , general counsel of The Clearing House Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are already very real concerns about whether the cumulative effect of these rules is unduly restricting the maturity transformation that is essential to the role that banks play in supporting economic growth , " he said . <p> The " required stable funding amount , " the part of the ratio that will likely generate the most debate among bankers , looks at assets , derivatives exposures and commitments using a set of standardized weightings .

It emphasizes long-term debt , capital instruments , and insured deposits , according to the FDIC . <p> By requiring banks " to maintain more stable funding to support less liquid assets " the rule would cut the risk that a bank would need to sell off assets at fire-sale prices to meet liquidity demands , the FDIC said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@8841239 <h> Premier League Matchday ... Week 38 Sunday <p> Leicester City taught us a lot this season , including how to pronounce the name . What lessons are in store for the final Sunday ? - Rob Stothard/Getty Images <p> The title has been decided along with the relegation battle , but plenty of drama remains surrounding Champions League and Europa League spots . More importantly , of course , this is your last chance to grab fantasy glory ! It 's a truly beautiful day as all 10 matches take place simultaneously , so do n't hesitate to get your fingers flipping on your remote control and tapping away at the keyboard ! <p> With so much already decided , there certainly is n't as much to play for as the average fan and avid fantasy player would prefer . That said , the added uncertainty ca n't help but bring plenty of excitement as we agonize trying to predict who will start and which players will deliver . <p> Arsenal needs only a draw against visiting Villa to secure third place , while Tottenham requires the same result at Newcastle for second place . Of course , that means the Gunners require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long string of St. Totteringham 's Day celebrations going . With both squads facing relegated sides , Tottenham has to be favored to break the streak and finish above their bitter North London rivals , but can they really conquer the jinx ? <p> Without recently sacked manager Roberto Martinez , Everton welcomes relegated Norwich , and the Toffees have to feel an enormous weight lifted off their shoulders , albeit combined with some measure of guilt as well . After strong starts to the season , Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku have hit the skids and a big finale would do wonders for their summer frames of mind . ( Lukaku has 18 goals on the season , but none in his last eight games ; meanwhile , Barkley has eight goals and eight assists , but no goals and only one assist in his past 13 games . ) <p> With things already well wrapped up , Leicester City does not have much motivation at Chelsea , but then again what could be better than capping off its Cinderella season with a victory over last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle with Diego Costa out injured and Willian 's fitness a question mark , but Eden Hazard has more than picked up the slack of late as it 's not just this season 's top team against last year 's , but a battle of consecutive Player of the Year winners with Hazard featuring against Riyad Mahrez in a thrilling midfield match-up . <p> West Ham 's brilliant midweek comeback win may just have dashed Manchester United 's hopes for nicking the vital fourth place spot , but there is still a chance in the form of a win against Bournemouth combined with a Manchester City loss at Swansea . The former would be no surprise at all , while the latter would not be an unheard of shock as the Swans have impressed recently with victories over Arsenal , Chelsea , Liverpool and West Ham , earning a contract extension for manager Francesco Guidolin . <p> Southampton needs a victory over visiting Crystal Palace combined with a West Ham draw at Stoke or a Manchester United loss for a Europa League spot . Given that Palace will likely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Hammers ' Dimitri Payet is out injured , the Saints have plenty of cause for optimism . <p> Watford should be expected to play its heart out trying to leave manager Quique Sanchez Flores a nice parting gift , while Sunderland 's Sam Allardyce may rest several of his players who are surely exhausted after avoiding relegation with huge victories over Chelsea and Everton in the recent double game week . <p> Speaking of rotation , Liverpool will look to the aforementioned F.A . Cup Final against Palace , which should give the fans at the Hawthorns a good shot at a party . <p> As the truly **26;0;TOOLONG 2015-16 season winds to a close , let 's take a look back at some memorable takeaways : <p> We all know the fairy tale story of Leicester City . But add in Tottenham and this will be the first time that two teams outside of the five squad fiefdom of **36;28;TOOLONG City/Manchester United have finished in the top four since all the way back in 1995-96 when Newcastle and Aston Villa joined Manchester United and Liverpool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since 2002-03 , while Manchester City could possibly do so for the first time since 2010-11 . <p> Speaking of Chelsea , the Blues have had the worst finish of any defending Premier League title holder ever ( the Premier League began in 1992-93 ) . The best Chelsea can finish is 9th place , while it could slip as far down as 10th . Previously , 7th place was the worst fall ( Blackburn in 1995-96 and Manchester United in 2013-14 ) . <p> In a season year where Leicester 's Claudio Ranieri won his first major title anywhere , managers from Chelsea ( Jose Mourinho ) , Liverpool ( Brendan Rodgers ) and Manchester City ( Manuel Pellegrini ) were all sacked or otherwise let go while skippers from Arsenal ( Arsene Wenger ) and Manchester United ( Louis Van Gaal ) have both been under heavy pressure for most of the campaign and either or both could yet suffer the same fate following the finale . <p> Mesut Ozil currently has 18 assists .

As well , if Vardy and/or Kane win , they would be the first **40;66;TOOLONG City/Manchester United player(s) to don the Golden Boot since Sunderland 's Kevin Phillips in 1999-2000 . Meanwhile , Sergio Aguero would be the first repeat winner since ... well , not that long ago , since Robin Van Persie turned the trick in 2012-13 , although interestingly for a different team ( Manchester United ) than in 2011-12 ( Arsenal ) . <p> Leicester City have 80 points . If they lose or tie , they would finish with the fewest points by a champ since Manchester United in 2010-11 , while if they win it would merely be the fewest since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foxes have 10 more points than second place Spurs . The last time there was a double digit difference between the top two squads was 2012-13 when Manchester United was 11 up on Manchester City . The last time there was a 12 point gap was 2004-05 ( Chelsea and Arsenal ) , while the last time there was a 13 point gulf was all the way back in 1999-2000 ( Manchester United and Arsenal ) . <p> Vardy ( 24 goals ) and Riyad Mahrez ( 17 goals ) have combined to score 41 goals . That 's the most prolific combination by any pair of teammates since ... well , not very long ago as Liverpool 's Luis Suarez ( 31 ) and Daniel Sturridge ( 21 ) combined for 52 in 2013-14 . But before that you have to go back a bit further to Chelsea 's Didier Drogba ( 29 ) and Frank Lampard ( 22 ) who managed 51 together in 2009-10 . <p> Tottenham is tops with a +38 goal differential . Unless Spurs can beat Newcastle by at least three , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +33 mark in 1996-97 . <p> Manchester City leads the league with 70 goals scored . It needs to notch at least two goals to finish as the least prolific top scoring club since Chelsea and Manchester United 's 72 in 2005-06 ; otherwise it would be the fewest since Blackburn 's 68 all the way back in 1992-93 . <p> Aston Villa has won only once this season on the road . ONE STINKING WIN ! ( The first game of the season against Bournemouth , to boot . ) That 's the fewest since 2009-10 when West Ham and Burnley also won just once and Hull City failed to get even a single victory away from home . Coincidentally , Villa has only 17 points ; without a victory over Arsenal it will finish as the worst team since Derby County ( 11 points ) in 2007-08 , while otherwise it would be merely the worst since Portsmouth ( 19 points ) in 2009-10 . <p> Who is the fantasy MVP ? Well , it depends on the format .

Just look at SAM Engineering &amp; Equipment ( M ) Bhd 's numbers and you get a sense that it is really helping the company . SAM Engineering posted a 13.1% increase in earnings to RM17.4mil for its fourth quarter ended March 31 , boosted by a higher profit from its aerospace segment . <p> The other reason for venturing into the small car segment is that by looking at Perodua 's performance , it 's that segment that , while having a hiccup or two , still attracts buyers in the Malaysian car market . <p> The only problem is that those projects will take time to digest . In the interim , UMW 's debt will rise , but the one thing UMW has shown is that cyclical businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in a position to not only benefit from its traditional core business but also from the new ventures it is going into . <p> King Koil acquisition <p> The decision by Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd ( KPS ) to pay a whopping RM115.93mil in cash to obtain a 60% stake in the King Koil mattress brand licensing business raises some questions . Businesses like King Koil , which entail the manufacturing and marketing of consumer products around the world and dealing with stiff competition , typically requires strong entrepreneurial leadership . Hence , any acquirer of controlling stakes in such businesses would have to have vast experience in running the daily operations of similar businesses . Does KPS have that experience ? <p> In the announcement , KPS says that it " will drive the improvement of operational effectiveness and efficiency , particularly in ensuring the preservation of the King Koil brand value via defined brand positioning , targeted marketing strategy and enhancement of quality control measures . " Achieving that will not be an easy task . The announcement also does not state clearly how profitable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings multiple KPS is paying for this business . Paying RM115.93mil in cash for a 60% stake values the business at some RM193.2mil . Giving it a conservative earnings multiple of say 10 times , this would mean that the King Koil business KPS is buying is making an annual profit of around RM19mil . Is the business that profitable ? <p> To be fair , the filings reveal that the business being acquired has been consistently generating profits with double-digit earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation margins of over 25% from 2010 to 2014 . The business also has been paying out around 80% of profits as dividends ( although actual figures are not revealed ) . KPS says that the target company has an attractive business model - " the brand licensing business model represents high growth potential , as the revenue is mainly derived from the collection of royalty payments based on the terms of the licence agreements . The business also requires minimal capital expenditure in the future . " <p> That may well be the case , but the bottom line is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick reactions to changes in market conditions , to name a few . <p> Time will tell if KPS will be able to achieve this in the running of the business .

They stated that they are " gravely concerned with the seemingly increasing disregard for the fundamentals of democracy by the Federal Government and key institutions of the nation . " <p> They argued that the situation is critical due to the increasingly strident and combative tone that the Government and institutions have adopted in dealing with criticisms . <p> In particular , Hakam said that they are worried about the state of our race and religious relations , the administration of justice , the freeness and fairness of elections , and the spread of corruption . <p> As solutions they proposed for the separation of the role of the Public Prosecutor from that of the Attorney General , reforming of the electoral processes , repeal of suppressive laws , and the improvement or creation of important institutions such as the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission , the Malaysian Judicial Appointments Commission , the office of the Inspector General of Police ( IGP ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I share Hakam 's concerns about the situation in our country . Our current trajectory is wrong and we certainly must urgently fix the situation . <p> I am really glad that in their statement , Hakam included the call for the constitutional reform to separate the role of the Public Prosecutor from that of the Attorney General . This has been our call too and we need more civil society organisations to voice the same demand to make this happen . It is great to see that Hakam has officially made public their support for this agenda . <p> The Attorney General can not continue to be Public Prosecutor at the same time . Instead , I believe the Attorney General should play the only the role of chief legal adviser to the government . Prosecutorial decisions should be left to another office so that decisions can be made without any political considerations . This reform is the only way to return trust to the this important institution . <p> In fact , it is not enough for this to remain just a civil society agenda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ' time , I urge politicians to consider making this important reform as a manifesto commitment . <p> However I disagree with Hakam 's call for MACC to be given prosecutorial power . While I share their desire to see our anti-corruption body be elevated to a higher position and protected by the Federal Constitution , I do not think the MACC needs to have its own prosecution power . <p> Giving the MACC prosecution power will create a new conflict of interest . The MACC will feel greater pressure to prosecute because they themselves conducted the investigation . This will be unfair to the accused . That is why it is better to separate the roles of investigator and prosecutor . <p> Instead the problem can be resolved by separating the role of Public Prosecutor from that of Attorney General . It is the office of the Attorney General that needs to be reformed . There is no need to give prosecutorial powers to the MACC whose role is to investigate . <p> I also support Hakam 's call to create the IPCMC . In this instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be looked at is the office of the Inspector General of Police ( IGP ) as well as the police force as a whole . Our national reform will not be complete if the powers of the police , especially the IGP , is not checked . <p> In 2004 , the government formed the Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal Malaysia Police . The commission proposed , among others , the setting up of the IPCMC . This is an important proposal that is still being ignored by the government . <p> Indeed these are not the only institutional reforms that we need for the country . More work is definitely needed . But Hakam 's list is a good place to start . -- Sin Chew Daily <p> * Wan Saiful Wan Jan is the chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs ( IDEAS ) <p> ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail Online . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@8993231 Heritage of Tough Urban Warriors <p> Once upon a time , pickup trucks were vehicles that served strictly rugged and utilitarian purposes . More recently , however , these vehicles have become increasingly refined and are firmly established as viable alternatives to passenger cars . <p> The pickup truck 's journey from the rough surroundings of estates and construction sites to the comfortable porches of residential homes has been remarkable , and one of the most important steps of this journey was made by Mitsubishi Motors . <p> During the late 1990s , when the surge in popularity of pickup trucks was at its infancy , Mitsubishi made the crucial move of putting an automatic transmission into the L200 Storm . It was a calculated gamble that became an instant success -- it broadened the pickup 's appeal to urban dwellers seduced by the convenience of automatics . <p> Inspired by the L200 Automatic 's runaway success , rivals eventually caught up and began offering their versions of automatic transmission-equipped trucks , further fuelling the segment 's widespread popularity .

At the same time , the Triton 's comfort levels surpassed all contemporary pickups and could rival even passenger cars . <p> On top of its top notch pedigree , the Triton also wore striking curvaceous sheet metal that flew in the face of straight-faced looks favoured by pick-ups of the time . Just because it is a vehicle for heavy duties does n't mean it has to look boring . <p> An interesting design feature of the Triton is the J-line joining its cargo bed and cabin . Besides giving the Triton a distinctive silhouette , the J-line serves a functional purpose in allowing Mitsubishi to package a bigger cabin than otherwise possible within the confines of its wheelbase . <p> As the succession of pick-up trucks in the market today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is worth noting that Mitsubishi had already reached these benchmarks with the Triton a little over a decade ago . <p> The present day Triton continues the job of its forebears by setting new standards in delivering passenger car comforts and pick-up truck robustness in one reliable package . Further enhancing the supple ride and dynamic sophistication of its predecessor , the all-new Triton raises the game by pioneering the introduction of xenon headlamps with integrated LED daytime running lights , paddle shifters , tilt &amp; telescopic steering adjustment , and keyless entry in the pick-up truck segment . These features have begun appearing in other trucks now , but Mitsubishi was there first . <p> As pickup trucks continue to expand their role to encompass private and lifestyle-based utilization , we see many of the newly-launched models in this segment become increasingly refined and sophisticated vehicles ; many of which are become good enough to be legitimate alternatives to passenger cars . <p> In two generations of the Triton as well as its predecessor , the L200 , Mitsubishi has played a key role constantly raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robustness and reliability that these vehicles continue to require . <p> Prefering his cars to come with four disc brakes , independent rear suspension , and manual transmission , Kon prioritizes mechanical sophistication over outward appeal .

Many people are sometimes not actually clear as to why they are making the report . <p> Many , in fact , lodge reports to get the matter off their chests . <p> Sometimes when something happens , the person does not know what to do and he makes a police report and feels that he has done something .

Not doing so becomes an offence . <p> Such a report is referred to as a first information report , and it triggers off the police investigation . A police report about an incident where a crime or offence is suspected is a starting point for the commencement of the investigation . <p> Once the report is made , depending on the content , there may or may not be an investigation . There can be different reasons why a police investigation commences or nothing happens . <p> However , where there is an investigation , it should lead to a conclusion . Either the investigation shows that there is enough evidence to prosecute the person complained against and he is charged , subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , does there always have to be a police report for an investigation to commence ? On some occasions the police will say that they took no action because there was no police report . <p> Depending on the circumstances , such a statement may amount to avoiding the issue rather than dealing with it . <p> This is because it is not necessary for a person who witnesses the happening to go to a police station to make a police report before an investigation can start . All that is required is for a first information report to exist . <p> Thus if a passer-by sees that there has been an accident and calls the police and informs the officer that there is an accident at a particular place , what the police officer on duty takes down becomes the first information report and based on that , an investigation starts . <p> There have been occasions where a very important person is aggrieved and the police come to know that . <p> Having an allegation that an offence has occurred , a police officer makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the basis for the investigation to commence . <p> This is not wrong , but it would be better if such an approach were also extended to lesser beings . <p> In the case of grievances of a civil nature , where there is a dispute between two parties which does not amount to an offence or crime , there is nothing for the police to investigate . It is a matter for the parties as to how they wish to address the situation . <p> The police report made , at best , serves as a contemporaneous record of what has been said and alleged at a particular time . <p> Depending on the facts and the circumstances , it may in some situations have a certain corroborative value . <p> Whether , in such a situation , a person should or should not lodge a report depends very much on the facts . <p> In the ordinary course of things , it would do no harm but at the same time may not serve any purpose either . <p> Another situation that arises out of making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make serious allegations against the other in the police report . <p> This can lead to the person accused being arrested or detained . <p> In other cases , the content may be highly defamatory .

No action can be taken against such a person by a person who is initially detained , though subsequently set free . <p> If every person , prior to making a report , is required to provide proof of the allegations made by him , then there would be no role for anyone else to play and the complainant would be required to be a detective and investigator before he could lodge a report . <p> That is not the concept relating to making police reports under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police report liable if facts that are later discovered show that there was no adequate basis for his complaint . <p> The only exception would be where the person makes such a report knowing at the outset that it is false . <p> Any comments or suggestions for points of discussion can be sent to mavico7@yahoo.com .

@@9455236 <p> BN will need to work harder to abandon the narrow-minded racist and religious policies if it really wants to keep the momentum going . <p> Translated by DOMINIC LOH Sin Chew Daily <p> The thumping victories of BN in Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar have sealed the ruling coalition 's all-win record at these two strong fortresses . <p> The outcome of these two by-elections shows that BN has not only managed to secure the support of Malay voters there , but also some Chinese voters who have returned to the BN , allowing it to defeat its opponents with boosted majorities . <p> BN 's candidate in Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar -- Budiman Mohd Zohdi and Mastura Mohd Yazid -- have won with majorities of 9,191 and 6,969 votes respectively , and this could be partly attributed to the returning Chinese votes to the BN . <p> Of the three Chinese-majority polling stations in Sungai Besar , for example , 505 Chinese voters who once voted for PAS are now voting for the BN . This phenomenon is even more obvious in Kuala Kangsar. the support for BN in Jerlun new village has doubled from 26% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinese votes to the ruling coalition . <p> Thanks to the support of Chinese voters in both constituencies , BN has scored impressive wins this time . While we can not rule out the fact that BN 's candy policy has worked , the outcome nevertheless shows that the local Chinese community indeed is more concerned about physical development . Take Kuala Kangsar for instance , the outdated infrastructure is in urgent need of improvement . PM Najib and DPM Zahid have visited KK several times , pledging infrastructure projects such as Manong bridge , community hall for Jerlun new village and Tsung Wah Private School administrative building , among others . These goodies have successfully lured some Chinese voters to their side . <p> In Sungai Besar , Budiman has been able to win with a convincing 9,191-vote majority , up sharply from a mere 399 in GE13 mainly because of his personal image as well as election strategies . He visited the 3,000 households in Sekinchan and Sungai Panjang , and has won the hearts of the local Chinese voters with his moderate and friendly approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BN government -- offering citizenship to red IC holders , building lighthouse for the local fishermen and the rescue of two Malaysian fishermen from detention in Indonesia , among others , have galvanized the local Chinese voters to cast their ballots in favor of the BN candidate . <p> By comparison , PAS managed to get some 75% of Chinese votes under the banner of Pakatan Rakyat during the last general elections . However , the collapse of PR and the party 's insistence to push ahead hudud law have estranged the Chinese voters , resulting in the drastic fall in their support among Chinese voters . <p> PAS ' insistence on hudud might have somehow contributed to BN 's increased support among the Chinese voters . Umno 's endorsement of a private bill on hudud has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese community that they can only stop Umno from getting too close to PAS by giving MCA and Gerakan a bigger show of support . And indeed , both the Chinese-based parties have done exceptionally well during the campaign period . <p> The outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the government , and will gauge and vote rationally at specific times . It is hoped that the government will come to the realization from these two by-elections that it can only win the hearts of Chinese voters with a more moderate and liberal attitude . <p> BN still needs the support of Chinese voters in the coming general elections . It will need to work hard to abandon the narrow-minded racist and religious policies if it really wants to keep the momentum going .

However , it looks like they wo n't be waiting to see if it 's a hit before moving forward on other properties .

The primary game mechanics are based around hacking the system in order to use it for your reasons .

The fact that the premise is n't new means it should be easy enough for a screenwriter , or an audience , to wrap their head around .

We 'd guess they 'd follow the same formula they started with Assassin 's Creed , creating original characters and plots for the movie , and simply giving them access to the tool box that the games also use . Are you excited by the prospect of a WatchDogs movie ?

@@9526239 <h> Rafizi unveils detailed ... by-election analysis <p> PKR Secretary-General counters negative response to earlier comments and claims that he had blamed voters following BN 's win in the Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar by-elections . <p> COMMENT <p> By Rafizi Ramli <p> I am aware that my initial response to the Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar by-election results have been reported as me blaming the voters for Barisan Nasional 's ( BN ) win . <p> I have explained previously on social media on the need to carry out a root cause analysis ( a term so familiar to people with an engineering background or quality systems ) to identify the real factors that motivate the voters to vote the way they did . This is a normal process out of which we are able to identify areas to intervene . <p> Only plans or programmes or strategies born out the correct identification of root cause analysis can yield the improvement needed to win the next general election ( GE14 ) . <p> My conclusion was that racial/religious sentiments as well as the goodies and cash handouts splurged during the campaigning were the two most important factors . I reiterated my view previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can move beyond these two tools deployed by the BN , it is unlikely there will ever be a change . <p> Some quarters quickly saw this as my blaming the voters . Umno jumped on the bandwagon and for the last few days I had the prime time slot on mainstream TV stations demonising me ( one minister called me a dictator , the other one said I was a disease , another one said I never fought for the rakyat ) . <p> While it is understandable that Umno behaves this way , I find it ridiculous that other non-traditional media ( often considered more independent ) also behaved the same way . <p> No one had disputed with facts and evidence ( the scholarly way and objectively ) that my diagnosis of the root causes was wrong . The most widely accepted public verdict was the voters did not vote because they were disillusioned with the infighting of the Pakatan Harapan ( PH ) , both intra- and inter- , and PAS . However , no empirical data has been offered so far to support this apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even some political analysts , who only days before the polls predicted a stronger showing by PH compared with PAS , did not revisit their earlier prediction and instead joined the bandwagon of pointing to " Opposition bickering " as the main reason for the results . <p> I was not frustrated with the outcome of the election nor the decision of the voters in those constituencies . If anything , I was relieved that finally we have an empirical set of data to work on to formulate intervention strategies . <p> What I was frustrated by was the tendency of the public , civil society leaders , analysts and commentators not to call a spade a spade . Even worse , while the lack of unified opposition forces was a key issue that needs to be addressed , the simplicity of the thinking that puts all the blame on the Opposition bickering to the point of ignoring the flagrant abuse of money/rewards ; the race/religion sentiments and a plethora of other electoral abuses by the BN , is actually counter productive . <p> It is ironic that while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , it seems oblivious to the massive corruption in the form of electoral bribery practised by BN , that I get the feeling as if the public expects PH to win IN SPITE of this electoral bribery . <p> Instead of focusing on the immorality of using taxpayers money to win votes by bribing the voters with a list of promised projects , many analysts and some civil society leaders seem to consider this ( electoral bribery through promised projects ) as a matter of campaign strategy i.e local issues versus national issues . <p> A lot of the comments on social media concur that goodies , cash offered and delivery of infrastructure projects promised did make a difference . They ( on social media ) commented that for voters from lower income families , it was better to take the cash offered because that could meet their immediate need as opposed to listening to PH 's heavy issues on national corruption , excessive spending , etc . <p> I find it inconsistent that while many among the public indirectly admitted that electoral bribery was rampant , yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause analysis . <p> I am not that perturbed with this attitude and what 's important is to concentrate on the future intervention . <p> My team had completed a stream by stream analysis of the results for both Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar . It was a relief that it was not as Armageddon-ish as it was made out to be . <p> The summary of my take on the analysed results are as follows : <p> i . The percentage of Malay support for Umno is status quo with no substantial increase ( 59% in Kuala Kangsar and 60% in Sungai Besar ) . The shock that gives rise to the feeling that PH was routed was because there was no dramatic decrease despite all the issues ( GST , 1MDB , Tabung Haji , Mara and the use of government jet scandals ) . <p> People missed the point that despite the massive money being spent ( allegedly RM400 per person distributed , more goodies and projects offered ) and the persistent racist and religious attacks against PH/Amanah/DAP ; Umno could only maintain the status quo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PH 's part , taking into account that we improved on this ( under normal circumstances ) , a swing of 2-3% among Malay voters in semi-rural seats like Kuala Kangsar and Sungai Besar is possible in GE14 . <p> ii . There was a notable increase of support for PH in both Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar among Malay middle class and young voters ( saluran 3 and 4 shows a modest 1-3% increase and we won Bukit Residen , a notable Malay middle class JDM in Kuala Kangsar ) . Considering these seats are semi-rural , the swing can be expected to be higher in semi-urban/urban seats . <p> iii . PAS bagged circa 26.6% Malay support for Kuala Kangsar and 30.6% in Sungai Besar at a time when their campaign massively benefited from Umno/BN ( no bad news on PAS , no attack on PAS , PAS ' attacks on PH given full coverage ) . <p> PAS was also facing Amanah which had been pictured ( rather successfully ) as selfish DAP lackeys . It can be expected that if the candidates had been from PKR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats would have been lower and may come to 24% -- which was their base as shown in the 2004 GE . <p> In other words , while PAS may think they had won the day because they had the second highest share of Malay votes ; they are definitely retreating and sliding towards the pre-2008 position . <p> iv . PH/Amanah got 9.5% Malay support in Kuala Kangsar and 8.6% in Sungai Besar . This is the worst case scenario for PH because Amanah is the newest ( hence lack of recognition and machinery ) and these are semi-rural seats in the worst circumstances for PH ( a long time taken to decide to enter the fray due to the negotiation with PAS , etc ) . <p> We have to run the simulations for a spectrum of Malay support for all our seats but my gut feeling is our ( PH/PKR ) Malay support in semi-urban seats can go to 20 percent and in urban seats like Pandan can reach 30 percent . <p> v. The Chinese voter turnout was lower by 21 -- 28% . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still see a swing of 5 -- 7% to Umno/BN though I think this is very much localised because of the promises and goodies given by BN . <p> vi . Therefore , while the defeat was a wake-up call to concentrate on the one-to-one contest with PAS , it is also a confirmation that it was not a rout , nor has the public abandoned PH . If Chinese turnout normalised during GE14 , plus early preparation and good machinery , plus BN has less firepower ( cash , goodies , projects ) during GE14 -- my guess is we may still make a strong showing in GE14 . <p> Rafizi Ramli is the Pandan MP and Secretary-General of PKR <p> With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice , FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties .

@@9573236 <h> Advertisement <h> More ... <p> JUNE 27 -- I was as shocked as any other to wake up to the news last Thursday that the Brits have voted to leave the European Union by a margin of 52 to 48 per cent . <p> This was pursuant to a referendum called by their Prime Minister , David Cameron , earlier this year over the question of whether Britain should remain a member of that organisation , following months of renegotiating membership terms which resulted in paltry concessions by that 28 ( now 27 ) member bloc towards Britain , resulting in the electorate 's decision to leave the EU by a narrow margin . <p> The intense dislike for the EU by the Brits is understandable . Having voted for continued membership of what was then nothing more than a common market in 1975 , the European project morphed over the decades into a political union of sorts , particularly after the Maastricht Treaty was agreed in 1993 . <p> This is not what they agreed to nor signed up for , and the British people were denied a say in this and other decisions made about Europe within the EU , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its rapid expansion after 2004 to include the less economically developed nations of Eastern Europe . <p> As a result , as many as three million EU citizens have made the United Kingdom their home , causing a drain on public services , such as their prized National Health Service ( NHS ) . This led to the central issue of immigration dominating most of the campaign . <p> The economy was a close second , though , and threats of doom and gloom by the Bank of England , the IMF and even George Soros notwithstanding , what was dubbed " Project Fear " by their media simply failed to convince the electorate , who by and large were content to accept short term economic uncertainty for the long term gain of being able to freely trade with the rest of the world on their own terms as well as regaining the ability to control their own borders and make their own laws . <p> But much like most others in the rest of the world , I did n't think that they would actually be brave enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loud and clear , that they want to leave and take back control , causing shockwaves throughout the European continent . <p> Now the President of the European Commission , Jean Claude-Juncker and Donald Tusk , the President of the European Council , have demanded that Britain immediately invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon to begin a two-year process of leaving the EU . <p> Meanwhile , David Cameron has resigned as prime minister and the Conservative Party , the party helming the British Government at present , will begin a process of selecting and electing a new party leader , who will subsequently be confirmed as the new prime minister . <p> Boris Johnson , the chief Leave campaigner , is the clear favourite to succeed Cameron , a situation once thought unthinkable only months ago . The establishment are duty bound to accept the decision of the British electorate to leave , although plenty of their members , from the majority of Members of the British Parliament to British business leaders , have made clear in no uncertain terms that they would like the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and ability of democracy to shake things up for the establishment and give the common people a voice over issues that matter to them . <p> This has made me wonder . Malaysia itself is a democratic nation and a member of the Commonwealth . We have inherited the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy where we elect Members of Parliament who serve for a maximum term of five years , as provided for by our Federal Constitution , who go on to form a Cabinet headed by a prime minister , the same as it is in the UK . <p> Yet while the UK has had numerous referendums in recent history to determine the huge constitutional issues they face , this Brexit vote among them , we ourselves have made scant use of this measure to determine the big issues confronting our society . <p> One such example would be the intention , manifested by PAS in particular , to reform our criminal justice system by introducing hudud elements within . <p> It has been a month since PAS president and Member of Parliament for Marang , Datuk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to amend the Syariah Courts ( Criminal Jurisdiction ) Act 1965 in Parliament . <p> The move caused much outcry among , not members of the public generally , but those opposed to the politics of PAS . These include the political parties in the Barisan National governing coalition other than UMNO such as DAP , MCA , MIC and PBB and of course not forgetting non-governmental organisations such as the G25 . <p> Various claims , mostly false , have been made by these parties about the supposed unsuitability of hudud for Malaysia . The issue has died down for now , but will resurface in October once Parliament is in session once more . <p> But before then , perhaps we should let the Malaysian electorate have their own say on the matter . Let 's legislate a referendum on whether hudud should be implemented . After all , we are a democracy , and that is what being democratic is all about -- letting the public decide what it is they want . <p> The issue of hudud has always been at the forefront of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our legal character as a nation will not make it go away . I propose therefore that we determine the issue by having a plebiscite on hudud implementation . <p> Were one to be held , I am certainly confident that it would pass , given the recent poll taken by the national debater Syed Saddiq indicating an overwhelming majority of Malaysians ( 83 per cent ) in favour of the idea . But the question is , will the abovementioned groups be up for such a vote ? <p> If they truly are for democracy and a free society , as they claim they do , they would definitely agree to such a vote being held . Any answer to the contrary would undoubtedly be most hypocritical on their part . <p> Democracy is n't about being secular or being liberal but first and foremost about rule of the people , by the people . It is about respecting and living with the decision of the majority , in this case , a majority in favour of hudud . <p> Not everyone in the UK voted for Brexit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the EU . But save for a few protests here and there , they are by and large content to let the decision of the British electorate to stand . <p> Likewise here , should a vote to implement hudud result in an overwhelming mandate to do so , others who oppose such a move must step aside , and let the mandate stand . <p> * Faidhur Rahman Abdul Hadi is a lawyer and the chief executive of Young Professionals , a non-governmental organisation formed for the purpose of defending the supremacy of constitutional ideals in the determination of public affairs . <p> ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail Online .

The resulting texture is one that is soft and slightly chewy accompanied by a hint of smokiness from the fire inside the clay oven . <p> Naan is often served plain but there are also different flavours such as butter , garlic , cheese , Kashmiri and masala . <p> The naan can be eaten as is but it is often served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mint sauce and garnished with onions . <p> The tandoori chicken is chicken marinated in turmeric , spices and yoghurt before it is roasted on skewers , also in a traditional clay oven . The clay oven is called the tandoor , therefore the name for the chicken . <p> The marinade and method of cooking make the chicken tender and fragrant , making it the perfect accompaniment to the fluffy naan . <p> For vegetarians , the naan is served only with the dhal and mint sauce . Dhal is a thick , flavourful and mild curry made with lentils while the mint sauce adds a refreshing zesty flavour to the meal . <p> Naan and tandoori chicken are usually eaten for lunch or dinner so most of the time , it is available from lunchtime onwards . <p> Due to it being baked in a special cylindrical clay oven , which is expensive and bulky , naan and tandoori chicken sets are often only available at restaurants and not at hawker centres or roadside stalls . <p> This homegrown Indian restaurant started out in Butterworth and now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Penang .

Here , you can get your fix of naan and tandoori chicken at any hour of the day . <p> At first glance , this restaurant appears to be a tourist haunt as it serves alcohol and is often filled with tourists having a drink at its al fresco area .

" The government has not done enough to safeguard our interests . <p> The cost of production has gone up while prices in the market have either stagnanted or dropped , " said the chairman of Narok Wheat Farmers Association , John Kameno .

Cheap imports and lack of subsidies have forced farmers to either reduce acreage or abandon planting , " said the official . An investigation by People Daily indicates that thousands of bags of wheat have been stored by farmers at the National Cereals and Produce Board depot in Narok until prices improve . <p> Millers who bought a 90-kilogramme bag at between Sh2,900 and Sh3,000 in both lower and upper Narok left early because they could not buy more due to cheap imports that flooded the markets .

@@10009236 <p> As Mercedes-Benz Malaysia prepares for an SUV blitz , the company 's Thai counterpart is set to roll out two plug-in hybrid vehicles ( PHEVs ) later this month . Bangkok Post reports that the two models are the S 500 e and the C 350 e , and they will be the first PHEVs to be assembled in the Land of Smiles . <p> The main difference between PHEVs and regular hybrid cars is that one can manually recharge the former 's batteries by plugging in the car to an external power source , EV-style . The charging port for both PHEV Merc saloons is located on the right side of the rear bumper . <p> The S 500 e is one of three hybrid variants in the W222 S-Class range , the others being the petrol S 400 Hybrid sold in Malaysia and the diesel-powered S 350 Bluetec Hybrid offered in Thailand . The LWB-only S 500 e is the most powerful of the lot , and is powered by a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 with 333 hp and 480 Nm , combined with an electric motor with 114 hp and 340 Nm , juiced by a lithium-ion battery . <p> Total system output is 442 hp and 650 Nm , which is good for 0-100 km/h in just 5.2 seconds , but with fuel consumption rated at just 3.0 litres per 100 km on the NEDC cycle . The claimed pure electric range is 33 km . <p> The C 350 e , Merc 's second PHEV after the S 500 e , is powered by the W205 C 250 's 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo with 208 hp and 350 Nm . The ICE is assisted by an 80 hp/340 Nm electric motor for combined power output of 275 hp and 600 Nm . 0-100 km/h is done in 5.9 seconds and fuel consumption is rated at an amazing 2.1 litres per 100 km . The all-electric mode is good for a claimed 31 km . <p> BMW wo n't be letting its archrival have the whole Lumpini park to itself , and will be introducing the locally-assembled 740Le and 330e PHEV models in Thailand later this year . <p> The G11 740e brings together a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo , a 95 PS electric motor and a lithium-ion battery for a 326 PS total , a 5.5 second century sprint time and FC of 2.1 litres per 100 km . The fresh limo 's electric-only range is 40 km . <p> The 330e from the F30 3 Series LCI family also uses a 2.0 litre turbo , but it 's paired to a 108 hp electric motor for a combined 252 hp and 420 Nm . It goes from 0-100 km/h in 6.3 seconds and also uses 2.1 litres of fuel per 100 km . The EV range is 35 km . <p> This German PHEV push in Thailand comes as our northern neighbour adopts a new auto excise tax regime that is C02-based , moving away from the engine capacity-based system that Malaysia also employs . The new system , which also takes into account E85 gasohol compatibility , starts this year and is four-days old . <p> All four PHEVs mentioned above have C02 emissions below 100 g/km , which means that they can qualify for a 10% rate for hybrids below 100 g/km . Previously , all hybrids were given the low 10% rate , but under the new structure , hybrids emitting 101 to 150 g/km of C02 are liable for 20% excise tax ; and those with 151 to 200 g/km C02 figures , 25% . Lexus ' conventional hybrid models lose out in this new system . <p> Now that these tech flagships are assembled in Thailand , will Malaysia be next on the list ? The likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz will have to gauge demand , negotiate a deal with the government and start local assembly -- like in the case of the S 400 Hybrid -- as these Thai-made PHEVs are n't likely to feature enough local content to take advantage of Asean free trade rules . <p> Danny Tan loves driving as much as he loves a certain herbal meat soup , and sweet engine music as much as drum beats . He has been in the auto industry since 2006 , previously filling the pages of two motoring magazines before joining this website . Enjoys detailing the experience more than the technical details . <p> proton is better than BMW and Mercedes , only stupid people waste money on these useless junks. drive proton now ! cheap and safer , and our Tun M says proton electric car is the best in the world . so good , he sacrific himself by driving a lousier car like porsche . no quality , so glad am Malaysian . <p> You kind of miss the point of these vehicles . Theyre not for people who want to save fuel . Their aim is to achieve lower emissions as well as have the latest in car tech . Hybrid and e-vehicles have never promised to please low budget buyers . At least not yet . <p> Global Mercedes-Benz is playing their cards very well in ASEAN . They have spread out local assembly of their alternative energy cars between Thailand and Malaysia because it 's too early to say which country will lead ASEAN 's Hybrid/ Plug-in/ EV industry . <p> I doubt MBM will assemble the E-Class PHEV , but I hope they will assemble the new C-Class C 350e PHEV this year . If so , I predict starting prices for the CKD C-Class will drop under RM200k ... placing it in Camry and Accord territory .

The allegations were first made four years ago by Lim Guan Eng 's former special officer Mohamed Razali Abd Rahman . Razali alleged that Israeli intelligence trained DAP strategists , USD$300 million was offered to DAP during the last general election by Israeli forces , and an Israeli Air Force base would be built in Malaysia if the Opposition captures Putrajaya . <p> These are very serious allegations and if left unaddressed , can single-handedly be the reason the Opposition fails to capture Putrajaya . Although the allegations may seem far-fetched , nothing can be taken too lightly . DAP 's Prof Ramasamy said that there was no credibility in the allegations and hence they need not reply to them . <p> The Opposition reacted in the exact manner in 2013 when Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said that Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim held numerous meetings with top leaders of Philippine 's Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) who were responsible for the Sabah invasion . They condemned and ridiculed Hishammuddin for supposedly plucking such stories out of the air . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacel Kiram have more or less confirmed that the Anwar family does share close ties with the Sulu Sultanate . It is not just the act of having dinner , but the posing together holding banners to free Anwar justifies Hisham 's claim .

In 2014 , Lim Guan Eng sternly threatened to sue a PAS central working committee member over allegations of impropriety in awarding of the Penang Tunnel Project . However , junior Lim failed to convert words into action and no legal suit commenced . <p> I personally feel that allegations by Razali are untrue simply because the late Tok Guru Nik Abdul Aziz would never have condoned such an act .

If DAP fails to seriously take up a legal suit against the four-year-old accusations , then perhaps it is guilty , too .

This is disingenuous : it is like arguing that more highways are needed because of traffic jams caused by accidents on the North-South highway . <p> Penang Forum is not against the idea of a transport master plan . In fact , NGOs first encouraged the Penang State Government to initiate a master plan in 2009 . The Halcrow transport master plan was the result of that initiative . But since then , the plan has undergone significant changes . We express grave concern over several issues regarding the current proposed transport master plan . <p> Scale and priority <p> The overriding motto of the transport master plan is " moving people not cars " , yet the rhetoric does not match the facts . Of the estimated budget of RM27 billion , and possibly even more than RM30 billion , the lion 's share , about RM17 billion , goes to building more roads for cars rather than on public transport . The priority should be reversed : 70% of the budget should be for public transport and 30% for roads . <p> For example , instead of building a tunnel to accommodate cars , why is there no effort to explore converting two lanes on either the first or the second Penang bridge for trains or LRT ? This will cut down the budget considerably . Or in the worst case , if a separate tunnel is needed , it should be for trains and not for cars . <p> The vision put forth by the state is an old paradigm that does not work because it addresses only the supply side and not the demand side of the transport equation . It looks at only increasing the supply : more roads and tunnels for private vehicles . It ignores a basic tenet of transport planning : more roads simply creates more demand for their usage . <p> Unless the state is willing to also initiate necessary , though initially unpopular , measures to regulate the demand for private road usage through road pricing , higher parking charges and car pooling , it will end up like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur with a spaghetti of highways that are clogged . <p> We do not see these measures in the transport master plan vision . Instead , the chief minister has said before that he considers such measures as undemocratic . <p> There are a lot of low-hanging fruit that should have been picked but were not in tackling traffic jams . These are much less expensive and will slash massive costs . Many of these have been identified in the Halcrow plan . Some examples are better enforcement against illegal parking and illegal hawking on streets , better management of on-street parking charges and the clearing of five-foot ways for pedestrians . <p> These will go a long way towards cutting down traffic jams . But there seems to be no political will to implement them . Instead , the reaction is to go for mega and expensive projects . <p> Financial model <p> The financial model of the transport master plan raises many questions : it is totally dependent on the state selling land reclamation rights to private developers to pay for the mega projects . <p> Reclamation is a two-edged sword . While it brings in revenue for the state , there are irreversible environmental and social costs when done excessively . Hence , it should be minimised rather than maximised . ( The present model opts for the latter . ) One is reminded of the proverb to not kill the goose that lays the golden egg . <p> Another way of reducing the costs -- and hence the scale of reclamation -- is to rethink the financial model of providing the use of highways free of charge . This is unsustainable both financially and ecologically . <p> Instead , if users want to enjoy the privilege and convenience of driving on roads , rather than taking public transport when these are provided , they should pay for the service . These charges can go to subsidise more public transport if the state is serious about pro-poor policies . <p> People are not against paying tolls . They are against it when the concessions are unjustly awarded and one-sided . This government can show the way to managing tolled roads correctly . <p> Other issues <p> A fundamental flaw of the proposed master plan is the assumption on which the projected transport demand is based . The population projection in the master plan up to 2030 is over 500,000 people higher than the estimate of the Department of Statistics of Malaysia . <p> Is there an over-projection of demand for the use of roads and even the type of public transport mode proposed ? Should not trams , that are less costly , be prioritised over monorail ? Is there financial modelling for the running and management of each of the public transport modes ? Who owns them ? Who is financially responsible for running them ? What happens if there are losses ? <p> Transport planning must follow , or at least be coordinated , with overall planning for the state . It can not be done independently of the Penang Structure Plan , which is in the process of being reviewed . <p> If there is so much emphasis on connectivity to the mainland and serving the people on the mainland , why is there not more emphasis on developing industries and services on the mainland , where land is relatively more abundant ? Why the need to reclaim so many islands off Penang Island ? <p> The above are only some of the many issues that must be properly and rationally studied . Meantime we should not politicise the issue and appeal to populism for support for the transport master plan . Neither should the master plan be dictated by pure commercial interest . <p> With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice , FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties .

@@10047231 Humble Submission <h> Vape : The legal issues <p> THE issue of vaping has been under the spotlight recently . It started with the Health Ministry announcing its intention to ban the use of vaping products . It was then followed by raids on several premises which were selling vape products . Thereafter , several states began to impose vaping " bans " , either on the trade of vape products or the act of vaping itself . <p> It has been reported that some of these states made their decisions based on a fatwa issued by the National Fatwa Council which declared that vaping is " haram " for Muslims . <p> I have no intention of questioning the correctness of the fatwa . <p> What I will bring up , however , is states ' decisions to impose the various bans based on the fatwa . <p> Under the Federal Constitution , matters relating to Islam are under the jurisdiction of the states . A fatwa issued by the National Fatwa Council is not binding on Muslims and is only advisory in nature . <p> What is binding on Muslims is a fatwa issued by the state fatwa committee or mufti or the individual states , or for the Federal Territory , the relevant religious authority . Once a fatwa is issued by the relevant body within the state and gazetted , then the fatwa will become binding on Muslims within the particular state . <p> Expressing an opinion contrary to a gazette state fatwa is a Syariah criminal offence . <p> It is wrong for state governments to ban the use or sale of vaping products because of the fatwa by the National Fatwa Council . By doing so , the state government would have acted before the relevant body within the state . <p> What the state government should do is wait for the relevant body within the state to deliberate and come to a decision as such matters . <p> The other issue is that by imposing a blanket ban on the use or sale of vape products , the state government effectively imposes upon Muslims and more importantly , non-Muslims within the state , a non-binding fatwa . It bears reminding that no fatwa should ever be imposed on non-Muslims . <p> If the state intends to ban the use or sale of vape products only on Muslims based on the fatwa , it should enact a state Syariah enactment in the State Legislative Assembly instead of through executive action . <p> State governments would have jurisdiction to regulate or even prohibit the sale of vape products on premises within the state . This is done through local councils by imposing conditions on business licenses on premises in the state , including the condition that no vape products can be sold on the said premises . However , traders should be given sufficient time to clear their stocks before this condition is imposed , especially , on those who have already been given permission prior to this . <p> Imposing a ban on the use of vape products or vaping itself is outside of the jurisdiction of the states , unless it is done as a state Syariah enactment and binding only on Muslims . Under the Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution , health and medicine , drugs and poisons fall within the jurisdiction of the Federation . As such , it is the Federal government , and not a state government , that can execute a ban on the use of vape products . <p> This issue must be dealt with comprehensively . The various authorities must sit down with other interested parties , including vape traders and users , to come up with policy and regulations on vaping . <p> There are many issues , legal or otherwise , that have arisen out of the vape controversy . While a conclusive finding on the health implications of vaping has not been published , the concerns by the various governmental bodies and state governments are not unfounded . Yet at the same time , they must tread carefully so as not to overstep their jurisdiction . <p> &gt; The writer is not a smoker , vaper nor has any personal interest in the vape industry . Daily Post Newsletter <p> Email Address <p> The Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission , NDDC Ibim Semenitari has accused the Rivers state Commissioner for Information , Austin Tam-George of incompetence . <p> Semenitari in a statement signed by her media Assistant was reacting to the report that the sum of eighty-two million naira was spent to honour Nobel Laureate , Professor Wole Soyinka on his birthday last year . <p> The statement said the claims were lies deliberately formulated to smear the literary scholar as well as the Acting Managing Director of NDDC . <p> Semenitari further said the background to the decision of the then Rivers State Government to honour Professor Soyinka had a link to the literary feat the then Administration of Amaechi achieved in securing Port Harcourt as the UNESCO World Book Capital City 2014 . <p> The statement reads , " For months , officials of the current administration in Rivers State were looking for " evidence " to justify their much-touted corruption allegation against the former Administration of Hon. Chibuike Amaechi . And last week , they finally " found " one . <p> " At a lavish press conference in Port Harcourt , the Rivers State Commissioner of Information and Communications , Dr. Austin Tam-George , called on anti-corruption agencies to investigate the expenditure of N82 million made to host Nobel Laureate , Prof. Wole Soyinka , during his 80th birthday celebration . <p> " Unfortunately , and perhaps to show the sinister intent of the whole issue , to which the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) have also shown undue excitement , references were made to Prof. Soyinka as a " friend of Amaechi " , without putting in context what necessitated the honour for the Nobel Laureate by the then Rivers State Government . <p> " While the whole claim is nothing but bare-faced lies deliberately hatched to smear the literary scholar as well as the Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission ( NDDC ) , Mrs. Ibim Semenitari , it is a shame that officials of government would indulge in this kind of gimmicky just to settle petty scores . We feel particularly sorry that Tam-George , barely a week in office , has manifested such gross incompetence in the procedures of his office as spokesman of government . <p> " The background to the decision of the then Rivers State Government to honour Prof. Soyinka , his family and friends , had a link to the great literary feat the then Administration of Hon. Amaechi achieved in securing Port Harcourt as the UNESCO World Book Capital City 2014 . The feat , which put not only Rivers State but indeed Nigeria on the global map , had not happened before and one of the people who assisted in that regard was Prof. Soyinka , a cerebral literary icon , an authority in global literature and The Arts generally . <p> " However , was the total amount of N82 million spent on the dinner alone , as Tam-George , PDP and their cohort would want the world go to bed with ? The answer definitely is NO , even as we challenge him to release the entire documents as contained in Mrs. Ibim Semenitari 's Memo REF : MOI/COM/C. /82/Vol . III/227 to cover Dance Drama by University of Port Harcourt Arts Village ; Great Singha &amp; His Highlife Band ; Set Design , Stage Lighting &amp; Costume Design ; Costume Design &amp; Stage Property ; Dinner ; Transportation and Accommodation of guests from outside the country and those outside Rivers State ; Decoration ; Travels &amp; Logistics , etc . <p> " Indeed , nothing can be more callous than the imputation that the dinner was because Prof. Soyinka " is a friend of Amaechi " . Having turned down several other overtures for an open honour to his enormous contributions to the growth of the literary industry in Rivers State , it was a decision of the State Executive Council to celebrate a man who had been a strong DNA in the birth of Garden City Literary Festival ( later Port Harcourt Literary Festival ) which catapulted the state to a global player in The Arts . <p> " Rather than face his urgent job as Information Commissioner to see whether he can help reposition an administration that is fast losing credibility in the eyes of civilized people in Rivers State , Tam-George would rather prefer to smear the exalted reputation of Prof. Soyinka , a man whose shoes ' lace he would be unable to untie all his life . <p> " We can forgive Tam-George 's attempts to smear the reputation and hard-work of Semenitari , who meritoriously served Rivers State for six years , since he must be suffering from a serious complex . But to drag the name of Prof. Soyinka into their coven of inferiority is beyond the pale . <p> " We , therefore , state unequivocally that if the media invitation to anti-crime agencies to probe Semenitari was on the expenditure of the N82 million , her doors are open any day , any time to welcome them .

@@10047236 for budget hotels <p> Legal business : Hotel Comfort Inn at Changkat Bukit Bintang is one of the few licensed budget hotels in the city . <p> Kuala Lumpur City Hall ( DBKL ) has hit a snag in its effort to legalise unlicensed businesses . <p> Budget hotels has a host of building guidelines to comply with and some are not able to be met , through no fault of the business proprietors . <p> When DBKL embarked on its mission last year to legalise all unlicensed businesses , it offered conditional licences that was valid for one year . <p> The conditional licence holders were required to fulfil all the stated criteria in six months to receive a full licence . <p> In an interview last month , then DBKL Socio-Economic Development executive director Datuk Normah Malik said among the many businesses that were not licensed , budget hotel owners faced the most difficulties . <p> " The conditional licence holders were required to fulfil all necessary criteria in six months . <p> " For straightforward cases , if the business owners have fulfilled the criteria during the given period , they will receive a full licence . <p> Many budget hotels are set up in old shophouses . <p> " But owners of budget hotels are facing many problems due to standard building guidelines needed by the Fire and Rescue Department , which are very difficult for many to comply with because of limitation in infrastructure . <p> " Many budget hotels are set up in old shophouses which have limited space and many are also in rented properties with only several years ' lease , making it a risk for them to invest in renovation work on the building . <p> " As such , out of 77 conditional licences given to budget hotel owners in February last year , only one managed to get a full licence , " she said before her retirement last month . <p> " The fire department building guidelines for hotel are standard across the board , meaning the same requirements given to a five-star hotel also apply to a budget hotel . <p> " As such , DBKL is working with the fire department to simplify the building requirements for the budget hotel category only . <p> Having said that , DBKL will not simply endorse any building just because it is a budget hotel . <p> " We will still make sure the important fire and safety features are met , " she added . <p> Budget hotel owners were the first batch of businessmen who received conditional licences on Feb 17 last year . The licences will expire next month . <p> Malaysian Budget Hotel Association president ( MyBHA ) Leong Pui Kun said any kind of leniency was appreciated to ensure that all budget hotels were properly licensed . <p> " I am grateful that the local government understands our problem . DBKL officers met me in November to ask about our problem to put forth in their proposal . <p> " The rise of ' sharing economy ' models like Airbnb has affected the budget hotel business greatly . <p> " Properties offered in such ' sharing ' business models have minimal cost and no licensing requirement , making them able to provide accommodation at a cheaper rate , " he said . <p> Normah said that as of October last year , 9,258 conditional licences had been issued . <p> " There was no reason for businesses to continue illegally anymore . " <p> Budget hotels are especially popular with backpackers looking for cheap accommodation . <p> She said DBKL made the licensing process very convenient for business owners . <p> DBKL appointed Oracle Synergy Sdn Bhd to inspect all business premises and collect data . The company has been assigned to visit every business outlet and check if it was properly licensed . If it is not , Oracle staff will advise them on what needs to be done . <p> " Oracle moves from constituency to constituency . <p> " Once the survey in one constituency is completed , DBKL will organise a licensing campaign in that area for the business owners to apply for a conditional licence . <p> " All the agencies involved in the licensing process will be present to give advice . <p> " The business owners only need to bring documents related to the premises , business , their identification card and money to pay the fee , and the conditional licence will be issued on the spot . <p> " Those who did not qualify were those operating in illegal premises , did not bring the necessary document or did not have enough money to pay the fee , " said Normah . <p> She added that until October , about 88,000 premises had been inspected , of which 18,000 were not licensed . <p> For those who have received the conditional licence , Normah said there were three categories of business owners . <p> " There are those that fulfilled the needed requirements , those who have tried to fulfil the requirements and those that have done nothing . <p> " For those who have fulfilled the requirements , their conditional licence will be renewed as a full licence when the time comes . For those who made the effort but faced some hurdles , they will be given a month extension to do the needful . <p> " Meanwhile , those who sat on it will have their licence revoked and necessary action will be taken . " <p> Normah said many were shocked at how easy the licensing process was . <p> Datuk Normah Malik <p> " There were many cases of businessmen using the services of runners to get licences from DBKL , thinking that it was a tedious and troublesome process to go through . <p> " There was one case where a businessman paid RM5,000 to a runner but never received the licence because the runner gave many excuses to delay the process . The runner did not send in the application because he was trying to get more money from the businessman . <p> " So I advise business owners to come in person to get their businesses licensed . <p> " If you are running a legal business in a legal premises , you will be licensed , " she added . <p> On average , business premises licence cost between RM200 and RM400 for a year . <p> Normah said the aim of DBKL 's exercise was to ensure all businesses in Kuala Lumpur were regulated . on Sunday by its National Legal Adviser , Victor Kwon , the PDP said Metuh , who was arrested without invitation by the anti-graft agency , has remained incarcerated since Tuesday , while the APC chieftain , who disregarded the commission 's invitation and had to be arrested , was quickly released after the EFCC boss had a meeting at the Presidential villa <p> The Peoples Democratic Party has accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of witch hunt and selective treatment in its fight against corruption . The party said its conviction was based on the release of an associate of President Muhammadu Buhari and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress , retired Brigadier General Jafaru Isa , barely eight hours after he was arrested . It said in contrast , the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP , Olisa Metuh , who was arrested for the same offence was still being held since Tuesday . In a statement on Sunday by its National Legal Adviser , Victor Kwon , the PDP said Metuh , who was arrested without invitation by the anti-graft agency , has remained incarcerated since Tuesday , while the APC chieftain , who disregarded the commission 's invitation and had to be arrested , was quickly released after the EFCC boss had a meeting at the Presidential villa . Kwon said in the statement : " The release of Jafaru Isa , a known associate of the President and chieftain of the APC eight hours after his arrest while our spokesman remains in detention even when the two are being investigated over same allegation , clearly shows that the President Buhari-led APC government is not fighting corruption but using the much hyped crusade as a cover to persecute PDP leaders and decimate the opposition , a project the EFCC has clearly yielded itself as a willing tool . " We have information of the marching order from the Presidency for the immediate release of the President 's associate and that his issue is one of the major part reasons for the repeated visits of the EFCC Chairman to the Presidential villa within the period of his arrest . Of course , there is nothing hidden under the sun . " We ask , how can the EFCC now explain to the world that it is not corrupt and teleguided by the Federal Government to persecute PDP leaders ? What happened to the illegal holding charge upon which it has detained the PDP spokesman beyond the limit stipulated by section 35(5a) of the constitution and in violation of his guaranteed personal liberty under the law ? " Are there now two separate sets of laws ; one for PDP leaders and perceived foes of the President Buhari-led government which allows them to be detained beyond constitutional limits without being charged to court and another set , for associates of the President associates and APC leaders , which guarantees them a slap in the back and immunity from investigation and prosecution , and if arrested , an immediate release ? " Is it really true that the fund Jafaru Isa was alleged to have received from the former NSA was traced near the corridors of those who today bestride power in the country ? Furthermore , can the Federal Government and the APC now in all honesty face the world and announce that this administration is indeed waging war against corruption ? " Can the EFCC explain what has happened to several petitions by Nigerians on corruption issues against many APC leaders including those who as former governor looted funds belonging to their state ? Are they now under immunity for the fact that they are in the APC and that most of the funds they looted where used to finance APC 's Presidential campaign ? " While we reiterate our support for any effort aimed eradicating corruption in our nation we stand our ground in demanding that the fight must be holistic , credible , within the limits provided by the laws irrespective of political affiliations . " The PDP therefore restates its demand that the EFCC immediately releases its spokesman , Chief Olisa Metuh or charge him to court if they have any case against him . His continued detention without being charged to court is only indicative of the fact that the commission has not been able convince itself of enough evidence of guilt and is now lending itself as a willing instrument of persecution against Chief Metuh . " The public will recall that the PDP is not given to frivolous claims as evidenced in many instances including our alert last year of a meeting between the Presidency , the then newly appointed INEC Chairman and top security officers just before the Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections . " Finally , we state with every sense of responsibility that now that it is clear , with the release of Jafaru Isa eight hours after his arrest , that the continued detention of our spokesman is politically motivated , this party can no longer guarantee that it can rein in its members and supporters who have been exercising restrain since this particular arrest by the EFCC .

Both major Chinese stock markets , the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges , halted trading in the middle of the day when the freshly installed " circuit breakers " mechanism were triggered as market declined more than 7% . <p> Global markets reacted accordingly . With the biggest economy starting off the year with a calamity of this size , the rest of the world followed suit . <h> One Week , Two Circuit Breakers <p> The 4th trading day of the year saw history repeat when the Chinese markets were suspended once again . However , this time the effects were much more significant . <p> The total decline of the CSI 300 , a tracker for the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges , tallied at 12% since year-start . The rest of the world was also much more greatly affected with the Hang Seng falling by 3.1% and the Nikkei by 2.3% . <p> Oil prices finally succumbed to the pressure of the Chinese economy and fell to less than $33 per barrel , losing their earlier gains , further dragging down the global economy and worsening fears . This is the lowest they have been in 12 years . <p> Even though the political turmoil in the Middle East threatens to shorten the oil supply , the fact that China , with its unstable economy , is one of the key buyers of crude oil is enough to push the price down . <p> The three key reasons that led to the first trade suspension were also part of the second one . Additional factors this time included the more recent release of the growth of China 's services sector showing them at their weakest in over a year , along with the rapid devaluation of the currency . <p> The Chinese Yuan dropped almost 6% in value against the US Dollar since last year 's August . <h> Government Should Play a More Passive Role -- Experts <p> Another thing common to many dire times in the history of China 's economy is that its government tends to get involved in the affair . <p> After last year 's stock market crash , the government intervened by injecting millions of dollars into the economy , banning stock sales from majority shareholders , and planning a circuit breaker mechanism . <p> This time as well , the government plans to put new rules in place aimed at helping the economy . This is despite the fact that some experts are of a different opinion . After the second suspension , it announced a new rule that will be effective immediately to greatly limit the sale of stocks . <p> Major shareholders ( those with more than 5% in any one company ) are now able to sell off a maximum of 1% of their holdings in any three-month period . In addition , such investors are now required to disclose their intentions 15 days in advance . They will also be removing the circuit breaker mechanism installed just this Monday . <p> Many experts have spoken up against the government for being so actively involved , saying that circuit breakers only fueled more worry . <h> Week Long Bumpy Ride Ended in Some Relief <p> Friday was a turning point in last week 's drama , giving the world the break that it needed after the first four days of global market decline . <p> After the removal of the circuit breakers and the addition of the new rule to stanch the selling spree , the Chinese market was allowed to fluctuate .

@@10082232 US$60 per barrel due to hedging <p> During the US shale boom , fortune favoured the bold drillers who discovered and pumped oil fastest . <p> Today the winners are producers like Pioneer Natural Resources , who best shielded themselves from tumbling prices . <p> Using derivative transactions known as swaps and collars , the Texas-based firm locked in a minimum price for 85% of this year 's production . <p> As a result , it gets US$60 ( RM263.30 ) per barrel for a large chunk of its output while many rivals are selling at the market price of around US$30 , often not even enough to cover the cost of drilling new wells . <p> Pioneer shares , though down 23% since the start of 2015 , outperform a broad S&amp;P index of oil and gas producers energy sector whose value dropped 46% . <p> The company also managed to sell US$1.4 billion worth of new shares to investors this month -- a rare feat in a market that has shut for most energy issuers . <p> Its executives are not gloating over their winning hedging formula , but they are certainly sleeping better , chief operating officer Tim Dove says . <p> Dove said Pioneer forged its strategy , which entails hedging production two or three years in advance , after the 2008-2009 oil market crash caught it virtually unprotected . <p> Battling for survival , the company idled 97% of its drilling rigs and its executives did not want to go through such " draconian cuts " ever again , he said . <p> Now , with crude prices down by 70% since mid-2014 , that strategy is paying off . <p> A Reuters analysis of late 2015 filings by the 30 largest US oil firms showed Pioneer had 60 million barrels of oil hedged through 2017 , nearly twice as much as any other major US shale producer . <p> That could bring Pioneer a windfall of more than US$730 million this year if oil prices stayed near current 12-year lows , according to a Reuters analysis of company data . <p> Tim Rezvan , energy analyst with Sterne Agee CRT , estimates that while Pioneer could get 23% of its revenue from oil and gas hedging this year , the majority of drillers have little or no output with price guarantees in 2016 . <p> Shale producers face a moment of reckoning after a decade-long fracking boom nearly doubled US oil output and turned the US into the world 's leading natural gas producer . <p> With costs for new drilling in some US shale areas as high as US$50 a barrel , the price rout has already triggered several bankruptcies , and tightened credit for those that remain active . <p> For Pioneer or its smaller rival Newfield Exploration that inspired its hedging programme , locking in prices for the bulk of their future production has become a part of their annual business planning . <p> Newfield chief financial officer Larry Massaro said hedging has been a strategic pillar for more than a decade for the Texas-based producer . It has a team that meets as often as daily to review its positions . <p> In global markets , Mexican state oil giant Pemex stands out as an adept hedger , having locked in a US$49 price per barrel for 212 million barrels of planned oil exports this year . <p> But for many other oil producers to hedge or not to hedge is a daunting tactical choice . <p> During the long spells of US$100 plus oil between 2009-2014 many drillers were reluctant to fix their prices as it meant foregoing considerable potential gains if prices moved higher . <p> When prices started to fall in 2014 , producers faced another dilemma -- buy protection against a further decline and risk losing out if there is a bounce or double down on a quick price recovery , leaving themselves fully exposed to a further slump . <p> That is what happened to Continental Resources . Its CEO Harold Hamm announced in November 2014 that it had cashed all of its hedges , pocketing US$433 million , to " fully participate in what we anticipate will be an oil price recovery . " <p> Analysts estimate the fateful decision has cost Continental more than US$1 billion by now . <p> Some hedge funds and oil consumers , such as airlines , have also lost money by ending up on the wrong side of hedging bets . <p> In contrast , Pioneer 's hedging has saved it around US$1.6 billion since 2014 , Dove estimated . <p> It has also helped Pioneer plan to lift output by as much as 20% annually through 2018 even as the US government expects national production to fall 9% over the next two years . <p> " We 're one of the few companies that is out there doing a lot of drilling , " Dove said . <p> Pioneer , which ranks among the top 10 US oil and gas producers by market value , pumps around 106,000 barrels of oil per day and is one of the largest players in the low-cost Permian basin that straddles Texas and New Mexico . <p> Yet even the most comprehensive hedging programme can not offer a blanket protection against the downturn . <p> Earlier this month , Pioneer said it planned to write down as much as US$1 billion in South Texas Eagle Ford shale assets due to falling oil prices . <p> In racing to drill more wells , Pioneer also risks losses if crude prices stay low for longer or crater to the US$20 per barrel level that some major banks have warned about . <p> The latest slide also makes it impossible for Pioneer and other producers to lock in attractive prices for much of their output in 2017 and beyond as options markets now offer swaps for less than US$42 on 2017 US benchmark crude . <p> Newfield is partially hedged into 2017 , but it allowed positions representing five million barrels to expire recently and has not yet replaced them . <p> Pioneer locked in prices for about 20% of 2017 production when last June 2017 oil futures briefly rose to around US$55 a barrel , Dove said , but has done few transactions since then . <p> " We would probably want it to at least have a five handle , " Dove said , referring to prices in the $50-60 a barrel range . <h> LATEST CONTENT <h> " People want to lead a peaceful lives .

@@10095237 your life by <p> The thing about resolutions is that they are all done in good faith . I can not remember the resolutions I made when the year changed from 2014 to 2015 , and therefore , can safely say that I neither honoured nor broke any . So with 2016 , I think I 'd rather list down 10 rules of day-to-day living that I will continue to abide by because they have served me well thus far . <p> RULE 1 : I do n't worry about who does n't like me because I 'm too busy loving the people who love me . <p> This is a conscious act of will and I find it very effective . The underlying principle is that life is short and it is wonderful to be surrounded by people who care for you and be able to love and care for others in return . I have so many new and not so new friends who are genuinely interested in being concerned about one another . The bottom line is that I can not please everyone and there will always be someone who will find fault , whether real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's myopic view of you spoil your day ? <p> RULE 2 : In everything I do , I give it my best shot . No half measures . <p> I agree with this wholeheartedly -- be it going to the office , delving into a hobby or doing voluntary work . I find that some people are " embarrassed " with their own quality of work and think that it is not good enough . For me , if I 've pitched in my best effort , then it is certainly good enough for myself and others . <p> RULE 3 : Commitment , responsibility , delivery : actions , not words . <p> It is easy to make empty promises and saying yes when we mean no . I have learnt that if I say yes , then it becomes my responsibility to deliver . I have also learnt that it is not easy to say no . When others expect you to say yes to a favour and the answer is no , more often than not , they become miffed . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yourself and not take more than you can handle or are comfortable with . <p> RULE 4 : Before I step out of my house ( even for a loaf of bread ) , I must look presentable . <p> I 've always believed in the quality of the product and its packaging . A good product looks better if it is packaged beautifully . <p> RULE 5 : When unsure , it is better to be overdressed than underdressed . <p> So far , I have not gone wrong on this point . It is always pleasant to the eye to look good and feel good . <p> RULE 6 : Eat everything in moderation . Exercise if I can . <p> Like most Malaysians , I enjoy good food . Tastes change with age and sweet things do not lure me as much as savoury stuff , and I guess I eat most things that walk or swim . Occasional treats are most welcome , but gluttony or indulgence is not . When the weather is good , I take walks . <p> RULE 7 : Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mine to begin with . <p> I have to remind myself of this regularly , lest I think I can bring them to the grave with me . <p> RULE 8 : Let go of the things I can not change . <p> Never enter marriage thinking you can change a person . There are many things or people that we can not agree with , but it is not my job to change them . The only changes I can make are within myself . <p> RULE 9 : Be grateful . Never take for granted the people or the things that we have around us . <p> It is so very important to appreciate our family and friends because there is a tendency to forget the people who are around us all the time . The phrases " I love you " or " Thank you " must never be in short supply . <p> This is the rule that holds up all the others . I do n't believe in holding back love when I care for a person , even if I have gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the opportunity to live another day in good health and surrounded by warmth .

@@10148237 <h> No charade in budget recalibration , please <p> If we think education and scholarships are important , then something must give . Taking the path of least resistance is not recalibrating the budget . It is a great charade . <p> COMMENT <p> By TK Chua <p> The purported news of government withdrawing the scholarships and bursaries makes me ponder over our personal finance and how we can draw some parallels on government financial management . <p> I am not a finance wizard , a great entrepreneur or a prominent politician in charge of national finance . <p> But the reality is most of us are likely to be ordinary guys earning a normal income and living an ordinary life . The reality is most politicians and bureaucrats governing us and managing our economy are also ordinary people with an average intelligence or even lesser than that . <p> I think we have to be realistic ; what we ordinary guys ca n't do at personal level , we should n't expect the government tol be able to do . <p> If at a personal level we should n't squander our income , borrow thoughtlessly and take risks excessively , the national government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wonders for things that we ca n't do ourselves . <p> If we are not gifted with making lots of money or showered with boundless inheritance , we should always live within our means . We may borrow to buy some big ticket items like homes and cars , but certainly we ca n't borrow or run credit card debt on current expenditures like buying groceries , paying house rent , eating in fanciful restaurants or going for holidays . If we do that , it means two things -- either our income is too low or our lifestyle is not in consonance with our income . The solution is to increase our income or change our lifestyle . Taking more loans is not a solution . In fact , it will only add to more woes . <p> I think this is the situation many Malaysians are now faced with . We borrow because easy loans are available and the process is really to help the banks make more money than to help us solve our problems . We live beyond our means because we want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking that our income growth will be sufficient to take care of loan repayments in the future . Most of us know there is no free lunch and yet many of us take it . <p> Then we look at the government , which to me is worse than individuals . The government deliberately grows its expenditure to match with revenue availability . Not only that , the government continues to borrow because government spending must be maintained to keep certain people/sectors happy . <p> Do you think the government would have solved its fiscal problems with GST now in place if oil prices had not dropped precipitously ? I do n't think so . The government will incur new expenditure to match with additional revenues provided by GST and whatever borrowings it could lay its hands on . This is a habitual issue -- big spending must continue to keep the politicians and vested interest groups happy , not so much to benefit the economy in terms of capacity building or productivity enhancement . <p> Soon , the government will face the same problems like individuals who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't build human/social capital and infrastructure . Excessive borrowing increases the debt servicing burden and increases the cost of borrowing which further reduces the government 's ability to spend . Depending on sources of financing , excessive borrowing by the government are inflationary which erodes the value of the currency . <p> So when the crunch comes , the government is at a loss on what to do . It cuts the allocations for education and scholarships not because these are the least important things to have , but because they affect the vested interests least . If we look at it at the individual level , it is like a person cutting expenditure on his child 's education so that the family can go for holidays instead . <p> I think here lies the big irony . Many Malaysians actually look to government for help -- BR1M , scholarships , healthcare and other welfare payments . On the contrary , the government is increasingly looking to the people for bailouts -- more taxes , more borrowings and higher inflation . <p> Certain mantras are worth repeating . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fiscal reforms must include reprioritisation and prudent spending . I agree all of us must shoulder the burden with budget cuts , but it is only fair that those enjoying the most thus far take a deeper cut . Politicians and bureaucrats ought to know what to cut and where to prioritise . If they do n't , then they are engaged in bunkum polemics . <p> If we think education and scholarships are important , then something must give .

But Tuscany is so much more than those . There are all manner of lesser-known wines off the beaten track . <p> I recently spent a couple of days in the Orcia valley , an area sandwiched between the vineyards of Montalcino and Montepulciano , with a river that rises at Monte Cetona and flows into the Ombrone . The DOC was recognized in 2001 , and in 2004 the whole valley was classified as a Unesco World Heritage Site . <p> As for most of the red wines of Tuscany , Sangiovese is the dominant variety , often blended with the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot and Petit Verdot . There are now about 40 wine estates in the 13 villages of the Orcia valley , with an impressive level of quality and just waiting to be discovered . Here are five that are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the property of Donatella Cinelli and Carlo Gardini . Donatella 's family has long been part of the wine scene of Montalcino , with her brother now running Fattoria dei Barbi , but Fattoria del Colle is where Donatella makes her mark outside Montalcino . She has about 81 acres of vines near the village of Trequanda and makes three red wines , not to mention Vin Santo , which is an essential part of every classic Tuscan estate . <p> Leone Rosso is Sangiovese with 40 per cent Merlot , making for riper , fleshier flavours . Cenerentola , or Cinderella , is Sangiovese with 35 per cent Foglia Tonda , an old Tuscan grape variety that almost disappeared . Donatella has played a large part in its successful revival . And then there is Il Drago e le Otto Colombe , a blend of Sangiovese with some Merlot , as well as 20 per cent of an Umbrian grape variety , Sagrantino . The name of the wine refers to the fact that the estate is run by women , the doves , with just one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes an amusing aside . But Donatella has a serious focus ; a fellow winegrower described her as the anima , or driving force , of the Val d'Orcia . <p> Podere Forte <p> This is a relatively new estate , in Tuscan terms , for it was created in 1997 by Pasquale Forte , a businessman from Calabria . From one small purchase in 1997 , he has developed a 416-acre estate , including 25 acres of vines ( in addition , there are olive trees , extensive woodlands and land for rearing animals ) . <p> Sangiovese is the core variety , with some Cabernet Franc , Petit Verdot and Merlot . They aim for self-sufficiency and even have a restaurant , the very stylish Osteria Perill ? , in the nearby village of Castiglione d'Orcia , where you can enjoy the produce of the estate . They are moving toward biodynamic principles and paying enormous attention to the condition of the soil , with advice from the leading expert in the field , Claude Bourguignon . <p> A drive around the vineyards offered breathtaking views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumn sunshine reflecting on golden vines . The cellar can only be described as state-of-the-art , with several sorting tables , vats for microvinifications and a serious selection of barrels . <p> They make three wines . Petruccino , a blend of 70 per cent Sangiovese and 30 per cent Merlot with 14 months ' oak aging , has a ripe fleshiness from the Merlot , balanced with freshness from the Sangiovese . More serious is Petrucci , a pure Sangiovese , described as their flagship wine , with aging in new oak . The third wine of the range is single-vineyard Guardiavigna , from Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot and Petit Verdot . The 2010 was drinking particularly well , with elegance and balance . <p> Fattoria le Buche <p> This estate was developed by Giuseppe Olivi , who produces an eclectic range of wines from an equally eclectic selection of grape varieties , namely Sangiovese , the key Bordeaux varieties , Syrah , and Pugnitello , another Tuscan variety that has been revived in recent years . His flagship wine is I Puri , a varietal wine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety is the absolute best in that particular vintage . In 2009 it was Merlot and in 2010 Sangiovese , with a fine expression of the variety . Unusually for the Orcia valley , they also have some white varieties , Verdicchio , Viognier and Sauvignon , making a fragrant white wine with some stony minerality . <p> Podere Abiello <p> This is an enchanting spot , with views of Monte Amiata and the small town of Pienza . The almost abandoned property was bought in 1999 by Ada Becheri and Roberto Tirri , and they began planting vines in 2002 . Until 2008 , they merely sold their grapes and did some experimental microvinifications . The following year , they built a neat compact cellar and now they make a convincing range of wines that amply illustrate the characteristics of the Orcia valley , with Sangiovese , Merlot , Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in varying proportions . Oak aging is essential to them all . <p> Citto , from all four varieties , is elegant and cedary ; Ciri ? is Sangiovese and Merlot , with some fleshy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a riserva , which requires 24 months of aging . In fact , it has spent 30 months in small barrels , with some lovely elegant sour cherry fruit and just the right amount of oak . And finally there is Albiano , a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot , with just a touch of Petit Verdot . This is riper and immediately more international in flavour , while still retaining the benchmark elegance of Podere Abiello . <p> Marco Capetoni <p> Marco 's first vintage was 2001 . He has developed the vineyards of an old family estate to make two wines : Capetoni , which is a blend of 80 per cent Sangiovese with some Merlot , and Frasi , which comes from a 3.2-acre vineyard planted in1973 that is mainly Sangiovese , with Canaiolo and Colorino . The three varieties are all mixed up in the vineyard and consequently fermented together , then aged in large wood for two years .

Then in the 2015 season , the FIA set a limit of four engines per driver instead of five in the previous year . The drivers had to get by with one less Power Unit and this meant that the engines had to perform with even greater efficiency and reliability . By comparison , the mileage covered by each of the five permitted units was approximately 2,800km during the 2014 season . In 2015 , it was 3,400km for four Power Units .

You would be surprised to learn that automotive fluids in a Formula One ? engine run close to the composition of ordinary , commercially available products . In 2015 for example , we introduced PETRONAS PRIMAX 97 with Improved Advanced Energy Formula for superior acceleration with learnings developed from Formula One with the following attributes : <p> *Protects the engine with the nation 's first low sulphur gasoline : On top of its lower sulphur content that benefits sensitive emission systems , the new formulation also removes and prevents deposits , providing long-term protection to the fuel injectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning formula : The fine quality base fuel produced by our world class PETRONAS refineries is an optimized formulation developed through our partnership with the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One ?

@@10206236 importance of full disclosures <p> THE predicament of CLIQ Energy Bhd boils down to two fundamental principles in our capital market . <p> One , that shareholders be given all accurate and sufficient information to make their decisions . And two , that independent advisors ( IAs ) ought to play their part in accordance to the standards required by the rules . <p> But first some background . CLIQ is a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC , what was listed back in 2013 . SPACs are cash shells that raise money to make acquisitions in sectors that its management team are presumably experts in , with the end goal of adding value to the newly-acquired asset to eventually see significant returns for shareholders . <p> But CLIQ 's latest attempt to make its qualifying acquisition ( QA or maiden acquisition ) has hit a problem -- the authorities , whose approval is needed for the QA to proceed , returned the application on the grounds that there are disclosures which are lacking and that the IA has not played its role in giving a view on the fairness of the report by the technical expert . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> According to CLIQ 's announcement on this matter last week , the Securities Commission ( SC ) said it was unable to proceed with its review of the QA due to required information and documents that have yet to be submitted to the SC . <p> These relate in particular to supporting data used in the assessment of the volume of oil reserves by the technical expert . CLIQ also said it was unable to obtain certain information from third parties to " support the assessment of the volume of oil reserves and consequently , the relevant updated reports which were all required for the application " . <p> No explanation had been provided as to what this exact data was . But it does sound like crucial data , without which investors would be hard pressed to make a decision on whether the asset was worth acquiring . <p> In its defence though , CLIQ had said that it had taken all reasonable efforts to address the required information and documents . Notably , the company added that it had encountered unanticipated events such as the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still , every single oil and gas company the world over has had to deal with the oil price decline and all Malaysian companies have had to contend with the drop in the ringgit 's value . <p> What is puzzling though is how these factors can have an impact on making sufficient disclosures that would only help put an investor in a better position to make his decision on whether to vote for CLIQ 's QA . <p> It is possible that some may think that in this case , the regulator is asking for too much information . But that is unlikely for one simple reason : It is the SC that had facilitated the listing of SPACs in the Malaysian market . <p> So there is no logical reason why the SC would strive to make it difficult for a Malaysian SPAC to get through its QA . For minority shareholders though , they should take comfort in the apparent fact that the regulator is striving to get all the necessary data presented to shareholders to make it easy for them to decide on the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too happy for a SPAC 's proposed acquisition to be presented to shareholder to decide . But if it allows incomplete disclosures to go to shareholders then it would be opening a can of worms . <p> All other SPACs ( of other listed companies submitting corporate exercises ) would then be allowed to lower their standards of disclosures and the only victims would be minority shareholders . <p> The CLIQ case has also brought up another interesting point . What exactly did the IA not do in playing its role ? <p> According to CLIQ , the independent adviser was appointed to provide a " fairness " opinion , as required by Bursa Malaysia . CLIQ 's filing with Bursa stated that the independent adviser had not taken a view on the reasonableness of the report and its contents and had relied on the asset valuation report prepared by the asset valuation expert . <p> CLIQ said the SC had informed it that as a result , shareholders of CLIQ would not have the benefit of a fairness opinion that encompasses all aspects that they need to consider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? Did the standards applied by the independent adviser meet the regulator 's expectations ? <p> In trying to figure this out , one should make reference to the best practice guide for IAs . Such a guideline was issued by Bursa Malaysia in July 2014 . <p> In particular , reference should be made to point 3.3 where inter alia , it states that an IA is expected to conduct its own review on any expert opinion being given in relation to a proposed corporate exercise . <p> In particular , such a review should include evaluating the reasonableness of the methodologies and key assumptions adapted by the expert . <p> Were the requirements by the SC pertaining to this clause complied by the parties involved ? <p> Nevertheless , the end result is that CLIQ is now facing the predicament that it would not be able to complete its QA before its April 9 deadline .

@@10232235 <h> Why the hurry for new levy on foreign workers ? -- Ramon Navaratnam <p> Rarely have so many powerful business organisations and high powered business leaders unite so quickly to protest against the new foreign workers ' levy that was surprisingly introduced on Monday . <p> This serious situation raises the basic question -- why is this new levy introduced in a hurry ? Why were the business community apparently caught unaware of this huge and untimely levy hike ? <p> We have a rich tradition in our country of government and private sector consultations on even the details of major economic policy changes , except budget tax proposals . <p> The surprised and stern reaction from the business leaders showed that there was inadequate consultation on the rate and timing of the hefty rise in the levy . <p> There also appears to be some lack of coordination among all the relevant government agencies . <p> Otherwise the trade ministry and other economic branches of government , would have influenced the Home Ministry to be more cautious about the pricing and timing of the new foreign worker levy <p> The businessmen have valid reasons to protest , on the following grounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , ranging from 100% to 300% , For example , levy for construction workers will increase from RM1,250 to RM2,500 . <p> At the time of global and the Malaysian economic slowdown and falling oil prices and the ringgit , the high increase in levies could raise business and consumer costs and reduce our competitions well . <p> The sudden increase could cause major disruption and a further slow down in production and exports . <p> Recommendations <p> In view of the above , I have the following recommendations for consideration . <p> It is ill advised for the business community to ask for the abolishment of this new levy . Instead it would be more reasonable and practical for businesses to ask the government , for a " calibrated phase " . The new levy could also be much lower initially and could be raised later when the economy and the businesses are more ready to adjust . <p> The government can avoid flip-flop decisions by keeping the new policy , but lowering the increases to make the levy more acceptable to the business sector and consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector as equal partners in development and do not spring surprises on them or catch them off guard . <p> The rise in foreign worker levy has much benefit , which should be highlighted to the public . The public need to be better informed on the overall costs and benefits on raising the worker levy , in the wider public and longer term interests . <p> The additional RM2.5 billion that the government hopes to gain from this new levy is attractive but it need not be overzealous in its collection , as it might also reflect government 's desperation to protect the budget 's integrity . <p> There needs to be greater integration between this new policy on foreign worker levy and the new minimum wage policy which will come out this June . I hope there are no more sudden surprises on rates and timing . <p> There is plenty of speculation that these new levies could benefit monopolies . If there is any truth in this , the government must be bold to clear the air and increase competition , to benefit the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is encouraging that the government is finally trying hard to reduce the unnecessary influx and use of imported labour .

One of the common ways is to build roads or expand roads from one lane to two or three lanes to cater to the increasing number of motor vehicles . <p> The Penang Island City Council or Majlis Bandaraya Pulau Pinang ( MBPP ) has a plan to cut 33 mature trees along Jalan Masjid Negeri near the Penang Free School . This is to enable the council to change a two-lane road to three lanes to help ease traffic flow . <p> As expected , the president of the Consumers ' Association of Penang ( CAP ) , SM Mohamed Idris , opposed the proposal . According to him , " What is Penang without her green ? " and " What is Green Lane without the Green ?

MBPP should justify its decisions . <p> It may be useful to recall that in 2013 , CAP held a protest against a proposal to cut some trees along Jalan Masjid Negeri near the Udini roundabout . However , the council went ahead with the project . This has led to a smoother journey for the residents of Island Glades and its vicinity and those who need to use Yeap Chor Ee Road . But the area looks bare . <p> Idris 's recent statement did have some effect .

@@10303234 <h> Shortage of Women in Southeast Asian Politics <p> Of the 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting this week in the California with President Barack Obama , not a single one is a woman . <p> Although across Southeast Asia leadership by women is not new given the region 's legacy of dynastic politics , leadership at the top levels is missing . There has been a recent increase of women in executive positions that suggests a power shift -- but not at the top .

In 2013 , Park Geun Hye became South Korean President ; Aung San Suu Kyi led her NPD party to another landslide victory in December 2015 and will likely play a major role in shaping her government despite a constitutional provision engineered by the junta to keep her from the presidency .

The growing presence of women in leadership signifies a positive change -- especially in Confucian patriarchal societies where women are supposed to remain in a position of servitude and ( political ) silence . <p> There are certain common traits in these women -- the most obvious being their elite upbringings and affiliations . With the exception of Taiwan 's Tsai Ing-wen , all the aforementioned female leaders in the region were ( or are ) closely related to formerly prominent male politicians . <p> For instance Park Geun-hye is the daughter of a former president -- she became the first lady of South Korea at the age of 22 when her mother was assassinated .

Others gained popular acceptance through their fathers , husbands , or brothers ' previous national struggle for independence and/or populist policies and rhetoric . Indeed , dynastic political culture still commands widespread acceptance in East and Southeast Asia . <p> A second attribute found among these women is their high level of education . Park earned a BA in electronic engineering , Aung San Suu Kyi a Master 's at Oxford and then a MPhil at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) ; while Tsai Ing-wen holds a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science ( LSE ) and Yingluck Shinawatra earned Master 's in Public Administration from Kentucky State University in the US . <p> Although education is seen as universal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a direction do not come naturally to many women .

@@10303236 <h> SPIED : 2016 Proton Perdana -- clearest rear view yet <p> Spyshots of the 2016 Proton Perdana just keep coming . This latest one by reader Alex Leong shows the clearest view of the rear of the national flagship D-segment sedan -- based on the previous-generation Honda Accord -- yet , with much of the disguise stripped off the car . <p> From here , the shape of the rear diffuser is clearly apparent , and match the one shown in the official preview . The rather tall rear lip spoiler also loses the previous box-like cover , showing the actual , more rounded profile of the bootlid addendum . Elsewhere , the L-shaped LED tail lights can be seen clearer here , as is the chrome bar linking the two lamp modules . <p> Last week , we saw the interior of the car , which featured a black-and-beige colour scheme with brown wood trim ( as opposed to the all-black palette with grey wood veneer of the Accord 2.4 sold here ) along with a new infotainment system with what appears to be a touchscreen . <p> To be built at Proton 's Medium Volume Factory in Shah Alam ( current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 2016 Perdana is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year , retaining the Accord 's 154 hp/189 Nm R20A3 2.0 and 177 hp/222 Nm K24Z2 2.4 litre i-VTEC engines and five-speed automatic transmission . <p> After trying to pursue a career in product design , Jonathan Lee decided to make the sideways jump into the world of car journalism instead . He therefore appreciates the aesthetic appeal of a car , but for him , the driving experience is still second to none . <p> PROTONG is doing multiple strip tease over the last 6 months . Start selling the bladdy damn car if it is damn good as claimed.All we know is , it is a REBADGE , rebadge , celup job . Anyway , Protong and honda have a common daddy .. dRB.ThatS why Honda Japan allows an outdated Accord to be rebadged as ACCORDANA . <p> Proton may garner some lost sales when this much anticipated Accordana hits our streets . However , not many Proton fanboys can afford the price , even if 10 year loans are PUSHED out as banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for car sales . Proton , like MAS is still in intensive care with tubes all over . Just take a walk around KL 's shopping malls.Not a single retail shop is happy with lacklustre sales.Infact , many outlets have closed , cos of high costs and failing sales . Local giant Petronas is on the verge of chopping a portion of its inflated workforce of 50,000 employees . The turnaround plan for proton is a bit too late . Sayornara , Protong . <p> After completed the all four planned model , Proton should develop their SUV bcoz now is the time the SUV segment is blooming . Started with a small B-segment SUV ( HR-V , CX-3 ) which is trending right now . Or they can rebadge Suzuki Vitara/Baleno since the volume will not as big as saloon car . <p> Heard that the launch has been delayed to May . As I 've said many times earlier , please take your time , do n't rush anything . It 's better to fix all the problems before launching , than to launch early and face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Look at the Prev ? , Proton rushed its launch , and it showed . I honestly think the Prev ? ( and Suprima S ) are as unreliable and unrefined as the older Waja and GEN-2 . First it was the little things like the gearshift lever breaking off , headlamp blow-outs and whatnot . Now it 's the bigger things ... in other words , the oil-cooler hose fiasco . I understand that Proton has already changed the vendors for the OCH , but the damage has been done . D <p> It 's true . On February 2nd , a delegation from PREVOC ( Proton Prev ? Owners Club ) met up with Proton 's Engineering division at COE Shah Alam . Proton 's CTO , En . Abdul Rashid Musa was present . The OCH problem is somewhat mysterious , because it could happen in any CamPro Turbo/ CFE equipped Proton . It is believed that the hot weather in Malaysia causes the hose to crack . Sometimes , owners can detect the leak in advance , but others are less fortunate . The OCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos , but this is not confirmed . <p> Proton has changed the vendor for the OCH to a South Korea-based company . The previous vendor also supplied the same OCH to other brands , and apparently , there 's been similar OCH cases in some Arab countries too , where the weather is even hotter . Proton said they tested the CamPro Turbo/ CFE + Prev ? / P3-21A combination prior to launch , but they did not encounter the OCH problem then . However , as we all know , Proton rushed the Prev ? ' s launch , so their claims are irrelevant . Also , Proton has changed their vendor for the headlamp bulb ( from Philips to Osram ) , the engine mounting and various other small enhancements have been made . <p> Proton also said that the OCH is under Unlimited Warranty coverage , and Proton may or may not do a recall in the near future . However , the next time you take your Prev ? / Suprima S/ Exora Bold to a SC , they will check your OCH and replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PREVOC FB group , if you have n't already . A lot of helpful owners there , and a lot of more useful info for your perusal . <p> I 'm glad that Proton is working hard to fix the reliability problems in their older models ... but I have mixed feelings . This kind of ' amateur ' problems should not have happened in the first place ... before this , it was power windows ... now , it 's the OCH . This is why some Malaysians still do n't want to buy a Proton ... they feel Proton ' has never learned ' . The fact that Dr. M keeps saying " Proton cars today are very good/ no problem " and " Why Malaysians do n't support Proton anymore ? " makes it even worse . <p> my car is fully-imported CBU from South Korea , 6 years old now , and I 've never had temperature issues . <p> Only Proton , a manufacturer from a TROPICAL COUNTRY can design a car not suited to hot weather .

The last in particular should give us pause , as the men could have easily changed their target to Singapore . <p> It would be a serious error , however , to suggest that a terror attack is the only major risk Singapore faces .

We can not completely rule out states as well as irregular actors attempting a crippling cyberattack on Singapore , perhaps through exploiting the IOT , as fanciful as that might seem now . <p> Here , we face an additional problem : When we have a critical vulnerability in the terrorism sphere , a friendly third party might sometimes assist with information that helps overcome the threat . <p> With the cybersphere , these otherwise friendly third parties become interested observers themselves , and could hide the knowledge of our vulnerability for a day when they might need to exploit it themselves . <p> Different slow-burning issues can also develop over time .

The people in some of these places have been able to face these events with a certain degree of composure , and to organise responses without solely relying on governments . For example , during the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the largely unknown and unplanned evacuation from Manhattan 's downtown by a flotilla of private boats saw 500,000 people rescued in nine hours . <p> Why some people are able to react this way is an extraordinarily complex question , one still being studied by academics and researchers .

But what is needed is a ground-up response , premised on a strong sense of self-sufficiency and inherent resilience to the " first hit " . This must come from the people .

Since then , Musa has continued to represent the country through many international platforms . <p> In his speech , he gave an honest and emotional account of his memories of Tunku . <p> Even though Musa admitted to being an advocate of Razak , he spoke fondly of his interactions with Tunku : his relaxed style and respect for people with opposing views , which taught him a lot about democracy and decency . <p> Musa spoke fondly of the first three prime ministers , but of Dr Mahathir , the architect of Vision 2020 , he said : " Brilliant though he was , he forgot in order to succeed he needed to train leaders at all levels ... he did away with all potential leaders and retained and trained followers . <p> " It is mostly these trained followers that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though there is a " very serious state of affairs in our country ... the only strong signals emanating from the leadership that show any sign of worry are the threats coming from them of tightening selected security legislation that seem to be aimed at free speech and press , with some even constitutionally questionable " . <p> In pinpointing where we have gone wrong , Musa emphasised " it is all wholly and simply caused by the failure of leadership " . <p> He went on to say " when a leader imposes himself and demands unquestioning loyalty accompanied by a loss of respect of good governance , human rights and the rule of law as well as not being considerate of the people 's welfare , the ugly head of dictatorship appears " . <p> Musa ended with calmer denouement . <p> " It was a blot in our country 's history that Tunku was very roughly treated after his retirement , " he said ( though earlier in my speech I quoted Tunku 's praising of Musa in 1980 as education minister , when he revived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catharine 's College , Cambridge ) , but " in the end , Tunku regained the respect and admiration of Malaysians " . <p> As I wrote last week , nostalgia can have tremendous value if it inspires citizens to contribute to change today and Musa 's reminiscing certainly reminded the audience -- especially the younger members -- of the importance of having principles . <p> You will be far more respected and admired if people know what you believe , even if they disagree with you , and trying to be everything to everyone will surely make you a liar . <p> Unfortunately , in today 's age of cynicism , brought about by the insincerity and machinations of some politicians , the words of elders are often dismissed . <p> " What is their agenda ?

@@11003234 be for a just cause <p> Snap polls for Penang will allow Lim Guan Eng to seek a mandate from the people before he is convicted on corruption charges and barred from contesting . <p> COMMENT <p> By Liew Chin Tong <p> To dissolve the Penang State Assembly and to seek a new mandate from the people of Penang is probably the most difficult decision that the DAP Central Executive Committee has ever made . <p> This move will provide a platform for people 's power to prevail against the dark forces and the first step to re-write the political history of our beloved nation . <p> After hours of deliberation , the DAP CEC unanimously resolved to dissolve the Penang State Assembly , upon consultation with our coalition partners in Pakatan Harapan . <p> According to our original plan , after consultation with our coalition partners , DAP Secretary-General and Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng would explain to the people of Penang and all concerned Malaysians the difficult decision we made . <p> It was unfortunate that the plan was prematurely leaked to the media . <p> But since it is now known , it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 1 . To seek a fresh mandate <p> Malaysia is nominally a federation but effectively more centralised than most other federations . In other federations , such as Australia and India , federal and state elections are usually separately held to avoid state issues being submerged by federal concerns . <p> In Malaysia , apart from Sarawak and Sabah and barring very exceptional situations , like the 1978 Kelantan state election , federal and state elections are generally held concurrently . <p> For Barisan Nasional , concurrent elections help the ruling coalition to swap candidates between state and federal seats and also to minimise the political impact of regularly held separate state elections . <p> But things are changing . From high-placed sources , we are told that after the Sarawak State Election in May , Sabah and Johor BN are mulling separate state elections in late 2016 and early 2017 to avoid being adversely affected by Najib 's scandals and poor image . <p> Separate elections are not typical in Malaysia , but it is still the best and an honourable way of returning to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Is Guan Eng 's case a personal matter ? <p> Many opine that no separate election is needed for Penang as long as Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng steps aside until he is cleared of his " personal legal problem " . But is Guan Eng 's case a personal matter ? <p> Since Tasik Gelugor MP Shahabudin Yahya abused his parliamentary immunity to accuse Guan Eng of corrupt practices on March 17 , the mainstream media and black operations have gone into overdrive to paint an image of Guan Eng being corrupt . <p> The then-alleged case of Taman Manggis had disappeared altogether by the time Guan Eng was charged on June 30 . Guan Eng has denied any wrongdoing . <p> Only when one looks at the case of Guan Eng in the political choices of Prime Minister Najib Razak that it starts to make sense . <p> Najib won the 2013 General Election with only 47% of votes and is now tainted with the 1Malaysia Development Berhad and political donation scandals . <p> The only way Najib can win in the next election is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair election but to win it by default through eliminating his opponents and splitting the Opposition : <p> First , putting Anwar Ibrahim behind bars eliminated the only common leader of the Opposition and deprived the Opposition of its candidate of alternative prime minister . <p> Secondly , since early 2014 , Umno has courted and coopted the conservatives in PAS through provision of financial inducement for Kelantan 's development and hudud legislation . <p> PAS split officially in June 2015 and the current leadership treats other Opposition parties as enemies while treating Umno as a friend . The current leadership seems to be prepared to be the spoiler in the general election by contesting in three-cornered fights . <p> Thirdly , with regard to Guan Eng , the political objectives are to destroy the credibility of Guan Eng , to deny him the chance to stand in the next general election and possibly to jail him . <p> According to our opponents ' calculations , DAP will lose support with Guan Eng 's credibility destroyed and without Guan Eng standing as a candidate in the next general election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . A just cause <p> The mainsteam media 's line is that the state election is called to keep Guan Eng in his position . But it is actually not the case . <p> Our assessment is that Guan Eng is likely to be convicted before the next general election so that he is not allowed to contest as a candidate , and he could possibly be jailed after that . <p> To dissolve the state assembly now to seek a fresh mandate , while Guan Eng can still contest , means that he is returning the mandate to the people for them to judge his performance as chief minister as well as to ensure that DAP and Pakatan Harapan have the mandate for the next five years , regardless of whether Guan Eng is freed or not . <p> The following are some of the objectives of the 2016 Penang state election : <p> Firstly , to keep Penang as a base for DAP and Pakatan Harapan to mount a challenge to win federal power in the next general election . <p> Secondly , if Pakatan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penang , future conspirators who want to " chop off " popular Opposition political leaders like Anwar Ibrahim and Guan Eng would have to think twice . <p> Thirdly , with Najib involved in the largest ever financial controversy in Malaysia 's history , and one that is global in scale , yet not charged locally while Guan Eng faces selective prosecution , the Penang state election is an opportunity for the voters to express their disgust . <p> In short , the 2016 Penang state election is a just cause for the people of Penang and Malaysia to fight back against Najib and BN . <p> Liew Chin Tong is DAP national political education director and MP for Kluang . <p> With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice , FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties .

But we want to push the downstream products , and SMEs can tap onto MPOB 's platforms and markets to move further downstream with higher value-add products that will enable them to export and explore new markets and improve their margins and profitability . <p> " It is the Government 's aim to achieve developed nation status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be left out in achieving this ambition .

@@13607240 hope for the Muslim world indeed <p> Nadem Hashemi , the director of the Centre for Middle-East Studies of the University of Denver , has labelled Malaysia as a failed nation because of its failure to live up to the expectation of fighting radical Islam . This disheartening remark was made by the US-based scholar during his talk in the seminar entitled ' The IS Crisis and the Spread of Radical Islam ' recently in UKM . <p> He could be right to certain extent but that does n't mean that he is absolutely correct in his statement on Malaysia 's status as a moderate Muslim country . Indeed there are certain groups of Muslim youths in Malaysia influenced by Wahhabism but not all had fallen into extreme Islamic beliefs . Our unique demographic composition - comprised of varieties beliefs and cultures - has formed a very effective repellent against extremism . <p> Moreover the Malays and their culture in this country never tolerated violence against the non-Muslims or the minorities . Malays are certainly not like their Muslim brothers in the Arab World . They have their own way of practicing the Islamic teachings , not only today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally tolerant in nature and that 's why if you can see , they can live in harmony with other races for so long . This exceptional nature in Malay culture had overshadowed the Wahhabism in Islamic teachings which were brewed in the Arab world . <p> According to Nadem , Wahhabism was developed by the Arab Saudi after the discovery of the oil , and this belief was propagated around the world with exorbitant expenses - it reached up to US$100 billion , during the cold war era between the US and the Soviet Union . <p> However , Nadem seems to be missed another important factor that contributed to the thriving of Wahhabism and subsequently Jihadism , especially among the displaced young men in the Middle East , notably in Iraq and Syria . He missed the false intelligence provided by the irresponsible US CIA which were actually blown out of proportion - to conquer the oil-rich Middle East nations . <p> Therefore , It is a mistake for Nadem to miss those contributory factors which caused the emergence of IS , as an ultimate evil force under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where the citizens are totally against extremism . The majority of them - the Malay Muslims - have never seen the minorities as their enemies and resorted to violence to exert their supremacy over them . The only major clash between races occurred during the May 13 , 1969 incident . And it was quickly put to rest with the effective measures taken by the-then leaders . <p> On the other hand , Nadem subtly concluded in his speech that Malaysia has to set its democracy in order before achieving the status of an exemplary Islamic state which practices moderate Islamic teachings . This statement is stark evidence of his failure to understand the very demographic pattern of this multiracial country . <p> In fact , Malaysians are unique in the sense that we allow different races in this country to practice their own culture , religion and education in their respective native languages , despite Islam being the federal religion . <p> Given that Malaysia is a multiracial country , an unlimited democracy in this country is still a far cry .

File picKUALA LUMPUR , Aug 4 ? The government can implement the controversial National Security Council ( NSC ) Act 2016 should the Bersih 5 rally turn unruly , lawyers say . <p> Civil liberties lawyer Andrew Khoo said the law could be used to declare a territory as a " security area " ? which would be subject to strict policing like curfews and searches and seizures without warrant ? even before Bersih 2.0 's street demonstration that is scheduled some time this year . <p> " It is likely , in the face of advance knowledge where Bersih 5 would be held , that the PM may declare whatever area or areas that the rally is to be held as security areas . <p> " He does not need to wait for the actual rally to take place , " Khoo told Malay Mail Online , referring to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 has stirred unease and speculation that it may be used against demonstrators at the rally organised by the electoral reform group . <p> The warning by Sungai Besar Umno division chief Datuk Jamal Yunos , who was the face of the rowdy Red Shirts protest last year , of a counter rally to Bersih 5 has raised the possibility of clashes . <p> Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed , however , rubbished yesterday speculation of the use of the NSC Act on the Bersih 5 rally , saying that it can only be enforced for natural disasters or violent terrorists who threaten the security of the country . <p> Commenting on this , Khoo said likewise was promised during the implementation of the now repealed Internal Security Act ( ISA ) 1960 . <p> " That is similar to what was said when the ISA was introduced and see what happened ? <p> " The truth of the matter is that it is an unnecessary piece of legislation which has a huge potential to be abused to stifle legitimate dissent and restrict freedom of assembly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Chan said the NSC Act gives " omnipotent " powers to the National Security Council to interpret scenarios and decide how to use the provisions under the Act . <p> " So it becomes more a question of the wide range of possibilities available for abuse , hence , derogating from basic safeguards to rights accorded to every citizen under Article 10 of the Federal Constitution and Peaceful Assembly Act , " he said , referring to the constitutional provision on the right to freedom of speech , assembly and association . <p> The expert in constitutional law also referred to the ISA and its implementation on politicians and activists as a point in case . <p> " Like the ISA , there was a promise that it would not be used on politicians for legitimate political activities .

There are mindless acts of violence in many parts of the world by supporters of the self-proclaimed " Islamic State " . <p> Who is financing these horrendous orgies of savagery is open to debate . But what is certain is that 80% to 90% of those being butchered or maimed are Muslims . <p> With sickening regularity , American and European fighter planes and drones resort to targeted killings in Muslim lands . Often , innocent civilians are blown to smithereens . Only some of these attacks are worthy of media reports ; others are merely collateral damage . <p> Despite this tragic backdrop , a thought-provoking forum on Islam was organised by the Islamic Renaissance Front last Sunday . It was titled " Human Rights and Diversity : Challenges for a Muslim Society " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , addressed the issue eloquently and argued that diversity and pluralism are consistent with Islamic ethics and history . <p> Diversity and a pluralist worldview were part of the divine intent in the Quran . It is said in Surah 11:118 : " Had Allah willed , He would have made mankind one community . But they will not cease to differ " . Another exquisite passage ( 49:13 ) states that " God made mankind into nations and tribes so that they may know one another " . <p> Obviously , tolerance and peaceful social interaction by " knowing one another " was the divine design . <p> In relation to freedom of conscience , there are clear injunctions to respect diversity . " Unto you your religion , unto me mine " ( 109:6 ) . " There is no compulsion in religion " ( 2:256 ) . <p> Prophet Muhammad signed the Treaty of Hudabiyah to allow Muslim apostates to leave in peace and join their adopted community . The Prophets of Judaism and Christianity are venerated as predecessors to Muhammad . The moving story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a beautiful chapter in the Quran named after Mariam ( Mary ) . <p> Respect for others was commanded . " Dispute not with the People of the Book save in the fairer manner , except for those of them that do wrong ; and say , We believe in what has been sent down to us , and what has been sent down to you ; our God and your God is One , and to Him we have surrendered " ( 29:46 ) . <p> For its first thousand years , Muslim societies generally tolerated and celebrated religious and cultural diversity . Muslims , Christians and Jews lived harmoniously . During the stewardship of Prophet Muhammad and the early Khalifs , Muslims and non-Muslims were equally entitled to public benefits granted by the state . <p> The Prophet gave dignity and honour to every human being . There are narrations from his noble life that on one occasion he stood up out of respect as the funeral procession of a Jewish woman passed by . He instructed his followers to pray for the soul of the departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others animated Muslim societies in the Ottoman Empire , Andalucia ( Spain ) , Iran under the Safavids and India under the Mughals . <p> Regrettably , a dissonance between Islamic theory and Muslim practice has developed in some Muslim lands . The great Muslim civilisation has fallen into an abyss . One of the reasons is that the gates of ijtihad ( independent reasoning ) have been shut in the Sunni world . Reason is shunned , not just by the fanatics but by the vast majority of Muslims . The most conservative , narrow and regressive doctrines have gained an unassailable hold on Muslim minds . <p> Suppression of thought characterises some Muslim societies . Diversity is regarded as deviationism . For example , in Malaysia a public discourse on Islam without prior permission of the syariah authorities through a tauliah can be punished . The questioning of a fatwa , no matter how respectfully and intellectually , can be a crime . <p> Moderation , toleration and rationality are viewed with suspicion . Taqlid ( unquestioning obedience ) is mandated . A religion that shunned a priestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no dissent , suppresses diversity and interprets the sacred texts in the most literal way . <p> After Merdeka , the curriculum of our primary and secondary religious education reflected the historical and internal schisms in the Malay community between various religious movements . Today the very conservative , Wahabi-Salafist version seems to prevail . In general , there is emphasis on memorisation of the holy text in Arabic without much understanding . An exclusivist vision of salvation is presented . Knowledge of other faiths is shunned . Arabisation of Malay society is in full swing . <p> According to Dr Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid of USM , " the internalisation since the 1970s of the Wahabi brand of Salafism among South-East Asian Muslims is the major factor behind ( an ) apparent shift towards a more radical worldview " . Regrettably there is considerable institutionalisation of this radical bent . <p> In mutual exchange of loyalty , the political elites support the religious elites even when the latter issue edicts and undertake actions that are divisive , seditious , intolerant and unconstitutional . <p> Further , in the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is politically and professionally dangerous because the terms " Islam " and " Malay " are regarded as synonymous . Any criticism of the religious establishment is wrongly translated to mean criticism of the Malay community . <p> In the years since the 1990s , innumerable conflict-of-law situations have gone to the superior courts . The aggrieved parties are Muslims as well as non-Muslims . The superior courts tend to rely on Article 121(1A) to decline jurisdiction . Barring some honourable exceptions , most judges of the superior courts look the other way when constitutional rights of the applicants are infringed . <p> What can be done ?

Despite a seemingly endless supply of debacles from strategic setbacks to quagmire conflicts since 9/11 , the top brass rarely criticize each other or , even in retirement , utter a word about the failings of their predecessors or successors . Think of it as the camouflage wall of silence . You may loathe him . You may badmouth him behind closed doors . You may have secretly hoped for his career to implode . But publicly point out failures ? That 's left to those further down the chain of command . <p> And yet that 's effectively exactly what newly installed U.S. Africa Command ( AFRICOM ) chief , General Thomas Waldhauser , did earlier this year in a statement to the Senate Arms Services Committee ( SASC ) . It 's just that no one , almost certainly including Waldhauser himself , seemed to notice or recognize it for the criticism it was , including the people tasked with oversight of military operations and those in the media . <p> Over these last years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and special ops training efforts as well as drone bases and other outposts on the continent have all multiplied . At the same time , incoming AFRICOM commanders have been publicly warning about the escalating perils and challenges from terror groups that menace the command 's area of operations . Almost no one , however -- neither those senators nor the media -- has raised pointed questions , no less demanded frank answers , about why such crises on the continent have so perfectly mirrored American military expansion . <p> Asked earlier this year about the difficulties he 'd face if confirmed , Waldhauser was blunt : " A major challenge is effectively countering violent extremist organizations , especially the growth of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , Boko Haram in Nigeria , al-Shabaab in Somalia , and ISIL in Libya . " <p> That should have been a d ? j ? vu moment for some of those senators . Three years earlier , the man previously nominated to lead AFRICOM , General David Rodriguez , was asked the same question . His reply was suspiciously similar : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the growth of Mali as an al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb safe haven , Boko Haram in Nigeria , and al-Shabaab in Somalia . " <p> All that had changed between 2013 and 2016 , it seemed , was the addition of one more significant threat . <p> In the midst of Rodriguez 's 2016 victory lap ( as he was concluding 40 years of military service ) , Waldhauser publicly drew attention to just how ineffective his run as AFRICOM chief had been . Some might call it unkind -- a slap in the face for a decorated old soldier -- but perhaps turnabout is fair play . After all , in 2013 , Rodriguez did much the same to his predecessor , General Carter Ham , when he offered his warning about the challenges on the continent . <p> Three years before that , in 2010 , Ham appeared before the same committee and said , " I believe that the extremist threat that 's emerging from East Africa is probably the greatest concern that Africa Command will face in the near future . " Ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic Maghreb or Boko Haram . ISIL in Libya did n't even exist . And even that " greatest concern , " al-Shabaab , was , Ham noted , " primarily focused on internal matters in Somalia . " <p> In other words , over these last years , each incoming AFRICOM commander has offered a more dismal and dire assessment of the situation facing the U.S. military than his predecessor . Ham drew attention to only one major terror threat , Rodriguez to three , and Waldhauser to four . <p> His Own Worst Critic <p> That said , Waldhauser is n't the only AFRICOM chief to point a finger at Rodriguez 's checkered record . Another American general cast an even darker shadow on the outgoing commander 's three-year run overseeing Washington 's shadow war in Africa : <p> " AFRICOM 's priorities on the continent for the next several years will be ... in East Africa to improve stability there . Most of that is built around the threat of al-Shabaab . And then , in the North and West Africa is really built around the challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instability there creates many challenges ... And then after that is the West Africa , really about the Boko Haram and the problem in Nigeria that is , unfortunately , crossing the boundary into Cameroon , Chad , and Niger . So those are the big challenges and then just the normal ones that continue to be a challenge are the Gulf of Guinea ... as well as countering the Lord 's Resistance Army ... " <p> That critic was , in fact , General David Rodriguez himself in an AFRICOM promotional video released on multiple social media platforms last month . It was posted on the very day that his command also touted its " more than 30 major exercises and more than 1,000 military to military engagements " between 2013 and 2015 . It was hardly a surprise , however , that these two posts and the obvious conclusion to be drawn from them -- just how little AFRICOM 'S growing set of ambitious continent-wide activities mattered when it came to the spread of terror movements -- went unattended and uncommented upon . <p> Waldhauser and Rodriguez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased insecurity on the continent . " Terrorism and violent extremism are major sources of instability in Africa , " Assistant Secretary Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the State Department 's Bureau of African Affairs told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May . " Terrorist organizations such as al-Shabaab , Boko Haram ( which now calls itself the Islamic State in West Africa ) , al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , and al-Murabitoun are conducting asymmetric campaigns that cause significant loss of innocent life and create potentially long-term humanitarian crises . " <p> National intelligence director James Clapper , who called the continent " a hothouse for the emergence of extremist and rebel groups " in 2014 , spoke of the dangers posed by the Lord 's Resistance Army and al-Shabaab , as well as terror threats in Egypt , Libya , Mali , Nigeria , and Tunisia , and instability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the Republic of Congo , Burundi , the Central African Republic , and South Sudan before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year . <p> And then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ( SOCAFRICA ) , the most elite U.S. troops on the continent . He painted a picture that was grimmer still . Last November , during a closed door presentation at the annual Special Operations Command Africa Commander 's Conference in Garmisch , Germany , the SOCAFRICA chief drew attention not just to the threats of al-Shabaab , al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , Boko Haram , ISIL , and the Lord 's Resistance Army , but also another " 43 malign groups " operating in Africa , according to another set of documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act . <p> The growth of terror groups from the one named by Ham in 2010 to the 48 mentioned by Bolduc in 2015 is as remarkable as it has been unremarked upon , a record so bleak that it demands a congressional investigation that will , of course , never take place . <p> Questions Unasked , Questions Unanswered <p> U.S. Africa Command boasts that it " neutralizes transnational threats " and " prevents and mitigates conflict , " while training local allies and proxies " in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rodriguez 's tenure was , however , marked by the very opposite : increasing numbers of lethal terror attacks across the continent including those in Burkina Faso , Burundi , Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad , C ? te d'Ivoire , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Ethiopia , Kenya , Mali , Niger , Nigeria , Somalia , South Sudan , and Tunisia . In fact , data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland shows that attacks have spiked over the last decade , roughly coinciding with AFRICOM 's establishment . In 2007 , just before it became an independent command , there were fewer than 400 such incidents annually in sub-Saharan Africa . Last year , the number reached nearly 2,000 . <p> While these statistics may be damning , they are no more so than the words of AFRICOM 's own chiefs . Yet the senators who are supposed to provide oversight have n't seemed to bat an eye , let alone ask the obvious questions about why terror groups and terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and engagement across the continent grow . ( Note that this is , of course , the same Senate committee that Rodriguez misled , whether purposefully or inadvertently , earlier this year when it came to the number of U.S. military missions in Africa without -- again -- either apparent notice or any repercussions . ) <p> In an era of too-big-to fail generals , an age in which top commanders from winless wars retire to take prominent posts at influential institutions and cash in with cushy jobs on corporate boards , AFRICOM chiefs have faced neither hard questions nor repercussions for the deteriorating situation . ( Similar records -- heavy on setbacks , short on victories -- have been produced by Washington 's war chiefs in Afghanistan and Iraq for the past 15 years and they , too , have never led to official calls for any sort of accountability . ) <p> Rodriguez is now planning on resting at his northern Virginia home for a few months and , as he told Stars and Stripes , seeing " what comes next . " <p> U.S. Africa Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodriguez , but if he follows in the footsteps of the marquee names among fellow retired four-stars of his generation , like David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal , he 'll supplement his six-figure pension with one or more lucrative private sector posts . <p> What comes next for AFRICOM will play out on the continent and in briefings before the Senate Armed Services Committee for years to come . If history is any guide , the number of terror groups on the continent will not decrease , the senators will fail to ask why this is so , and the media will follow their lead . <p> During his final days in command , AFRICOM released several more short videos of Rodriguez holding forth on varioius issues . In one of the last of these , the old soldier praised " the whole team " for accomplishing " a tremendous amount over the last several years . " What exactly that was went unsaid , though it certainly was n't achieving AFRICOM 's mandate to " neutralize transnational threats . " But what Rodriguez said next made a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- whatever it was . Washington , D.C. , he said , had played a key role , too . In that , he could n't have been more on target .

Superman : Dawn of Justice grossing $873 million worldwide but failing to impress audiences or reach the hoped-for $1 billion mark , Warners still urgently needs to jump-start its critical DC Comics universe , raising the stakes for Suicide Squad , which cost at least $175 million to make . <p> Yet if the villain team-up ultimately works - and it has drawn some harsh early reviews - it will be in spite of the kind of behind-the-scenes drama that is becoming typical for giant franchise movies that now are the main focus of the studio business : a production schedule engineered to meet an ambitious release date ; a director , David Ayer ( Fury ) , untested in making tentpole movies ; and studio executives , brimming with anxiety , who are ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Often , efforts to fix perceived problems ratchet up costs , which drive anxiety ever higher . In extreme cases , such as Fox 's troubled Fantastic Four , the intervention is so aggressive that it becomes unclear what it means to be the director . ( In each such case , studios are careful to stress that the credited director is on-scene and in charge , which is essential to avoid DGA issues . And the wise director plays along . ) <p> In Ayer , Warners enlisted a director who had never made a giant , effects-packed action movie . Hiring filmmakers who lack such experience is the trend , and it 's often out of necessity . " There are a lot of people who do n't want to direct those movies and that 's a huge problem , " says one producer with franchise experience . <p> " A lot of the proven guys are back-to-back with their stuff , or they want to develop it for five years , and there 's a machine that has to be fed . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studios turn to those with less experience , relying on instinct that they will be up to the job . Sometimes it works ( Colin Trevorrow on Jurassic World ) , and sometimes it does n't ( James Bobin on Alice Through the Looking Glass ) . <p> A source with knowledge of events says Warners executives , nervous from the start , grew more anxious after they were blindsided and deeply rattled by the tepid response to BvS . " Kevin was really pi**ed about damage to the brand , " says one executive close to the studio . A key concern for Warners executives was that Suicide Squad did n't deliver on the fun , edgy tone promised in the strong teaser trailer for the film . So while Ayer pursued his original vision , Warners set about working on a different cut , with an assist from Trailer Park , the company that had made the teaser . <p> By the time the film was done , multiple editors had been brought into the process , though only John Gilroy is credited . ( A source says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final editor was Michael Tronick . ) " When you have big tentpoles and time pressure , you pull in resources from every which way you can , " says this source . " You ca n't do it the way it used to be , with one editor and one assistant editor . " <p> In May , Ayer 's more somber version and a lighter , studio-favored version were tested with audiences in Northern California . " If there are multiple opinions that are n't in sync , you go down multiple tracks - two tracks at least , " says an insider . " That was the case here for a period of time , always trying to get to a place where you have consensus . " <p> Those associated with the film insist Ayer agreed to and participated in the process . Once feedback on the two versions was analyzed , it became clear it was possible to get to " a very common-ground place . " ( The studio-favored version with more characters introduced early in the film and jazzed-up graphics won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required millions of dollars worth of additional photography . <p> Other sources describe a fraught process - one cites " a lot of panic and ego instead of calmly addressing the tonal issue . " Clearly all was n't sitting right with Ayer , who in June suddenly dropped his longtime agent at CAA and defected to WME , though the agency won him back in a day . " He was under a lot - a lot - of pressure , " says one person with knowledge of the situation , arguing that Ayer was exhausted and needed time to process conflicting ideas . <p> And there may have been other strains . Just weeks before the two versions were tested , Warners declined to ante up for Ayer 's next project , Bright , which will reunite him with Squad star Will Smith . He ended up at Netflix , which made a staggering $90 million deal . Nonetheless , a day or two after Ayer fired and rehired CAA , another cut of the film was screened for a test audience , and sources say the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Los Angeles . <p> Now the question is whether the film will deliver for an industry thirsty for something , anything , that will work in a summer bereft of live-action hits . Though reviews suggest the competing visions for the movie may have taken a toll ( THR 's critic calls the film " puzzlingly confused " ) , BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield says , " I 've learned long ago there is not always a connections between reviews and box office and financial success . " At the same time , it is imperative for Warners to build DC movies fans love like they do the Marvel pics . <p> Even on the day of the premiere , one insider fretted about whether Suicide Squad would mirror BvS ' huge opening and weak legs . Another veteran says the goal is survival : " The movie 's got to do $750 million , $800 million to break even . If they get anywhere close to that , they 'll consider it a win .

JAROD LIM reports . <p> APPLE Vacations and Conventions has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a little travel agency in 1996 . <p> The company , which thinks of travelling as " a journey , not a destination " , recently celebrated its 20th anniversary , having evolved into a more versatile outfit -- a travel consultancy that offers comprehensive travel services . <p> Today , Apple Vacations organises tours to 100 countries , and group executive chairman Datuk Seri Lee Ee Hoe is proud that the company has become synonymous with travel . <p> " I am proud of the branding that we have achieved in the tourism industry . It 's just like what Maggi is to instant noodles , and Pampers to diapers -- when people think of travelling , they will think of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sultan Ismail , Kuala Lumpur . <p> Lee observes that the company has grown along with its consumers in terms of how travel is viewed and practised . <p> " We can see the method of travelling has changed drastically .

When we talk about snow in the winter , lavender in the summer or the onsen ( hot spring ) , we know these will not fail us . This keeps us confident about selling the tours , " he says . <p> " It is also something that our brand has fulfilled . We are known for offering thematic and in-depth tours , especially to Japan , " he stresses . <p> At present , Apple Vacations commands a 20% market share for tours to Japan . <p> In December 2014 , when Japan offered Malaysians visa exemption for short-term stays in the country , outbound travels to Japan bounced -- almost doubling . <p> Artist rendition of the Impression Melaka . <p> " The number of local tourists to Japan increased from about 180,000 to 220,000 travellers to about 400,000 after the visa exemption . <p> " Prior to the exemption , we actually had 40% market share , but this does not mean that our customers have reduced .

One-fifth of Malaysians going to Japan travel with us , " he notes . <p> " In Malaysia , we offer some of the most expensive tours but with quality guaranteed . If you are tired of budget travel , it 's high time for you to come to us for a pampering tour , " pitches Lee . <p> Speaking of travelling trends , Lee says travellers used to be happy just to explore the attractions of a country without really bothering too much about food or accommodation . <p> " Now , people think differently . They see travel not as a ' mission ' but as a leisurely activity . They want to enjoy better food and comfort . We have thought about introducing more special tours , such as museum visits and trekking trips , to Malaysians but , unlike the Taiwanese , we still do n't have that kind of market . <p> " These kinds of tours will create a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation is different , " he says . <p> Nonetheless , Apple Vacations is continuing to push new travel experiences where it can . A few years ago , it worked closely with tea specialists and started tea tours to Southern China to educate travellers on the origins of the tea . <p> These tea tours are still ongoing , and the company also intends to add special tours revolving around coffee to Taiwan and Central America soon . <p> Lee says he is looking forward to introducing more exotic tours such as to the Galapagos islands and the Amazon River , as well as to organise more chartered flights for tour package buyers to other countries . <p> Moving forward , Apple Resources Holding expects to list its travel business by the end of the year and is looking at building more boutique hotels in Kuala Lumpur , Malacca and Penang . <p> Japan is a big market for Apple , so it 's not surprising that the fourth floor of the company 's HQ has a Japanese-themed meeting room . <p> Currently , the company operates two Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuala Lumpur , as well as The Yard Boutique Hotel in Kuala Lumpur . <p> " We have chartered flights from Malaysia Airlines for about 282 travellers of different group tours to Hokkaido . <p> " Currently , we also do chartered flights to Bhutan , and we are looking at offering this service to central Japan and Okinawa . This year alone , we have organised seven chartered flights to Hokkaido . If there is a demand , I 'm looking at 20 to 50 chartered flights a year for the four places , " he says . <p> Apple Resources is also invested in the mega-project Impression City , a joint venture with Yong Tai Bhd that combines the draw of a new tourist attraction and property development . <p> Located in Kota Laksamana , the project will be carried out in 11 phases with total gross development value ( GDV ) estimated to be around RM5.4bil over a period of eight to 10 years .

None of the funds go to us . Whatever money that we collect goes directly to whatever shelter that we work with , " Lyn explained . <p> As this is a pro bono work and a cause that is close to their hearts , they are counting on their position as professionals and are leveraging on their connections . <p> " Amelia is a PR expert for a very good start-up and I am a restaurateur , so we believe that we can leverage on our connections , on our network in order to make this happen , " she added . <p> Although they are very young , PAWS UP has managed to successfully hold a fund raiser and raised more money than they had expected . <p> " What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the stray animals that have been rescued by the shelter and for this round we focused on the cats called it ' PAWS UP ! Meow Around the City ' . <p> " We managed to raise around RM9,000 and it exceeded our target because there was just the both of us handling the event apart from the sponsors that also supported our cause , " Lyn shared . <p> PAWS UP ! Meow In The City exhibition . Pic : PAWS UP <p> They are also trying to help PAWS Malaysia become more visible in the society of donors to ensure that they get consistent funding each month since the shelter needs at least RM50,000 a month to run smoothly . <p> " By using our skills and through the people that we know and our friends , we think that that 's going to push them a little bit more out there , " Amelia said . <p> PAWS UP is also planning to adopt the shelter for as long as they can and trying to organise more events to raise funds for them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . What we always told them was that we will do our best to raise funds for them . <p> " The ultimate goal is to ensure that they get a permanent land space to run their shelter because right now , they are actually residing on neutral land which they do not own , which means that they can get kicked out at any time , " Lyn said . <p> In fact , PAWS Malaysia was almost kicked out last year , which had forced them to find a way to re-home 400 animals in the span of one week but fortunately , Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Azmin Ali stepped in to help them out . <p> " So , we saw that need that we could do something , whether it 's helping them find money so that they can build something or get a land and relocate their space , " Amelia said . <p> Championing To Give A Second Chance To Animals <p> These days , many browse and buy pets online from pedigree breeders as opposed to rescuing strays , not realising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption . <p> Lyn thinks that this is because people see pets as a luxury item in today 's society . And because of this , they are also working to help these abandoned animals who are not adopted to get a second chance in life through the ' mutual rescue ' campaign . <p> Pic : PAWS Malaysia " You would be surprised that some of them are pedigree animals that are abandoned . From time to time you will see an abandoned Persian cat or an expensive rabbit . Because people just buy and they do n't know what to do with it . <p> " They either realise it 's too much work or it does n't suit their lifestyle so that 's why a lot of animals get abandoned , " Amelia explained . <p> Meanwhile , Lyn passionately relayed , " The mutual rescue concept is basically the heart of our PAWS UP community because one of the biggest problems right now is a lot of the older animals in these animal shelters , usually cats and dogs above five years old , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are put to sleep , and I do n't blame the shelters because they lack resources to accommodate them . <p> " So , this mutual campaign is designed in such a way that we relocate all these older animals to places like orphanages , old folks homes and rehabilitation centres because studies have shown that animal therapy educates people to become more compassionate , to be more empathetic , so it actually gives people hope in general . " <p> The mutual rescue campaign thus will give these animals that are not adopted a second chance in life where they are being utilised for the good of society instead of being left at the shelter to die . <p> PAWS UP is currently talking to a few orphanages to explore the possibility of them adopting an older animal at the shelter . <p> " The funding will probably come from our fund-raising drives whereby these animals are sponsored to live there until the end of their time . And at the same time , we believe that these people who take care of the animals will benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to humans . I think in the long run if we ever lobby for animals to become part of the education system , I think it will do the next generation a lot of good , " Lyn mused . <p> Lobbying To Implant Animals With Microchips <p> Another cause that they are championing is to make microchipping pets mandatory since the system currently implemented in Malaysia is limited to pedigree pets and does not have a central database . <p> Pic : ivonnewierink/Deposit PhotosMicrochipping is more for identification purposes but it is important as some people would not want to lose their pet , and there are possibilities that some stray animals are not been able to locate their owners and without identification , they remain as strays . <p> " If you have a pet and it goes missing , someone who finds it can bring it to a vet to scan the animal and they would know exactly who owns the cat . <p> " Unfortunately , since Malaysia is a big country , our central database is not as central as we want it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pedigree animals where if you lose your pet , you could take it to a local vet but it is only regional in the sense that PJ is PJ , Ampang is Ampang , it 's not nationwide database . <p> This huge goal of lobbying for pets to be microchipped is a whole different endeavour as they need to work together with the shelter in order to start a dialogue . <p> " We need to do the lobbying in conjunction with the shelter , in this case PAWS Malaysia , because they have been lobbying with the government for a long time , for the past five or six years . <p> " Because our government changes on a regular basis , a lot of these negotiations are not carried forward or at least not officialised . <p> " So we believe that having two non-NGO representatives sitting there , there will be a bit more weight to get a government body to listen to the lobbying , " Lyn said . <p> While they are not expecting to get immediate results , their aim is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue . <p> Working Tirelessly , And Calling More Volunteers <p> After their successful first round of fund raising , they are planning for their next exhibition which will have dogs from the shelters as their focus this time around , as well as to look for more volunteers to help them with their event . <p> Pic : PAWS UP " We are currently looking for a photographer who is willing to donate their time to take photos of dogs at the shelter and we 'll do another round of exhibition here at Ruyi and Lyn sometime in November . <p> " The previous round was a success to us considering our limited resources , and we welcome more volunteers for this next round . <p> " There are so many things that people can help us out with so just reach out to us and we will be more than happy to explore and put things into action , " Lyn said . <p> As it stands , it is just the two of them currently working on this effort and they welcome any helping hand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shelters to help as they can help through other methods such as sharing their story , going around collecting pet food from various places that may be nearing its expiry date , or to help them with organising the next exhibition . <p> " We are very new , very young , so we are calling out for more volunteers to help out so we can grow a bit . <p> " We want people who share our vision to come on board because at the end of the day , there is no fame or fortune for doing this . It is a very unglamorous pursuit , " Amelia said . <p> It Has Been A Rewarding Experience So Far <p> Their journey might still be new but these two inspiring individuals have found it rewarding so far . <p> " I think it is quite rewarding to do this because we are putting in effort but I think what 's more meaningful is when the shelter thanks you for this . It 's the gratitude from them that makes it worthwhile . <p> " Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because RM1,000 goes a long way for these shelters that rely on public donations , which may not come in the next month or in a year 's time , so every little amount helps . <p> Pic : PAWS Malaysia " The fact that we 've managed to raise over RM9,000 , I think is really a milestone , our first milestone , " Lyn recounted . <p> Amelia also shared the same views with Lyn and feels that they are doing something right by championing for a sector of community that do not have their own voice . <p> " People have asked us why we do n't go and raise money for a cancer society , children 's society and all that , but I think , for us , everyone does a lot for these causes but no one really focuses on animals . <p> " Currently , there is a really small community which focuses on animals and there is nothing wrong in helping them and giving them a second chance in their lives . <p> " It 's rewarding in a sense we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have a voice , it feels good to be able to do our bit , " Amelia gushed . <p> For the time being , no other shelters have reached out to them yet . Nevertheless , they do hope that when they have enough people on board and so long as they do not need to turn shelters away due to shortage of hands , they will be able to do more to help . <p> " Eventually once the word gets out there , we will be able to do more , " Amelia said before we parted ways . <p> Head over to the Facebook pageto find out how you can help Lyn and Amelia in their cause .

@@13866230 <p> The Land Public ... Commission ( SPAD ) has outlined its plans to improve the taxi industry in Malaysia . The Cabinet-approved Taxi Industry Transformation Programme ( TITP ) is geared to regulate e-hailing services ( Uber/Grab ) , while providing existing taxis new opportunities to remain sustainable and competitive . <p> Quite a few points have been announced , most of which are set out to " resolve long-standing structural issues besetting the taxi industry " and to create a fair playing field that benefits drivers , operators and passengers . It 's said to be a clear way forward for the industry to " evolve towards a more sustainable future by being responsive to market forces . " <p> The TITP is underpinned by four key principles : leverage on technology , improve taxi drivers ' income and welfare , improve taxi drivers ' service quality and conduct and rationalise taxi fares . <p> As a start , e-hailing ( Uber/Grab ) will be regulated as an intermediary service under the Akta Pengangkutan Awam Darat 2010 ( APAD ) . Once passed in Parliament , e-hailing companies will be required to be incorporated in Malaysia , and all e-hailing drivers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Vehicles providing e-hailing services will also be required to comply with compulsory road worthiness inspections .

Qualified taxi drivers exiting the taxi rental ( pajak ) system will receive a cash grant amounting to RM5,000 from the Government to help them purchase a new vehicle . <p> Click to enlarge the SPAD 's full statement . <p> Speaking of a new vehicle , taxi license holders will have much wider options , as vehicle models for taxis will be liberalised -- no longer limited to select models like the Proton Exora and Toyota Innova . All models with at least a three-star safety rating by ASEAN NCAP will be approved , to accelerate the replacement of ageing vehicles and reduce costs for taxi drivers and operators . <p> Taxi rental contracts will be standardised , with operators to include a rent-free day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle insurance and deposit refund at the end of the contract . Taxi operators will also have mandatory KPIs , with fleets required to be linked to a dispatcher ( mobile application , in addition to phone bookings , web booking or radio booking ) to increase drivers ' earning . <p> For added safety , SPAD will impose a new set of stringent screening processes on taxi and e-hailing drivers , including health checks , criminal records , traffic offences and violations of SPADs Operating Licence conditions . SPAD will also work with the JPJ to monitor taxi drivers under the new Kejara Demerit Points System . <p> More importantly , the metered fare structure for taxis will be rationalised with the current budget fare . New TEKS1M fares will have a minimum charge of RM3 , plus surcharges of 25 sen/200 m and 25 sen/36 seconds , down from the existing rates of RM4 , 30 sen/200 m and 30 sen/36 seconds respectively . <p> For taxis picking up fares at airports and terminals , the existing zonal fare will be replaced by a distance based calculation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations will go up , while others will drop considerably .

@@13880230 new party is race-based <p> Former prime minister also writes , in his latest blog post , about the goals Bersatu hopes to achieve . <p> KUALA LUMPUR : Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia ( Bersatu ) is Malay-based because the majority of Malaysians in the rural and semi-urban areas are comfortable with Umno-type racism . <p> Dr Mahathir Mohamad , who initiated Bersatu , adds this is necessary if the new party is to compete with Umno . <p> In his latest blog post , the former president of Umno writes : " The sophisticated and highly educated urban people may believe that racial politics is not in keeping with the times . <p> " But on the ground it is different . For the rural people who largely are poor , race is not only important but they believe ( it ) is essential for their well-being . Umno 's popularity is because it is a racial party . <p> " If the new party is to compete with Umno , it must give the people in the rural constituencies and the unsophisticated urban constituencies the kind of comfort associated with Umno 's kind of racism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party is not confined to Malays but is open to all bumiputeras and it is ready to accept non-bumiputeras as associate members . <p> The former prime minister gives reasons why a new party similar to Umno had to be formed . In essence , it is because they were unable to bring about changes -- removing Najib Razak as president via a vote of no confidence and resuscitating the party -- by working within and on Umno . <p> He says they found that Najib had a total grip on Umno and that he was able to expel any member who criticised him . Najib had surrounded himself with " tame " people who seemed " obligated " to him despite his " wrongdoings " and it became clear that there was no way to remove him from within . <p> Forming a new party , therefore , became " absolutely necessary , he explains . <p> " Only a new party can revive the country 's glory of the past . The new party will take cognisance of the changes in the thinking of all Malaysians . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are better off in many ways . Their perceptions of things and their aspirations have changed . " <p> Mahathir goes on to list some of the ideals and goals the new party will work to achieve . <p> These include : <p> Striving to improve the performance of the Government and ensuring a better life for the people . Bersatu will try to regain the respect and honour of Malaysia -- which he says has been destroyed by Najib -- in the eyes of the people and the world ; <p> Restoring democracy and the rule of law " which have been denied and abused by Najib " ; <p> Ensuring the separation of powers between the legislative , the executive and the judiciary ; <p> Separating the legal service represented by the Attorney-General from the judiciary . " The AG may not pass judgement over reports made to the police except when the reports are vexations and irrelevant . Even then the AG must give his reasons to the public and not just say there is no case to answer . Certainly he must not put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suspicion of corruption and making the report public ; <p> Allowing foreign observers to oversee elections and to have full access to the operations of the election , both Government and Opposition ; <p> Making all transactions by Government transparent ; and <p> Ensuring that borrowings by the Government do not exceed amounts fixed by Parliament . <h> Comments <p> Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story .

@@13963230 meets the Eurofighter Typhoon <p> The world of LMP racing is highly competitive , and the Audi R18 e-tron quattro is one of the most advanced race cars to go on track . A mix of composite materials , an advanced powertrain and sophisticated engineering all culminate in a three-time 24 Hours of Le Mans and two-time World Endurance Championships winner . <p> Recently , Audi 's official magazine Encounter decided to introduce the R18 to the Eurofighter Typhoon , one of the most technologically-advanced figher on the planet . Powered by a pair of Eurojet EJ200 engines with up to 40,460 pounds of thrust , the multi-role fighter is also capable of carrying up to 7,500 kg of payload . <p> For the encounter , the car would be represented by three-time Le Mans winner Andre Lotterer , while for the plane , there is Eurofighter test pilot , Geri Krahenbuhl . First up , Krahenbuhl slotted himself into the R18 to find out that even though he has flown a plane that costs around 90 million euros ( around RM400 million ) each , the R18 proved to be quite a challenge . <p> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

By comparison , the Eurofighter will accelerate from a stop to Mach 1.3 at 36,000 feet , pretty much vertically , in 90 seconds . " It goes like a bat outa hell , " Krahenbuhl exclaimed . <p> Meanwhile , Lotterer 's time sitting in the plane was completely perplexing , even with his experience at behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the instruments and possibilities are fascinating . You can hardly compare a car , which moves in two dimensions , with an aircraft that moves in three dimensions , " he said . <p> " Perhaps people who already have a pilot 's license would be able to grasp the operating logic faster . I do n't have one , so a jet cockpit is something entirely new to me . The elements that we operate with our hands and feet in the race car are not comparable with the pedals , controls and switches in an airplane , " he continued . <p> Despite the differences between the two , both the R18 and Eurofighter represent the very best of what 's technical possible currently , require an immense amount of training to operate and demands the very best of their respective pilot/driver in terms of physical as well as mental prowess . <p> Originating from the corporate world with a background in finance and economics , Gerard 's strong love for cars led him to take the plunge into the automotive media industry .

It could simply be that you stumble upon and fall in love with the look of an older car or that it was the car that hung on the wall in picture form as a child . However , regardless of reason and regardless of make or model , those taking the plunge into classic car ownership tend to make the same mistakes . <p> " Unfortunately , there are often cases of people purchasing a ' rust bucket ' car that they think they can fix up , " begins McKeel Hagerty , CEO of classic car valuations and insurance company Hagerty .

" No matter what make or model of vehicle you are looking to buy , always buy the best example that you can afford , even if you have the skills and talent to work on a project , " explains Hagerty . <p> The better the example the less expensive it is going to be to keep on the road .

But expect to pay a hefty premium . Likewise , the tyres for the Jaguar XJ220 , once the world 's fastest production vehicle , are bespoke and Bridgestone , the company that made them , is n't making any more . <p> But like Ferrari and Porsche , Mercedes and Jaguar occupy the lofty heights of the classic car market and another common misconception , according to Hagerty , is that you need to be rich to own a classic . " There are many great ' affordable classic ' options that are easy to get in to under the US$10,000 ( RM40,000 ) or even US$5,000 range . " <p> Likewise , make sure the car is one with a collectors ' or owners club and sign up to it .

It was a consensus that if you sent the Myvi for proper , regular servicing , it would keep on chugging for the better part of a decade . The variant I opted for was the 1.5 SE Manual -- although had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have chosen that instead . The manual is not the most slick-shifting transmission on the market , but it does make the driving experience a lot more entertaining . The 1.5-litre engine also has a wealth of low-end torque that the 1.3-litre units do n't quite have . <p> Compare the Iriz 's driving experience with your car <p> It is clear that despite the Iriz being similar in capacity to my Myvi and packing a 5-speed manual as well , the execution of the two cars is entirely different . The strongest inherent characteristic of the Iriz is its fantastic handling balance : the chassis is neutral on the limit , and the steering is direct and precise even if lacking a little in feel . Dynamics has been Proton 's strong point , and the Iriz is no different . <p> In comparison , the Myvi lacks that dynamic edge in terms of precision and body control , but it makes up for this in a number of other ways . Where the Myvi gear shift may be notchy at times , it has a more positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iriz has very short throw and even less feel , but perhaps the largest issue with the Iriz is the throttle delay that became prevalent in the Campro era of Proton powertrains . The 1.6-litre engine itself is a little rough around the edges and it lacks the low end punch of the Myvi -- which can make overtaking a little bit of a chore at times . At the top end of the rev range it does perform far better than the Myvi 's 1.5-litre lump , but rarely do you get up there to appreciate that high end pull . <p> Specific to this variant of the Iriz , the kit list feels far more extravagant than my own Myvi -- although you could also attribute that to the RM 9,000 price difference and the fact that the Iriz Premium variants would appropriately compete with the Myvi 1.5 Advance . It is worth nothing that the Iriz comes with ESC , which is not available on any Myvi variant , although personally I feel that neither car needs such a system . <p> What aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By far it has to be the handling of the Iriz that I would like to incorporate , or at the very least , emulate in the Myvi . The Iriz is leaps and bounds ahead of the Myvi in terms of dynamic ability straight out of the showroom , with Perodua taking more conservative measures when it came to suspension selection and tyre choice . <p> Would you trade your car for the Iriz ? Why ? <p> No , both in the short term and the long run . As we have waxed lyrical about the Iriz 's handling ability , it remains the only aspect that impresses me about the Iriz . The powertrain was a good attempt but it still lacks the finesse required to be competitive in a modern environment , and the understanding that low-end torque is far more important for everyday driving . The Myvi is a lot easier to drive in day-to- day situations , and you can leave it in fifth gear for most of your commute unless you get trapped in slower moving traffic . I am also positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Iriz with some aftermarket tuning . The Iriz is a solid product and a great attempt by Proton , but the Myvi is just that little bit better suited for my needs . <p> Concluding Remarks <p> As affordable entry-level hatchbacks , the Iriz , Myvi , and Picanto need to appeal to a wide range of consumers . They need to be affordably priced in order to be accessible to the masses , yet they can not feel cheap so as to maintain their appeal in the eyes of affluent buyers who also look at this segment for spare vehicles in the household . <p> Perodua has undoubtedly gotten the formula right with the Myvi - the scores of these cars you see on the road bears testimony to that fact . The Picanto , for what it 's worth , is an excellent effort on Kia 's part . It is an effective demonstration of how to make an entry-level vehicle affordable and respectable . The Iriz , meanwhile , is a fine effort on Proton 's part - it was developed with the least economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the same requirements in cost and specifications . We also like that Proton went the extra mile with safety and driving dynamics of the Iriz , qualities often neglected in this segment . <p> Each of the three cars featured here has its own unique blend of strength and weaknesses . The Myvi is the consummate all-rounder , but we found that the perfect motoring solution in this pool would be a vehicle that combines the safety , ride , and handling of the Iriz ; powertrain and cabin space of the Myvi ; and the zestiness and sophistication of the Picanto . <p> Prefering his cars to come with four disc brakes , independent rear suspension , and manual transmission , Kon prioritizes mechanical sophistication over outward appeal . Admires cars built to exceed the sum of their parts and appreciates vehicles engineered with integrity .

There he participated in mission drives to fund the Jesuits ' activities in Honduras , visiting the country briefly in 1974 to present the proceeds . <p> In 2014 he told Rockhurst 's newspaper , Prep News Online , that " I vowed to return one day and was able to take a year off law school in 1980-81 to go back and volunteer with wonderful Missouri province Jesuits and their Spanish and Honduran counterparts , who worked hard everyday to live and preach the Good News among the poor in Yoro Province . " <p> " What I learned that year from the Jesuits and the comunidad put me on a public service path that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teacher and elected official , " he continued . <p> According to the Washington Post , Kaine said in 2005 : " I made a decision when I came back from Honduras ... that I am not going to focus on making as much money as I can make . I am going to focus on doing things where I can serve people . " <p> In a 2010 interview with CNN , Kaine described his time in Honduras , when he was 22 , as " the turning point in my life . I was at Harvard Law School and did n't know what I wanted to do with my life ... The most powerful memory was the great people I met there who convinced me that a life of serving others was the way to be happy . " <p> And during a November 2014 visit to Honduras , Kaine stated that " I think of El Progreso everyday . The people , aside from my family , are the most important in shaping who I am today . " <p> El Progreso is the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Kaine spent nine months volunteering with the Jesuits . <p> He visited the city again in February 2015 , commenting , " El Progreso is extremely special to me . My experience working at Loyola taught me the importance of access to skills-based training -- both in Honduras and the U.S. -- and inspired me to pursue the issue of expanding career and technical education in the U.S. Senate . " <p> In a June 7 , 2016 interview with C-SPAN , Kaine said that his experience with the Jesuits put him " in a seeker mode where it pushed ( him ) not to just accept what ( he ) had been taught " but encouraged him to seek his " own answers . " The Jesuits , he said , were an important part of his transition to adulthood , where he did n't just accept the answers he was given by what he has described as his devout , Irish Catholic parents . <p> At the time of Kaine 's 1980-81 volunteer work in Honduras , the country has been ruled by the military for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I lived in Honduras under a military dictatorship that deprived people of even the right to vote , I learned to value what we have and do my little bit to protect and better it . " <p> In 1980 , each of Honduras ' neighbors were gripped in civil wars between right-wing military governments and left-wing revolutionaries : Guatemala 's had started in 1960 , and El Salvador 's in 1979 . To the south in Nicaragua , the Sandinista National Liberation Front had ousted the Somoza dictatorship in 1979 , but fought counterrevolutionaries throughout the 1980s . <p> The Council on Foreign Relations noted in 2012 that " Honduras did not have a civil war of its own , but nonetheless felt the effects of its neighbors ' conflicts ; it served as a staging ground for U.S.-backed Contras , a right-wing rebel group fighting Nicaragua 's Sandinista government during the 1980s . " <p> Surrounded by " hot " theaters of the Cold War , Honduras " became the stronghold from which the United States attempted to stabilise the region against the forces of Communism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " State-sanctioned political repression , disappearances and death squad executions were ubiquitous , " he continued . <p> As early as 1979 , Honduras established Battalion 3-16 , an army unit " trained and equipped by the CIA to gather intelligence about subversives , " according to the Baltimore Sun . The publication also found in the course of a 14-month investigation that hundreds of Honduran citizens were kidnapped , tortured and killed by Battalion 3-16 in the 1980s . <p> Honduras ' military government held a general election in 1981 , which was won by the Liberal Party , a center-right group which had not held power since a 1963 military coup d ' ? tat . <p> It was in this context that Kaine arrived in Honduras in 1980 . <p> In a recent article at The Nation , Dr. Greg Grandin ( a professor of history at New York University ) , wrote that in 1980 , Honduras " was quickly turning into the crossroads of Cold War . " <p> " It was into this whirlwind that young Tim Kaine flung himself on his voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of this , however , comes across in anything Kaine says about his time in Honduras . " <p> Kaine 's volunteer work with the Jesuits in Honduras has been portrayed as teaching carpentry and welding at the Instituto Tecnico Loyola , which gives vocational training to at-risk youth . <p> Father Mauricio Gaborit , S.J. , whom America Magazine has called a long-distance mentor of Kaine and who met Kaine in 1974 while working in El Progreso , said that during Kaine 's 1980-81 visit the young man would visit villages to recruit students for the technical institute , befriend them , and help them to sell the goods they made . Fr . Gaborit said Kaine also taught English and religion classes . <p> Father Jack Warner , S.J. , an American who lived with Kaine in Honduras and who currently lives in El Progreso , told CNA that Kaine 's work was mostly focused on the Instituto Tecnico Loyola , but that he also helped with the design of the carpentry of a small theater the priest founded . <p> Dr. Andr ? s Le ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Costa Rica , has written that the work of the Jesuits in the Aguan valley of northern Honduras " was oriented mainly around organizing and supporting peasant cooperatives . " <p> " These were all priests influenced by Liberation Theology , " Le ? n wrote in his 2015 dissertation for the City University of New York . " They were particularly active in the area of political training , especially through their radio schools -- teaching reading and writing as the basis for organization . " <p> He described the Jesuits as " in the thick of the struggle for land " between farmers and ranchers , but that they " also were usually the first to denounce injustices taking place within the cooperatives ( corruption and violence above all ) . " <p> Le ? n noted the 1975 Horcones massacre as among the events that " shifted the ways in which the Jesuits approached their political work in the communities . " <p> In June 1975 , the bodies of 14 people heading to a hunger march in the capital city Tegucigalpa were found on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome Cypher and Father Iv ? n Betancourt . Le ? n wrote that " Perpetrated by members of the Honduran army with the support of local cattle ranchers , the massacre was understood as an attempt by the military government ... to stop the increasing militancy and radicalism of the peasant movement , " which was pushing for land reform . <p> According to Le ? n , in the aftermath of the massacre the Honduran bishops instructed parishes " to lay low and fire anyone affiliated with the left-oriented parties , " which " basically meant a retreat from any open political activity . " <p> This instruction was extremely distasteful to Father James Carney , S.J. , an American-born priest who embraced liberation theology and revolution in the 1970s , was exiled from Honduras in 1979 for his increasingly radical activities and promotion of Marxist ideology . <p> Father Carney wrote in his autobiography that after the Horcones massacre " the Catholic hierarchy , the majority of the priests and also the laymen in Honduras retreated from any social commitment and became nonpolitical and very anticommunist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Kaine was there , Father Carney corresponded with the Jesuits in Honduras , encouraging them in their work . He later re-entered Honduras as a chaplain for a leftist guerrilla unit and was " disappeared " , and likely executed , by the Honduran military , in 1983 . <p> After an interview with Kaine , Jason Horowitz wrote in the New York Times Sept. 2 that though Father Carney was exiled from Honduras during Kaine 's stay , Kaine sought him out " during a short stay in Nicaragua . " <p> " Mr. Kaine hopped off a bus in northern Nicaragua , walked miles to Father Carney 's remote parish and spent a memorable evening listening to the priest describe ' both getting pushed around by the military and getting pushed around by the church , ' " Horowitz said . <p> He added that Kaine " embraced " liberation theology , saying he told his pastor in Richmond , Va. , " that his exposure to liberation theology had ' changed him , it deepened him .

By no means were most Jesuits left wing , but many , perhaps the majority , were at least broadly committed to what was called the ' social gospel . ' " <p> This was echoed by Horowitz , who said that " most of the American Jesuits Mr. Kaine worked with on a daily basis had a more pragmatic streak and rolled their eyes during philosophical debates about liberation theology . " <p> According to Grandin , when Kaine stayed in Honduras , the Jesuit mission at El Progreso " was focusing its work on labor issues and the welfare of plantations laborers and their families . " <p> Grandin interviewed Dr. Jefferson Boyer , an emeritus professor of anthropology at Appalacian State University , about the Jesuits in Honduras . Boyer spent six years in Honduras , earning a doctorate with his 1982 dissertation " Agrarian Capitalism and Peasant Praxis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . <p> Grandin relates that Boyer remembered a " split " among the " North Coast Jesuits " of Honduras , along the lines of liberation theology and the election of St. John Paul II as Bishop of Rome . <p> He wrote that Boyer said " the US Jesuits in Honduras tended to be more conservative , while younger Latin American and European Jesuits ' consistently held democratic socialist positions , ' " though Father Carney was the exception to this rule . <p> Kaine 's mentor in El Progreso was Father Jarrell " Patricio " Wade , S.J. , according to Grandin , who describes the priest as having ethics " more pastoral than political . " He says Boyer called Father Wade a " traditional Jesuit " , and that Father Carney said Father Wade " blamed his political work with peasants for provoking the growing repression against priests . " <p> Kaine and his wife Anne celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in November 2004 by visiting El Progreso , where they spent a couple a couple days with Father Wade , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his time with Father Wade -- who remained in Honduras until his death in 2014 -- is that they visited an impoverished family around Christmas , and the father gave the priest a bag of food as a Christmas gift . <p> " Kaine said he was shocked and angry that the priest had accepted food from a man whose own children clearly were not getting enough to eat , " Timothy Dwyer wrote in the Washington Post . " For five minutes or more they walked in silence , until the priest turned to Kaine and said : ' Tim , you know you really have to be humble to accept a gift of food from a family that poor . ' " <p> Kaine told the Post : " That one sentence that Patricio said to me is the thing that I have come back to most often in the last 25 years as I try to figure out what to do and what I ought to be doing . " <p> In his 2010 interview with CNN , Kaine mentioned , alongside Father Wade , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " people who at a young -- at an early time in my life really put me on a path I still feel like I 'm on to try to , you know , be of service to others . " <p> Father Gaborit told America that Kaine , in reflecting on the situation of the poor , " went the route of optimism . He saw himself ... helping people . " <p> Grandin writes that " According to his own account , " Kaine " provided politically neutral technical training , helping with a program that taught carpentry and welding . " <p> But he quotes Boyer as saying that " if Tim Kaine was working as a Jesuit volunteer in 1980 , he could not have avoided become immersed in these socio-religious , political currents and cross-currents . He would have been exposed to both conservative and generally more left and activist work of his hosts and mentors . " <p> This view was echoed by Father Warner , who told CNA that Kaine would certainly have had contact with the troubled situation in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence ) , the force , affected everyone , because the reality of the situation at that time one simply could not escape , there was no way to look in another direction , " he said . <p> Father Warner spoke to the New York Times about liberation theology , saying that " the gospel is an extremely communist document " and that St. John Paul II 's crackdown on liberation theology was " one of the reasons we did n't make too much noise about it . " <p> And sympathy for Father Carney 's radicalized vision of liberation theology continues today through the work of Father Ismael Moreno Coto , S.J. , director of Radio Progreso , who also worked with Kaine during his time in Honduras . <p> During a September 2015 commemoration of Father Carney 's disappearance , Father Moreno called on those in attendance " to follow his Father Carney 's footsteps and memory of struggling to continue to build a more just and equitable society .

If the world 's most powerful nation , the United States , remains powerless to put a stop to what its staunch ally , South Korea , called the " maniacal recklessness " of Pyongyang , what hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor that outcompetes Jong-un for the bad boy mantle is Daesh ( or the so-called Islamic State ) , whose very calling card is destruction , devastation and damnation . <p> Predictably , too , the US and Seoul , added to the tension , indicated that they would imminently carry out a series of joint war exercises this week over the Korean peninsula . An advanced US B-1B bomber was due to fly to Korea on Tuesday from the US base in Guam in an apparent show of strength and solidarity with Seoul . More disconcerting is the lobbying of more than 30 right-wing South Korean members of parliament for the country to develop its own nuclear weapons programme or the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from the South under a 1991 pact . <p> The two sides and their allies are effectively also fighting a parallel war of brinkmanship . <p> The problem is that the international community , primarily the US and its Western allies , have treated the North Korean shenanigans as a narrow nuclear weapons and disarmament issue , when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy , trade and the environment . <p> Moreover , it remains a living legacy of the continuing consequences of the Korean War of 1950-53 , which was effectively an ideological proxy war between the communist North and the democratic South , and therefore between their main protagonists , China and the US . <p> China , North Korea 's main ally during the Korean War and still today , lost more than 180,000 soldiers who perished in the bitter internecine fighting , which claimed an estimated three million lives on both sides -- military and civilian -- including 150,000 Allied troops . <p> The Korean War had one positive unintended consequence -- the reconstruction of defeated Japan as a vital supply base for the Allied campaign in the Korean Peninsula by General Douglas MacArthur , the Supreme Allied commander of Korea , resulting in the post-war Japanese economic miracle . <p> The IAEA may have its " Atoms for Peace " initiative , which supports the use of nuclear energy for peaceful activities , such as power generation and nuclear medicine , but we have also seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea and unwittingly Pakistan . Had Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi still been in power today , this Silk Road of nuclear weapons could easily have extended to Benghazi and beyond . <p> The reality is that the solution does not lie with Pyongyang , but with Beijing , whose response to successive nuclear weapons tests by its southern ally has been revealing . After the latest test , Beijing warned that the solution to the crisis does not lie with unilateral action or with sanctions . It insisted that the solution lies with the US . <p> This is an oblique criticism of Washington 's unwavering support for South Korea and the continued demarcation of the Korean Peninsula along the 38th Parallel into two artificial states -- the communist North and the democratic South . <p> The presence of permanent US bases and troops on the Korean Peninsula is rightly or wrongly perceived as a real or existential threat to their sovereignty by both Beijing and Pyongyang . The decision last January by Seoul in response to Pyongyang 's fourth nuclear test to allow the US to deploy its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially detects and shoots down missiles , over South Korea , further stoked up the war of words . <p> China regards this as an extraterritorial extension of US hegemony in a region that is not its usual sphere of influence -- just as Washington considered Cuba as not a natural sphere of influence of the Soviet Union but as a threat in its backyard during the Cuban Missile Crisis . US strategy in Korea , Beijing suspects , is that of containment of China . Beijing 's oft-quoted Korean Peninsula mantra of " ' no war , no instability , no nukes " in that order of importance reveals that nuclear disarmament is not a priority . <p> This feeds into the vexed question of Korean reunification . There are currently two countries that remain divided , namely Korea and Cyprus . The difference between the two is that the former involves two diametrically opposed nuclear world powers supporting their respective allies . <p> The latter has its roots in an historical dispute between two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation members , Turkey and Greece , in the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for territory by the Axis Powers and their proxies , Greece and Armenia . The 1919-22 War of Independence saw a rump Turkish army led by Mustafa Kemal defeat both Greek and Armenian troops , resulting in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and the advent of the Turkish Republic . <p> A third country , Yemen , used to be divided , then got reunited , and has since degenerated into a civil war with a danger yet again of splitting up into North and South , propped up by their political paymasters Saudi Arabia and Iran . <p> The most successful reunification of a country in the 20th century to date is that of Germany . It took a unique series of events to create the conditions for wiedervereinigung ( reunification ) -- the post-war German economic miracle thanks to the Marshall Plan ; post-war German leadership of exceptional quality , including chancellors Konrad Adenauer , Ludwig Wilhelm Erhard , Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt ; entrenched Allied Occupation of Berlin split between the Western allies in West Berlin and the Soviets in East Berlin ; the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasnost under Mikhail Gorbachev ; and the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall . <p> The Korean Peninsula needs a similar collapse of the 38th Parallel ; a transformation of China hopefully into a pluralist democracy ; the emergence of a Chinese Gorbachev ; Korean leaders of exceptional quality on both sides ; the demilitarisation and denuclearisation of the peninsula , including the closure of US bases ; and a Korean Marshall Plan which would facilitate an orderly coming together and mitigate the ravages wreaked upon its population by the communist dynasty created by Kim Il-sung since 1948 . <p> If the underlying causes are removed , then the very raison de'tre and the necessity for nuclear weapons may be eliminated . <p> The debate about whether Pyongyang has nuclear weapons ; whether it has successfully miniaturised these into a nuclear warhead payload mounted on ballistic missiles ; whether it does possess such missiles ; whether it has created a more devastating hydrogen bomb ; whether the explosive load of the latest test is 10 or 20 kilotonnes -- all of which have never been independently verified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated five UN Security Council resolutions since 2006 when the first test occurred .

Is it done according to the number of voters or the size of an area ? <p> " If you see what has been announced , a lot of areas were carved out and this has changed the voter demographics .

What is the political significance of the meeting ? <p> Some people immediately said , " Politics is the art of the possible " , " The enemy of my enemy is my friend " , and " We have no permanent friends or permanent enemies , only permanent interests " . These lines are blas ? . They tell us nothing beyond the obvious . <p> Nor can we be happy surely to be told that everyone should leave the past behind and go forward " in the national interest " , to " save the country " , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not when the past weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living . Some people demanded that Mahathir should apologise for every wrong that he 'd done ( and there were people who thought that whatever he did as prime minister was wrong ) . <p> Second , when Anwar disagreed with Mahathir on how to solve the financial crisis of 1997-98 , and Mahathir had Anwar jailed , were n't they both acting to save the national economy ? <p> One journalist repeatedly asked Anwar if he trusted Mahathir . Luckily Anwar was n't so crass as to ask , " Do I have to kiss him ? " -- which was how Mahathir retorted when he was asked if they were on good terms , shortly before he fired Anwar . <p> An opposition politician thought that the meeting would rattle Umno . One Umno politician ( pointless to remember the name these days ) approved of the meeting because it would cause PKR members to leave the party in disgust . <p> What Mahathir and Anwar said <p> Evidently , few were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few words they uttered outside their private conversation . That is an error . <p> We watch what politicians do . We do n't just heed what they say . Hence , there 's that other clich ? about how they should ' walk the talk ' . There are times , however , when we dissect what little we hear for what it bears . <p> What was the most important thing Mahathir said ? It was that he went to support Anwar over a crucial issue on which their positions agreed . He would not be drawn into talking about making peace or working for Anwar 's release . <p> What was the most pertinent thing that Anwar mentioned ? He was silent on the past and about trust but he remarked that Mahathir " has now embraced the reform agenda " . <p> " A single detail , " a French news editor notes , " is sometimes enough to sketch an ideological picture . " Can we sketch an ideological picture from that single detail of a fateful meeting ? <p> If we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , there is consensus that Umno obstructs the agenda of the day , namely , the deep reform of the political system . For that , and to reverse the degradation of public institutions , Umno , not just its current leadership , has to go . <p> Mahathir is no one 's fool . He knows he was responsible for a lot in this matter . But he 's 91 and no recluse . Should he spend the rest of his life dwelling upon the past in remorse ? Does n't it make more sense to let him risk all that he has on the future ? <p> Anwar was not above blame in this . He was more gracious in admitting as much after his fall . If one is religious , one might even say , with empathy , that he 's been atoning for his sins ever since . <p> It has taken Mahathir 18 years to reach a conclusion that , as it were , he forced upon Anwar in 1998 : the true and urgent agenda is the unfinished one of Reformasi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , the former master can only be the follower . Anwar raised the call to Reformasi . A host of dissident forces rallied to it with courage , dedication and inventiveness . <p> Mahathir has no intuitive affinity with dissidents . He jailed some of them . Still , non-conformity is not alien to him . He went to Bersih 4 to back the cause but not the movement -- as he later met Anwar only to support his suit . <p> Such distinctions do n't matter so long as this much is understood : Mahathir can help to dismantle the existing order . He can not lead the project of reform . <p> Mahathir has long given two differing justifications for imprisoning Anwar . On the one hand , he said that Anwar would have succeeded him as prime minister had Anwar not been " immoral " . The insinuation was of alleged sodomy . On the other hand , he more than implied that he got rid of Anwar because the latter tried to overthrow him . <p> What else is significant about Mahathir 's meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for Sodomy I. That by itself should tell the world what Mahathir really thinks of Sodomy II . <p> Speaking of Mahathir 's visit , Anwar used the word ' embraced ' . It carries a connotation of conversion to a radically different view of the world . Has Mahathir , after looking over his ex-Umno camp , accepted his former ' anointed successor ' as the leader of the reform agenda ? <p> Anwar 's relationship with Mahathir was once free of mutual betrayal . For 16 years , their careers developed in parallel . While Mahathir backed his prot ? g ? , Anwar fought the battles of his boss . The financial crisis of 1997 was the source of their rupture . <p> Thereafter , the ballad of Anwar and Mahathir was a tortured one . The fall of the one forced the departure of the other , the humiliation of Anwar led to the condemnation of Mahathir .

So much so we now have halal lifts , halal hotels , halal buffets and the likes , " he said , adding that as an example , this year , hotels were not allowed to have Ramadan buffets without first obtaining halal certification . <p> Art also cautioned that this move , if followed through , would eventually result in all Malay or Muslim entrepreneurs being forced or compelled to obtain this halal certification for fear that if they did not , their products would be perceived as not halal . <p> Former de facto law minister Zaid Ibrahim also tweeted on the issue , saying : " Yes some Muslims are more Muslim than others ; some Malays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more halal than others .

It 's Malaysia . And that 's probably one reason investors are nervous about the nation 's banking stocks : <p> To see why such misgivings may be justified , consider the simple way a bank in Asia can raise short-term dollar resources : borrow locally in the interbank market , use those funds to buy greenbacks in the spot market and then sell them forward by , say , three months . <p> In the summer of 2013 , after Ben Bernanke first hinted at tapering the Federal Reserve 's quantitative-easing program , the total cost of this operation had shot up to 1.2 percent for Indian banks , compared with three-month dollar Libor of 0.28 percent . Dollar liquidity was suddenly so elusive that the central bank gave a subsidy to lenders for raising foreign-currency deposits from expat Indians at high interest rates . <p> U.S. dollar Libor <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged to as much as 0.87 percent . That 's partly because of expected monetary tightening and partly because of a seismic overhaul of the $2.6 trillion money-market industry that kicks in next month . <p> But Indian banks are n't breaking a sweat : they can effectively borrow the U.S. currency at just 0.39 percent , a discount to Libor . <p> Not everybody in Asia is so fortunate . If there 's truly a dollar-funding crunch for banks in the region ex Japan , it 's in Malaysia , where three-month dollar borrowing is as expensive as 1.44 percent . <p> The timing could n't be worse . Several countries are investigating allegations of theft and laundering of billions of dollars from 1MDB , a Malaysian state fund whose advisory board was until recently headed by Prime Minister Najib Razak . <p> Meanwhile , Malaysian banks ' deposit growth has stalled , led by a 10 percent decline in foreign-currency deposits so far this year .

The way the hard-currency funding deficit is shaping up in Malaysia 's banking system , it might actually be more helpful for lenders if the ringgit got cheap enough for the country 's non-commodity exports to rev up , and for dollars to start pouring back in . <p> This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners .

While there have been countless books about climate change over the past two decades , this one -- entitled The Madhouse Effect - distinguishes itself by its clear and straightforward science mixed with clever and sometimes comedic presentation . <p> In approximately 150 pages , this books deals with the basic science and the denial industry , which has lost the battle in the scientific arena and is working feverishly to confuse the public . The authors also cover potential solutions to halt or slow our changing climate . Perhaps most importantly , this book gives individual guidance -- what can we do , as individuals , to help the Earth heal from the real and present harm of climate change ? <p> To start the book , the authors discuss how the scientific method works , the importance of the precautionary principle , and how delaying actions have caused us to lose precious time in this global race to halt climate change . And all of this done in only 13 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic science of the greenhouse effect . Readers of this column know that the science of global warming is very well established with decades of research . But some people do n't realize that this research originated in the early 1800s with scientists such as Joseph Fourier . The book takes us on a short tour of history . Moving beyond these early works that focused exclusively on global temperatures , the authors come to expected impacts . They explain that a warming world , for instance , can be both drier and wetter ! <p> This seeming paradox is a result of our expectation that areas which are currently wet will become wetter with an increase in the most-heavy downpours . A great example is the flooding this year in the Southeast United States . The reason for this is simple : a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor . In other areas -- especially those already dry - it will become drier because evaporation will speed up . If there is no available moisture to enter into the atmosphere ( i.e. an arid region ) , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clear language , the authors also discuss impacts on storms , hurricanes , rising oceans , and so on . <p> With the basic science covered , the authors quickly move into reasons why readers should care . Many of the big risks climate change presents are covered . Included here are security , water availability , food production , land use and availability , human health , and risks to the world economies and ecosystems . Simply put , these are not future and abstract risks . They are current risks that are becoming more severe and will affect all of us . <p> The chapter that was most interesting to me was the stages of climate denial . The first stage is " it 's not happening , " where outright denial of the reality of climate change was discussed . The authors use an example of this stage which came from the climate contrarians Roy Spencer and John Christy , who claimed that the Earth was n't warming . <p> Technically , Christy and Spencer claimed that a part of the Earth 's atmosphere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the globe . It was discovered that these contrarians had made some elementary errors in their calculations . When those calculations were corrected , their results fell into line with other research . I 've written many times about the many errors from contrarian scientists -- certainly not limited to Christy and Spencer . Within the scientific community , the contrarians have made so many technical errors that their work is no longer taken seriously by many scientists . But this has n't stopped the denial industry from showcasing their work , even though it is discredited . <p> The next stages of denial involve admissions that climate change is happening but that it is natural , it will self-correct , or it will climate change will benefit us . The tale of mistakes made in the science underlying these arguments is told in the book , and would be humorous if not so serious . The tales involve cherry-picked data , resigning editors , and other mistakes . For readers who may be concerned about getting lost in the weeds , do n't worry . The authors do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that readers do n't need a PhD in climate science to see the patterns . <p> Next , the book covers the denial industry including some of the key groups and persons who were responsible for a systematic rejection of the prevailing scientific view , or at least insidious questioning so that in the public 's mind there would be no consensus . This effort which not only denied the causes and effects of climate change , but also the health risks of tobacco was coupled with funding to scientists , " petitions " designed to appear as if they originated from the National Academy of Sciences , and an interconnected network of funded think tanks . <p> One result of all of this is that actual scientists who spend their lives studying the Earth 's climate have been attacked . One of the authors of this book ( Michael Mann ) is perhaps in the world 's best position to tell this tale because he personally knows many of the scientists who have been attacked professionally and personally , including the late Stephen Schneider , Ben Santer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortune of knowing these scientists and I can attest that they ( and others ) go into this field because they have an intense curiosity . Scientists want to know how things work and why . A side benefit is our understanding can give us guidance about the future . I do n't know of a single scientist who went into this field either for money or ideology . It 's shocking to be attacked for wanting to know , or for doing our jobs and telling the public about the scientific implications of our actions . <p> The book finishes by moving to the main political persons and groups that now populate the contrarian landscape . These groups and persons either continue the attacks on scientists , fund the denialist groups , or try to claim that taking action on climate change will do no good . The book finishes with the fallacy of geoengineering -- which is seriously being considered and contrasts geoengineering with practical things individuals can do to make a difference . <p> What 's great about the ending is that often times , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in submission , " what can I do about this problem ? " . Well there are things we can do , either as individuals or as a community . Together , we can make a difference , bend the curve of emissions and create a better future for all of us.

On December 7 , 1965 , Pope Paul VI in Rome and the ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras in Istanbul terminated the mutual excommunications " from memory and from the midst of the Church " and committed them " to oblivion . " <p> But efforts toward healing have taken place . Upon the invitation of Archbishop Bruno Forte from Chieti-Vasto , Italy , 70 Orthodox bishops together with two cardinals and numerous other high clergymen of the Roman Catholic Church celebrated the Orthodox " divine liturgy " of St. John Chrysostom on September 18 , 2016 in the Basilica of the Holy Face before the Face of Christ , which is displayed above the main altar of the church . <p> Your Eminence , Archbishop Bruno Forte calls the " Holy Face " of Christ the " polar star of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the veil with the image is identical to Veronica 's veil of Christ that John mentions next to the linen bandages in the holy tomb . Is that however not provocative for the Orthodox brothers ? Cardinal Koch : Christians believe in one God who showed his concrete face in Jesus Christ . And the closer we come to know to the Face of Christ and the deeper we become one in him , the deeper we also become one among ourselves . Therefore , it is a wonderful occasion to be before the face of Christ , to pray , to venerate the Face in order to ask for his wish to be fulfilled that we find unity . <p> Catholics have something to bring the Orthodox . The other way around is also true , with the Orthodox , say with their culture of venerating icons . Could it be this : that from this day on , the images could be newly comprehended and valued in the Catholic Church -- in the midst of that powerful " Iconic Turn , " which the media experts today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like never before ? Yes , the innermost mystery of ecumenism is an exchange of gifts . Every church has their gifts . And the icons are a special gift of Orthodoxy . I believe therefore that many Christians in the west can find a new approach to the icons and so deepen their faith . That is a magnificent gift . It is very important that we in the western tradition also renew our appreciation for the image . Through the reformation in the 16th century , we set a totally new emphasis on the word . But the Word was made flesh . The Word was made visible . Therefore the images belong with faith . That is a gift of the Orthodox that we accept gratefully . <p> Ten years ago , Peter , in the form of Pope Benedict , came here . Since then , there has been a tremendous turn in the appreciation of this image of Manoppello . Since then , it has become world-renown . Today , the Synod of Bishops came . What meaning do you think will someday be attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very nice that after 10 years we were allowed to come here on this jubilee .

This jubilee can perhaps aid the search for unity between the Church in the east and the Church in the west . <p> You are , as president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in Rome , responsible for ecumenism . Pope Francis has said , " Look at Christ and proceed courageously ! " What would you say in light of today , when you came together in this difference of the eastern and western Church before this image of Christ , would be the next step to approach Christ courageously ? We are actually always on the way towards Christ . For it is His Will that we find unity . That is not a human project .

The " Face of Mercy " was given this year its very own meaning . What do you feel when you stand here today before the merciful glance of Christ , who looks at us from this wonderful veil ? It is a beautiful message that we have a merciful God , who knows that there are no hopeless causes for him . Even if a person has fallen so deeply , he can never fall deeper than into the hands of God .

What began with Bridget Jones 's Dairy in 2001 , and then in Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason in 2004 , with Renee Zellweger as the lead character , is at long last concluded . <p> She fell in love , then out , and now realises who she really , really loves . <p> The dithery , clutzy Bridget , with all her imperfections in the first movie , hit home a few times for the romantic-comedy narrative , which was encapsulated by the timeless line when dishy barrister Mark Darcy ( Colin Firth ) tells the plump lass , " I like you just as you are " . <p> There is no such classic takeaway in Baby , unless , you count the high-flying Darcy ( Firth again ) saying : " Well , I can always find time to save the world .

So , here 's Bridget on her sofa , again , in her jammies , again , with a cupcake getting cutely depressed to Jamie O'Neal 's All By Myself , again ( that song was in Diary too ) . <p> Ah , but she 's so seemingly hip now that she switches that song off and on to House of Pain 's Jump Around , an early 90s club favourite .

Back on earth , and at work , she has to attend a baby christening and meets the dashing Darcy who is now almost single . Things happen , to more music , and now Bridget is pregnant . Mamma Mia ! But who 's the father , Bridget ? That 's the rest of the story , a madcappish ride to the altar . <p> Solemani , whom we saw in Bad Education , makes an impression with her sexy news presenter role while Emma Thompson 's doctor portrayal is a wonderfully ironical take on gynaecologists . <p> The narrative is predictable , from finding it impossible to pronounce Indian names to mistaking the Chinese chauffeur for the Chinese general that was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hipsters she works with , from saying " Hashtag : Let 's do this " after a board meeting with the new young boss to her resignation speech , where she hopes her child will be in an era when integrity is fashionable again . <p> But these are just frills to the ending -- so who does Bridget marry , and who is the father of her child ? <p> She does have that walk to the altar .

Because part of CILISOS 's daily activities is to look for interesting stories , Snopes has become our go-to site for checking up on how true a particular story is . And over time , we 've found some pretty interesting ones that have been proven to be false . <p> Here are 7 of the most Malaysia-related ones that Snopes has debunked. <h> 1 . Dragon killed in Semenanjung Malaysia ? <p> MYTH : <p> Back in 2015 , a series of photographs of a dead animal started circulating around the internet . Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> Original image from Snopes . <p> As the story goes , the owner of a fruit orchard in Semenanjung Malaysia shot this creature after he found out this creature had been eating his rabbits . Mana tau the creature also got fur like rabbit . <p> FACT : <p> Snopes snoped the poop out of this when they found out that these pictures had been going around the internet before , and the story was that this same creature was found by a fisherman in Mongolia in 2014 ! <p> " Was this dragon killed by a fisherman in Mongolia in 2014 , only to come back to life and steal rabbits from a farmer in Malaysia in 2015 ? " -- Snopes <p> Sadly it was n't a dragon la . Heck it seems that it was n't even a real animal because they found a video which showed that the whole thing was actually a sculpture which some flers made ! <p> Unfortunately , this was a rumour in which Snopes was n't able to verify . They mention that UNICEF did confirm that tsunami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real is debatable . <h> 3 . MH370 did n't go missing ... It 's actually a conspiracy .... <p> MYTH : <p> We all know that the MH370 incident has been nothing short of controversial , but sadly , with it came some conspiracy theories as well . <p> " Stolen passports were used by unknown individuals to apparently board the jets . The use of two stolen passports has been confirmed . Who else is there to suspect other than the Mossad ? It is that entity alone which has a history of committing such high crimes through the use of forged identities . " -- nodisinfo.com <p> And what Snopes usually does is have an article dedicated to debunking a claim/rumour . <p> Screencap from snopes.com <p> FACT : <p> " That article was just another spoof from NODISINFO.COM , a website whose stock in trade is satirizing far-out conspiracy claims by publishing outlandish versions of them ( frequently featuring " zionists " and " zionist cabals " ) . " -- Snopes <p> And also another claim that the MH370 tragedy happened over a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the story goes , 4 out of 5 people who owned this mysterious item were on MH370 , and the fifth person was involved in making the plane go missing . But Snopes debunked it too by checking the names of the people in the article and comparing it to the passenger manifest of MH370 . <p> A quick search on Snopes also brought up at least 6 other different stories about MH370 . Among them are some articles which debunk sightings of the aeroplane and pilot . <h> 4 . MSG + Coke = Date rape drug ? <p> MYTH : <p> Some of us would remember the very tragic rape and murder of Canny Ong back in 20o3 . The case surrounding her murder dragged on for years before her murderer , Ahmad Najib Aris , was sentenced to hang in 2005 . It was also in 2005 that a rumour started circulating that Canny Ong 's murderer drugged her using a concoction made by combining Coca-Cola and MSG.The rumour also said that Coke+MSG could also serve as a aphrodisiac , causing a person to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most popular and readily available drinks around , and MSG probably being the closest thing to replacing rice as a Malaysian staple , this claim is actually pretty scary . <p> Just an example of some of the foods that contain MSG . Image from healthybliss.net <p> FACT : <p> So is this true ? Well , far from it according to Snopes . They mention that MSG can cause headache and nausea amongst other things , BUT only to some people . <p> " Only some people experience adverse reactions to MSG . Spiking the drinks of random women in hopes of hitting upon one who is MSG-intolerant would n't be a very effective strategy for someone looking to incapacitate the unwary , especially considering that those who are susceptible to the chemical could experience any of the symptoms listed , and thus the potential rapist could just as easily end up with a woman who develops a headache , feels nauseous , or experiences chest pains rather than one who gets drowsy or excited . " -- Snopes <p> They also provide links of Coca-Cola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links were n't working anymore . But as for whether a combination of Coke+MSG was used on Canny Ong , that is n't true either because Canny Ong was actually threatened with a knife by her attacker. <h> 5 . Eggs on windshield used by robbers in Johor Bahru ? <p> MYTH : <p> If you 've ever been in a family Whatsapp group , you 've probably received messages about " what new tactics robbers are using " at least once . For example , this one story . <p> Please take this seriously ! <p> If you are driving at night and are attacked with eggs , do not operate the wiper and spray and water . Because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% <p> Then you are forced to stop at the road side and become a victim of robbers . This is a new technique used by robbers in Johor Bahru . <p> Please inform your friends and relatives ! ! <p> Image from Snopes . <p> FACT : <p> This , and many other warnings about robber techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story above has many variations , including the version above that mentions this took place in Johor Bahru . Also their attempts to find actual news articles about this egg tactic actually being used by robbers came to nothing . <p> They also question how the article was specific enough to say that it will block 92.5% of the driver 's vision . And also how a few eggs could obscure the driver 's whole view . <p> " It would take a number of extremely well-placed eggs ( a hen 's typical offerings are n't that big ) to splat a windshield so thoroughly as to completely impair the driver 's view and force him to stop immediately . " -- Snopes <p> Image from brainlesstales.com <p> So yea , seems a little too difficult to pull off on a moving car la. <h> 6 .

For one , Snopes say the source may have come from Malaysia but no one where the story came from . And by that virtue , whether the people in the story even existed . <p> Variations of the story also exist , with some versions stating that the wife passed away as soon as the husband realised that he still loved her . <p> So Snopes does n't say that this story is fake ( since we do n't know ) , but they do classify it as " Legend " . So for those of you who do love this story , do n't worry , they have become legendary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYTH : <p> So back to tsunamis .

Nowhere else in the Land of the Rising Sun is this more relevant than in Nikko , located 125 kilometres from Tokyo and famed for its holy shrines and autumnal foliage . <p> When folks visit Nikko , it 's usually to the Nikko National Park . This national park in the Kanto region includes both the UNESCO World Heritage site of " the Shrines and Temples of Nikko " , near the town of Nikko , as well as the natural splendour of scenic Okunikko , the mountainous region of Nikko to the west . Here you will find lakes , waterfalls , streams , marshlands and endless trails for lovers of hiking . <p> The misty Mount Nantai breaks out in autumnal colours ( left ) . Fallen momiji ( maple ) leaves in the waters of the Ryuzu Falls ( right ) . The season for viewing autumn leaves or momijigari in Nikko stretches up to three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikko is a far more forgiving destination for " hunting " autumn leaves -- momijigari is a combination of momiji ( " maple leaves " ) and gari ( hunting " ) -- as the landscape of riotous colours travels slowly from the mountain peaks down to the valley . <p> If you 're arriving earlier in the season , start in Okunikko . The highest point here would be Mount Nantai , a 2,486-metre high volcano often covered with mysterious mists . The adventurous hiker can attempt tracing the trail to its peak ; expect to climb for about four hours and cover four kilometres before you reach its summit . <p> The Senjogahara Plateau.Leaves turning red in parts of the Senjogahara Plateau.Those who are less athletic may prefer to wander the flatter , more forgiving marshes of the Senjogahara Plateau .

There are sturdy wooden walkways for visitors to explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle trickling of streams . <p> Lake Chuzenji.Cute swan-shaped boats at Lake Chuzenji.Further down Mount Nantai is Lake Chuzenji , which was supposedly formed by an eruption of the volcano 20,000 years ago .

This sacred bridge leads pilgrims into Nikko , considered by many to have been founded by the Heian-era Buddhist monk Shodo Shonin . According to ancient records , he crossed the Daiya River in the year 766 and built the Shihonryuji Temple ( later renamed Rinno-ji Temple ) . <p> Statue of Shodo Shonin , a Heian-era Buddhist monk responsible for building the temples in Nikko.Shodo Shonin was also the first person to climb Mount Nantai and explore the Lake Chuzenji . At the great lake , he was said to have carved a thousand-armed statue of Kannon ( the bodhisattva of mercy in Japan , known in Chinese-speaking countries as Guanyin ) from a single gigantic katsura tree . <p> Truth or myth , there 's no doubt that without Shodo Shonin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Nikko as we know it today -- a pilgrimage site of temples and shrines .

The juxtaposition of religious architecture with autumnal foliage is sublime . All over , different trees such as maple ( kaeda ) , ginkgo ( icho ) , larch ( karamatsu ) , beech ( buna ) and zelkova ( keyaki ) are stunning with their fiery branches of red and orange , copper and gold . <p> The Nitenmon or " the Gate of Two Gods " is the largest gate in Nikko.Moss-and-lichen covered torii gates are found at many shrines in Nikko.Taiyuinbyo is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu , founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate .

Wandering around its Japanese-style Shoyoen Garden , one ca n't help but wonder if the venerable Shodo Shonin once walked here too .

And yet he created a reputation for supporting and protecting the poor . <p> In the absence of strong governance institutions , Bhumibol was often called in to manage domestic political disputes , most notably in 1992 , when the military fired on tens of thousands of protesters who had gathered in Bangkok . The king summoned the Thai junta leader and the leader of the protest to his palace in the center of the city , and on live television both men prostrated themselves before him while he demanded an end to the bloodshed . <p> The junta pulled back , a civilian government was installed and by the 2000s Thailand seemed to be building a solid and stable democracy . The king was touted as a force for democratic change . <p> But , as working-class Thais , who had tolerated military and technocratic rule for decades , came to embrace the kingdom 's new democratic politics , they voted for populist parties that would shift political power away from the royal , military and political elites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's politics descended into a cycle of palace-endorsed coups , elected governments and violent street protests . <p> Adding to the uncertainty after Bhumibol 's death , Thailand 's current military junta has said the king 's heir , Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn , will not immediately assume the throne , because he needs time to mourn . In the meantime , the monarchy will be managed by a regent , long-time Bhumibol ally and former Thai prime minister and armed forces leader Prem Tinsulanonda . <p> General Prem is a divisive figure . Although he oversaw a period of rapid economic growth as prime minister , many poor Thais dislike him , favoring populist parties linked to former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , whose sister was also prime minister until she was ousted in a 2014 coup . <p> Many Thais consider Gen. Prem an arch-enemy of Mr. Thaksin , whose own government was toppled by the military in 2006 . To them , Gen.

Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage the crown 's transition . <p> There could be several reasons why Prince Vajiralongkorn is not immediately assuming the crown . For starters , he may realize that he is nowhere near as popular as his father and needs time to build public goodwill . <p> Alternatively , the junta ( and Gen. Prem and other Bhumibol advisers ) may have forced the crown prince 's decision , because they fear his playboy reputation and reported friendship with Mr. Thaksin . Yet another explanation is that the junta is stalling so that it can maneuver Prince Vajiralongkorn 's sister , the beloved Princess Sirindhorn , into power instead . <p> Bhumibol 's death further destabilizes an already unstable region . Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is mired in a corruption scandal . <p> In the Philippines , President Rodrigo Duterte , in power since June , has sent shockwaves across Southeast Asia by denouncing the US , inching closer to China and calling for the end to US-Philippine joint military exercises . <p> All Southeast Asian countries must balance their ties between China and the US . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having approved a new constitution in August .

American model Binx Walton said these words on her Instagram Story just hours ago , and I am not okay with it . <p> This is my response to this week 's episode of ' people who do n't understand what feminism is . ' But first , a recap : feminism is not about taking men down , it 's not about opposing men and it 's not about burning your bra . It 's about plain gender equality , which includes women and men sharing equal opportunities and being able to make choices about things , like what to wear , without being shamed . I do n't expose my nipples in public , but that 's just my choice . But if I , a woman , want to wear a see-through shirt without covering my nipples , so be it . ( Of course , there are cases where it 's considered disrespectful to show up with your nipples out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irony in that . ) <p> Forget being un-feminist , calling a woman a bitch or slut because her nipples are out is downright sexist . What do you call a man who wears a see-through shirt without covering his nipples ? Probably just a man in a shirt , if you 're not also ogling him for his rock-hard abs . <p> Even when we put feminism aside , it still begs the question : what business is it of anyone to call a woman a slut for wearing a revealing shirt ? If someone truly has a problem with public nakedness , they could look away . The beauty is that people have a choice not to look . <p> Maybe you forgot , Binx , but you walked the recent Saint Laurent show with one breast out .

Being free to have opinions about other opinions is a chicken-egg situation we ca n't avoid . But do n't call a woman a bitch or a slut because of what she wears . While we 're at it , I 'll address the opinions of those who would go on to say that a woman who dresses inappropriately risks rape .

Its spending on the healthcare system a year alone is larger than the whole economy of the United Kingdom at US$2.6 trillion or France at US$2.7 trillion . <p> If there are no changes with the way we do things , we might be another America .

The total expenditure for both public and private healthcare is at RM50.3bn ; where operational costs take up 93 per cent of the pie and only 7 per cent is allocated for development . <p> The GDP percentage spent on healthcare ranks Malaysia at number 156 in the world . The majority f Malaysians go to public healthcare facilities : 75 per cent of Malaysians seek in-patient treatment and 90 per cent of Malaysians seek out-patient treatment at public facilities . Despite that , the government spends only 52.4 per cent for total healthcare expenses .

A monitoring plan that can ensure continuous improvement in quality , effectiveness , accountability and most importantly affordability . <p> How do we measure performance ? If affordability is a measure , the cost of birthing in a hospital in the UK and Australia with 2.6 days stay is at one month 's median wage versus three months ' median wage in Malaysia .

It is easy to accuse individuals of not really taking care of their health and that the government has done their level best in ensuring that facilities are in place . <p> However , a person with the utmost healthcare awareness will not be able to do much if the public conditions are not set up to a reasonable standard . The government has a responsibility to ensure the condition of our clean water , a proper immunisation program , affordable healthy food and accommodation , other environmental issues and surroundings . <p> Another discussion is whether the healthcare expenditure by the government is a form of subsidy or a form of the government discharging its responsibility . If we are to agree that it is one of the government 's major responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare spending . <p> I find it irresponsible that in Pemandu 's subsidy rationalisation labs , healthcare is tagged as an item to be rationalised under the subsidy programme . Such identification can be deemed as a policy attitude towards healthcare ; that healthcare is a subsidy and not an investment . This will have an unhealthy effect towards healthcare . <p> By agreeing that healthcare is the government 's responsibility , we need to begin addressing more related issues -- such as privatisation , the cost of medicine and services , human capital and facilities , and third party administrators -- and exploring other successful models implemented by other countries and subsequently identifying a way forward . <p> Privatisation of healthcare and profiteering private hospitals and GLCs <p> The Malaysian government in 1983 under then Dr Mahathir Mohamad introduced privatisation policies which allow the private sector to play a greater role in taking away the government 's responsibilities in both healthcare and education . Healthcare has exhibited an ever increasing cost since then . <p> Private hospitals that were run by non-profit organisations or religious organisations are now increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the rich can afford private hospitals , and this would reduce traffic at government hospitals , allowing them to provide better services for poorer patients . <p> Privatisation did n't stop here . In 1993 , the pharmaceutical services under the health ministry were privatised . Renong back then was awarded an exclusive long-term contract for supplying medicines and supplies , subsequently doubling government spending for that provision the following year . <p> Instead of stopping privatisation , other support services such as laundry and linen , clinical waste management , cleaning , facility engineering and maintenance were then privatised three years later in 1996 . Within a year , the cost of these services jumped to RM450m from RM140m . <p> As a result of privatisation , highly qualified and experienced doctors flocked to the private sector . Within 20 years the private sector held two thirds of the total number of medical , surgical consultants , and specialists . <p> Brain drain <p> Eventually the waiting time and quality of service in government hospitals deteriorated significantly . Some have experienced tragedies where relatives have met their death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected earlier , the cost for healthcare in private hospitals is very high . As an example , the maternity charges in Class 1 of a public hospital is RM800 which is a fraction of the cost in the private sector ; which averages between RM3,500-RM6,000 . <p> Recently , the cost of medicine has also risen sharply due to the implementation of GST . In the private sector , the GST cost is transferred to the patients as it is not absorbed by private healthcare institutions . <p> We need to find the real cost of healthcare . Why are there approved permits for medicines ? Profiteering must not be allowed especially by large health conglomerates Government-linked companies like Sime Darby , Pantai , Khazanah , KPJ and others account for more than 40 per cent of private hospital beds . <p> The consequences of privatisation in the healthcare sector also call for an urgent review of the privatisation policy . The government is wearing three hats : as the public healthcare provider , regulator and investor in profiteering from healthcare -- which comes with clear conflict of interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' expenses <p> The mandate in privatising healthcare is to distribute the burden of healthcare to the private sector . At the same time a financial model needs to be established to bear the cost , and the insurance industry has done well to do so . It is estimated that the cost to insure every Malaysian at a minimum premium to cover hospitalisation costs would be at RM30bn per year . <p> Over the years , the number of insurance policy holders has increased and more private hospitals have been built . With the creation of such supply versus demand , the cost of healthcare should logically be reduced . <p> However , this has not been the case . In recent years , a sharp spike in the cost of healthcare services and the price of medicine can be observed clearly . New artificial demands have been created . Over-investigation , over-treatment and , in some cases , unnecessary clinical investigations are being performed at private hospitals . This practice has resulted in an offset of the supply . <p> There is also a need to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a standard hospitalisation bill , the ratio between the fees by the hospital ( which includes medical , equipment cost , disposables and nursing ) is 60 per cent while the remaining fees would be from the specialist . Their fees are governed by the 13th Fee Schedule , which is urgently in need of a review . <p> Like any other industry , the cost of healthcare is also increasing unnecessarily due to the existence of the industry 's middle-men , termed as third party administrators ( TPAs ) or sometimes called the Managed Care Organisations ( MCOs ) . <p> What they do is that they provide interface administration between medical providers , corporations , and the insurance companies . They assist in processing claims , corporate and retail policies and financial facilities . Their major revenue is in the form of fees or commissions on premiums , which are standardised by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority ( IRDA ) . <p> Most Malaysians are unaware of the extra premium charged by insurance companies for TPA services . <p> Regulations can be enforced by amending and including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facilities and Services Act 1998 ( PHFSA ) . There are at least 30 TPAs/MCOs currently active in the country . <p> Malaysia 's healthcare human resources and facilities <p> According to the Ministry of Health ( 2016 ) , we have a total of 46,491 doctors in public and private hospitals ; which gives us a ratio to population of 1:656 , dentists at 1:4,775 , pharmacists at 1:2,900 , opticians at 1:9,578 and optometrists at 1:19,053 . <p> The Eleventh Malaysia Plan ( 2016-2020 ) calls for a ratio of 1:400 which means a target of 75,000 doctors by 2020 . Do we have enough training hospitals and future undergraduate doctors to achieve that ? This means 28,509 new qualified doctors within the next four years . <p> The health ministry however is saying that there is an inadequacy of infrastructure to absorb graduating trainees for internships and housemanships . As such , new medical course freezes will be extended . This is indirectly saying that we do not have enough hospitals . <p> At the moment , there are 143 public hospitals with 41,389 beds and 183 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our population choose to go to public hospitals , this means one public hospital would need to serve 157,342 Malaysians while one private hospital would need to serve 40,983 Malaysians . <p> There are now only 44 training hospitals . The lack of training hospitals is translated as an additional year that new doctors would have to spend before they can obtain a placement . The existing doctors who are stretched thin with the heavy workload would also not be able to provide the best of training for the apprentice doctors . <p> There is a way out . While building more training hospitals , we can revisit the regulation and allow trainees to do training overseas provided by universities which must be certified to conduct the training by the Ministry of Education . Rural clinics can also be upgraded into mini-hospitals with qualified doctors . This will increase placement position for trainees and doctors . <p> I have always advocated a minimum wage and a bigger pie for the working force . Despite the size of the profit in healthcare , the money that goes to the salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia 's private sector healthcare 's EBITDA/Revenue percentage is approximately at 35 per cent while Wages/Revenue is at 20% . If we take a look at a developed nation as a benchmark , we can see that in Australia it is at approximately 12% EBITDA/Revenue and 45% Wages/Revenue . <p> Affordable Care Act and non-profit hospitals <p> The South Korean government did very well when they opted to promote that prevention is better than cure . In the long run , it has been proven to be a cost-effective solution . The South Korean government will absorb full medical costs for its citizens provided that they do annual medical check-ups without fail . <p> There are also other options that can be explored such as social hospitals , where non-profit organisations run hospitals in government-provided buildings . A new Act can also be drafted which can be literally labelled as the " Affordable Care Act " that obligates the government to provide affordable healthcare . A measure of correlating insurance premium costs to income can also be introduced to ensure that every Malaysian citizen can afford it . <p> Muhammadiyah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion and education . Some of its schools are also open to non-Muslims . At the moment there are 5,754 schools under Muhammadiyah . Their latest venture is in running non-profit medical clinics and hospitals . Today , they own several hundred medical clinics and hospitals in Indonesia . <p> Considering that 19.9 per cent of all hospitalisations is related to pregnancy , we can start off with the establishment of a chain of maternity and paediatric hospitals priced at the midpoint . These hospitals will provide no-frills services with wide accessibility . We can envisage a chain of hospitals in normal shoplots . The hospitals must be operated by non-profit organisations or cooperatives . <p> Karnataka , a state in the south western region of India , is leading the way for affordable healthcare : it introduced the Yeshasvini Health Scheme , a scheme for the rural masses to access quality healthcare at only RM0.30 ( 5 rupees ) per month . <p> The scheme provides free outpatient consultations and 1,700 different types of operations entirely free of cost ! Within seven months of the scheme launch , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers had outpatient medical consultations . <p> Healthcare is a collective obligation <p> According to the State of Households II Report released in August 2016 by Khazanah Research Institute , a nutritionally adequate diet is beyond the reach of many Malaysians , particularly in urban areas and after taking other living expenses into account . This is bound to have a causal effect on the state of healthcare . <p> The above reflects that there are other non-direct entities that affect healthcare . Healthcare must not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry , but a collective responsibility of every Malaysian . <p> The collective payment of income taxes , real property gain taxes , goods and services taxes , road taxes and other funds collected from society must be beneficial for the people . The money collected by the government must be transferred back to the government 's two primary obligations -- healthcare and education . The budget must be allocated to fund medical activities and programmes . <p> This will eventually bring about many benefits for the government , ensure continuously healthy and productive labour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Moving forward , payments for doctors should not be on a fee-for-service basis -- which will avoid over investigation and over treatment .

I heard you were very smart . <p> Ng Ka Long : I studied at school from 8am to 3pm , and then I immediately went to train , and then I went back to home and did my homework . Every day was almost the same . I did n't have time to hang out with my classmates and had no time for other interests . Every day I had to balance the two sides . I think the time management is very important for junior players like me because the training was already using most of my time . I had to manage my time very well in order to keep the two sides in balance . <p> Badzine : What was the motivation that helped you believe in yourself ? <p> Ng Ka Long : If I had n't been able to keep up with my studies , my parents would n't have allowed me to keep playing badminton . I had to have good results in school in order to let them know I could manage both studying and badminton training with good balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study hard . <p> I also have high expectations of myself . I do n't want to do well only in one area . I also forced myself to study hard . I needed to stay serious about my grades . At least in the past . <p> Badzine : How did you keep believing in yourself when you were a junior ? <p> Ng Ka Long : Actually , I did n't have so much belief in myself when I was a junior . I just gained confidence with the tournaments I played in . When I beat strong players , my confidence slowly became higher and higher . I had to tell myself that I could n't give up on myself , because I was still young and I kept thinking , " Maybe I can become one of the top players in the world . " I just kept telling myself to believe . Of course , I had to face some ups and downs . All the while I just told myself to never give up . <p> Badzine : When you feel down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long : My coach , family , and friends give me advice . Not only for badminton . After hearing the advice , I became happier and have energy and motivation . <p> Badzine : What were the hardest days in your badminton career ? <p> Ng Ka Long : When I decided to focus to singles , those were the hardest days , especially at the beginning . In my junior time , I did well in both singles and doubles and it was in doubles that I was able to get the World Junior Championship title . Many people wanted me to play doubles with my partner because we had a good chance to get into the top 10 in the world . <p> I knew that it would be better for me to play singles but when I lost a singles match , many people would say " Why do n't you play in doubles ? If you played doubles , your ranking would be so much higher than it is now in singles . Why do n't you just focus on doubles ? " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , maybe for 4 or 5 years . So they wanted me to play in doubles in order to become a top player in a very , very short time . So I felt a lot of pressure at that time . Every time I went to a tournament , I told myself I must n't lose in singles . I did n't want to hear that voice . <p> But my coach , family , and friends advised me a lot , telling me things like , " Many top players are 23 or 24 years old . You have a lot of time until you 're that age . You have the chance to be a top player . " So I trusted their kind advice and trained as hard as I could every day . Finally , I managed to get good results . <p> Badzine : Last year , you scored a win against Lin Dan of China at the Hong Kong Open . How was your feeling before that match ? <p> Ng Ka Long : I did n't have any pressure for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me so I just wanted to give my best performance for the Hong Kong spectators . I did n't think of winning or losing . <p> Badzine : Did anything around you change after you beat Lin Dan ? <p> Ng Ka Long : Especially , the media in Hong Kong . After the match , many journalists focussed on my match and came to me after every match to interview me . They were talking on their sports news about all of my matches , whether I won or lost . On the plus side , many people came to know who I was and I become more famous . But on the other hand , there was more and more pressure on me . <p> Badzine : What are the important things to be strong player ? <p> Ng Ka Long : Of cause , the training is the most important . If players do n't train enough , they ca n't stay at their level and they fall very quickly . And another important thing is the attitude toward pressure . If you ca n't face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also fall very quickly . So training and attitude are the most important for top players . <p> Badzine : How was your Olympic experience ? <p> Ng Ka Long : The Olympics had a different mood and atmosphere from other big tournaments like the Superseries . If I want to handle the pressure that is on me , I must play well in a relaxed mood like I do in other tournaments . This experience was very useful for me for the future . <p> Badzine : What do you want for the future ? <p> Ng Ka Long : I train with both older and younger players . Sometimes I give some advice to younger players . I hope their level will continue to rise so that we can all join in Superseries tournaments together like Japan 's women 's singles players do .

@@15154231 <h> Cambodia 's Illegal ... Crisis <p> Tree cover loss in Cambodia has accelerated faster than in any other country in the world since 2001 , so fast that Prey Lang , one of Southeast Asia 's last great forests , is disappearing . <p> Supposedly that has alarmed Cambodia 's Prime Minister Hun Sen , who in February threatened to fire rockets at illegal loggers . Environment Minister Say Samal doubled down four months later , claiming that the " large-scale timber logging " the country used to see had " entirely ended . " <p> But the felled trees scattered around Prey Lang , Cambodia 's largest lowland evergreen forest , tell a different story , one where no rockets are fired and deforestation marches on . Although the area is one of the world 's top biodiversity hotspots , environmental activists warn that both Prey Lang and the Cambodian jungle in general are reaching a point of no return . <p> " In the 1990s , Cambodia was still very special , because it was 30 years behind its neighbors in terms of so-called development . It was not like other countries that had already been destroyed , " said Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests . " Over the past 10 years , they have established one of the fastest deforestation rates in the world . " <p> Much of the damage is linked to Economic Land Concessions ( ELCs ) , patches of land allotted to investors -- both Khmer and foreign -- to help develop rural areas . Since the early 2000s , ELCs have proved popular with companies , quadrupling in size between 2004 and 2013 , according to the environmental NGO Forest Trends . <p> However , observers claim they have fostered little development and much illegal logging , as vast swathes of land have been cleared with the excuse of agro-industrial projects -- Siamese Rosewood , a hardwood endemic to parts of Southeast Asia , has been a chief casualty . Protected under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) and coveted by Chinese buyers for its beauty and durability , rosewood is now so rare that loggers are trespassing into Thailand to steal it . <p> And it is not just China 's voracious appetite for hongmu -- Chinese for rosewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . Vietnamese , American and European markets all drive the demand for timber , said Ouch Leng , an activist and winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2016 . <p> " Companies need to protect the forests and preserve the original natural system , but this is just in theory . Once they have a license , they chase people away and cut the trees , " Leng said , adding that illegal logging can take place only because the authorities look the other way or are actively involved . <p> Prey Lang is no exception . Besieged by concessions on both its western and eastern sides , the forest is quickly shrinking to make way for endless lines of rubber , mango and pepper trees . <p> Only about 40 percent of the original jungle remains , Leng said , and although its surviving core was declared a protected area this year , loggers have hardly put down their chainsaws . On the contrary , with valuable timber becoming scarcer and rosewood all but gone in nearby ELCs , they are pushing ever deeper into the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key role in sustaining local communities thanks to the valuable resin they produce . <p> As of August , the mud tracks crisscrossing the remaining jungle were dotted with felled trunks , stored in the open for the dry season , when trucks will be able to negotiate their way and pick them up . Worryingly , the number of resin trees chopped greatly surpassed that of those still standing . <p> It is hard to establish where exactly the timber is sent to , but villagers alleged the trees are bought by a spawning sawmill located in an ELC on the edge of the forest . The heavily guarded , walled compound contained hundreds of stockpiled trunks . Discarded logs were abandoned only a few hundred meters away . <p> According to Hardke , the sawmill is owned by Seng Keang -- colloquially known as SK or Mr. 95 -- an organization described in a 2007 study by anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness as " the most powerful logging syndicate in Cambodia . " <p> The same document linked SK directly to the central government , reporting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hun Sen , his ex-wife Seng Keang -- a friend of Bun Rany , the Prime Minister 's wife -- and Khun Thong , brother-in-law of then Minister for Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries Chan Sarun and father-in-law of then Director General of the Forest Administration Ty Sokhun . <p> Logging on the scale seen in Prey Lang hardly benefits local communities , which claim they gain more from farming and harvesting the jungle 's resources than by working in plantations , where they can be paid as little as US$2.50 a day . <p> " The companies say they will give people jobs . But in reality they treat them like enemies , " said Leng . " That this is a development is just propaganda to the world . " <p> While protests have taken place multiple times in the past , villagers are increasingly becoming loggers themselves , partly because they see little alternative . <p> " At first , they did not cut the trees .

" All local residents think that when the companies come , they will chop the trees anyway . " The refrain is nearly ubiquitous in Prey Lang . As locals see the trees being felled , they have a choice : they can allow others to do the job or join in and grab the crumbles of a multi-million dollar business . <p> " They have already done big damage , " said Hardtke . " Even where you still have forest , it is like the death of one thousand cuts . "

@@15207236 <h> Making money after ... <p> 4 November 2016 @ 11:00 AM <p> MALAYSIA 'S relatively small workforce had to be mobilised optimally in order to reduce the country 's dependence on foreigners , be they professionals or labourers . Towards this end , the retirement age was raised to 60 from the previous 55 a few years back . Thanks to better healthcare , Malaysians are now living and working longer . For those who feel able to go on past 55 , a conundrum surfaced : what about the individual 's Employees Provident Fund 's ( EPF ) withdrawal and continued contributions ? The problem is now resolved . The EPF yesterday announced its Akaun Emas to facilitate those who want to continue working until 60 . This makes possible a complete withdrawal at 55 for those opting to continue working . Meanwhile , EPF contribution for post-55 employment will be paid into Akaun Emas , and any remaining funds in the individual 's accounts 1 and 2 will be moved appropriately . Akaun Emas is part of the EPF scheme 's enhancement initiatives , tabled in Parliament last year and gazetted on Feb 18 . <p> EPF is a mandatory savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-retirement cushion , which when properly invested , should provide the retiree with regular income . There is also a provision for ongoing contribution from employees past age 60 , the limit for which is now upped from 75 to 100 years . As a savings account , it pays handsome dividends . For last year , the dividend rate was 6.4 per cent despite the challenging economy . Banks can not compete , not even with their fixed deposit rates . It is , therefore , a prudent investment . However , the EPF savings for many are looked forward to as a lump sum payment that can help members realise a retirement dream , like enlarging the house to welcome the next generation . <p> This announcement , therefore , is a relief to those working through to age 60 without losing access to their savings at 55 to fulfil whatever dreams they may have for their hard-earned nest egg . And , for them until the age of 60 , a monthly income is assured , including more savings . By the first withdrawal at age 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced savings , and come round to the paternalism that informed the practice in the first place . After all , EPF savings is inclusive of a substantial employer 's monthly contribution , and the annual interest payment , to a rapidly increasing total savings . Of absolute importance is the very nature of EPF , which yields high interest without speculative risks , unlike commercial funds . Those managing the fund have always cautioned low-income savers to be very prudent with their savings , and much advice is dispensed by EPF to help savers get the most out of their money . With Akaun Emas , members of this category are now able to exploit an opportunity at 55 to wisely invest for the future , even while they go on working and saving until 60 . Whether this outcome is intended or otherwise , the EPF , having evolved accordingly , now has additional features to help construct a decent retirement for all its members . <p> 28 reads <h> Sports <p> SYDNEY : The death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was a " tragic accident " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment , the New South Wales ( NSW ) Coroner 's Court ruled on Friday . <h> Lifestyle <p> LONDON : Scientists have discovered genetic markers in malaria parasites linked to resistance to the key anti-malarial medicine piperaquine , and say their work could help doctors and health officials monitor and limit the spread of such resistance . <h> World <p> LONDON : In a major setback to British Prime Minister Theresa May , the High Court on Thursday ruled that the UK government must seek parliament 's approval before officially starting process to exit from the 28-member European Union .

@@15241239 @ @ @ PLM -- and the march to ' The Factory of the Future ' <p> The Factory of the Future beckons and the road leading to it is a five-lane superhighway of technology , product innovation , customization and advanced performance capabilities . Passing the tollgates , however , requires a creative mind-set for problem-solving , late-stage assembly , configuration tools , accelerated prototyping , and sensor tracking Stubborn adherence to traditional processes -- whether it 's holding on to a legacy ERP or insisting that IT modifications are enough -- will cause serious roadblocks for the slow adopters . <p> However , some manufacturers Asia Pacific are already leading the way to modern manufacturing , setting new production standards for product lifecycle management ( PLM ) . They are making bold advances and reaping greater rewards . Here are some tips other manufacturers in the region can learn from these early pace setters . <p> Learn about the latest PLM strategies <p> While some manufacturers are already reaping the benefits of the latest generation technologies , such as cloud , virtualization and mobility , there are those who have yet to muster the courage to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , or more best practices to emerge . Given some disruptive technologies , like the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , are still in their infancy , manufacturers who are too slow to take advantage of disruptive technologies risk becoming irrelevant . PLM is changing dramatically , from engineering design through prototyping and product launch to customer feedback , warranty claims , and after-market service . It 's crucial for Asia Pacific manufacturers to keep updated on the latest PLM strategies . Only then can they start to look into accelerating their PLM transformation . <p> A holistic approach to PLM propels the Factory of the Future <p> To help steer the region 's manufacturers into modernizing their PLM practices , it is crucial to have a comprehensive approach , which includes harnessing multiple IT capabilities across different functions , such as product design collaboration , sales configuration tools , assemble-to-order capabilities , quality control , regulation compliance , and 3D printing for rapid prototyping , amongst others . <p> Transparent supply chain <p> Accelerated product innovation -- especially in high tech industries -- requires a reliable supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fast changing market demand . For instance , suppliers should be flexible enough to contract or expand as required . . This is only possible when there 's a clear visibility across the supply chain , making it easy to monitor the details of components , parts and raw materials , for instance . Interoperability and collaboration with partners is also important , and this includes sharing and using relevant data to ensure an effective and well- managed value chain . <p> Product innovation and configuration tools <p> To satisfy consumer demand for highly personalized/customized products , manufacturers in Asia Pacific may want to look into implementing product configuration tools that enable them to manage complex designs , product quotes and production specifications . Also , integration with online portal and CAD solutions allow customers to visualize designs , adding to a more positive customer experience . <p> Another tool that is helping drive the speed of innovation is 3D printing , allowing manufacturers to create prototypes easily . Many manufacturers are already implementing 3D printing for prototyping , testing and obtaining customer feedback . Its use will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more versatile and the cost of equipment gets more affordable . <p> Late-stage assembly <p> As customers increasingly demand Engineer-to-order ( ETO ) and Made-to-Order ( MTO ) products , manufacturers are turning to delayed or late-stage assembly to help them manage this mass consumerization trend . By designing products in various modules , components can be manufactured and inventoried first , waiting for the order . The product is only assembled when the order is received . <p> A similar concept is distributed manufacturing , where the raw materials and methods of fabrication are decentralized , and the final product is manufactured at a location closest to the location of the customer . Like reshoring , regionalization is a growing trend , where manufacturers , their suppliers , and subcontractors work to form the right combination of proximity to customer and a productive location . <p> Internet of Things ( IoT ) and performance insights <p> The Internet of Things ( IoT ) is expected to impact many aspects of manufacturing , including PLM , with product design and supply chain management likely to be the biggest beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking are being used to monitor the movement of goods -- from the warehouse , on trucks , on ships and cargo planes , on the road , and to customers .

Today , connected cars are already collecting data on user behavior , service and performance . <p> Data is gold <p> Data is the force that is making modern manufacturing cost-effective . Insights derived from business intelligence and data analysis help manufacturers focus on markets , buying trends , customer attributes , cost of raw materials , time , labor , operational costs , details about the product in use in the market , as well as consumer opinions . Insightful data enables manufacturers and their respective supply chains to make the right decisions quickly and more efficiently . <p> Social and mobile <p> Manufacturing leaders are extremely mobile . They are expected to make decisions on site , in the heart of their operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from remote locations . This can range from a maintenance technician checking inventory of spare parts to a warehouse manager using a smart tablet to confirm locations of forklifts and personnel . <p> Social and collaboration tools also provide critical support to employees empowered by smart phones , tablets , laptops and other mobile devices to access data . To continue to be relevant , it is crucial for manufacturers to embrace mobility and collaboration tools . <p> Cloud -- and the need to be nimble <p> Manufacturers need to keep pace with fast-changing global trends , which includes dealing with new markets , new customer demands , challenges of Omni-channel shopping , and growing competition from start-ups . All these require manufacturers to agile and flexible Cloud solutions , because they offer faster deployment and implementation , support manufacturers in their efforts to continually offer new and improved products to quickly and cost-effectively . <p> Cloud solutions allow manufacturers to add branches , bring on new fabricating facilities , and set up new distribution hubs easily and quickly . <p> Closed loop quality control <p> Automated quality control methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand value .

They are angry and they do not want Trump to lead them . <p> The elections were rigged they say , Hillary won the popular vote they claim ( which she did ) , the whole process was a joke they roar . <p> Another d ? j ? vu for those of us in Malaysia . <p> Will all this protests bring about a different outcome than it did in Malaysia ? I sincerely do n't think so . <p> This is mainly because , when we protest , we do n't really have an end goal .

Absolutely not ! <p> Will it " bigly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably it wo n't either . <p> Because racial sentiments , divide and rule policies , religion and gender supremacy still binds the mentality of the voters , the outcome will be the same , be it in America or in Malaysia . <p> Looking at America today feels exactly like looking at Malaysia during the last few general elections . Something that no one would have expected to happen did because the fundamentals have now become equal . <p> Democracy , in essence , is a system where the supreme power is vested on the people . A system that enables a people 's government by the people . <p> Thus , it is powered by the exact same energy that powers the people into voting . If race , religion , gender and creed supremacy is what drives one to pick one 's government , then that is exactly the kind of government one will end up with . <p> Malaysians can learn quite a bit from the American elections this time , or rather refresher lessons . <p> The next time you walk your way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lives with policies beyond the shackles of religion , race , gender etc . <p> Look for policies that can propel the nation and all its people to greater heights . <p> Ca n't find any ? Then opt for a lesser , maybe even unknown evil . A lesser , unknown evil , in my opinion , is far better than a known evil , as I would have known the degree of " evil " that I 'm dealing with and how much I can tolerate . <p> For the past 13 elections , we have elected a single party to run our country . We have always been led to believe that this is the party that works in the best interest of this country and its people . <p> Fifty-nine years have passed , why dispute that notion now ? <p> Well , the answer is that a generation of voters have changed since but the ideology still clings on to each and every one of us . <p> So , only when we free ourselves from these " restrictions " , can we truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A Necessary Foreword <p> The sending of the letter to His Holiness Pope Francis by four cardinals derives from a deep pastoral concern . <p> We have noted a grave disorientation and great confusion of many faithful regarding extremely important matters for the life of the Church .

We have interpreted his sovereign decision as an invitation to continue the reflection , and the discussion , calmly and with respect . <p> And so we are informing the entire people of God about our initiative , offering all of the documentation . <p> We hope that no one will choose to interpret the matter according to a " progressive/conservative " paradigm .

Explanatory Note of the Four Cardinals <p> CONTEXT <p> Dubia ( from the Latin : " doubts " ) are formal questions brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Faith asking for clarifications on particular issues concerning doctrine or practice . <p> What is peculiar about these inquiries is that they are worded in a way that requires a " yes " or " no " answer , without theological argumentation . This way of addressing the Apostolic See is not an invention of our own ; it is an age-old practice . <p> Let 's get to what is concretely at stake . <p> Upon the publication of the post-synodal Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia on love in the family , a debate has arisen particularly around its eighth chapter . Here specifically paragraphs 300-305 have been the object of divergent interpretations . <p> For many -- bishops , priests , faithful -- these paragraphs allude to or even explicitly teach a change in the discipline of the Church with respect to the divorced who are living in a new union , while others , admitting the lack of clarity or even the ambiguity of the passages in question , nonetheless argue that these same pages can be read in continuity with the previous magisterium and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching . <p> Motivated by a pastoral concern for the faithful , four cardinals have sent a letter to the Holy Father under the form of dubia , hoping to receive clarity , given that doubt and uncertainty are always highly detrimental to pastoral care . <p> The fact that interpreters come to different conclusions is also due to divergent ways of understanding the Christian moral life . In this sense , what is at stake in Amoris Laetitia is not only the question of whether or not the divorced who have entered into a new union can -- under certain circumstances -- be readmitted to the sacraments . <p> Rather , the interpretation of the document also implies different , contrasting approaches to the Christian way of life . <p> Thus , while the first question of the dubia concerns a practical question regarding the divorced and civilly remarried , the other four questions touch on fundamental issues of the Christian life . <p> THE QUESTIONS <p> Doubt number 1 : <p> It is asked whether , following the affirmations of Amoris Laetitia ( nn. 300-305 ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penance and thus to admit to Holy Communion a person who , while bound by a valid marital bond , lives together with a different person more uxorio without fulfilling the conditions provided for by Familiaris Consortio n. 84 and subsequently reaffirmed by Reconciliatio et Paenitentia n. 34 and Sacramentum Caritatis n. 29 . Can the expression " in certain cases " found in note 351 ( n. 305 ) of the exhortation Amoris Laetitia be applied to divorced persons who are in a new union and who continue to live more uxorio ? <p> Question 1 makes particular reference to Amoris Laetitia n. 305 and to footnote 351 . While note 351 specifically speaks of the sacraments of penance and communion , it does not mention the divorced and civilly remarried in this context , nor does the main text . <p> Pope John Paul II 's Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio , n. 84 already contemplated the possibility of admitting the divorced and civilly remarried to the sacraments . It mentions three conditions : <p> The persons concerned can not separate without committing new injustices ( for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ) ; <p> They take upon themselves the commitment to live according to the truth of their situation , that is , to cease living together as if they were husband and wife ( more uxorio ) , abstaining from those acts that are proper to spouses ; <p> They avoid giving scandal ( that is , they avoid giving the appearance of sin so as to avoid the danger of leading others into sin ) . <p> The conditions mentioned by Familiaris Consortio n. 84 and by the subsequent documents recalled will immediately appear reasonable once we remember that the marital union is not just based on mutual affection and that sexual acts are not just one activity among others that couples engage in . <p> Sexual relations are for marital love . They are something so important , so good and so precious , that they require a particular context , the context of marital love . Hence , not only the divorced living in a new union need to abstain , but also everyone who is not married . For the Church , the sixth commandment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of human sexuality that is not marital , i.e. , any kind of sexual relations other than those engaged in with one 's rightful spouse . <p> It would seem that admitting to communion those of the faithful who are separated or divorced from their rightful spouse and who have entered a new union in which they live with someone else as if they were husband and wife would mean for the Church to teach by her practice one of the following affirmations about marriage , human sexuality , and the nature of the sacraments : <p> A divorce does not dissolve the marriage bond , and the partners to the new union are not married . However , people who are not married can under certain circumstances legitimately engage in acts of sexual intimacy . <p> A divorce dissolves the marriage bond . People who are not married can not legitimately engage in sexual acts . The divorced and remarried are legitimate spouses and their sexual acts are lawful marital acts . <p> A divorce does not dissolve the marriage bond , and the partners to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not legitimately engage in sexual acts , so that the divorced and civilly remarried live in a situation of habitual , public , objective and grave sin . However , admitting persons to the Eucharist does not mean for the Church to approve their public state of life ; the faithful can approach the Eucharistic table even with consciousness of grave sin , and receiving absolution in the sacrament of penance does not always require the purpose of amending one 's life . The sacraments , therefore , are detached from life : Christian rites and worship are on a completely different sphere than the Christian moral life . <p> Doubt number 2 : <p> After the publication of the post-synodal exhortation Amoris Laetitia ( cf. n. 304 ) , does one still need to regard as valid the teaching of St. John Paul II 's encyclical Veritatis Splendor n. 79 , based on Sacred Scripture and on the Tradition of the Church , on the existence of absolute moral norms that prohibit intrinsically evil acts and that are binding without exceptions ? <p> The second question regards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's encyclical Veritatis Splendor 79 claims that one can " qualify as morally evil according to its species ... the deliberate choice of certain kinds of behavior or specific acts , apart from a consideration of the intention for which the choice is made or the totality of the foreseeable consequences of that act for all persons concerned . " <p> Thus , the encyclical teaches that there are acts that are always evil , which are forbidden by moral norms that bind without exception ( " moral absolutes " ) . These moral absolutes are always negative , that is , they tell us what we should not do . " Do not kill . " " Do not commit adultery . " Only negative norms can bind without exception . <p> According to Veritatis Splendor , with intrinsically evil acts no discernment of circumstances or intentions is necessary . Uniting oneself to a woman who is married to another is and remains an act of adultery that as such is never to be done , even if by doing so an agent could possibly extract precious secrets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( what sounds like an example from a James Bond movie has already been contemplated by St. Thomas Aquinas , De Malo , q. 15 , a. 1 ) . John Paul II argues that the intention ( say , " saving the kingdom " ) does not change the species of the act ( here : " committing adultery " ) , and that it is enough to know the species of the act ( " adultery " ) to know that one must not do it . <p> Doubt number 3 : <p> After Amoris Laetitia ( n. 301 ) is it still possible to affirm that a person who habitually lives in contradiction to a commandment of God 's law , as for instance the one that prohibits adultery ( cf. Mt 19:3-9 ) , finds him or herself in an objective situation of grave habitual sin ( cf. Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts , Declaration , June 24 , 2000 ) ? <p> In paragraph 301 Amoris Laetitia recalls that : " The Church possesses a solid body of reflection concerning mitigating factors and situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer simply be said that all those in any ' irregular ' situation are living in a state of mortal sin and are deprived of sanctifying grace . " <p> In its Declaration of June 24 , 2000 , the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts seeks to clarify Canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law , which states that those who " obstinately persist in manifest grave sin , are not to be admitted to Holy Communion . " The Pontifical Council 's Declaration argues that this canon is applicable also to faithful who are divorced and civilly remarried . It spells out that " grave sin " has to be understood objectively , given that the minister of the Eucharist has no means of judging another person 's subjective imputability . <p> Thus , for the Declaration , the question of the admission to the sacraments is about judging a person 's objective life situation and not about judging that this person is in a state of mortal sin . Indeed subjectively he or she may not be fully imputable or not be imputable at all . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eucharistia , n. 37 , Saint John Paul II recalls that " the judgment of one 's state of grace obviously belongs only to the person involved , since it is a question of examining one 's conscience . " Hence , the distinction referred to by Amoris Laetitia between the subjective situation of mortal sin and the objective situation of grave sin is indeed well established in the Church 's teaching . <p> John Paul II however continues by insisting that " in cases of outward conduct which is seriously , clearly and steadfastly contrary to the moral norm , the Church , in her pastoral concern for the good order of the community and out of respect for the sacrament , can not fail to feel directly involved . " He then reiterates the teaching of Canon 915 mentioned above . <p> Question 3 of the Dubia hence would like to clarify whether , even after Amoris Laetitia , it is still possible to say that persons who habitually live in contradiction to a commandment of God 's law , such as the commandment against adultery , theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grave habitual sin , even if , for whatever reasons , it is not certain that they are subjectively imputable for their habitual transgressions . <p> Doubt number 4 : <p> After the affirmations of Amoris Laetitia ( n. 302 ) on " circumstances which mitigate moral responsibility , " does one still need to regard as valid the teaching of St. John Paul II 's encyclical Veritatis Splendor n. 81 , based on Sacred Scripture and on the Tradition of the Church , according to which " circumstances or intentions can never transform an act intrinsically evil by virtue of its object into an act ' subjectively ' good or defensible as a choice " ? <p> In paragraph 302 , Amoris Laetitia stresses that on account of mitigating circumstances " a negative judgment about an objective situation does not imply a judgment about the imputability or culpability of the person involved . " The Dubia point to the Church 's teaching as expressed in John Paul II 's Veritatis Splendor according to which circumstances or good intentions can never turn an intrinsically evil act into one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Amoris Laetitia , too , is agreed that any act that transgresses against God 's commandments , such as adultery , murder , theft , or perjury , can never , on account of circumstances that mitigate personal responsibility , become excusable or even good . <p> Do these acts , which the Church 's Tradition has called bad in themselves and grave sins , continue to be destructive and harmful for anyone committing them in whatever subjective state of moral responsibility he may be ? <p> Or could these acts , depending on a person 's subjective state and depending on the circumstances and intentions , cease to be injurious and become commendable or at least excusable ? <p> Doubt number 5 : <p> After Amoris Laetitia ( n. 303 ) does one still need to regard as valid the teaching of St. John Paul II 's encyclical Veritatis Splendor n. 56 , based on Sacred Scripture and on the Tradition of the Church , that excludes a creative interpretation of the role of conscience and that emphasizes that conscience can never be authorized to legitimate exceptions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their object ? <p> Amoris Laetitia n. 303 states that " conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel . It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God . " The Dubia ask for a clarification of these affirmations , given that they are susceptible to divergent interpretations . <p> For those proposing the creative idea of conscience , the precepts of God 's law and the norm of the individual conscience can be in tension or even in opposition , while the final word should always go to conscience that ultimately decides about good and evil . According to Veritatis Splendor n. 56 , " on this basis , an attempt is made to legitimize so-called ' pastoral ' solutions contrary to the teaching of the Magisterium , and to justify a ' creative ' hermeneutic according to which the moral conscience is in no way obliged , in every case , by a particular negative precept . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience to know " this is adultery , " or " this is murder , " in order to know that this is something one can not and must not do . <p> Rather , one would also need to look at the circumstances or the intentions to know if this act could not , after all be excusable or even obligatory ( cf. question 4 of the Dubia ) . For these theories , conscience could indeed rightfully decide that in a given case , God 's will for me consists in an act by which I transgress one of his commandments . " Do not commit adultery " is seen as just a general norm . In the here and now , and given my good intentions , committing adultery is what God really requires of me . Under these terms , cases of virtuous adultery , lawful murder and obligatory perjury are at least conceivable . <p> This would mean to conceive of conscience as a faculty for autonomously deciding about good and evil and of God 's law as a burden that is arbitrarily imposed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , conscience does not decide about good and evil . The whole idea of a " decision of conscience " is misleading . The proper act of conscience is to judge and not to decide . It says , " This is good , " " This is bad . " This goodness or badness does not depend on it . It acknowledges and recognizes the goodness or badness of an action , and for doing so , that is , for judging , conscience needs criteria ; it is inherently dependent on truth . <p> God 's commandments are a most welcome help for conscience to get to know the truth and hence to judge verily . God 's commandments are the expression of the truth about our good , about our very being , disclosing something crucial about how to live life well . Pope Francis , too , expresses himself in these terms when in Amoris Laetitia 295 : " The law is itself a gift of God which points out the way , a gift for everyone without exception .

In 55 percent of the world 's countries , there have been no changes on state of religious freedom in comparison with the 2014 Aid to the Church in Need report . <p> Religious freedom improved just in three countries : Egypt , Bhutan and Qatar . <p> The worst places in terms of religious freedom are Eritrea and North Korea . In China , religious minorities are considered threats to the stability of the country . This is why the Chinese government pushes for these groups to come under State control , with grave consequences for groups that do not toe the party line . <p> For instance , in the Chinese province of Zheijang , government authorities issued a series of new rules in 2015 that led to the demolition of crosses and the removal of symbols of faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taller than 78 feet .

" <p> The film is set in 1926 . Newt has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures . <p> Arriving in New York for a brief stopover , he could have come and gone without incident , were it not for a No-Maj ( American term for Muggle , or non-magic folks ) named Jacob ( Dan Fogler ) , a misplaced magical case , and the escape of some of Newt 's fantastic beasts , which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds . <p> VERSION OF THE CHARACTER <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters she has created , including their back stories . <p> " Whenever she came on set , we were super excited .

@@15499240 <h> Interview with Peter ... Peter is an industry veteran with more than 30 years ' experience in the automation industry . He has extensive involvement in the development and marketing of all levels of automation and related IT technologies . <p> More often than not , we see companies having CEO , COO and CFO but not CSO . Please explain your role as a chief strategy officer . <p> That 's a good question . I would say when I first got that title 10 years ago , I did n't see that many people , even in the US and Europe , having that title . But now more and more folks are having that title . Now , there are even conferences for chief strategy officers . So I think the idea is if you ask who in the company is going to think about and execute strategies , then the answer normally will be the CEO . Well , the CEO has also got a lot of other stuff to do especially in companies involve in a high level of technology in their direction and products . Then it may be useful to have a guy like me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the overall technology portfolio direction . <p> Also , unlike the CEO who additionally has to spend a fair amount of time on operations and other functional and support areas , I am in a way , relatively free to think about growth and new product strategy without being one of the guys who got beat on every quarter for how we are doing on the profit and loss . <p> Emerson is pretty strong in individual business units like Fisher , Rosemount , DeltaV and others . So without somebody looking across the whole business and to think about things we should be doing , we have a tendency to just limit ourselves to our own product areas and not taking advantage of synergy by tying everything together . That 's a big part of my role . One of the teams that I have is the corporate technology team that develops shared technology that we use across the different units . <p> Moving forward , what are your plans for the company 's strategic direction ? <p> When I took the role 10 years ago , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty strongly . Then we changed the focus and looked more into wireless and pervasive sensing . Now , I 'm very excited about the new PlantWeb , the digital ecosystem and I think we really expanded the vision of making all the different business units inside Emerson Automation Solutions to work better together . I think this is something that 's going to keep me busy for five years at least . <p> You obviously have your fingers on the pulse of all the countries that Emerson operates in . For Asia , what , in your opinion , are the challenges facing companies wanting to leverage on IIOT ? <p> First of all , I have to say that you have to look at Asia as China and the rest of Asia because when you look at IIOT in China , it is very clear that data ownership and data communications are highly regulated and the government wants Chinese companies to be at the forefront of IIOT . We have worked with and talked to Chinese companies like Huawei for instance who was very excited with IIOT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it and is very interested in being the leader in the development of IIOT . <p> Outside of China , if you look at Singapore , Thailand , Indonesia and the other manufacturing areas , I think they are similar to the west . Singapore has many of the same concerns or even more in terms of needing to prove operational performance . That 's why we have a good relationship with Singapore 's Economic Development Board to work on some of these areas . The countries that have low labour cost do n't need to worry so much about using IIOT to improve operational performance . So it really depends on a particular country on whether it has a low cost manufacturing base or a highly developed economy . <p> In your opinion , what are the factors affecting the implementation of IIOT . <p> That 's a great question . It starts with a commitment to find out what areas you want to improve , have clear goals and KPIs and specific problems that you want solve . One thing I absolutely do not agree with is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of it ; you go in collecting all the big data , run it through some tools and wonderful inferences come out . I 'm not at all a believer of that . Number two , you need to have a cross organizational collaboration . <p> This can not be something that just the IT department does because IT people do not have the operational knowledge . On the other hand , it can not be something that the operational team does . It must be cooperation between IT and operation teams for IIOT to be successful . The operation team , having knowledge about the whole manufacturing process , can ensure ROI and the IT team will be able to make sure that boxes are checked on all the technical aspects . <p> Also , in your opinion , who within the company is in the best position to drive this implementation ? <p> My opinion and this is really just an opinion and there may be different ones , is probably a combination of operational and engineering guys . The operation guys have the business goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KPIs . The engineering guys know what is technically possible . And then , they have to bring in the IT guys to support it . It 's really something that the operation guys want to do and see it as a key area as driving operational excellence . <p> Last question , coming back to your role as the chief strategy officer , what would you say are personal traits that make you suitable ? <p> Nobody has ever asked me that before ! Again , great question because I ask this myself all the time . You know , if you have asked me the question 20 years ago about what I like to do , I would have describe the job that I have right now . I 've always been interested in what we should be doing , what we should be offering to customers , what the technology and products should look like , what we should have in the portfolio . In other words what business and product strategy that we should have . <p> Personally I feel that if you are the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operational constraints too . Usually in other companies , the guy that gets to do that is the top guy who has to deliver the quarterly P&amp;L . So in this role , I 'm very happy because I get to spend my time on the stuff that I like to do and be very influential on that and work with the business leaders . But I do n't have to carry and worry about the P&amp;L . For me , what I like to do is what I am good at . <p> Driven by increasing industrialisation , huge and necessary investments in infrastructure , and an emerging middle class creating new demands for all manner of consumer goods , the centre of gravity of the automation industry is markedly shifting east -- with Asia increasingly becoming the leading market for the devices , systems , and services that are helping to boost industrial performance in the region .

State-sponsored religious education continued being strengthened with linkages to enable a promising advanced education and career options for students while more schools were built . <p> State-sponsored community colleges were also introduced throughout the state to equip less academically-inclined youngsters with employable skills that will improve their future potential . <p> A number of forest reserves and natural heritage sites were also identified and gazetted to ensure that the state 's dwindling natural forests are preserved and allowed to grow back up to the 30% mark set by the state planners while natural sciences research centres were encouraged to set up operation in the state 's national parks . <p> Despite the 1997/98 financial crisis which was highly detrimental to Johor institutions , and with a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steer not only these Johor institutions out of bad weather , but ensure they continue to grow stronger in the aftermath . <p> He was even more convinced that Johor 's holistic approach towards development , will be the key sustaining factor that will be its defence against a recurrence of similar crisis as evidence in his 1999 budget speech . <p> Economics , afterall , consists of peaks and trenches , and no doubt that dips will happen again . <p> Johor and its people must be made fundamentally strong to ensure that it will be able to weather such crises with minimal damage and with that came the requirement to re-position Johor as a top investment destination that will rival the best in the region . <p> Core to the plan will be making the most of Johor 's ideal location , existing logistics facilities , abundant resources and industrious locals to attract would be investors that will spur development of new industries , and ensure industrial resilience by re-structuring its economic growth drivers . <p> Firstly , Johor is blessed with a coastline that continues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has three international seaports and an international airport , many industrial parks , in addition to being located on one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .

A new seat of government similar to Putrajaya is required , away from the commercial hustle and bustle of the city , but within easy distance that will not be inconvenient to the public , which will also free high-value real estate for commercialisation and the transformation of Johor Bahru City Centre . <p> Thirdly , its proximity to Singapore should be capitalised to benefit Johor ; instead of simply being Singapore 's backyard or hinterland , Johor should aspire to build a city of equal stature socially , if not commercially , to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on the list of Federal infrastructure development funding as states such as Selangor , Kedah , Kelantan or Penang , but this time around the state required Federal assistance to make this a reality . <p> It had always been a middling state , not poor enough to require attention , but not near enough to the seat of power like Selangor to require Federal infrastructure focus , or as historically significant colonial outposts as Melaka or Penang to attract tourism projects . <p> The state itself did not have the financial means to make all this happen within a time-frame that would make it meaningful , nor would it likely be able to raise the funds itself considering the many development programmes continuously being put in place to raise the quality of living for the rakyat . <p> But Johor must position itself for the new millenium , therefore Federal assistance was required to make the transformation in a timely manner and a proposal was worked out by the planners at Bukit Timbalan . <p> Ghani and his people had then drafted a comprehensive plan for it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , was given the green light by then PM Dr Mahathir . <p> However , by the time it was possible to implement the plan , it was Pak Lah at the helm .

@@16146232 <h> Err ... what ... skills ? <p> Rather than encourage critical thinking , our educators are only too happy to insist students think like them and do like them . <p> COMMENT <p> Professor Tajuddin Rasdi , a former senior academic from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia hit the bulls eye when he said : " If the purpose of a university is to influence people and expect students not to do things that are not approved , there would be no progress and you will always be left behind . " <p> His statement , although referring to the recent disciplinary action taken by a local public university against its students for their involvement in a public rally , holds true for other situations as well , for I believe " brainwashing " begins inside lecture halls . <p> I would like to relate an incident at my daughter 's university , which took place earlier this year . <p> It was the start of the fourth semester and my daughter , for the first time , was scheduled to attend a compulsory Thinking Skills class meant for law students . Having most of her other classes based on factual learning , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have open discussions as well as debates with others in her class . <p> In the first Thinking Skills class , the lecturer began by introducing himself to some 30 students before posing the question : " Why do you seek an education ? " <p> The students were expected to write down their answers on a piece of paper after which the lecturer would categorise them -- students whose answers made it into the first category would be allowed to stay in his class , while those that did not make it , would have to reschedule with the academic division . <p> My daughter 's answer was among those that were rejected . <p> " Fine , I shall give you a second chance -- you may change your answers , " the lecturer said as he distributed fresh pieces of papers . <p> Upon checking the answers , a few students were accepted and some rejected -- again . This included my daughter . <p> " I 'll give you a third chance now , " said the lecturer . <p> This time around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the answer sheets . <p> " I seek an education because I want to be smart and useful . " <p> " I want to have a good future . " <p> " I want to improve myself . " <p> The lecturer shook his head and said , " It is okay if you do not wish to change your answers . But your answers will determine whether you fit into my class or not . I will give you one final chance . " <p> Fresh sheets of papers were distributed one last time , and students who were not accepted began whispering to each other , asking what the correct answer should be . My daughter , being naturally stubborn , submitted the same answer , for the fourth time in a row . <p> With one after another claiming their seats , ever so happy to finally be accepted into the class , the lecturer was left holding my girl 's answer sheet in his hand -- she was the only student not accepted . <p> " I seek an education because I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offer my knowledge to others and be useful to my society , " he said , reading my daughter 's answer aloud . <p> By now , my daughter had already observed that there was a pattern to the answers submitted by the others in the class . She decided however to stand by her own answer . <p> " If there is no knowledge in the world , what would you do ? " asked the lecturer . <p> Puzzled , she answered , " There is always something to learn in this world , sir . " <p> " What if , there is no knowledge and to be someone knowledgeable is out of the question ? " he repeated . <p> " No sir , that does not make sense . There is always knowledge around us , " she said , standing her ground . <p> Clearly , the lecturer was not too keen in celebrating his student 's " thinking skills " as he continued building walls around my daughter 's thinking ability with a prolonged series of questions , crafted in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for . <p> Tired , my girl finally gave in . <p> " I seek education for Allah . " <p> And just like that , she was accepted into the class . <p> Professor Tajuddin Rasdi was so right when he said a university 's role was to encourage students to be critical and question everything they were taught . Sadly , our education system is bent on producing students who subscribe to a certain way of thinking as clearly demonstrated by my daughter 's Thinking Skills lecturer . <p> In recent years , our public school classrooms have shifted from the chalk-and-talk mode to a more hands-on and minds-on teaching and learning method . With more education officers sent overseas for training on how to improve our education system , it is both sad and frustrating to know that after all their good work , our children may still end up in institutions of higher learning where they risk being denied the right to speak their own minds . <p> We already have too many adults walking amongst us , who are intellectually shallow , who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to separate emotional thinking from logical thinking , who can not base their judgements on evidence , who confidently argue about things they know nothing about , who are reluctant to ask pertinent questions about burning issues or who lack the open-mindedness to consider new ideas and the opinions of others -- and all thanks to our educators whose own thinking ability is questionable . <p> If our university students continue to be treated like a herd of cows , I fear they too will end up having the thinking ability of a cow . <p> Fa Abdul is an FMT columnist <p> With a firm belief in freedom of expression and without prejudice , FMT tries its best to share reliable content from third parties .

Flipside <h> There 's more to Malaysia than just politicking <p> AS far as Malaysian politics is concerned , 2016 has served up quite the storm . <p> Betrayals , " family " feuds , unlikely friendships , untimely deaths ( of political careers ) -- it had overflowing doses of drama and intrigue to make for a very addictive soap opera . <p> The last 12 months have also shaken the very core of what many of us knew and believed about the nation 's political landscape , spanning the last few decades . <p> The sight of former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad breaking bread with the same people he vehemently opposed for 22 years still feels like a scene from an alternate universe . <p> Equally surreal is the idea of Umno and PAS seemingly on the verge of an unprecedented political agreement , especially pertaining to Islamic matters . <p> Indeed , the unexpected twists and turns in local politics have made it the flavour of the year in most Malaysian circles . <p> In fact , there is little else we enjoy talking about these days . <p> Almost every topic of discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with friends and strangers alike , seems to even ? tually skew towards politics . <p> On one hand , it is comforting to know that as Malaysians , we are becoming more politically aware , thanks in large part to social media such as Facebook and Twitter . <p> But I do wonder , when does it become a little too much ? On many occasions , issues that seemingly have nothing to do with politics are somehow politicised . <p> Be it in cyberspace or during social gatherings , it has become increasingly harder to steer clear of the " heavy stuff " . <p> And like it or not , such discussions have a way of quickly souring an otherwise pleasant atmosphere , as there are bound to be clashes of opinions and heated arguments among people of different inclinations . <p> A daily scroll through The Star Online 's Facebook page , which I manage together with my colleagues from the online team , reveals hundreds of comments from readers that are highly political in nature . <p> What is perplexing is that these comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entertainment , which are rarely linked to the politics of the day . <p> It appears that Malaysians have a remarkable gift for seeing everything through a political lens , and while that can be a necessary safeguard against perceived injustices committed by those who serve us , it also has the potential to become an unhealthy obsession . <p> For starters , an increasing reliance on information sourced from shoddy blogs , websites and unverified viral messages , has created a society that is unable to separate fact from fiction because of individual biases . <p> The tendency to argue one 's position based on rumours and emotions , as opposed to facts and reasoning , is also evidence that while political awareness is increasing , political intelligence is not . <p> It explains why many of the comments left by readers on our Facebook postings are often insensitive and riddled with factual inaccuracies . <p> Most of these commenters resort to vul ? ? ga ? rity , name-calling and insulting either their fellow commenters or the very subject(s) of the article in question . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some of our politicians . <p> This does not in any way imply that politicians should be immune from criticism . We deserve to channel our anger in the strongest terms possible whenever they fail to live up to expectations . <p> However , any kind of criticism requires basis and context , and can definitely be conveyed in a more tactful manner than the vitriol we are accustomed to these days . <p> So whenever we come across people who feel the need to spew unfounded allegations or half-truths , and to politicise where it is unwarranted , we must remind ourselves not to get caught in the trap they 've set . <p> A prime example is the Mass Rapid Transit ( MRT ) project that recently saw its first phase , connecting Sungai Buloh and Semantan , being opened to the public on Dec 16 . <p> This was a project that had been highly anticipated and despite some traffic inconveniences and minor hiccups in its construction over the last two or three years , it was completed within the stipulated timeframe and budget . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is clearly benefiting the public , especially those who reside in the Damansara area . <p> Its early success has hence been a source of pride to the Government and all the stakeholders involved in the project . <p> Many Malaysians are also raving about the brand new trains and the level of convenience offered to travellers , with the initial free service and feeder buses to the MRT stations . <p> Yet , there continue to be perpetual sceptics out there who prefer to search high and low for flaws in the project just so they can politicise it . <p> Allegations of budget excesses and claims that the MRT costs would increase the national debt are among some of the falsehoods that have been spread and are being eagerly lapped up by sections of the population who are too stingy to offer credit where it is due . <p> And this sentiment does n't just exist among the anti-government supporters , but also the pro-establishment folks who choose to blindly condemn some of the finer things the Opposition has done . <p> Their quest is usually led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on paper-thin evidence just to earn some political brownie points . <p> As learned voters , however , it is time we moved beyond and above such single-minded rhetoric . This starts with changing how we make ourselves heard online as it is the only way we can prove to the world that Malaysia is indeed progressing towards a First World mentality . <p> So the next time we are tempted to unne ? cessarily politicise or to make sweeping condemnations , pause and consider that it is important to be objective every once in awhile . <p> It is at least one of the simpler resolutions we can make for 2017 . <p> Online reporter Akil Yunus believes the world would be a better place without politics , but also a lot duller , something he addresses in The Flipside .

As someone who has to monitor social media a lot during the course of my work , this debate was troubling for a variety of reasons . <p> First , what does it say about the state of our country when a Malaysian can not greet a fellow Malaysian with festive wishes during his or her festival ? <p> Secondly , as this touches on religion , the arguments on social media rapidly became divisive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the jury is still out if a Muslim can greet a Christian with a " Merry Christmas " . <p> As a Christian , it 's not my place to go into the intricacies of this argument and counter-argument ( although the Federal Territories Mufti said recently that it was permissible for Muslims to wish Christians Merry Christmas ) . <p> No , I would just like to highlight the fact that Malaysia has long been looked up to as a country that 's rich in diversity and one where different races celebrate each other 's religious and cultural festivals . <p> At least , that 's the politically correct line . The reality is that we are becoming increasingly polarised . <p> But still , I take heart in the fact that many of my Muslim friends wished me on or before Dec 25 . <p> Fellow The Star columnist Daphne Iking wrote about this same subject last week and in fact , as a Muslim convert herself , she is best qualified to talk about this subject . <p> I urge readers to read her column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that she was compelled to write the column because of a series of Facebook postings attacking her as a Muslim for her festive greetings . <p> Ironically though , those attacking her were Christians themselves who felt that a Muslim convert had no right to do so . Strange but true ! <p> I also noticed that many celebrities like Daphne and also prominent politicians took to Facebook , Instagram and Twitter to offer Christmas greetings to their followers . <p> Many of these people were Muslims themselves , but the simple act of offering festive wishes in a climate where such a thing is frowned upon by a segment of the population should be lauded . <p> However , the most sensible argument I 've read online comes from the Crown Prince of Johor , Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim : " Offering festive wishes to the non-Muslims does not make one less of a Muslim . Islam teaches its followers to respect people of different races and beliefs and to stay away from any form of extremism . Islam is a religion of peace and love . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ismail said he was puzzled why people have to be afraid of respecting one another . <p> I have to say , I totally agree with him -- Malaysians seem to waste their time arguing over trivial matters , in this case something as insignificant as a festive greeting . <p> His statement resonates with me . <p> Conversely , when I wish my fellow Muslim or Hindu friends and colleagues " Selamat Hari Raya " or " Happy Deepavali " , I do not feel any less of a Christian . <p> In fact , it makes me proud to do so as I embrace the various cultures that make up Malaysia , and my wishing others is reflective of the values that have shaped me -- to become someone who is not only respectful but happy to be living aside others , no matter their differences . <p> Now , enough of this triviality .
