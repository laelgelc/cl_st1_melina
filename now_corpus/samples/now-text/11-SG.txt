February is always a big month for Filipinos . Two weeks after celebrating Valentine 's Day , Filipinos hold another annual celebration that is uniquely their own . On the 25th of February each year , die-hard Aquino supporters have their annual song and dance routine usually complete with a live musical variety show near the EDSA shrine to commemorate the anniversary of the so-called ' People Power ' EDSA revolution . <p> You can be sure that Aquino supporters will have their grins up to their third molars on the day because the so-called ' Aquino legacy ' has finally come full circle . After 25 years , who would have thought that President Noynoy Aquino ( PNoy ) , the son of People Power icon former President Cory Aquino , would follow in his mother 's footsteps , literally ? <p> The People Power Monument along EDSA blvd ( Photo by Mike Gonzalez ) <p> An Aquino oligarchy yet again ? <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother 's incompetence to deliver on her campaign promises , PNoy got his mother 's unique style of ' barely there ' leadership to a tee . <p> But what a joy it must be for the rest of the melodramatic Aquino fans who love living in the past at the expense of the poor . Likewise , the oligarchs that benefit from a family member 's stay in Malaca ? ang are basking in the glory coming from a guaranteed grip on the people 's minds for years and years to come . <p> The victors of the so-called ' revolution ' have been reduced to resorting to propaganda in recent years . <p> The Filipinos have , indeed , given ' people power ' a new meaning after 25 years . The political opposition should never have underestimated the power of illogical people moving in large groups . It has been said that the victors get to write history . It has also been said that propagandists get to use history to their advantage . Thanks to the lack of progress in the country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resorting to propaganda in recent years . Since none of the perpetrators during the Marcos ' years have been put on trial or convicted anyway , the Aquino family and their cronies continue to use media outlets owned and operated by their own family and friends to continue demonizing the Marcos regime . <p> By doing so , the Aquino family likewise continue to come across as martyrs . The victors -- the Aquinos -- are quite successful applying this approach towards keeping the majority of the population beholden to them even when democracy in the country is alive only in theory . <p> It is quite a mind-boggling exercise to ponder the question of why most Filipinos have such a screwed up memory of the events that unfolded after EDSA I. Four years after Marcos was ousted , Cory 's administration was highly criticized for its failure to deliver on the much-needed economic reforms and was plagued by allegations of corruption involving Cory 's wealthy and influential relatives -- the same allegations they used to topple Marcos in the first place . In an article published on TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption against her brother Jose ' Peping ' Cojuangco were documented : <p> TIME magazine named her Woman of the Year at the end of 1986 , the first female to hold the distinction since Queen Elizabeth in 1952 . ( Photo by Dennis Raymond ) <p> ... But in the tumultuous four years since Aquino became President , charges of incompetence and graft have increasingly tainted her own government . When rebellious soldiers launched the seventh abortive coup against Aquino on Dec. 1 , their most pointed complaints focused on the administration 's failure to deliver basic services and on allegations of corruption among the President 's wealthy and influential relatives . <p> The charges , magnified by the Manila rumour mill , have inflicted serious political damage . While the President herself is considered incorruptible , critics accuse her of turning a blind eye to family and friends who are said to be enriching themselves at the public 's expense . <p> ... A frequent target of reports is Aquino 's brother Jose ( ' Peping ' ) Cojuangco Jr. , a wealthy and powerful congressman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cojuangco had helped some of his cronies gain control of a lucrative cargo-handling business ; he is also suspected of using family ties to get jobs for friends in Manila casinos . Cojuangco has denied any wrongdoing , and neither he nor any other member of the Aquino clan has been charged with a crime . <p> Yet lack of prosecution means little in a country where the rich and powerful are perceived to be above the law . ' It would take a first-class fool to testify against someone like Peping Cojuangco , ' explains Blas Ople , executive vice president of the opposition Nacionalista Party and a former Minister of Labor under Marcos . <p> In one of the few corruption cases the authorities have pursued , Cojuangco 's wife Margarita was suspected of having taken a $1 million bribe from an Australian businessman last year to help him obtain a gambling-casino license . <p> PNoy 's term is even beginning to look more and more like a carbon copy of his own mother 's term with allegations of nepotism , favoritism , and incompetence plaguing his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy ' is not as untainted as the Aquino minions would have everyone believe . PNoy 's term is even beginning to look more and more like a carbon copy of his own mother 's term with allegations of nepotism , favoritism , and incompetence plaguing his administration . And with images of PNoy , and of his celebrity sister Kris , splashed all over the country like propaganda paraphernalia , Marcos 's ' personality cult ' drive to send subliminal messages just to keep his popularity high is alive and working for the Aquino family . <p> Ram Bahadur has to work for each and everything . Most times , he stands at the gate , sometimes he has to fetch water , othertimes he has to go to the market to buy vegetables and fruits . He is no ordinary security guard .

@@4297239 n't mix <p> In 2008 , Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore bought 27 wild bottlenose dolphins from the Solomon Islands to be placed in a dolphin exhibition in their Marine Life Park in 2012 . Nine of the dolphins were then transported to Langkawi and the rest were put in Subic Bay , Phillipines . <p> However , in 2010 , two female dolphins that were put in a holding area in Langkawi died from a bacterial infection known as Melioidosis . Melioidosis is caused by the soil-dwelling bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei and most commonly occurs when a wound comes into contact with contaminated soil and muddy water . <p> Following the deaths of the two dolphins , the other dolphins in Langkawi were then transported to the Philippines and are currently undergoing training in preparation for their arrival in 2012 . <p> A similar event occurred in 2003 , where 28 bottlenose dolphins from the Solomon Islands were imported to the Atlantida facility in Mexico for entertainment purposes in their Wet ' n ' Wild Park . <p> However , at least 12 dolphins died within five years of the transport . One died as a result of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next two years due to illnesses . Following this tragic outcome , the Mexican government implemented a ban on the exportation and importation of live cetaceans for entertainment uses . <p> THE PLIGHT <p> The surviving RWS dolphins will potentially face a life of suffering and their fate may be similar to that of the Mexican dolphins . It is important to consider the conservation and well-being of wildlife and therefore I do not believe that the RWS dolphins should be kept in captivity . <p> The public needs to know that the beauty of wildlife should only be observed in their natural habitat . The intelligence of dolphins is one that is rare in nature , and they should not be degraded for entertainment . The deaths that occurred in captive environments all over the world furthermore prove my point that the RWS dolphins can not thrive in captivity . <p> Taken from RWS website and I quote " Research , public education and conservation efforts for marine life are the cornerstones of the Marine Life Park . " The irony of it all is that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolphins have already died under their care . <p> What kind of conservation are they promoting ? How many more dolphins have to die before RWS gets the hint that they are leading these dolphins to misery ? With much support and persuasion to abolish the dolphin exhibition in RWS , these dolphins can lead a life of freedom in the ocean where they belong . <p> IMPACTS OF CAPTIVITY <p> Captivity causes unstable relationships : <p> Dolphins can not thrive in captivity . An oceanarium , no matter how big it is , can not recreate the dolphin 's natural habitat -- the oceani . It simply can not provide the same social environment for these marine creatures . <p> Social relationships play a very important role in the well-being of dolphinsii . Unstable relationships usually lead to stress and aggression in dolphinsiii , and loss of social support results in increased stress and a higher risk of mortalityiv . Unstable relationships often occur when dolphins are captured from the wild and thus stripped from their social groups . Also , the death of one or more pod mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can result in further suffering for the pod group as dolphins are highly sociable creatures . <p> The dolphin groupings determined by humans are artificial and is different from the natural groupings in the wild . Dolphins that do not get along with the group will be isolated or try to escape confinement . A newly matured dolphin or an introduction of a new dolphin to the group affects the social hierarchies and relationships already in placev . This instability in the dolphin group can lead to an increase in the risk of injuries , illnesses and aggression between the dolphinsvi . <p> Captivity ignores behavioural needs and causes stress : <p> Wild dolphins are used to swimming forty to fifty miles a day and diving hundreds of feet . They are constantly swimming , looking for food and playing with their pod matesvii . Unfortunately , marine parks are just too small to cater to the dolphin 's behavioural needs . The use of echolocation by dolphins for hunting and detecting objects is also severely limited in captivity . <p> Dolphins denied the ability to partake in their natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by psychological stress . Stereotypical behaviours are believed to be triggered by artificial environments that do not allow animals to meet their behavioural needsix . <p> Merely transporting dolphins can cause severe stress and many dolphins have died as a result of transport . According to WSPA , the risk of dying is increased six times during the first five days after capture . It is also found that 53% of captive dolphins , who have managed to survive the trauma of transport , die within the first three months of confinement . <p> Tragic outcomes : <p> Kathy the dolphin who played the character Flipper in the popular television series " Flipper " died in captivity in 1970 . After the TV series ended , Kathy was put in a steel tank without much interaction with other dolphins and humans . Kathy slowly showed signs of stress and depression according to dolphin trainer Ric ' O ' Barry . Eventually , while still the trainer 's arms , Kathy sank underwater and did not swim up for another breath . As dolphins are not automatic air breathers they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too unbearable by simply not breathing . Kathy 's death proves the extent of suffering dolphins can experience in captivity . <p> Here are some cases of dolphin deaths in captivity according to the Oceanic Preservation Society : <p> At the Miami Seaquarium in Miami FL , 62 dolphins have died from various diseases such as salmonella , toxic hepatitis and many others . <p> In Australia 's Sea World enterprises , 16 dolphins have died from injuries such as spine fractures , twisted bowels , heart and mammary abscesses , " operating stress " and severe anemia . <p> The Orlando Sentinel performed a computer analysis of captive dolphins in the 1980s . They found that in the waters off Florida and other Gulf states , there were altogether 414 dolphins that were captured or born into captivity . However , over one third of these dolphins were dead by first January 1990 . <p> Dolphins should be in captivity only for rehabilitation or conservation purposes but not for entertainment . <p> Yes , there are indeed some facilities that are focused on dolphin conservation and rehabilitation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as promoters of conservation ; whose genuine intention is to build a money-making industry at the expense of their captive cetaceans . <p> Resorts World Sentosa certainly seems to be the latter . Besides the revenue it would earn RWS and enjoyment of visitors , no other benefit can be derived from the dolphin exhibition in Resorts World Sentosa Oceanarium . And more importantly , there will surely be detrimental impacts on the cetaceans ' wellbeing . <p> Although there is an argument that dolphins in captive environments have increased life span compared to wild dolphins , one thing is clear ; captivity severely reduces the dolphins ' quality of life . <p> v Caldwell , DK and Caldwell , MC 1968 , " Social behaviour as a husbandry factor in captive odontocete cetaceans " Boca Raton : Proceedings of the second symposium on disease and husbandry of aquatic mammals . <p> N.
