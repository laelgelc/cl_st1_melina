@@16195250 <h> West Ham star just do it ! <p> Recently , I had the privilege of speed-mentoring some very determined youth at Ghana Think Foundation 's Barcamp Kumasi . Almost all the mentees told me that they had so many ideas of things they really wanted to do , there was just one thing standing in their way : fear of being laughed at . <p> This fear was one I knew too well and even to this day battle . <p> You see , I find it amusing when I meet people who think I am so confident , brave and all that . What most people do n't know is that every single time , before I put up a post on Facebook , blog or make a presentation , there is that voice which constantly says to me ' You 're not there yet ' , ' You 're not smart enough ' , ' This is not good enough ! Ah ! Do you want to display your ignorance for people to laugh at you ' and so on . I question myself ' what if people laugh at me ? ' <p> Frankly , it is frightening to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to forget posting anything or to speak anywhere . But guess what , sometimes I actually win this mind battle . In spite of the self-doubt and fear of being laughed at . <p> I just do it ! And I know I should never stop because apart from the personal satisfaction I get from doing what I do , the private messages of encouragement and ' thank you ' that I get are indications that I am doing the right thing . <p> I strongly believe that each one has their own purpose in life and fear must not stand in your way , hence this article . Here are some few tips that help me overcome from time to time . <p> Learn from others <p> There is nothing new under the sun and most of the things we want to achieve have been conquered by other people already so why not learn from them . <p> I totally admire the way Michelle Obama speaks . Most of the time , I more like gape at her instead of listening to her . I study her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow specific people I admire , I read about and learn from them . <p> For those I am able to contact , I book appointments to meet and chat . When I attend training in which I am not a facilitator , I mostly pay attention to the different presentation styles so that I can assimilate what I admire . <p> There is nothing wrong with learning from others ; you do not have to be like them entirely , you simply need to take the good from them and add to your good . <p> Start with baby steps . <p> For instance , if yours is the fear of public speaking start by offering to pray or making a suggestion when you are in a group . Yes , I know . I know , every fibre and bone in you will resist this decision but do it anyway . You will most likely break into sweat , shiver uncontrollably or both . It does not matter , do it anyway . <p> You can then graduate to reading the Bible during church service or to giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first ten tries will probably give you mini heart attacks but I can assure you that will not die . I 'm alive , ' in n it ' ? <p> Pray before you start <p> I do not mean to preach but this really works for me . Right before I speak or train especially , I pray silently ' Lord , you say that when it is time to speak , you will show us what to say so please use me to bless your children ' The fact is , I do not even remember where in the Bible I read this , whether it was Paul who wrote it or it is about Moses . All I know is , God promised it somewhere in the Bible so I just remind Him of it and it works for me because somehow I know I am never alone . <p> Practise . Practise . Practise . <p> I know this is probably a clich ? , but it works like magic . Recently , I had an opportunity to speak at TEDxAdum . Now if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big deal for me . I usually research and practice before any presentation but as for this event , I took it up a notch . <p> First , I wrote down my presentation in a story format . Read through at least ten times , rehearsed it in front of the mirror , audio and video recorded myself at least twenty times , rehearsed in front of my family and later the organisers before the big day . It felt a bit awkward rehearsing in front of my family and the organisers but by the time I gave the talk , there was not a shred of nervousness left in me , I just rattled away . <p> It really is ok to make mistakes <p> A lot of times , we fear that we will be laughed at because we may make mistakes and for this reason , we do not even dare try at all . That is such a shame because come to think of it , who can ever walk on the surface of this earth without making a mistake ? So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out of nervousness , and so what ? I have had my share of ' preases ' and I am still alive and kicking ! <p> Your presentation , had typographical errors and so what ? Big deal ! Get over it and go again . I have read about enough successful people to know that they keep going in spite of their setbacks . Your mistake is an opportunity to learn a lesson and move on . And by the way , do you know that most of the time , the people who laugh at us are really laughing to suppress their own feelings of insecurity ? I know this because I have laughed at others before , yes I know , shame on me ! Most of these people do not have the courage to try what you are doing . So ' prease ' , be encouraged . <p> Believe me , even as I type this article on my little laptop , there is that annoying voice telling me that this is not good enough . It is always there , constantly reminding me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are reading this then it means ' I just did it ! ' Yes , I sent it for publication in spite of that naughty voice that I ca n't seem to get rid of . <p> Please , learn from others , take the first baby step , pray before you start , practice like you are crazy and do n't be afraid of mistakes .

This is often our idea of a dream travel . Did you know that travel can be done alone ? Often the experiences of solo travel live longer because we create them by ourselves and do n't depend on anyone else to make it successful . Below , Jumia Travel enumerates 5 key things to consider when traveling alone . Call it the 5 commandments of Solo Travel . 1 . THOU SHALT CHOOSE THE PERFECT DESTINATION <p> In a world where there are over 250 countries and over 4,400 cities , finding a perfect travel destination may be an arduous task . However , there are limited places where you can have a memorable experience when you travel alone . In many parts of the world , tourist destinations are designed with large numbers in mind . Some even have family and friends packages . When you travel alone , you may be lost in certain cities or not have the best experience at certain destinations . Always make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . One that you have planned for a while to make the experience memorable . Choose a perfect destination . If you must go alone , make sure the destination is perfect for just you . <p> 2 . THOU SHALT PLAN ACCORDING TO YOUR BUDGET <p> When you travel in a group or with family , there is always a likelihood that there are one or two people to jump to your rescue when you are short of money . When you run out of money on your travel , you often should have a back-up . However , when you plan a solo travel , be sure that you plan adequately for it . Plan according to your budget so you do n't overspend . You will not have anyone to fall on during such times . Plan for each hotel booking , each meal and each tour . Do not leave anything to chance or make plans outside your budget . What you have is all you have to spend . Do not spend on impulse else you might end up stranded . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never set off without knowing enough about your trip . Do not travel blind . You have to research adequately to know where exactly you are going , where you are staying , the places you will visit , languages , transportation means and other important information . Also have all documents intact before you move . Flight tickets , and hotel reservations as well as health insurance and passports should be well prepared . Remember , you have no one else to fall on when you get missing and relying on locals may end you in serious trouble as you ran the risk of falling prey to robbers and criminals . Get enough information before you set off . <p> 4 . SOLO IS NOT SELFISH <p> When you are drowning with friends or family in an ocean and there is only one oxygen mask , there is unfortunately one option . Save yourself ! It does n't mean you are selfish . Sometimes , you have to be by yourself . You have to wander around the world alone to find yourself . To reflect and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you need to relax and destress . Do n't worry , there will be time for family travel . This time is all about you . Go alone and enjoy yourself . <p> 5 . THOU SHALT NOT RETURN WITHOUT RECORD <p> The best memories are the ones that can be re-lived . You do n't necessarily have to be present at the same spot where you had the memory to enjoy it . Pictures and videos are probably two of the best means of capturing amazing memories . However , when you travel alone , you might want to pick up some memorabilia or artefacts to prove that you were actually at these places or to better tell your story . Some sand at the beach , some sea shells , a flag , iconic item , t-shirt or some sort of record is always great . If you return without record , you may have to go back there someday to truly enjoy the memories yet again . <p> By : Bennet Otoo , Jumia Travel . <p> Do you have more to share about this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to : ( newsghana101@gmail.com )

And no one should underestimate that especially in our winner takes all democracy .

If with all the resources at their disposal : the military , the police , and the control of the national purse , they could not provide adequate policing only for their opponent to stuff ballot boxes then they are the most useless group of people to ever govern Ghana . The most annoying part is when their attack bulldog , Koku Anyidoho , become belligerent in a respond to Sammy Awuku , which was also a provocation by the chain of events ignited by Mrs Joyce Bawa-Mogtari . <p> I do n't think this will be the last .

Jammeh took his cue of conceding defeat from Nigeria 's Jonathan , he must have also thought he was making a mistake going by the happenings in Nigeria today . <p> With the relentless vindictive persecution of Goodluck Jonathan 's family by the Buhari administration , the unending vendetta against Jonathan 's former ministers and government officials , the use of the military , secret police and other security agencies to harass , intimidate and even kill innocent , harmless and helpless citizens in droves with little or no provocation , high-handedness in dealing with sections of the country that did not support the emergence of president Buhari , it probably became obvious to Jammeh the enormity of risks he is taking by conceding defeat . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in conceding defeat in Africa . They must have reminded him of what is going on in Nigeria despite the magnanimity of Goodluck Jonathan . Even his cabinet members might have become apprehensive . They must have become afraid of being witch hunted and persecuted . <p> Some of them might even be ready to face prosecution should there be any need for that , but then , they realize that what their counterparts in Nigeria are facing is more of persecution than prosecution . They must have all brought Jammeh 's attention to al the atrocities going on in Nigeria . Jammeh gives all these a long and hard thought , and then thinks it is not worth it in the end . <p> This is only just a part of the many consequences of Buhari 's tyrannical approach to governance in Nigeria . The message of his style reverberates across Africa . The goodwill and novel approach of incumbents conceding defeat in the continent is being endangered rather than being engendered . Consequently , Buhari 's style of leadership is rolling the political progress of Africa kick-started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handover centuries backward . <p> Even Nigeria 's electoral system that was beginning to make tremendous progress under Jonathan has suffered unwarranted grievous attacks under Buhari . The nation 's electoral system has been so bastardised within the short period Buhari 's administration has lasted that electoral malpractices have been given an official toga . <p> Not even the ECOWAS court has been spared the torrid experience of having its court orders disobeyed by the Buhari administration as it concerns its pronouncement on Sambo Dasuki , Nigeria 's former National Security Adviser under Jonathan . It is therefore even more shocking that the same ECOWAS would rely on such a man to be a mediator in the political logjam about to befall Gambia . <p> Well meaning Nigerians have continued to warn that the autocratic manner Buhari is running Nigeria has very grave implications not only for the country but also for Africa . Gradually , those implications are beginning to unfold right before our very eyes . The UN that is asking Jammeh to accept defeat and hand over power to Barrow seem to be only interested in treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of such a disease . <p> No one is saying that governments should not prosecute past governments where and when necessary , but everyone would want such prosecution not to degenerate into persecution , intimidation , harassment and vindictive pursuit of family members and officials of any previous government . <p> Diligent and civil prosecution of anyone would always encourage peaceful handover of power from one government to another in Africa . But first , the ECOWAS , AU , UN and other such international bodies must also not look away while any government deals with its people with an iron fist under the guise of fighting corruption and or other such otherwise noble guises . Until this is ensured , there are likely to be many more Jammehs in Africa than anyone can imagine . <p> By Jude Ndukwe ( jrndukwe@yahoo.co.uk ) <p> Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to : ( newsghana101@gmail.com )

The situation is equally dire in West Virginia . <p> " I 'm really , really worried about what 's happening in Washington .

@@17398238 <p> These speed bumps are intended to slow trading down and level the playing field between big investors and tech-driven high-speed traders . The idea , championed by IEX , has been controversial and was met with fierce opposition from established trading platforms -- including the NYSE . <p> But the IEX got its approval , and now NYSE is introducing its own speed bump -- at least in one corner of its trading network . Where the twist just appeared is that , now , IEX is the one pushing back against the NYSE 's plan for a speedbump . <p> NYSE is now proposing its own version of a speed bump , and it gives as the only justification that it wants to offer more choice in exchanges . But NYSE says nothing about its choices in putting forth the Proposal , how it thinks investors and the quality of the markets will be affected , or how MKT would compare in those respects from the three other exchanges it operates . Especially considering its prior statements , we think NYSE is required to provide a complete explanation to gain approval under the standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gone down , this bullet point guide might help : <p> The battle between NYSE and IEX has been hard to follow , and spans across multiple different market structure issues , ranging from speed bumps and so-called stale quotes to the cost of market data . Multiple other firms have engaged on each of these topics , sometimes forming odd allegiances . At one point , a discussion around market data descended into an argument over Game of Thrones references . <p> Given the relatively tiny market share occupied by the presumed competitor ( IEX ) , it 's more than a bit puzzling why another exchange would be rushing into compete with it . Taken along with the extreme brevity of the the NYSE Mkt Proposal ( it 's only a few pages ) , and the vagueness of its justification , it appears as though the proposal may be being sought as a placeholder , to be further adjusted and potentially used in the future . The Commission should view such a vague proposal with a healthy skepticism . <p> Turner : You said earlier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that said can you talk me through the thought process behind introducing a speed bump ? <p> Farley : There are more or less four different models out there in the US for trading securities . There is out NYSE hybrid model , floor and electronic , that de-emphasizes speed with the use of floor brokers and DMMs . There is the all-electronic model that is quite prevalent at Nasdaq and BATS and elsewhere . Then we have our NYSE Arca business , which works quite well as a primary listing venue for ETFs and structured products . There is the speed-bump model , and there is the first speed bump that the SEC allowed from IEX , we 've seen subsequent speed-bump requests from Chicago , we 've had a distant cousin from Nasdaq with the long life order . That 's the third model . <p> The fourth model is what I will call " other . " You can almost look across the pond as well . You have a greater reliance of auctions , would be one example of that .

NYSE , Arca , the speed-bump model on NYSE American . We think we can improve on the existing speed-bump model , because frankly , we can do it a lot cheaper for customers . <p> The price out there for customers trading on the speed bump model , this kind of midpoint trading , is very , very high , and so we think we can do it at a much more effective price , and our institutional customers who are working hard to satisfy their fiduciary obligation will appreciate that , that 's our view . In addition , we think we can do it better in terms of attracting lit liquidity , because the existing speedbump model is substantially all dark trading . <p> Finally , the fourth model is the NSX medallion that we 've announced .

That will be our sandbox to try some of those other models in the not-too-distant future . <p> Farley : Our view is that we need to work together as an industry toward consolidation and simplicity . The way we operate our business is , we are going to do everything we can to have the best listings franchise , and we 're going to look at what competitors are doing , and whether they may or may not be competing for our listings business , and respond in a way that enables us to protect that . We 're going to be listening to our institutional investors , when they say , " Hey , with respect to the models that are allowed by SEC regulations , congressional laws , we want you to be offering choice . " <p> That does n't mean that we do n't believe in simplification . We absolutely do . We 're the first ones to throw our hands up .

@@17830230 <p> This week , there 's really only one story I want to talk about , but you know what , the other things that have happened since Monday are also important , so let 's touch on them before I vent my spleen on that one big story . <p> This week , our focus on Galamsey has intensified significantly . We spent two days with a former Minister of Lands and Natural Resources , a conversation that proved to be a catalogue of how NOT to fight Galamsey . Nothing the previous government did made any lasting impact on the fight against illegal mining . But let 's get this clear ; the Kufuor government before them achieved a great big nothing in that area too . <p> Both administrations sat idly by while foreigners trooped into our country , colluded with indigenous nation wreckers to rape our lands and poison our waters . Members of both governments benefitted from turning a blind eye while all this happened . Some of them joined in . Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , Regional party executives , all set up so-called small scale mining companies and used them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , poison our water bodies and squander our nation 's future . <p> So now , here we are , staring death in the face as drinkable water disappears slowly from our map , replaced by a brown sludge laced with mercury and other tasty carcinogens . But slowly , our nation has started to wake up . The media has played its role as the eyes and ears of Ghana , removing the veil of collusion and corruption that has kept this Democide undetected for so long . Now people are awake . Now , people are angry . Now , people are ready to act . And this government promised us they would do it . Pages 89 to 94 of their Manifesto are filled with lofty ideas of reclamation , reaforrestation , conservation , and a glistening , shiny little thing called the Clean Rivers Programme . Yoo . As usual , you have said plenty . Now do plenty . <p> Worryingly , we discovered in our conversations yesterday Thursday with the Minerals Commission that all the licenses they have issued for small scale mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified by parliament as the Constitution demands . So in effect , apart from the large-scale mining companies , every other person or company mining in this company is doing so illegally . All 1000 or so of them -- they 're all doing galamsey . The sector Minister , John Peter Amewu confirmed this worrying detail . So what does this mean ? Is this the Government 's opportunity to ban all small scale mining , as some watchdogs have been calling for ? WILL they seize this opportunity ? Or is it yet another thing to just talk about and not act upon ? <p> Anyway , now , let me talk about the thing that has really bothered and scared me this week . And I wo n't talk too much -- just lay out the facts . So a group of NPP footsoldiers called the Delta Force have stormed a courtroom , abused a lady judge and effected the escape of 13 of their members who had just been remanded to custody pending trial for assaulting a member of the security services appointed by the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the NPP 's leadership has sponsored , protected and defended to the point where they now believe they have the right to do these things . Kennedy Agyapong - a member of parliament and one of the party 's most prominent financiers - openly admits to flying around the country , funding and tasking these criminals to protect ballot boxes during the recent election . He reveals that the party promised these hooligans government jobs with salaries that you and I will pay . He goes further to pledge that if any of them faces trial for assaulting the Presidential Appointee , he himself will lead a demonstration against government . <p> So yesterday 's profane violation of this country 's rule of law must not have come as a surprise to him . <p> The Delta Force .

For the first time I decided to get some airtime and just vote for him . Yes I voted for him . I voted for him to win Gospel Artiste of the year several times ( which I was 101% sure about ) because I 'd seen most of what he did in that year and unenthusiastically for Artiste of the year ( because my reason was that I just could n't trust the organizers of the VGMAs ) . <p> I personally believed that Joe deserved Gospel Artiste of the year because in 2016 he really worked hard . I was at his outdoor event at James Town Mantse Agboena park in December and it very just refreshing . <p> On artiste of the year , I think anyone who has followed me knows that I 'm a dyed-in-the-wool Joe fan . In fact I wo n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That said , I am also not a keen follower of the secular music industry so to be truthful apart from household names like Shatta Wale , Stonebouy , EL , Kofi Kinaata and a few others I really do not know much of what happens in their circles . In fact even for the people I 've mentioned , I think apart from Shatta Wale I may not be able to even mention a single title to any of their songs . <p> In fact it was only last week I asked a friend who was behind de song " Paa Kwesi ee ee Nana Yaw . " For some reason I thought it was Agya Koo who sang it . I love good music and most especially very good , sound , lyrically educative music not the noisy songs like " po ny3 ny3 " ( who did that music ? ) <p> Back to Joe , I think Joe worked very hard in 2016 . I personally do not measure people 's outputs by the stages you stand on or the international travels one does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well at least from where I sit ) . His song #Onwanwani just ministers to me and I personally love it . No doubt he 's my Artiste of the year regardless of who awarded him . <p> Joe Mettle <p> Now to the VGMAs . Personally , I see the VGMAs as " a struggling for credibility Awards scheme " that needs to get its acts together . What I realized from this year 's awards was that I realized that at least they tried to get some of their awards right . At least awarding Fancy Gadem means they can get it right if they want to . <p> If u want to know who Fancy Gadem is at least travel up north . He 's very large . My brother the late Kwabena Boadu ( MayHGSRIP ) drew my attention to him . I hear he filled the whole Tamale sports stadium several times . His biggest rival is Maccassio . You can check these two up on YouTube . <p> On Artiste of the year , I mean seeing my boy hold that award does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One person I would have loved to see in that category is Shatta Wale . If Shatta was in this category then possibly he would have won it or should have it . His song ' Mahama paper ' is everywhere and that makes it the most popular song of the year . I mean apart from his crude approach to issues I think that guy is a talent that should be managed to market Ghana . <p> I 'm reading reviews about the fact that Joe won the Artiste of the year as a means of compensating those of us in the Christian circles . I do n't think that is factually correct . Joe worked quite hard in the year under review . I think what accounted for this was a host of factors . In 2016 I do n't think the secular Artistes did much work as we are being made to believe . The same way some of them claim no knowledge of Joe is the same way we also do not know their people . For instance I got to hear of Medikal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year Lord Kenya won Artiste of the year his song " Me d ) " was a household song and he as an Artiste was all over the place . In the year Stonebouy won Artiste of the year , his song " them dey susupon me " was quite common and his presence was quite loud . Same can be said of R2Bees , Kontihene , VIP etc . However we did not see this level of appeal among these secular guys . Someone should tell me how EL or MsVee or Stonebouy or Medikal was better than Joe Mettle ? And this one of the things I do n't want to do ; comparing a Christian Artiste to secular Artistes as if to say they do the same things . This is really hard for me but we have brought this on to ourselves . <p> Personally I think Joe Mettle is a true reflection of the scripture that says " all things work together for them who love the Lord " and I will explain . In the year Joe got nominated , a certain George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying bribes to win awards . George Quaye happened to be the spokesperson of Charterhouse , organisers of the Ghana Music Awards . <p> Many gospel artistes got very offended , with Gospel icons Oware Junior and Selina Boateng boycotting the Awards . In fact the song of the year if OJ had been part of this year 's Awards in my estimation would have just been OJ 's " Nipa hia mmoa " and he would have been song writer of the year . <p> Looking at these factors , coupled with the fact that Charterhouse as a business minded organization knew that losing the Gospel Artistes and their followers would mean them losing a certain base of the market . They had to be smart and act immediately . Fortunately for them ( Charterhouse ) , a certain young man in the Gospel Circles had worked so hard it would be so good to Award his hard work in a year the secular guys did not do much in 2016 . By doing so , this will mean winning a certain base that felt they had been neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have erased the " erroneous " perception that had been published by their spokesperson . So eventually a certain Joe Mettle who had strategically positioned himself at the right time and worked so hard got awarded as the Overall Artiste of the year 2017 . By this singular act , Charterhouse , then manages to gain some credibility from the large Christian followers . Smart move right ? Yes ! Bingo for Charterhouse ! That is it . <p> In fact as I have already said , if Shatta Wale had been nominated , this would have been a very difficult year for Charterhouse as giving the Award to anyone else would have been a major dent . <p> That said , Mr and Madam Gospel Musician , Awards wo n't take you to heaven . The state of your heart will . Joe has won an award so the doors are opened so you too you will be forcing yourself to win some by force . Masa ma wani nda h ) ! Not all that glitters is gold . Grace and favor may have found Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win Artiste of the year or some awards .

But the beneficiaries of such remittances never complain that the money is coming from someone who has been cleaning .

When Manchester City appointed Guardiola last summer , success was far from guaranteed . A new footballing identity , however , seemingly was . <p> Guardiola , of course , made his name at Barcelona by creating one of the best football sides in history , sticking to Barca 's classic footballing beliefs : width , 4-3-3 and possession play . His stint at Bayern was different , demonstrating a more flexible nature to Guardiola 's coaching . He did n't rigidly adhere to his Barcelona principles , and instead adapted his approach to suit Bayern Munich 's stars , becoming increasingly experimental with his formations . <p> The big question for Guardiola at Manchester City , therefore , would be how he found the balance between introducing Guardiola-style football and continuing with City 's existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly : there was a sweeper-keeper , ball-playing centre-backs , inverted full-backs and an overwhelmingly creative midfield trio . <p> Slowly but surely , however , Guardiola has abandoned his intended approach for Manchester City and increasingly reverted to the system they played under Manuel Pellegrini . There are four distinct examples : <p> 1 . Goalkeeper <p> Changing City 's No. 1 was Guardiola 's most obvious " changing of the guard " moment . Joe Hart had endured a few difficult campaigns , but other managers might have hoped a new coaching regime would rejuvenate his career . <p> Claudio Bravo OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images <p> Not Guardiola , however . Among question marks about his ability to play as a sweeper-keeper , Hart was unceremoniously dumped , and Claudio Bravo was introduced as his replacement . On his debut against Manchester United , Bravo provided a remarkably exaggerated example of a sweeper-keeper performance , positioning himself permanently outside his penalty box and continually playing the ball out when pressured by opposition players . He made a mistake for United 's goal , dropping a cross to Zlatan Ibrahimovic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what Guardiola wanted . <p> Since then , however , it 's become clear that Bravo is n't a particularly good goalkeeper in a traditional sense . At one point , he conceded six consecutive shots on target , but perhaps more significantly , he essentially abandoned his sweeper-keeper style , positioning himself traditionally . Meanwhile , his performances became so bad that he was on the bench between Jan. 21 and April 8 , with reserve goalkeeper Willy Caballero preferred . Bravo has regained his place , but with his confidence dented by mistakes and being dropped , he now simply seems like a dodgy goalkeeper rather than a progressive sweeper-keeper . <p> 2 . Full-backs <p> At Bayern , Guardiola had stunned opponents by often asking his full-backs to play a very peculiar role ; rather than overlapping down the flanks , they were asked to drift inside to midfield positions . Philipp Lahm and David Alaba were both comfortable in central midfield , so the move worked effectively , guarding against opposition counter-attacks and allowing Bayern 's wingers space down the flanks . <p> Guardiola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gael Clichy asked to do something similar during the opening game of the campaign against Sunderland and in a couple of other early-season games . In truth , the experiment was less successful , primarily because these players lacked the technical quality and footballing intelligence of the Bayern pair . But it was nevertheless a progressive and interesting tactical move , the type of thing we 'd come to expect from Guardiola . <p> There has been little sign , however , of this in recent weeks . Pablo Zabaleta has played this role on occasion , and there was a brief spell when Fernandinho did the same on the right . The Brazilian seems the most suited to that position among City 's squad but is clearly required elsewhere . <p> Instead , Guardiola is now back with Clichy and Zabaleta or Sagna playing traditional old-school full-back roles . <p> Pep Guardiola Ian MacNicol/Getty Images <p> 3 . Ball-playing centre-backs <p> John Stones seemed Guardiola 's pet project : a young , intelligent , technically gifted centre-back who needed to be taught how to defend . This was perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Guardiola would mould him into a commanding centre-back in the same way he transformed Jerome Boateng . <p> But Stones has endured an underwhelming campaign , and his traditional defensive skills remain questionable . And while his possession play is occasionally impressive , he does make an extraordinary number of errors for a defender at a top club , not simply when attempting to play the ball out -- he also conceded a needless goal at Everton when trying to hack the ball into the stands . So far , it 's difficult to see a significant improvement . <p> Guardiola started the campaign often playing Aleksandar Kolarov as the left-sided centre-back , a peculiar decision considering the Serbian often seemed too attacking for a left-back role , never mind a centre-back role . Nevertheless , that was precisely what we expected when Guardiola touched down in Manchester . <p> But again , this experiment has largely been abandoned , and Guardiola has essentially returned to using traditional centre-backs like Nicolas Otamendi and Vincent Kompany -- in part due to Stones ' recent weeks . <p> 4 . Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty : Fernandinho , Kevin de Bruyne , David Silva , in a 4-3-3 formation . Fernandinho sat deep and sometimes dropped into the defence , while De Bruyne and Silva drove forward from deep . It was overwhelmingly technical and incredibly brave , using a mobile box-to-box midfielder in the holding role and two natural Nos. 10 as Nos. 8 . <p> On occasion it was simply tremendous . City travelled to Steaua Bucharest for their Champions League qualifier in August and demonstrated football from another planet : Silva and De Bruyne driving through midfield , swapping passes and racing forward to create chances . It was fast , technical , dynamic and unlike any other system you 'll see in Europe this year . <p> But among disappointing domestic results Guardiola has gradually lost faith with that system . He 's switched to 4-2-3-1 , sometimes using De Bruyne out wide and regularly played Fernandinho alongside Yaya Toure -- a player Guardiola had previously banished from the squad . Again , it seems like a regressive move , and while Ilkay Gundogan 's injury has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't derail an entire approach . <p> The result of all this is simple : City now look very different from the defence and midfield that played under Manuel Pellegrini last season . <p> On the opening day of this season , Guardiola uses Stones and Kolarov as ball-playing defenders , Sagna and Clichy drifting inside from full-back , and Fernandinho just behind De Bruyne and Silva . Pellegrini would n't have done any of these things . <p> Yet for the recent 0-0 draw with Manchester United , Guardiola used a simple four-man defence of Zabaleta , Kompany , Otamendi and Kolarov , all players who played those roles under Pellegrini . Similarly , the Fernandinho-Toure combination was Pellegrini 's first-choice formation . In goal , meanwhile , Bravo has returned to the starting XI but is n't playing anything like a sweeper-keeper anymore . <p> It 's not all disastrous . Silva is enjoying another sparkling campaign , Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane have been sporadically brilliant and should progress further , while Sergio Aguero has banged in the goals and Gabriel Jesus is a ready-made replacement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , City will collect more than last season . But , of course , the standard at the top of the Premier League has increased significantly overall . Intriguingly , City finished on 66 points last season , and champions Leicester collected 81 . As things stand , coincidentally , City are on 66 points and league leaders Chelsea are on 81 ; in other words , City are essentially the same distance behind the pacesetters . <p> But again , it 's not all about points ; it 's about style , and City do n't feel significantly different from the Pellegrini side of last season . Rather than City adapting to Guardiola 's new approach , Guardiola has adapted rather too much to City 's old approach . This might be a transition season , but it rather feels like the transition has happened in reverse .

@@19809238 <h> Otabil 's pricey , unbiblical menu of miracles Article <p> Wednesday , August 2 , 2017 12:50 pm <p> Pastor Mensa Otabil <p> All these years I had been sacrificing to honour my folks and love my neighbor , I wish someone had told me I could have taken a shortcut by lying , cheating and stealing to make $5,000 and pay for blessings . This is basically the sum of the argument of the folks fiercely defending what I have decided to call the Otabil debacle . To them and others who believe in the seed-faith doctrine , one can give and compel God to bless them . Easy right , except the Bible says something entirely different . <p> Anyway , If we 're honest , no one is truly shocked by the menu of miracles . We have seen some version of the blatant merchandizing of the work of the Holy Spirit in many churches across Ghana . Obinim and others have been selling the works of the Holy Spirit in the form of anointing olive oil and gallons of water on national television for years . The shameless exploitation of the people and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ghana . <p> The honest-to-God truth is , no one was really surprised by last week 's unveiling of a menu of dollar-priced miracles at the International Central Gospel Church 's Greater Works conference . The surprise is n't because the menu had weirdly named and arbitrarily priced miracles like " millionaire status , " which was pegged at $5000 , " seed of completion " for $520 and 24-hour miracles for $240 . <p> The amazement is because it occurred at the International Central Gospel Church , a church run by one of the nation 's most respected pastors . Pastor Mensa Otabil is a man who has built his brand and ministry by giving Ghanaian Christians practical tools to live godly lives . He does n't dabble in the " **26;0;TOOLONG -sickness " kind of theology . He is respectable and seemingly above what educated and worldly Ghanaians consider as the crassness of Obinim . No one was expecting to ever read that he , too , believed that one could buy " millionaire status " at $5000 or " seed of completion " at $540 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch it , a con . The menu suggests that God requires our sacrifices to bless us . The one thing that is distinctly clear in the Bible is that God does not require our sacrifices before granting us miracles . Okay , perhaps not that clear from the Old Testament where there were rules on how , who and when to give . But the Bible makes it abundantly clear in John 3:16 that " for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whosoever believes in him shall not perish , but have eternal life . " After Christ 's death , God stopped dealing with Christians based on the old covenant , also known as the Old Testament . We 're now living under the grace . <p> There is no argument about the salvation and the blessings therein for us , the Bible makes it clear that by accepting Jesus Christ as our lord and savior , he will bless us . And as the Apostle Paul noted in Ephesians 1:3 , God 's blessings are all-encompassing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ . " Ergo , financial , spiritual , health and material well-being are taken care of as believers . Romans 11:29 makes it clear " for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable . " <p> Contrary to the arguments being manufactured to defend this ginormous faux pas , and I 'm being generous here , there is no ethical , moral , spiritual and biblical justification for this tacky , expensive miracle menu . No Christian worth the blood of the lamb should be caught defending something so gross . Nowhere in the Bible is there proof that the Holy Spirit can be summoned and ordered to produce miracles at will . God will cease to be immutable if we , mere mortals , can compel him to produce a 24-hour miracle at $240 . If he is easy to bribe , what would be the essence in fearing his wrath ? <p> For the record , the problem here is n't the act of giving , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just to give , we 're mandated to give , but freely . The act of giving to support the ministry is a long-held practice in the Ghanaian community of churches . It is the contribution of church members that built schools , hospitals and orphanages and sustain pastors across the country . Ghanaian Christians have been supporting the church since the colonialists arrived with the Bible . Even unbelievers know it is good and worthy to give , how much more those of us saved by Jesus Christ . <p> The problem is the suggestion that one can buy financial and spiritual blessings at special rates in dollars . No amount of dollars can make you a millionaire if you do not get off your bed and work . Again , the Bible is definite on this : 2 Thessalonians 3:10 " For even when we were with you , this we commanded you : that if any would not work , neither should he eat . " It 's that simple . There is no evidence in the Bible of a correlation between one 's generosity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we did n't even pay to have Christ die for our sins , how much more simple things like financial and material wealth ( which by the way should n't be the focus of good Christians ) <p> If we 're to listen to those fervently defending ' Otabil mess , ' there is absolutely nothing wrong with the merchandising of miracles in church . The same thing that caused Jesus to sweep through the temple with a whip . But this is Ghana , where men of God are highly esteemed over the God they serve , some Christians have been straining to defend the mess . Suddenly , that which is wrong and evil when done by Obinim is suddenly defensible because Pastor Otabil is involved . Let me be clear , the Obinim comparison is only in the light of selling miracles , not the other crazy things . <p> The argument that " faith defies logic , " while true , does n't apply here because Jesus did n't charge per piece when he fed the five thousand with two loaves of bread and fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seed as by Jesus and the disciples was a metaphor for the word of God . While I love the notion that folks can do what they want with their money ( because that 's what feminists and gay rights advocates have been saying since the beginning of time about people 's sexuality ) , these pay-as-you go rates are just indefensible . <p> It is heartbreaking Pastor Mensa Otabil allowed this to happen on his platform and sought to justify it when the story broke . It is the sort of thing one expects callow and unread preachers to do , not someone in his position who cares about the implications of corruption on national development . Where does he think poor church members will be getting money to buy these miracles ? His actions justify that of the condemnable acts of preachers who do this regularly and teach young preachers that it is alright to sell the blessings of God . It also blatantly excludes the poor in the church , the very group Christ loved and cared for . Which makes it even sadder . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $5,000 is not the price of miracles ; it 's just the investment you make if you want to become a millionaire here on earth without any work . Seen through that lens , it 's not a bad investment . That if they can guarantee the returns .

Yes , I am talking about uncontrolled lending . It seems like the banks have lent relentlessly and this is causing them to accumulate a lot of Non-Performing Loans ( NPLs ) . <p> Loans are considered to be non-performing when they are equal to or greater than 90 days in arrears or where management believes a loss may be incurred . <p> Ghana is right now in a dire need to revive private investment . In face of such a crisis , when the country has GH ? 7.96 billion stressed assets at the end of end of June 2017 , things are definitely serious . <p> The ratio of NPLs to total gross loans ( NPL ratio ) experienced an increasing trend between 2007 and 2010 from 6.37 per cent to 18.08 per cent and declined to 11.27 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 and 21.2 percent in June 2017 . <p> Persistently high NPLs hold down credit growth and economic activity <p> High NPL ratios in Ghana have considerable and wide-ranging impacts ; for both banks and society at large . <p> For banks , NPLs tie up part of their capital base without providing a commensurate return , reducing profitability and increasing capital requirements ( NPLs have a ' risk weight ' of 150 percent under the Basel 3 Standardized Method ) . <p> For Ghanaian society , a banking system which is not firing on all cylinders , due to the drag of NPLs , does not have the capacity to drive net new lending ( in particular to SMEs ) . This constrains economic growth and disrupts the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism ( from the central bank to real-economy borrowers ) . <p> Accelerating the resolution of NPL in Ghana requires a comprehensive approach based on three key pillars : <p> Enhanced prudential oversight ( " touch love " ) . <p> Despite the Asset Quality Review launched in 2016 , little has been achieved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the assets still suffer from very high levels of bank debt . Similar to Viral Acharya ( Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank of India ) , I am proposing a " tough love " style approach towards the banks from now onwards . This is because this " tough love " measures will work towards the benefit of the banks but since the banks have been reckless towards lending in the past , such " tough love " measures will include the Bank of Ghana taking up the role of the parent that will put some additional regulations such as mandatory write off and time-bound restructuring targets on banks ' NPL portfolios . In addition , Bank of Ghana should enforce the following provision under the Specialised Deposit-Taking Institutions ( SDIs ) Act , 2016 ( Act 930 ) with no mercy : <p> Banks with NPLs above a set threshold ( for example , 10 percent ) should be subject to a more intensive oversight regime to ensure that they conservatively recognize and proactively address asset quality problems . <p> Bank of Ghana exercising its powers under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate information to credit bureaus and applying the penalty for the submission of inaccurate , incomplete , delayed and non-submitted information to credit bureaus . <p> Conservative application of accounting standards should be supplemented by micro- and macro prudential measures , such as time-bound targets for resolving delinquent assets and raising risk weights on impaired assets of a certain vintage ( above the current 150 percent , under the " standardized approach " adopted by all Banks in Ghana ) . <p> As permitted by section 78 ( 1 ) ( b ) l , the Bank of Ghana applying the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision publication 155- Principles for sound stress testing practices and supervision1 to require all Banks to perform stress testing as part of Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ( ICAAP ) at least on a quarterly basis and for those Banks that fails the stress testing , Bank of Ghana will then exercise the following rights under Act 930 with no mercy : <p> Exercise the right to require some Banks to maintain additional capital to address concentration of risks ( Banks with high NPLs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase to prescribe one or more capital buffers above that required by the minimum capital adequacy ratio for Banks with high NPLs .

Currently , Bank of Ghana guidelines2 stipulates that a collateral perfected should meet all these requirements : <p> Assuming the collateral is a legal mortgage , the collateral title has been obtained in accordance with the Land Title Registration Act 1986 ( PNDCL 152 ) .

Accordingly , authorities should consider to centralize Collateral registry with land tile and other registration so you have one spot for perfection of collateral . <p> c . Development of distressed debt markets by improving market infrastructure and , in some cases , using asset management companies ( AMCs ) to jump-start the market . <p> Despite the passage of Borrowers and Lenders Act , 2008 ( Act 773 ) 3 and the Credit Reporting Act , 2007 ( Act 726 ) which resulted in the establishment of credit reference bureaus and collateral registry , NPL continue to grow . <p> The stock of NPLs stood at GH ? 6.2 billion as at end-December 2016 , expanding at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent from GH ? 0.26 billion by end-December 2007 . By the end of June 2017 , the stock of NPLs in the banking industry had risen to GH ? 7.96 billion from GH ? 6.09 billion in June 2016 . The ratio of NPLs to total gross loans ( NPL ratio ) experienced an increasing trend between 2007 and 2010 from 6.37 per cent to 18.08 per cent and declined to 11.27 per cent in 2014 and thereafter increased to 17.70 per cent in 2016 and 21.2 percent in June 2017 . The NPL ratio reduction from 2011 to 2014 was due mainly to an upsurge in new loans disbursed ( i.e. increase in gross new loans ) and not because of a reduction in the stock of NPLs . <p> Although in Ghana , the Borrowers and Lender Act 2008 , Act 773 , allows banks and other financial institutions to takeover collateral used in securitizing loans without going through the rigors of court , several loopholes have seen debtors ' slow banks down in taking over properties or securities .

Most banks to my knowledge take the safest route via the courts ( section 33 ( a ) of Act 7734 ) <p> The private sector , being the largest recipient of outstanding credit balances also accounted for the greatest proportion of banks ' NPLs .

Alternatively , the second bank may simply have written off its non-performing assets more quickly than the first bank , in an attempt to display a healthier loan book to investors and ratings agencies . <p> In some countries , public-sector banks are more exposed to NPLs than Private-sector Banks because public-sector banks ' portfolios tend to lean toward infrastructure , real estate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As well , in these countries , private-sector banks are considered to be more vigilant and prudent in their credit appraisal , risk management and loan recovery practices . This trend is however not exhibited among Banks in Ghana since both private and public-sector Banks exhibit high NPL . Suffice to say the Bank with the highest NPL at the end of Q2 2017 was Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Limited , a private sector Bank . <p> What Are The Macro-Financial Implications Of High NPL ? <p> NPL and Bank Lending <p> NPLs influence bank lending through three interrelated key channels -- profitability , Capital , and funding . Bank profitability suffers because high NPLs require banks to increase provisions , which lowers net income , while NPLs carried on banks ' books do not usually generate income streams comparable to performing assets . NPLs , net of provisions , may also tie up substantial amounts of capital due to higher risk weights on impaired assets . Also a deteriorating balance sheet raises a bank 's funding costs because of lower expected revenue streams and , hence , heightened risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors result in a combination of higher lending rates , reduced lending volumes , and increased risk aversion . See below a graph of Private Sector Credit ( y-o-y ) Growth(%) obtained from Bank of Ghana monetary times series data section of its website ( https : **38;30;TOOLONG ... Banks that have weaker balance sheets tend to lend less . Data for Banks in Ghana from Bank of Ghana banking sector report confirm that banks with higher NPLs tend to be less profitable , have relatively weaker capital buffers , and face higher funding costs . They also tend to lend less . A growing amount of literature on the macro-financial effects of NPLs is pointing out a robust relationship between higher NPLs and weaker credit and GDP growth , with causality going both ways . Banks ' reduced lending capacity undermines the growth prospects of viable firms , and it is also likely to disproportionately affect SMEs that are more dependent on bank financing . This is of particular concern because SMEs account for significant shares of total output and employment <p> The impact of NPL on GDP growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that higher NPLs tend to reduce the credit-to-GDP ratio and GDP growth , while increasing unemployment . This is consistent with the data from Bank of Ghana Financial Stability Reports and Banking sector Reports and Ghana statistical service . <p> What are the obstacles to NPL resolution ? <p> a.Prudential supervision <p> Write-off practices- Banks are required to seek Bank of Ghana approval before writing off loans , this creates an incentive for Banks not to write off loans . <p> According to the IMF survey , collateral-related issues are a greater concern than capital buffers . While bank capital buffers are deemed a medium concern in about half the countries surveyed , collateral-related issues elicit either medium or high concern in most of them . These rankings partly reflect thin real estate markets ( as the most common type of collateral is real estate ) and difficulties in estimating collateral recovery values given weak debt enforcement frameworks . With only a few exceptions , collateral valuations are reportedly based on market prices , although in many countries , deep and liquid markets for foreclosed properties are lacking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed countries have some concerns about banks ' capacity for NPL management , even though most banks tend to have dedicated NPL resolution units . <p> b . Legal Obstacles <p> Although in Ghana , the Borrowers and Lender Act 2008 , Act 773 , allows banks and other financial institutions to takeover collateral used in securitizing loans without going through the rigors of court , several loopholes have seen debtors ' slow banks down in taking over properties or securities . <p> The efficiency of the institutional framework ( particularly judicial systems ) matters as well . <p> c . No secondary market for distressed debts in Ghana <p> Developing a liquid market for NPLs is crucial to provide an outlet for banks to dispose of their distressed assets and to boost recovery values . <p> Information deficiencies or constraints on information sharing are fairly common . The general public is unable to conduct searches in public asset registers ( in about one-third of surveyed countries ) and real estate transaction registers ( in about half of the sample ) . Also restrictions on sharing individual debtor 's information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus typically do not include certain types of information relevant for debt restructuring , that is , on tax payments and social security contributions ( about 80 percent of surveyed countries ) and payments to utility companies ( two-thirds of surveyed countries ) . Credit registers in more than half the sample do not have credit scoring for individuals , and about half do not produce credit scores for SMEs and larger companies . <p> e . Lack of debt counseling is another common problem <p> A comprehensive NPL Resolution strategy <p> International experience prior to the global financial crisis as well as recent European experience suggests that a comprehensive strategy is most effective in resolving NPLs ( Hagan and others 2003 ; Liu and Rosenberg 2013 ) . Such a strategy typically includes three crucial elements : <p> ( 1 ) Tightened supervisory policies , <p> ( 2 ) Insolvency reforms , and <p> ( 3 ) The development of a distressed debt market . <p> a.Supervisory policies <p> -- Pursue a conservative application of accounting standards for impaired asset In particular , a supervisory policy should be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having exhausted all legal means to collect the debt . Time-bound write-off requirements for uncollectible loans could also be considered within the confines of Act 930 . With regard to interest accrual practices , the adoption , for prudential purposes , of a nonaccrual principle for loans past a set delinquency threshold would be critical . <p> -- Ensure that banks apply a conservative approach to collateral valuation . While it is reasonable to take account of collateral in provisioning , a conservative approach should be adopted , reflecting various constraints in valuing , accessing , and disposing of collateral . In particular , the value of collateral should reflect changes in market conditions , the costs of sale , and delays in realizing proceeds etc . Furthermore , collateral should be periodically valued by reliable and independent third parties and subject to enhanced supervisory scrutiny . In the case of real estate , banks should obtain <p> sound appraisals of the current fair value of the collateral from qualified professionals . <p> Strengthen capital requirements to encourage asset disposal . Conservative application of accounting standards should be supplemented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for resolving delinquent assets and raising risk weights on impaired assets of a certain vintage ( above the current 150 percent , for instance , for banks reporting under the " standardized approach " ) . In some cases , the combination of realistic provisioning , conservative collateral valuation , and stronger valuation may reveal that certain banks are insolvent , in which case regulators should encourage these banks to exit the market . <p> Enhance prudential oversight- Banks with NPLs above a set threshold ( for example , 10 percent ) should be subject to a more intensive oversight regime to ensure that they conservatively recognize and proactively address asset quality problems . Prudential reporting requirements for NPL portfolios should be significantly enhanced through detailed submissions ( on a quarterly or more frequent basis ) . For banks with high NPLs , BoG could agree with banks on operational targets for NPL resolution and introduce standardized criteria for identifying nonviable firms for quick liquidation and viable ones for restructuring . <p> Require banks to develop internal NPL management capabilities . Banks should be encouraged to develop a comprehensive NPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPL resolution , such as ( 1 ) removing impaired loans from regular loan servicing and adopting specific tools for early arrears , ( 2 ) conducting risk scoring to set case prioritization , and ( 3 ) developing a customer charter to cater for hardship and sensitive cases , subject to clearly defined implementation targets . <p> Enhance disclosure . Extended Pillar III reporting of NPLs and granular disclosure by supervisory authorities of NPL portfolios and NPL management performance would increase market transparency and discipline . Disclosures could usefully include the accrual treatment for NPLs . <p> Insolvency and debt enforcement reforms5 <p> Strengthen incentives for viable but distressed debtors and creditors to participate in meaningful restructuring . The legal framework should consist of both legal tools designed to facilitate speedy in- and out-of-court solutions and an adequate institutional framework ( including courts and insolvency practitioners ) to support the consistent , efficient , and predictable implementation of the laws . More specially , authorities should : <p> Enable the rapid exit of nonviable firms and the rehabilitation of viable firms . The provisions of the Companies Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Official Liquidations ) Act , 1963 ( Act 180 ) , or any other enactment relating to corporate insolvency or liquidation should be enhanced to include : ( 1 ) expedient in-court approval of settlements negotiated out of court ; ( 2 ) post-commencement financing recognizing creditor priority to enable financing for the firm during restructuring ( 3 ) inclusive restructuring involving all creditors ( including secured and public creditors ) ( 4 ) pre-insolvency processes that enable restructuring before reaching nonviability ; ( 6 ) simplified and cost-effective insolvency processes for SMEs enabling a fresh start for entrepreneurs within a reasonable time period and ( 7 ) the facilitation of various restructuring tools , such as debt-equity swaps ( for example , through removing the requirement for shareholders to approve corporate changes ) <p> ii.Augment out-of-court frameworks with hybrid features . International practice suggests that out of- court debt restructuring generates more rapid and cost-effective results , especially if the restructuring occurs against the backdrop of strong insolvency procedures . Out-of-court frameworks that use hybrid and enhanced features , such as a stay on creditor actions , majority voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the best results . <p> iii . Strengthen debt enforcement and foreclosure processes . Enforcement and foreclosure processes should be simplified and streamlined ( for example , to clearly specify enforceable titles , limit appeals , set short preclusive deadlines ) to enable a swift process . Out-of-court enforcement and foreclosure should be considered where appropriate . <p> Improve the institutional framework . The judicial system should be strengthened by increasing the specialization of judges and establishing special benches for commercial or insolvency matters . The performance of professionals ( such as insolvency practitioners or bailiffs ) should be properly supervised and adequately monitored . The fee structure should incentivize the rapid return to the productive value of business assets and be performance based . <p> c . External NPL management and distressed debt markets <p> Foster the development of markets for distressed assets to facilitate the disposal of NPLs , recognizing market infrastructure as a crucial constraint Access to timely financial information on distressed borrowers , collateral valuations , and recent NPL sales are critical for the development of an active market for NPL restructuring . Facilitating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a banking license , would lower the cost of entry into this market and allow for greater specialization . Use of specialist NPL servicing and legal workout agencies , and more efficient collateral auctions would help raise recovery values <p> Asset management companies ( AMCs6 ) or other special-purpose vehicles could help kick-start a market for distressed debt . First , they bring economies of scale , which may help smaller banks in particular resolve problem loans . For example , centralizing impaired assets from several banks into an AMC may help reduce the fixed cost of asset resolution , increase the efficiency of asset recovery , and allow for a more efficient packaging of assets for sale to outside specialist investors . Second , and relatedly , AMCs are likely to enjoy greater bargaining power due to their size , especially when loans are scattered within the system , collateral is pledged to multiple creditors , and the size of debtors is large relative to that of banks . Third , they encourage specialization by enabling banks to focus on new lending while allowing the AMC to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor becomes increasingly important if NPLs are at systemically high levels and for smaller banks , which lack workout expertise and resources . Fourth , increased specialization can facilitate better valuation and credit discipline . The transfer of NPLs entails a separation of the loan administration away from their credit officers , which could foster a more objective assessment of credit quality . Finally , all these points together suggest that AMCs could be crucial to price discovery . Economies of scale , central bargaining power , and better valuation are likely to be key to solving the problem of collective inaction , thereby bridging the pricing gap in situations where no market exists , or the market is extremely illiquid . <p> AMCs could be private or public . Larger banks may be in a better position to establish their own private AMCs . However , for smaller banks or in cases of market failure due to significant structural constraints or where NPLs have reached systemically high levels , consideration could be given to a national-level AMC with public participation . In either case , AMCs should be ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as loan workouts in separate bank unit or bank-specific AMCs ) ; and ( 2 ) combined with strict supervisory policies , robust insolvency frameworks , and the removal of obstacles to NPL resolution as described in the previous sections . Good governance and transparency are crucial to the success of AMCs . In cases of public participation , it would be necessary to ensure that the AMC operates as an independent entity and has a clear mandate to maximize the recovery value of assets . For instance , an AMC should not be set up as a unit within a central bank or a subsidiary thereof . <p> d . Support measures <p> The three-pillared strategy described above should be underpinned by support measures that cut across pillars , such as improving access to information and reforming tax regimes . <p> -- Improve access to debtor information to enhance the effectiveness of NPL workouts . Credit bureaus should include full details of borrowers ' debts above a specific threshold , including arrears to utility companies or tax authorities . Asset registers that record real estate , vehicle , machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable wealth assessments . Authorities should also ensure that such repositories are centralized , electronic , accessible to private sector agents , and economical . Improved links between asset registers and credit bureaus across national borders are needed in some regions to fully capture wealth and debt abroad . <p> Deploy debt advisory services so debtors are well informed and confident to engage with creditors . Households should have access to free or subsidized budgeting and legal advice services to ensure they are aware of their options and are comfortable discussing them with creditors . These services should be complemented by coordinated public outreach campaigns including through availability of standard advice pamphlets at bank branches and creation of a citizens ' advice website dedicated to household debt management . Micro and small enterprises should have access to institutes of credit management to ensure sufficient understanding of debt and supply chain credit management . Implementation of such services for both households and small businesses would greatly benefit from the establishment of a qualification or profession for debt counselors . <p> Reform tax rules to encourage NPL resolution . The credit hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities should be modified as necessary to ensure that all creditors are broadly and equally incentivized to support debt restructuring as well as enforcement and liquidation options . Tax rules should be reviewed and amended in areas where creditors are discouraged from provisioning or writing off loans or from selling any underlying collateral . Tax rules that inhibit debtors from accepting debt restructuring or write-off deals should also be amended . <p> Conclusion <p> Reducing the level of impaired assets is essential for restoring the health of the banking sector and supporting credit growth in Ghana . High NPLs hold back credit supply by locking up capital that could be used to support fresh lending . And low write-off rates hinder necessary corporate restructuring and prolong the debt overhang , depressing credit demand . Given that impediments to NPL resolution are often interlinked , a comprehensive strategy is needed to address the NPL problem . Based on international experience , such a strategy should be based on three key pillars : ( 1 ) enhanced supervision , ( 2 ) insolvency reforms , and ( 3 ) the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@20504235 <h> Akufo-Addo 's corruption fight : Will the anchor hold ? <p> There 's a missing plank in President Nana Addo 's corruption fight . This plank is missing in both the NPP 's 2016 manifesto and the president 's anti-corruption rhetoric . It is an almost impossible task to run a clean government without addressing this issue . I 'm referring to the issue of campaign finance and the broader issue of political party funding . <p> It is no news that elected officials spend a fortune to get elected . A simple armchair analysis of the campaign activities of political candidates from constituency primaries to national elections and the expenditures that go with them confirm this . <p> Alban Babgin , MP for Nadowli-Kaleo said in an interview on Starr FM on Wednesday 21st June 2017 that , " To get into parliament now , depending on your constituency , you will not spend less than GH ? 1m . " <p> On August 5th 2016 , the Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) also reported that their research into the activities of political parties showed that " it costs political parties up to GH ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country just for one month during off peak election seasons ; in between elections ... During electioneering campaigns , it could cost as much as GH ? 800,000 a month for political parties to run their activities " . <p> If I spend GH ? 1m to get elected as MP , I will definitely find a way of covering that cost . Per the IEA 's findings , a political party will spend a total of GH ? 13,200,000 to run its operations . The question is : how do political parties and their candidates finance their operations ? How many politicians will spend private funds on elections without an intention to recover monies spent ? Chapter 12 of NPP 's 2016 manifesto is titled Governance , Corruption and Public Accountability and the party states that , " The NPP will fight corruption head-on through preventive , detective , corrective and punitive actions " . One of the best preventive actions against political corruption is regulating campaign finance . The president 's efforts at fighting corruption are commendable but not enough in the corruption fight if elected officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will definitely find a way to finance their operations and it always leads to corruption scandals . <p> Father of modern Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew wrote that , " Human ingenuity is infinite when translating power and discretion into personal gains " . I dare say that if the president does not initiate reform in the area of campaign finance , he 'll find himself in conflict with his party officials . Party officials and government appointees will find disingenuous ways of translating power into private gains . <p> Well , since I work as a ghostwriter and corporate trainer and not a politician , I thought I may not know any better . So I referred to one of my favorite books , Lee Kuan Yew 's " From Third World to First World " . So the gospel according to Lee Kuan Yew , chapter 12 ( titled Keeping the Government Clean ) , page 164 , paragraph 2 reads : " A precondition for an honest government is that candidates must not need large sums of money to get elected , or it must trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in Asia has been the high cost of elections . Having spent a lot to get elected , winners must recover their costs and also accumulate funds for the next election . The system is self-perpetuating " . <p> Soon we will be electing MMDCEs and national executives of the political parties and if the cost of elections remain high , the cycle of political corruption will continue . If there 're no reforms in campaign financing , the NPP government will be tainted with corruption scandals . Big money is the oil that makes the wheels of political parties and elected officials turn . <p> The time to talk about campaign finance reform is not 2019 or 2020 . Every forward looking elected official is currently in cost recovery mode and is thinking of accumulating funds for the next election . Civil society must also place campaign finance reform on the front burner . Ghana needs a new paradigm in campaign finance . Once again , there 's a lot of wisdom in the gospel according to Lee Kuan Yew , chapter 12 , page 165 , paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to win elections . As leader of the opposition , I persuaded Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock in 1959 to make voting compulsory and prohibit the practice of using cars to take voters to the polls . After winning power , we cleaned up triad ( secret society ) influence from politics . Our most formidable opponents , the communists , did not use money to win voters . Our own elections were small , well below the amount allowed by law . There was no need for the party to replenish its coffers after elections , and between elections there were no gifts for voters . We got them to vote for us again and again by providing jobs , building schools , hospitals , community centers , and most important of all , homes which they owned . These are substantial benefits that changed their lives and convinced them that their children 's future lay with the PAP . Opposition parties also did not need money . They defeated our candidates because the electorate wanted an opposition MP to pressure the government for more concessions " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frimpong Tenkorang , The writer is a ghostwriter and corporate trainer ( yaw.ftenkorang@gmail.com )

By the same token , if we do not win the fight against environmental hazards , especially the battle against the galamsey phenomenon , we will have no nation to speak of .

But it would certainly be remiss of me if I did not satisfy myself on the constitutional aspect , before I put it before the Ghanaian people .

The Black Star has a tryst with destiny . Let us work together to make it happen , " he said . <p> President Nana Akufo-Addo continued that he believed that the noblest chapters in the modern history of the Ghanaian people , so far , have been written by lawyers . <p> According to him , the writing was begun by Ghana 's first lawyer , " the immortal John Mensah Sarbah " , who , together with Joseph Casely-Hayford , another lawyer , and their other colleagues in the Aborigines Rights Protection Society ( ARPS ) , warded off " the greedy hands of British imperialism " , and kept control of the country 's lands . <p> This , he said , was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President noted further that one had only to reflect on the complicated land inheritance that the countries of Southern and Eastern Africa endured to acknowledge the importance of the ARPS ' contribution to the growth of Ghana . <p> Further chapters , the President indicated , were written by the likes of Thomas Hutton-Mills , Kobbina Sekyi , Kojo Thompson , Akilakpa Sawyerr , all lawyers , who maintained the momentum of nationalist agitation initiated by the ARPS . <p> In 1948 , when that agitation reached new , unprecedented heights , with the killings by the colonial police of the three ex-servicemen , Sergeant Adjetey , Corporal Attipoe , and Private Odartey Lamptey , President Akufo-Addo noted that of the six persons , " Big Six " , who were arrested and fixed with responsibility by the colonial power for that development , four of them -- Joseph Boakye Danquah , Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey , Ebenezer Ako-Adjei , Edward Akufo-Addo -- were lawyers . <p> " One , William Ofori-Atta , a decade later , subsequently became a lawyer ; and the sixth , Kwame Nkrumah , Osagyefo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law from becoming a lawyer . So , as you can see , the responsibility of lawyers for setting our country on the road to freedom and national independence was great , " he added . <p> Succeeding generations of lawyers , the President stressed , have remained committed to the goal of securing not only the independence of Ghana , but also the establishment of the body politic of the country on the foundation of respect for the rule of law , individual liberties and human rights , and the principles of democratic accountability , values whose promotion are at the core of the Bar Association 's historic mission . <p> " I refer here to the work of lawyers like Kuranchi Taylor , Akua Asabea , Joe Appiah , Victor Owusu , B.J. da Rocha , J.E . Jantuah , F.A . Jantuah , Johnny Hansen , Obed Asamoah , Ray Kakraba Quarshie , Anthony Mmieh and Obeng Manu Snr .

@@20677240 <h> Zidane must address Madrid 's sluggish start <p> There was a curious sense of inevitability as Real Betis ' Tony Sanabria steered a last-gasp diving header beyond Keylor Navas . <p> The Paraguayan 's 94th-minute finish becomes the latest winning goal ever scored by a visiting team at the Bernabeu , pipping Lionel Messi 's dramatic winner in El Clasico last season by two minutes . The goal did not come from an isolated attacking foray , but a precision-engineered 20-pass move that saw 10 players touch the ball in a 71-second spell of uninterrupted possession . <p> Real Betis displayed admirable organisation and tactical clarity in their 1-0 victory , while Madrid failed to lace their dominance with the incision necessary to break down a stodgy defence . On the way to the capital city , Betis manager Quique Setien passed the time on the train by playing chess against his goalkeeping coach Jon Pascua Ibarrola . It proved a fitting activity in the lead up to a match in which the 58-year-old had his opposite number checkmated and unable to conjure a goal for the first time in 74 matches . <p> " We had 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and in the end it the ball did not want to go in . " <p> Zidane 's point , while a simple one , carries some weight . It is often forgotten that in a low-scoring sport such as football , luck plays a significant part in determining results . Evenly split across their three home matches in La Liga , Madrid have an expected goals ( xG ) tally of around 9.5 , compared to 2.5 for their opponents . This is indicative that the poor run of form -- not since the 1995-96 season have Madrid failed to win any of their first three home matches -- is due to a combination of profligate finishing and good goalkeeping , rather than a systemic flaw in the team . <p> In short , Zidane should make subtle tweaks rather than drastic changes in order to add fluency and precision to Madrid 's play at the Bernabeu . <p> That said , the Frenchman should not be totally absolved of blame for the defeat to Betis . While the " it just was n't our day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liga defeat since 2011 to a team other than Barcelona or Atletico Madrid warrants deeper scrutiny . An absence of luck and questionable managerial decisions are not mutually exclusive , and thus the inclusion of Cristiano Ronaldo and the withdrawal of Luka Modric fall under the spotlight . <p> Zidane handed Ronaldo his first start of the season in La Liga following the conclusion of his five-match ban . The Portuguese protagonist did not benefit from a full preseason , as his holiday was extended following Portugal 's run to the semifinals of the Confederations Cup . Ronaldo 's display of petulance in the Spanish Super Cup then limited him to sporadic game time with Madrid in the opening weeks of the season . <p> The 32-year-old 's lack of sharpness was evident as he dashed around the Bernabeu wielding a banjo but unable to find the barn door . Just two of Ronaldo 's 12 shots were on target . <p> Given Madrid 's fine attacking performance in the victory over Real Sociedad , Ronaldo 's return to action seems both rushed and counter-intuitive . A place on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teammates and the fans a lift -- would have been a better option . <p> Guillermo Martinez/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images <p> Additionally , Zidane 's decision to withdraw Modric with 20 minutes remaining was misjudged . There was a certain symbolism to the image of 12 white shirts on the pitch for a brief spell , with Modric unaware that the fourth official 's board had displayed his number in red . <p> The Croatian flaunted his repertoire of intelligent passing and movement , and appeared the Madrid player most likely to pick the lock in the Betis defence . The introduction of Borja Mayoral in his place brought about confusion rather than invigoration . <p> " Zidane fixed the team as if it were a pizza , " scathed Orfeo Suarez in El Mundo . " He piled up strikers in the same way that you throw ingredients on the dough . " <p> Real Madrid now find themselves seven points behind La Liga pace-setters Barcelona .

Only once -- in 2002-03 -- have Madrid recovered from a seven-point deficit to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inauspicious start to the season should not be presented as a crisis . <p> " These days when people say you have to run , work , fight , compete , I ask my players to think , " explained Setien after the final whistle .

One has to drift back to the 1958-59 season and the Blackburn Rovers side of Ronnie Clayton and Bryan Douglas to find the last team to score five or more in three consecutive league games . That was almost 60 years ago . <p> Man City 's record scoring pace has overshadowed some stellar play on defence . <p> One might reasonably expect that such record will keep falling if this prodigiously talented squad can maintain its focus and fitness .

How it copes against opposition prepared to push forward in greater numbers will be tested more at Stamford Bridge next weekend , but the evidence of the Liverpool match suggests it can cope .

The tendency has continued in the early weeks of this season , with the thrashing of supposed title rivals Liverpool , a 6-0 triumph away to a hitherto unbeaten Watford side and a four-goal thrashing of Feyenoord on their own patch .

How many other stadium projects can say the same ? <p> Records continued to be broken . The roof on the cantilever of what 's now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was the largest in the world in 1995 . Old Trafford 's pitch is in a hollow and it was only with the construction of that giant stand that the roofline rose significantly above the surrounding skyline . The floodlights , which were dismantled in 1988 , were a much missed landmark . <p> The major stadium developments continued until the Glazers took control in 2005 . True , the family sanctioned the continuation of the quadrants to boost the capacity by 8,000 when they could have called a halt . They 've smartened up the executive facilities too -- because they had to wake them up from their musty 80s prime . There 's money in executive facilities so that made sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building in Greater Manchester which oozes power and evokes reverence , is starting to look neglected . Paint is peeling off the white iron girders of the stands built in 2000 . The cladding is a bit 90s .

Phillip Jackson 's bronze statue of Sir Matt Busby is framed by the huge glass curtain of the East stand . Facing it , the Holy Trinity of Best , Law and Charlton . The Ferguson statue and the Munich memorials add to the magic , but development should not have stopped a decade ago . <p> Old Trafford 's capacity is 75 , 643 and United have looked at plans to expand . <p> Old Trafford is still the biggest and remains much loved by the fans who fill it every week , but rival clubs are playing catch up . <p> United have looked at numerous options how to expand the stadium , but none have been given the go ahead . Only the Glazers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . <p> The natural development would be to continue the stadium to complete the bowl effect . Two new quadrants would add another 8,000 seats in the corners . That would mean 84,000 seats . Another tier on the main stand would add another 10,000 seats . A third tier to mirror the Ferguson stand would make the capacity 97,000 , though it 's trickier as there 's a rail line behind the stand and houses , too . It 's possible , though . It 's also expensive . <p> Only Barcelona 's Camp Nou ( which is being expanded to 105,000 ) would be bigger in Europe . Real Madrid , one of the three biggest clubs in the world with United and Barca , are also investing heavily in the Bernabeu . So why are n't United in Old Trafford ? <p> While matchday revenue used to provide the lion 's share of United 's entire revenue , its importance is diminishing . In 2006 , when the last major development opened , match day revenue accounted for 43 percent of United 's total revenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from broadcasting .

Ticket prices have stalled in the last five years , yet matchday revenue increased to ? 107m in a decade . <p> It 's still important and it 's crucial that United continue to invest in the stadium . Older generations are used to it being how it is , but when they opened the new Mercedes Benz stadium in Atlanta last month , the two host tenants felt they were in competition not with another stadium , but fans watching at home on 40 inch television . They had access to replays and wifi , so Atlanta boasts the seventh largest video screen in the world . The scoreboards at Old Trafford have no option to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight leg room and low roofs which cloak the stadium in grey and limit views may be , Old Trafford 's progress has always come because the club have been at the forefront of stadia development .

@@21003239 <h> N'Golo Kante 's recovery vital for Chelsea to keep pace in title hunt <p> The FC panel look ahead at Chelsea 's fixture list and examine the impact Alvaro Morata 's hamstring injury may have on the team . <p> The international break came at a good time for Chelsea after a gruelling September run of seven matches in 21 days , but it has n't offered much to lighten Antonio Conte 's mood as he stews on a comprehensive home defeat against Manchester City . <p> Alvaro Morata is still nursing the hamstring injury that forced him off after just 35 minutes at Stamford Bridge , though Chelsea are hopeful that initial suggestions of weeks rather than days on the sideline will prove a significant overestimate . <p> Even more worrying for Conte was the sight of N'Golo Kante limping off 35 minutes into France 's World Cup qualifier victory over Bulgaria on Saturday with a suspected hamstring injury of his own . Chelsea expect to have a better understanding of the severity of the problem by Wednesday . <p> Any prolonged absence would be a new experience for Kante . Since arriving at Leicester City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 of a possible 83 Premier League matches , missing two through suspension and two because of a minor thigh knock picked up in the final weeks of last season . <p> Only two players -- Cesar Azpilicueta and Thibaut Courtois -- have started more Premier League matches for Chelsea under Conte than Kante . More than an impressive testament to his durability , such remarkable numbers underline that Kante has been regarded as indispensable from the moment he set foot in England . <p> But how much would Chelsea miss him over a period of several weeks ? Well , while Eden Hazard is unquestionably the Blues ' most talented footballer and proven match winner , Kante stakes a compelling claim to be considered the most important player in Conte 's team . <p> Above all else , the Italian 's 3-4-3 system stands or falls on the ability of the two central midfielders to control both the space and the ball . <p> N'Golo Kante left France 's World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria with a muscle injury on Saturday . <p> It is well documented that Kante is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totals since 2015 are so far ahead of anyone else in the Premier League that they can seem like statistical glitches . Less appreciated , however , is how much he has improved with the ball at his feet since joining Chelsea . <p> Last season Kante managed to improve his pass completion from 81.6 percent to 88.8 percent while also completing 20 more passes on average per game . He has also become more incisive , averaging 1.4 key passes per Premier League game this season compared to 0.8 in 2016-17 and 0.6 at Leicester City in 2015-16 . In the Chelsea squad , only Cesc Fabregas ( an eye-popping 2.8 ) averages more . <p> " Last season I said many times that N'Golo could improve a lot with the ball , " Conte said last month . " He 's working very hard to improve this weakness . But I think now he 's a complete player -- he 's a top player with the ball , without the ball . He always knows when he has the ball what he has to do . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is paired with the more defensive-minded Tiemoue Bakayoko , whom Conte views as being in the early stages of a similar process . Without him , the alternatives are Fabregas , a special creative talent but a defensive liability , and deadline-day signing Danny Drinkwater , still working his way back to full fitness . <p> Bakayoko has already shown signs that he may be able to take on at least a significant chunk of the defensive load Kante regularly bears ; he has averaged 2.8 tackles per game in six Premier League appearances -- ranking him 11th among midfielders -- as well as 1.3 interceptions , despite the fact that he spent much of August and September well short of peak condition . <p> Perhaps that will be enough . Looking at the fixtures , there are certainly worse months for Kante to potentially miss than October . <p> Three of Chelsea 's next four Premier League opponents are in the bottom five of the table and while Roma home and away in the Champions League should provide a stiffer test , last month 's dramatic late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches slightly . <p> Further cause for optimism is the fact that last season the Blues won all three league games Kante missed ( Bournemouth and Middlesbrough at home and West Brom away ) . <p> Chelsea will be hoping that sitting out the next three weeks is Kante 's worst-case scenario -- not least because November begins with the visit of Jose Mourinho 's ominously impressive Manchester United to Stamford Bridge . <p> Already six points adrift of both United and City , Conte 's men can not afford to give any more ground to their principal title challengers .

@@21385239 <h> The Customs And Traditions Of The Sissalas And The Dagaabas In The Upper West Region <p> Many young people in Ghana today downplay the importance of their cultural heritage and hence their failure to learn the cultural norms and traditional practices of their various homes or localities inspite of the inevitable consequencies involved in breaking these cultural norms which do not even temper justice with mercy for ignorant offenders . <p> These young people shy away from the elders in their localities who are knowledgeable in traditional customs and capable of educating the younger ones about their culture so that they have a better understanding and fair knowledge of what their culture is about . This is because the youth perceive the aged in society as people with achaic minds and therfore often finds it difficult sitting in their midst to interact with them . <p> Therefore , young people rather prefer camping in groups to play games and discuss issues trending across the country and issues about themselves to sitting in the midst of elders to share in their wisdom . <p> Anyway , I would still encourage our traditional leaders who are the custodians of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them such that they can learn their culture for onward passage to future generations . <p> Cultural Similarities of the Sissala and the Dagaaba People <p> History has it that the Sissalas and Dagaabas are among the first settlers in the Upper West Region which makes the duo indisputably the dominant tribes in the region . These two tribes even though they have some tribal differences but they share some similarities in their way of life . <p> During traditional celebrations including funerals , both the Sissaala and the Dagaaba people wear the smock as their traditional garment as used by other tribes in the three regions of the north . Aside , the funeral celebrations of both tribes are characterized by the use of the xylophone in mourning the dead and singing of dirges in their respective languages in tune with the sound of the xylophone and also the brewing of pito for sale which has become a trade for women of these tribal extraction and a popular drink among the two tribes . <p> Marriage Customs of the Dagaabas PeopleAmong the culture of the Dagaaba people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dagarti man marries a new wife , some curses are invoked on the marriage and sacrifices made during the marriage ceremony in an attempt to keep the woman faithful to her husband . If in the course of the relationship , the woman breaches the vow by cheating on her husband , then the woman would have to be cleansed as it the custom of the Dagaabas that any wife who has cheated on her husband with another man can not enter her marital home unless she is purified . It is a taboo for a Dagarti man 's wife/Dagarti lady to have any sexual relationship with another man even if the man is a member of her husband 's family . The woman is declared as a ' spoiled woman ' until the necessary rituals are performed.Any man who touches the breast or kisses or caresses a Dagarti man 's wife in a sexual or romantic manner has rendered her unpure and therefore , she must be purified traditionally before she can cook or sleep with the husband otherwise the husband may die upon eating his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is also believed that if a woman indulges in the abominable act without confessing for fear of being divorced by her husband , she may die . <p> Also , a married woman who engages in a sexual affair with another man while away on a journey would have to confess and be purified on return before she can enter her marital home . <p> If a woman is distant from her husband and engages in adultery and stays away for so many years until her husband dies , the woman would have to confess for the rituals to be performed before she can step foot at her husband 's funeral or perform the widowhood rites , otherwise she may die . <p> However it is alleged that some wives who engage in adultery nowadays succeed in reverting the curses invoked during their marriage ceremonies to save their lives by taking what was used for her dowry to a traditional priest to revoke the curses.When this is done , it woman becomes free to have sexual contact with another man either than her husband but nothing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PeopleThe absence of invoking traditional curses during marriages in the Sissala culture leaves much to be desired as married women commit adultery without any fear of facing dire consequencies because there is no traditional practice to scare them from engaging in the act as it is in the case of the Dagaabas . <p> In the Sissala culture , a married woman may commit adultery and be free since there is no traditional law baring them from it unless the cheating wife is caught in the act by a family member of her husband . When this happens , the culprits are at worst , summoned before custodians of the land and fined . <p> Also , some married women who attend funerals in nearby villages by the permission of their husbands are sexually exploited by their supposed boyfriends who lure them into spending the night at the funeral grounds under their mosquito nets after inducing them through excessive drinking of alcohol and meat .

Widows who claim to be married to such little children are accused of snatching other people 's husbands and stiring marriages around . Some indigenes are of the view that widows who have the tendacy of giving birth should not be permitted to marry children but must compulsorily marry from amongst the adult younger brothers of their husband otherwise they should be granted the freedom to marry outside the family . <p> Customary fines by Dagaabas in Breach of their Marital Vows <p> When a Dagarti man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman may be asked to pay a fine , known locally as ' passani ' which may include ; a ram , goat or a cow and some amount of money depending on the status of the man whose wife is involved . <p> That notwithstanding , it is said that after the rituals are performed , the said woman becomes a legal wife to both her husband and the man she committed adultery with . <p> The Sissala Fines in breach of marital vowsIn a Sissala traditional home when a woman who commits adultery is caught in the act by the husband , he reports to the custodians of the land who would summon both parties involved in the abominable act before the elders . The culprits are then slapped with huge fines which may include ; a cow , goats , alochol among others to serve as deterrent to others .

My worry , Mr. President , for the Nana Akufo-Addo I have known over the years , is why this matter is being rushed through as though it were a matter which can not wait for the constitutional and legal processes connected with or related to the gruesome killing of the army officer to be exhausted before you decide on enacting the Major Mahama Trust Fund Bill into law . <p> Mr. President , you have shown by word and deed that Ghana is a constitutional democracy , ruled under laws in accordance with the rule of law and the due process of law . In view of the fact that the victim of the gruesome act turned out to be a commissioned officer of the Ghana Armed Forces one expected that in addition to the Constitutional processes and the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed Forces Act , 1962 ( Act 105 ) as revised would be complied within whatever actions the Government wanted to take in this matter . <p> Mr. President , the Executive , and Parliament of Ghana through its Defence and Interior Committee has a duty as representatives of the electorate of Ghana under the 1992 Constitution to investigate and disclose to the electorate of Ghana the circumstances under which a fellow citizen , in this case a member of the Ghana Armed Forces , found himself at the time and place he was killed . Why was the officer in that village at that time of the morning alone ? Was he on active duty or on a frolic of his own ? The answers to these questions will not excuse the lynching of any citizen whether a soldier or a civilian but for a member of the Ghana Armed Forces it is a condition precedent to further actions under Act 105 . <p> Mr. President , is it true that Major Mahama was repatriated from Lebanon on Ghanabatt 82 in 2015 for driving into what seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was consequently repatriated on the last chalk 4 ? Mr. President , this question is important for those who are questioning the lone mission he was on in the village at the time of his killing . The records are to the best of my knowledge at the IPO at Burma Camp and you as Commander-in-Chief should have been briefed by now . This is public knowledge in Burma Camp ! <p> Mr. President , on 30th May 2017 the Minister of Defence was reported by Joy FM to have promised Ghanaians a thorough investigation into the killing of the army officer which he described as weird . On 2nd June 2017 Class FM reported that the Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ) Lieutenant General Obed Akwa promised Ghanaians that : " ... investigations will be conducted into why Captain Maxwell Mahama , ... was jogging alone at the time he was attacked . " Mr. President , the CDS was reacting to very pertinent military issues raised by Major Osahene Boakye-Djan ( rtd ) . <p> Mr. President , you know that under the Armed Forces Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity have to be investigated and the people of Ghana are entitled to the results of that investigation . Ghanaians are not aware that this has been done . The Minister of Defence who promised an investigation has also not made available to the electorate any results of any investigations . What was his authority under Act 105 for presenting the Bill to Parliament under his signature as the Minister of Defence as though he was acting under the Armed Forces Act for and on behalf of the Ghana Armed forces ? <p> Mr. President , the Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Interior which has a constitutional duty to investigate this matter on behalf of the electorate has taken no such steps to the best of my knowledge to do so . Yet when four United States of America soldiers were killed in active service in Niger a few days ago Sen. John McCain , the chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee threatened to issue a subpoena to the Executive for more information . He was reported in the following terms : " the White House was not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would like the information his committee ' deserves and needs ' " . <p> Mr. President , in Ghana , Parliament on the contrary has rather presented you with a Bill to sign into law in which the Chairman of the Defence and Interior Committee and his Ranking member are to be trustees of the fund with financial benefits even before they could undertake their constitutional duties to the people of Ghana under the 1992 Constitution . Could this be an incentive to kill any parliamentary investigations ? <p> I have been away since 3rd November 2017 to my village where electricity and network is a scarce commodity that is why I am trying to get this appeal to you so belatedly through the media before the budget overtakes the pertinent issues I have raised herein tomorrow . <p> Mr. President , there is a tendency on the part of many politicians and political appointees to over please every sitting President in whatever he says .

@@21771231 <h> Why Mugabe is still walking as President of Zimbabwe <p> Zimbabwe 's ruling party ZANU-PF sacked President Robert Mugabe as party leader on Sunday , 19th November 2017 . Though this removal marks the accelerating collapse of the 93-year-old 's support and power base , Mugabe still has power and would hang on a little while more . <p> The military seized power late Tuesday night with reports of Mugabe being under house arrest . The army , however , have been at pains trying to give the impression of obeying the law . They have played down suggestions that their intervention amounted to a coup . <p> Major General Sibusiso Moyo said in a statement justifying the army 's actions on state TV in the early hours of Wednesday that " We wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover ... We are only targeting criminals around him ( Mugabe ) " . <p> During his first meeting on Thursday with the army Generals , President Mugabe is said to have bluntly refused to step aside and events on Saturday further this narrative . <p> Whiles sections of the media reported of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations between Mugabe and the army to plot the end of the president 's regime seems hoax , as Mugabe appeared at a University graduation same day . <p> This was followed by a press conference by President Mugabe on Sunday , a widely watched event which failed to result in the much-expected announcement of the President 's resignation . <p> Article 96 of Zimbabwe 's constitution provides that the president can resign by submitting a letter to the Speaker of Parliament who must publicly announce the resignation within 24 hours . Though this is the fastest , simplest and least risky way for Mugabe to leave power , he has further resisted this call to step down , a step he has maintained since the crisis began . The sticking point for this resistance is very important because the constitution says that in the event of a President 's resignation , he will be replaced by the Vice President . <p> Hitherto , the military 's preferred candidate to succeed Mugabe , Emmerson Mnangagwa , was removed as Vice President last week . The second Vice President -Phelekeza Mphoko- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated to President as the army would want to avoid him as such . <p> The army can not , therefore , ask Mugabe to resign unless they first persuade Mugabe to re-appoint Mnangagwa . <p> The impeachment route seems appropriate but would also not yield dividend at the moment , although a vast majority of elected ZANU-PF representatives , like the opposition , appear now in favour of removing Mugabe . Hitherto , the process could be slow and like the resignation route , it would currently result in Mphoko becoming Head of State . <p> The process entails , under Article 97 of Zimbabwean Constitution that National Assembly and the Senate proceedings to remove the president if both pass by simple majority votes against the Head of State in cases of " serious misconduct " , " failure to obey , uphold or defend ( the ) constitution " , " violation " of the constitution or " incapacity " . <p> Once the votes are passed , the two chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president . If the commission recommends impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses back it with two-thirds majorities . <p> Clearly , Mugabe is going nowhere anytime soon . The African Union and the Southern African Development Community have warned the army not to try to remove Mugabe by illegal means . The Generals appear to have heeded their warnings and have instead pushed for dialogue with Mugabe while putting pressure on him ( through the support for the mass protests against the embattled president ) .

As at July 2017 , only eight ( 8 ) of the thirty ( 30 ) States Parties to the Protocol had made the declaration recognizing the competence of the Court to receive cases from NGOs and individuals . The eight ( 8 ) States are ; Benin , Burkina Faso , C ? te d'Ivoire , Ghana , Mali , Malawi , Tanzania and Republic of Tunisia ( ACHPR , 2017 ) . <p> The African Charter on Human and People 's Rights was adopted on 27 June 1981 , and came into force on 21 October 1986 ( ACHPR , 2013 ) . <p> African Charter on Human and People 's Rights recognises the collective rights .

The " Commission " mandate is to promote human and people 's rights in Africa . It does this by gathering " documents , undertakes studies and research on African problems in the field of human and peoples ' rights , encourages national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples ' rights and make recommendations to Governments ( article 45 , 1 ) " ( United Nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Charter did not initially provide for a designated court on human and people 's rights .

The court has jurisdiction over cases concerning the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and People 's Rights . <p> But all said and done , the African system allows individuals to make applications of alleged violations to the " commission " . More importantly , the applicant does not have to be connected to the alleged violations ; a state party can also report another state party , unlike the European system ( United Nations , 2004 ) . <p> The downside though , is , unlike the European system , whereby individuals have direct access to the European Court of Human Rights , the individual complainants in African system have to go through the " Commission " .

More room for improvement . <p> Interestingly , the world society approach theorists observe that most states only join the human rights regime to acquire legitimacy , and thereby deflecting possible future criticisms ( Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui 2005 ) . <p> Thus , some experts suggest that the same factors that urge a state to comply with human rights treaties , the same factors would dissuade a state from committing ( Hathaway 2007 ) . By inference , a sizeable number of states join the human rights regime without the desire to comply with the treaty provisions . <p> Similarly , Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui ( 2005 ) building on the influential legal models by Chayes and Chayes ( 1995 ) , note three reasons that explain state compliance . To begin with , they stress that organisational power results in less costly compliance and more attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they observe that international treaties emanate from prolonged negotiations that represent the national interests of member states . Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui explicate that because states ratify treaties when their national interests are met , they are inclined to comply with the treaties they choose to join . <p> In a grand scheme of things , Human rights regimes require ratified countries to give in to the international community to interfere in their human rights practices towards their citizens . <p> The ratified countries , so to speak , would commit to human rights treaties not so much because of the costs and benefits in doing so , but as a result of genuine commitment to the principles of such a human rights treaty . <p> In the case of Woyome versus the Republic of Ghana , I am of the firm conviction that the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights lacks the jurisdiction to sit on the case as it is still pending in our apex court .

@@21928234 <h> Human Rights , Culture , And The Issue Of Homosexuality <p> Many a citizen went absolutely livid when His Excellency President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo , in an interview with Aljazeera , in response to a question concerning the illegality of homosexuality in Ghana , said these words : <p> " These are socio-cultural issues if you like . I do n't believe that in Ghana , so far , a sufficiently strong coalition has emerged which is having that impact on public opinion which is saying change it , let 's then have a new paradigm in Ghana . " <p> These words emanating from the lips of the president seemed to suggest that he was opening the door for the acceptability of homosexuality as part of the Ghanaian culture should " a strong coalition " make demands for it . Unsurprisingly , he got some stick for it and not necessarily wrongly so . I , however , pray that stones would not be hurled at me upon your reading of this article . <p> It is trite in any analysis of the social contract theory that in the Hobbesian ( Thomas Hobbes ) order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos to protect the rights of all citizens including MINORITIES . It is therefore a non-sequitur to say that a person 's human right is dependent on a majority vote . <p> John Locke , another great theorist postulates that government is formed with the task of protecting the life , liberty and property of individuals . For him , a person 's body is his first property . This means that how that person chooses to use his body for any act should not warrant an attack from another insofar as the one using his body to engage in certain acts does not infringe upon the rights of others while doing so . <p> An example in this regard is the woman 's right to protect herself from being raped . Notice that in this case , although a man possesses a right to copulate with the woman , he does not have a right to do it if it goes against the woman 's right to consent which is tied to the right over her body , her primary property . It must be said that a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a majority of the citizenry think . Neither is an unmarried man 's right to engage in consensual sex with a married woman based on what more than 50% of the people think . <p> To the latter point , many Ghanaians would state emphatically that adultery is a sin . Nevertheless , they hasten to add that it is not a crime because there is a recognition that two adult individuals who engaged in consensual sex albeit outside culture or religious boundaries have a right to use their bodies as they please . <p> The $64,000 question is whether or not homosexuality is a right . The answer , based on the above analysis is in the affirmative . I say so because if a person has the right to use his body as he pleases , it follows that he can have consensual sex with whoever he chooses . It is for this reason that I part ways with our president when he intimates that a powerful coalition of groups must precede the enjoyment of the rights of certain individuals . <p> In playing the card of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human right at the mercy of " socio-cultural " norms , a dangerous move that might even go against the right to life . Think for a second about a society that believes in cannibalism . Should individuals lose their right to life just because society , or religion says so ? <p> Let 's have a quick look at the law that bars homosexuality in Ghana . Section 104 ( 1b ) of the Criminal Offenses Act , 1960 says as follows : <p> " A person who has unnatural carnal knowledge ... of another person of not less than sixteen years of age with the consent of that other person commits a misdemeanor . " <p> The main question that arises from this is what is unnatural carnal knowledge ? The answer lies in Section 104 ( 2 ) of the same act which explains it to be : <p> " ... sexual intercourse with a person in an unnatural manner or with an animal . " <p> Now , the idea of criminalizing unnatural carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse is problematic since the said acts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement because in speaking of unnatural sexual activity , oral sex and anal sex are mentioned ( God did n't create those organs for that purpose ) . Can we then say that a married man who has consensual oral and or anal sex with his wife should be arrested and prosecuted given the fact that Section 246 ( 4 ) of the Criminal and other Offences ( Procedure ) Act , 1960 says that a person convicted of a misdemeanor is liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years ? <p> Or is it a matter of the people involved and not the act because if it is the former then that is tantamount to discriminating against persons based on who they are and not what they do . If it is limited to anal sex as many claim , then does that mean lesbians are exempted ? And wo n't that even be a discrimination against gender and not just sexual orientation ? <p> As a matter of fact , many Ghanaians do n't realize that it is quite legal to advertise unnatural carnal knowledge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to think about this . What at all is natural about using condoms during sexual intercourse ? Unless an artificial barrier is now seen as natural , I am at a loss as to why people accept the commercials of condoms on our screens but think homosexuality is more unnatural . ( as if such a distinction even exist in the law ) <p> Most certainly , the president who is an eminent lawyer by all standards knows that parliament who represent the people have the power to make , amend or repeal laws regarding sexuality and that it is only " a strong coalition " that will make it happen . It was a clever way of attaining political correctness although it might have backfired amongst those who are not conversant with such matters . <p> Nonetheless , imagine what will happen if parliament , based on the wishes of the majority , decided to castrate all the men of a particular tribe . In the same vein , we should ask ourselves why we fight against female circumcision in the name of human rights when some say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recognize that the young girl 's body is not subject to what the majority of her kinsmen say . It is therefore an issue of double standards when homosexuality is raised . Strangely enough , people seem to forget that a " a strong coalition " of Hutus thought it was right to exterminate half a million Tutsis . Now why is that wrong ? <p> Having dealt with all the aforementioned points regarding human rights , I want to emphasize the fact that culture is necessary in ensuring stability of a country and that is where the issue of marriage comes in . Marriage , unlike sex , is not an inalienable right but a privilege granted by the state . Indeed , this is when the individual is said to be subordinate to the collective culture . <p> In speaking about marriage , parliament can resolve to legalize homosexual marriage based on the desires of the people as was done in the United Kingdom or the people can directly decide for themselves in a referendum in the case of the Republic of Ireland . Personally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by virtue of the fact that by giving gay couples the right to adopt children , we stand a risk of negatively affecting the upbringing of children .

The first is a basic right while the other is subject to culture . I hope this message in not misconstrued since I am a Christian , ( and a straight one for that matter ) who believes in the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ( GNT ) . He writes : <p> Surely you know that the wicked will not possess God 's Kingdom . Do not fool yourselves ; people who are immoral or who worship idols or are adulterers or homosexual perverts or who steal or are greedy or are drunkards or who slander others or are thieves -- none of these will possess God 's kingdom . <p> Significantly , all these groups are put in the same category of people on their way to damnation . But just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before God but not punishable by law , I see no reason why my belief in the fact that homosexuality is a grave sin should be the basis to deprive someone of this right especially when he may not subscribe to my religion and is not bound by it . <p> Interestingly , Paul in Verse 12 of the same chapter ( NIV ) says the following : <p> " I have the right to do anything , " you say -- but not everything is beneficial . " I have the right to do anything " -- but I will not be mastered by anything . <p> Indeed , I like Paul posit that not all rights are right but they are rights all the same . I belief that homosexuality does not enure to the benefit of the gay person but I ca n't force his or her actions . It 's just like forcing a smoker who is fully aware that smoking kills to stop buying cigarettes . It 's his body ! <p> This might come as a surprise to many , but this argument actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask is this , " When the faithful are in the minority and are being persecuted for their beliefs in a culture that sees religion as the opiate of the masses , would the religious then say that a majority vote determines their freedom of religion ?

@@21991234 <h> What Black People Get Wrong About Slavery <p> I am no historian , but I find the notion that white people ought to bear the brunt of history , with regards to the transatlantic slave trade , very hypocritical , absolutely disingenuous and frankly laughable ! Let me explain . <p> The slave trade was exactly what its name implied : COMMERCE . Any commerce has two critical agents : buyers and sellers , and the last time I checked , white folk did not play this dual role in Africa ; they were n't moving from village to village to capture slaves themselves . Slavery was not a black or white affair ; it was a black AND white affair ! Black Africans , acting as merchants , and profiting massively from the trade , were an essential component in perpetuating the cycle . <p> For some clarity , slavery was a feature of African society prior to the coming of the Europeans . There is some evidence that suggests that some African cultures treated their slaves better than the Europeans , but even within those societies , the fate of a slave was n't always rosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of thousands of slaves to celebrate the death of prominent people . Slaves who looked exactly like them . But did the people at the time find such practices reprehensible ? Not really . For you see , we have the hindsight of knowledge and our collective consciousness has fundamentally changed . <p> When the British Parliament abolished slavery in 1833 , African kings and merchants were on record to have petitioned the Queen of England , through her subjects , to revert the Act : so they could continue selling their own people ! Many of these black merchants continued the trade , albeit illegally , years after its abolition . Do white people need to feel remorse for the sins of their ancestors ? Definitely ! But so do we ! <p> There seem to be some inherent hatred that black people harbor towards one another , irrespective of where we find ourselves in the world ; be it in the America 's , Europe , Asia or Africa . It seems the only time we embrace our identity and the spirit of togetherness is when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in blaming others for our predicament , we have largely been responsible for much of our fate , throughout history . In the words of William Shakespeare , " The fault is not in our stars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings " . Do n't you think we should learn to love ourselves first , if we expect respect from others ? As Martin Luther King Jr . puts it , " We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools " <p> Reactions to the reported modern slave market in Libya , right here on African soil , adequately portrays my sentiments . The typical " politically correct " reaction goes like this , " Arabs are very mean and racist towards black people . They deserve our collective indignation and detestation " . Without equivocation , what 's happening in Libya is a barbaric activity that belongs only in medieval times . It deserves unconditional condemnation by anyone who considers themselves human . <p> However , blaming Arabs solely for the practice , without understanding the deeper causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transatlantic slave trade , the real ' slavers ' are greedy black African leaders whose corruption and lack of empathy towards their fellow citizens , pushes our youth to make such dangerous journeys . Therefore , blaming only Arabs is like shooting a fellow black person in the morning and attending a Black Lives Matter rally in the evening . <p> Today , the remnants of the transatlantic slave trade still exist in our political and economic structure , a structure which transfers billions of dollars of our wealth to foreign lands annually . The thousands of young Africans who perish each year , trying to cross the Mediterranean to seek greener pastures in Europe ( this time not in chains ) , is a direct result of the neo-slavery perpetuated by the same African elite , who are reminiscent of the merchants of yore . <p> It 's been more than two centuries since the transatlantic slave trade was abolished . Is n't it time we confine it to the history books and tackle the menace of neo-slavery , as a means of enhancing socio-economic development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who rose from the ashes of World War II , broken , humiliated and in despair , to build one of the most advanced societies the world has ever seen . <p> Or take the Chinese , just a couple of years ago they were n't regarded this highly by the West . But today , the streets of Europe are teeming with Chinese tourists , who inject billions of dollars into Europe 's economy . It 's difficult to disrespect a people when you need their money , no matter how yellow , green or white you are . The same can not be said of those whose governments are jumping from country to country in search of aid , whilst at the same time stashing millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts ! Money 's stolen from the very people they are elected to represent ! Respect , like freedom , is never given . It must be ' taken ' . It must be earned ! <p> Take the United States for instance : it took over a century after the signing of the emancipation proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegitimized , and for black Americans to be granted the vote . Today , more than 50 years since Dr. King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to declare his dream to the world , black Americans still face discrimination on many fronts . Clearly , there 's a critical missing piece in " the fight " , and methinks that this critical piece is the absence of love and empathy within black communities around the world . The problem is not with the colour people ! It 's with what the colour represents , what it is associated with , and it remains our ultimate responsibility to change the perception of what it means to be black . <p> Kwadwo Agyapong AntwiThe writer blogs on economic , social and political issues at **32;115;TOOLONG .

@@22119235 <h> Has Wilshere convinced Wenger he should start against Southampton ? <p> Jack Wilshere reflects on breaking his goal drought with Arsenal and how he can build off of it for the rest of the season . With the likes of Giroud , Walcott and Wilshere fighting for spots in Arsenal 's lineup , Arsene Wenger lauds his squad players ' spirits . <p> Arsenal could barely have wished for an easier Europa League campaign . Qualified with two games to spare , top of the group with one in hand and finishing things off in considerable style thanks to a 6-0 drubbing of BATE Borisov on Thursday night . All conducted with the minimum of fuss and without recourse to Arsene Wenger 's biggest names . <p> The only problem is that it may have been too easy . <p> As an exercise in giving first-team football to young talents and fringe players , it has been an unparalleled success . Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott have boosted their goal tallies , Ainsley Maitland-Niles is getting exposure and invaluable experience and Jack Wilshere has charted his return to form with a series of impressive performances , culminating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A first goal in two-and-a-half years certainly helped and Wenger was delighted with his performance , speaking of " the most mature Wilshere I have seen , in the game and outside the game . " <p> The manager then added , somewhat intriguingly , " You will see more of him ... He will get games , he will get the opportunity to show that Jack Wilshere is back . " <p> But was the man-of-the-match performance enough of a prod for Wenger ? The opposition were an abject mess , after all . It 's the nature of the Europa League , but the standard of football in Arsenal 's group was a few levels below the Premier League . It is hard to make a truly convincing case . <p> Granit Xhaka has been struggling but , ahead of the weekend trip to Southampton , is dominating BATE the kind of supporting evidence that will be enough for Wilshere to unseat him , or get a spot further forward ? <p> Wenger switched to a back four on Thursday , having ditched 3-4-3 after Shkodran Mustafi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Manchester United . If the 4-2-3-1 remains intact it allows for an extra body in the final third and that could be Wilshere , possibly as a No. 10 with Mesut Ozil pushing wide . But it would be a big move to abandon a now well-established formation . <p> Arsene Wenger could make personnel and formation changes after seeing so many players in good form against BATE . <p> Ultimately , you suspect Wenger will stick to what he knows . After all , the identity of Arsenal 's other best player against BATE suggests that Europa League excellence may not translate to Premier League competence . <p> Theo Walcott also impressed . He scored , claimed an assist , won a penalty , forced an own goal and had a shot cleared off the line . It represented more impact than he has made all season in the league . Unfortunately he is a doubt against his former side with a " little tight calf " but , even if Wenger sounded optimistic he would be available , would he be in genuine contention ? You suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option sidelined -- Santi Cazorla can not figure in any realistic plans at the moment -- Arsenal are in rude health . The benefits of having an entire second team for midweek cup commitments are clear : Wenger 's men are about as fresh as you can be at this stage of the year . <p> Trips to Southampton have been volatile affairs of late . Last season , Arsenal won 2-0 in the Premier League in May and 5-0 in the FA Cup in January . That saw the pendulum swing back after a particularly devastating 4-0 defeat on Boxing Day 2015 , which exposed Arsenal as title lightweights . Indeed , there have not been fewer than two goals in this fixture since 2003 . <p> Southampton 's season has been a bit of a struggle with only four wins in 15 matches but they have improved recently : A 4-1 home win over Everton on Nov. 26 was followed by a defeat at Manchester City that was only confirmed in injury time . Last weekend , they got a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth . <p> Even allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of a fixture in which you might try something different . Whether that be in terms of rewarding personnel for improved form or returning to a former tactical orthodoxy . <p> The trouble is , even battering BATE might not be enough to convince Wenger that he needs to change Plan A. <p> Tom is one of ESPN FC 's Arsenal bloggers .

@@22346235 <h> President queries Trade Minister over charges at Expatriate Awards <p> Controversy is brewing over the alleged payment of substantial amounts of money by expatriates interested in sitting close to the President at an awards ceremony organised jointly by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Millennium Excellence Foundation ( MEF ) in Accra early this month . <p> While the ministry and the foundation have responded to the allegations , President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , apparently unhappy with the turn of events , has asked the Minister of Trade and Industry to explain the circumstances that led the ministry to allegedly demand various sums of money from the expatriate business community who took part in the awards ceremony . <p> The query , dated December 20 , 2017 , issued through the Chief of Staff , Ms Akosua Frema Osei-Opare , and addressed to Mr Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen , read : " The attention of the President of the Republic has been drawn to an allegation that during the just-ended Ghana Expatriates Business Awards ( GEBA ) ceremony held on Friday , December 8 , 2017 at the Movenpick Hotel in Accra , expatriate business owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . " <p> " This Office urgently requires a response , with documentary evidence , to the said allegation , taking note that the Presidency was not consulted with regard to the said alleged arrangement , " it continued . <p> The query , a copy of which is available to the Daily Graphic , directed the minister to respond by 5 p.m. yesterday , December 20 , 2017 . <p> Information available to the Daily Graphic indicates that the President is livid over the issue and is demanding immediate answers . <p> The Communications Director at the Presidency , Mr Eugene Arhin , confirmed the issuance of the query to the Daily Graphic in Accra yesterday . <p> Mr Kyerematen , according to our sources , has responded to the President 's query but the details are yet to be made public . <p> Allegations <p> Media reports alleged that the Ministry of Trade and Industry provided account details to collect dollar-denominated cheques ranging between US$25,000 and US$100,000 from expatriates interested in sitting close to the President at the awards ceremony . <p> The ministry is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organiser , the MEF , in order to assure the sponsors of the credibility of the event , but the extent of the ministry 's involvement has sparked controversy over whether the Presidency is being used for profiteering . <p> Last Monday , the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for North Tongu , Mr Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa , alleged the extortion of between $25,000 and $100,000 from expatriate businesses to determine how close to the President they sat at the awards ceremony for expatriate businesses . <p> Ministry of Trade and Industry <p> But , in a statement issued in Accra yesterday , the ministry described the allegation as baseless . <p> " The Ministry of Trade and Industry has learnt with disdain the baseless allegations flying in the media ( including social media platforms ) that the ministry charged expatriates between 25,000 and 100,000 dollars to offer them seats close to the President at the recently held GEBA , " it said . <p> It said the GEBA was " the brainchild of the Millennium Excellence Foundation , an entity noted for its prowess and credibility in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Accra Marathon " . <p> It added that " upon the conception of the novel idea , the foundation informed the government , through the Presidency , and further sought partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Industry in the organisation of the first-ever awards event targeted at recognising and rewarding the contributions of the expatriate and naturalised expatriate community to the socioeconomic advancement of the country over the decades . For the avoidance of doubt , this is the first of its kind in Africa " . <p> It said as a government that believed in the private sector as the engine of growth , the government , through the Ministry of Trade and Industry , welcomed the initiative to collaborate with the foundation to see to the birthing of the initiative . <p> MoU <p> According to the statement , the ministry consequently signed a memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) with the foundation , which spelt out the roles of both parties . <p> " Resource mobilisation to ensure that the event was organised at no cost to the taxpayer was the sole responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organiser , the foundation came up with a sponsorship programme , as would be done by any serious-minded events organiser , which included a series of fund-raising dinners and sponsorship packages , " it noted among other issues , and said the awards were credible , adding : " Non-mischievous minds with a basic knowledge of event organisation will know that , as is the case with all fund-raising activities , there are different sponsorship categories and packages with their attendant benefits . " <p> It said it was " very worrying for people who were expected to know better ( especially if some happen to be leading members of the august House of Parliament ) to conveniently join the street wagon in pursuit of petty partisan parochial interests to churn out deliberate falsehood to perpetuate the fallacy that access to the President has to be secured with financial inducements " . <p> Millennium Excellence Foundation <p> For its part , the President of the MEF , Mr Ashim Morton , has denied assertions that some money was collected from expatriate businessmen and women to allow them to sit close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , December 8 . <p> At a press conference in Accra yesterday , Mr Morton said all the money collected was meant to support the organisation of the event but not to sell access to the President . <p> According to him , per an MoU signed between his outfit and the ministry , all the money paid towards the event was lodged in the account of the ministry . <p> " I want to state categorically that no money was paid by anyone to sit next to the President of the Republic of Ghana . Because of accountability , transparency and the terms of the MoU we had with the ministry , all inflows for the sponsorship of this project were lodged in the ministry 's account to be used for future events under the GEBA . <p> " Our Financial Department is currently reconciling with the ministry to determine how much money was finally raised .

We labelled the seats as red , yellow , green , black and presidential circles , as well as the President 's Gold Table . <p> " For the avoidance of doubt , the President 's Gold Table was reserved for persons carefully selected by the foundation and MOTI at our own discretion . Such persons could be expatriates who contributed enormously to our development and not necessarily whether they sponsored or would win a prize that day . <p> " I am here to officially inform the general public and our well-wishers that no one seated on the President 's Gold Table that evening paid $100,000 , " he concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the MEF , Mr Victor Gbeho , explained that the money collected was for fund-raising purposes . <p> Mr Gbeho , a former Ambassador of Ghana to the European Office of the United Nations in Geneva , said the foundation would no longer have a presidential table at its events , since it had learnt its lesson from the controversy over the fund-raiser which had attracted concerns from the Minority in Parliament and some civil society organisations . <p> " The MEF is a non-governmental organisation and I must state it clearly because some people are beginning to introduce politics into this issue and that is the last thing that we want to touch . <p> " The truth in the matter must come out because the figures charged were for fund- raising and sponsorship , but some of the companies have not even paid . I must explain that all our ceremonies are based on funds that we raise . <p> " We have no other source of money , except what we raise for each occasion , and in this case , we asked the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatriate business community , " he said . <p> The Awards <p> Twenty-four expatriate businesses were honoured at the maiden edition of the Ghana Expatriate Business Awards 2017 for their outstanding performance over the years . <p> The Chairman of Interplast , Mr Saied Fakhry , was crowned the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Expatriate of the Year . <p> Mr Fakhry , who is also the Chairman of Dream Reality and Inesfly , was decorated by President Akufo-Addo at the ceremony .
