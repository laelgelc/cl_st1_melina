Asohan November 16 , 2012 <p> Malaysia 's first full-length stereoscopic 3D animated film has hit local cinemas <p> How the vision finally became reality has lessons for all entrepreneurs <p> THE creative minds behind War of The Worlds : Goliath ( WoTW : Goliath ) are at the studio of the BFM business radio station , in between umpteen interviews they were facing in the media blitz leading up to the movie 's gala premiere in the weekend . <p> The news was in : Barack Obama had just been re-elected President of the United States . The two Americans -- director Joe Pearson and writer David Abramowitz -- join the entire BFM crew to listen to Obama 's victory speech . They have interviews scheduled with BFM and Digital News Asia ( DNA ) , but this was history in the making . <p> As the speech winds down , Pearson goes into another room for a video interview . The Malaysian producer of WoTW : Goliath , Leon Tan -- surely on his way to becoming a household name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments and schedules and what-not . <p> That leaves DNA alone with Abramowitz for a few minutes , and we get a quick lesson in Abramowitz 's Politics 101 -- about how he was disappointed with Obama , but extremely proud of the American people for re-electing him . <p> " The first time may have been a fluke , but having an African-American re-elected as President shows that the United States is truly a multi-cultural nation , " he says . <p> It was worth recounting this little episode because it shows Abramowitz has a fair degree of cynicism . And he has the Hollywood pedigree too , with a list of writing or producing credits covering 21 Jump Street , V , MacGyver , Cagney and Lacey , and Murder She Wrote . He was also behind the Highlander TV series and is a consultant for the Summit Features remake of the original Highlander movie . <p> But ask him about Tan , and he glows . " Leon is the very spirit of entrepreneurism -- you should have him bronzed and duplicated . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone like him could have done it , " he adds , quickly shifting gears to save him the blushes when Tan walks into the room . <p> How Tan did it is perhaps a lesson for all aspiring entrepreneurs , not just those in the creative content space . Indeed , hearing how this movie came to be made , and the challenges the filmmakers faced along the way , is a story no different from any other business venture : They had a vision , they had to get funding , the timing just came together , and they pivoted ... many times . <p> The tale <p> WoTW : Goliath , a Tripod Entertainment production , is a ' what-if ' sequel to H.G. Wells ' 1898 classic science fiction tale The War of the Worlds , set about 15 years after the first Martian invasion . <p> That first invasion failed because the Martians succumbed to our germs , but the remnants of their technology were left scattered all over the world . It was only natural that we humans would go poking our noses into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you have the Kaiser 's Germany , China , the British Empire , America , Japan , Tsarist Russia -- it 's a whole new geopolitical space but still locked within the history that we know , which is the eve of the First World War , " says Tan ( pic ) . " So you can put in Teddy Roosevelt , Nikola Tesla , the Red Baron -- all these cool characters . " <p> " We give Tesla his due . Take that , Thomas Edison . In our alternate history , Roosevelt does not run for a second term as president of the United States because he feels he has a higher calling as the Secretary of War ; the League of Nations is formed much earlier and they build a new international army , what we call ARES ( Allied Resistance Earth Squadrons ) . <p> " The key to ARES is only one thing : To defend the Earth from the second Martian invasion . And Tesla is picked to reverse engineer or re-engineer all that Martian technology . It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goliath follows the adventures of the five-man crew of Goliath , a mecha built on hybrid Earth-Martian technology , as they battle the second Martian invasion : Captain Eric Wells ( voiced by Peter Wingfield ) ; Lt Jennifer Carter ( Elizabeth Gracen ) ; Cpl Patrick O'Brien ( Adrian Paul ) ; Pvt Abraham Douglas ( Beau Billingslea ) and Lt Raja Iskandar Shah , a Bugis prince from Malaya played by none other than our own Tony Eusoff . <p> Why Wells , and why steampunk ? <p> " I 've been a lifelong animation and science fiction geek . Sure , I may have a business degree and have had a corporate career , but really , I love animation and science fiction , " says Tan . <p> " If you 're a science fiction fan , The War of the Worlds ; it 's like the Holy Grail ; it 's one of the many foundations of modern science fiction . It 's something that appealed to me at a deep level as a science fiction fan , and the opportunity to create a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Another part of The War of the Worlds is that it 's really a metaphor for colonization , and thanks to David and Joe 's treatment , this still resonates in Goliath . <p> " And we love steampunk , " he adds . " The War of the Worlds , as a story , has been around for more than a hundred years , and there 've been so many versions that have been made , many by people with a whole lot more resources than we had . <p> " We wanted to do something that would turn heads and get people to say , ' Wow , it 's The War of the Worlds , but I never thought about it like this . ' And steampunk , really , it 's post- the Industrial Revolution , and although 1914 is a bit further down the line , it sits very neatly within that space where electricity is a fairly new deal but you have whole cities running on this new energy source . " <p> " It 's a logical extension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds Abramowitz ( pic ) . <p> Pearson acknowledges that some genre fans on the Internet have complained that the technology in WoTW : Goliath is more dieselpunk than steampunk . " I 'm just thinking , ' Whatever , guys ' . " <p> " While I love Jules Verne and the whole gear-and-ratchet look , I wanted machines that really looked like murder machines that could go up against the Martians , " he says . " The super-zeppelins and the pumped-up triplanes -- there 's a certain aesthetic that perhaps is more reflective of a world closer to pre-World War II , but it makes sense in the context of a world that is post-Martian invasion . " <p> The story behind the tale <p> The corporate career that Tan refers to , almost as an aside , was no small matter either -- he was with the Usaha Tegas Group , as part of its corporate finance team , where he supported its investments , mergers and acquisitions and funding activities . <p> After that he joined Lycos Asia , an Internet media joint-venture between Terra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia and Philippines operations , and then led global business development based in Singapore and Shanghai . <p> He left in 1997 and together with New Zealander Mike Bloemendal ( who is also one of the producers of WoTW : Goliath ) founded Elemental Ventures Sdn Bhd and its sister company Imaginex Studios Sdn Bhd , which ran a network of creative audio production studios in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta . <p> It was at a time when the Multimedia Development Corporation ( MDeC ) , Malaysia 's ICT custodian , was trying hard to project Malaysia 's Multimedia Super Corridor ( MSC Malaysia now ) as a hub for creative industries . The Government 's venture capital arm Malaysia Venture Capital Management Bhd ( Mavcap ) became an early investor in Elemental Ventures . <p> The company was successful and the cash-flow strong enough to support Tan 's crazy ideas . Then came the fateful bus ride in Tokyo . <p> The idea of doing a ' what-if ' sequel to Wells ' 1898 classic was actually Pearson 's , who first laid out the premise and characters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years later , at a science fiction convention in Tokyo , he was on the bus back to the hotel , and the only other passenger was this Malaysian guy . <p> " It was his twinkling eyes and sparkling personality , " Pearson laughs . " No , we met , and we just hit it off . " He shared his vision , and Tan was on board . <p> " The timing was actually perfect -- Mavcap had been asking us what our plans were , and I said , ' Why do n't we do animation ? ' They said okay , " says Tan . " It actually started with let 's fund a project , but Mavcap went a step further and said let 's not just fund a project , let 's fund a whole new company . " <p> " This was beyond what I was thinking at the time , but we did it , and that 's how Tripod was born . In 2010 , we consolidated Tripod and Elemental to form the Tripod Group , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor buy-in and support is very important . <p> " Mavcap has been with us from the start ; in fact , they 've been very supportive of us every step of the way , " says Tan . " The understanding we had with Mavcap was , you give us the resources to send our maiden project into the wild , and we will look after everything else . The first project was going to be a very important one , and we decided on WoTW : Goliath . " <p> Mavcap 's role was an important one , says Tan . " They signed all the checks , " he laughs . " And second , they did not attach any veto rights to this . " <p> " They took the plunge , " he adds . " I 've always said it 's hardest to raise the first dollar , but the other nine dollars would not come quite as hard . With Mavcap , they kept coming in , and one investor spawned several others . MDeC came in with a training grant ; Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pemandu and Finas came in with a CG ( computer graphics ) fund . " <p> Pemandu is the Performance Management &amp; Delivery Unit ( Pemandu ) of the Prime Minister 's Department , which implements and oversees the Government 's various transformation programs ; while Finas is the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia , responsible for promoting , preserving and developing the film industry in the country . <p> Pearson adds , " Without Mavcap , this movie would n't have been made . " <p> " Our production time took twice as long , the scale went up , the length of the movie increased -- it 's usually very nerve-wracking for any investor , but they were on board with every big decision we made , " he says . <p> Pivots aplenty <p> And there were a few big decisions along the way . <p> " All of us were doing this for the first time , " says Tan . " We started making crazy decisions , like let 's do it in stereoscopic 3D ... sure , why not ? It was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the DVD market tanked , so we had to adapt . Let 's make it into a feature film ... sure , why not ? <p> " Do we have the money for this ? No , but we will raise it -- how hard can that be ? " he adds . " Perhaps a little naivet ? helps -- and a lot of tenacity . " <p> " I did n't get the memo , " Tan laughs . " At the same time , we assembled a team that was so driven to make this movie their best work to date . Like BaseCamp Films , which had been toying with stereoscopic 3D through various little projects and various ads and leaders -- they were so pumped up . " <p> " For our next project , we will try and make all the big decisions at the start , " he adds . <p> Challenges and plans afoot <p> For all the Malaysian funding and production , WoTW : Goliath is very much an international undertaking between Malaysia , the United States and Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In broad strokes , because I do n't want to go into much detail here , the biggest challenge for me was that remote management can be quite tricky , " says Tan . " You can also get lost in the minutiae , the details you have to look into , yet all the while you have to always see the big picture . " <p> " I always told the team that it 's not how you get into the situation that defines you , it 's how you get out of it , " he adds . <p> After four years in the making , there were early promising signs : It had a successful premiere at Comic-Con International in San Diego in July , and more importantly , was recognized as the Best 3D Animated Feature Film at the Los Angeles 3D Film Festival , beating out favorites such as Paranorman , Madagascar 3 and Tinker Bell : Secret of the Wings . <p> " I think that in terms of the segment of the North American audience we were targeting , we seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But going to the Sitges festival in Barcelona in October was an absolute test , because the audience at San Diego and Los Angeles was the audience that had been following us , so we were completing a promise to them , " he adds . " Going to Europe was total terror , we had no idea of how they were going to receive it there , and the reception was great . " <p> But the team is quite realistic about the mainstream US audience . <p> " This movie falls into a difficult place , simply because to open a movie in the United States is going to cost you US$25 million and above -- it 's just not possible to do , " says Abramowitz . " But through Video-on-Demand ( VoD ) , which seems to be what the future is , this falls into a nice niche as a genre film for people who like steampunk , anime and science fiction . " <p> " This will play in some cities perhaps , if the appropriate deals are done , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and in Europe . Then some distributor may take a look at it , " he says . <p> Pearson ( pic ) adds , " We 've had a lot of interest from distributors in the VoD and DVD markets , and we 'll get that . We knew all this , going in . " <p> And of course , there is the possibility of a sequel . <p> " We allude to this in the movie , " says Pearson , " While it ends very decisively , there are some loose ends . The battle was won but the war goes on . " <p> He says he has some " very bad plans " for one country , which would see a Martian hive being built around an iconic landmark . There is also the possibility of certain groups of humans making treaties with the invaders , and loose ends with the characters that need to be resolved . " I can see three movies , " he adds . <p> Tan adds , " Well , we have a story arc that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to change radically . " <p> " Let 's just say that while we hope to see a trilogy , a tent-pole kind of thing , there 's also potential for an expanded universe for further exploration using transmedia ( telling a single story across various digital media or platforms ) in particular , or other forms of media which will allows us to tell more intimate stories of people who may or may not be part of the movie , but are part of the universe . <p> " In fact , we explored that with the 10 comics we made with Heavy Metal magazine last year , all done by Malaysian artists , " he adds . " We had stories in Kyoto , St Petersburg and even had one in Port Swettenham ( now Port Klang ) . " <p> In that short story , the Martians destroy Port Swettenham , and the Tripod defenders realize that they ca n't fight them on the streets , so lure them into the mangrove swamps where they are made short work of . <p> Tan says Tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iOS and Android platforms and is working with Malaysian game house Appxplore to develop a game app as well . " We hope to roll that out in the first quarter of next year , " he adds . <p> Then there is merchandising as well . " In the last few weeks , I realized that there may be some immediate opportunities in developing merchandise regionally , not just for the international market , " says Tan . <p> " We have had no shortage of interest -- a publishing house in the United States is interested in further developing some of the stories we 've done , and a toy company out of the East Coast wants to explore some toy lines . " <p> But he remains optimistically realistic . " There are things we want to do , but certain things need to happen before we can do them . The movie has to be well received enough , including commercially , so that we can create other ancillary rights . " <p> Sounds impossible , but that 's right up Tan 's alley . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is more resonant with his first campaign : There is now a sense of hope for the Malaysian film industry , that " yes , we can . "

From now on , our half-yearly analysis will also look into how the players perform in the mobile Internet arena . -- Goh Thean Eu <p> MALAYSIA 'S third largest mobile operator DiGi.Com Bhd outshone its rivals in the first half of financial year 2014 ( 1H2014 ) . <p> The company , 49% owned by Norwegian telecommunications giant Telenor ASA , has gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of its rivals Maxis Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd . <p> Among the key indicators it has gained in are total revenue , prepaid and postpaid subscriber base , data revenue , and more . <p> Its performance has not been a ' one-hit wonder ' either . Although it experienced hiccups in some quarters , DiGi has managed to consistently grow its revenue over the past 11 years . <p> In 2003 , it reported revenue of RM1.71 billion , representing a market share of 16% . At the time , Maxis ( then known as Maxis Communications Bhd ) registered revenue of RM4.68 billion , and led the industry with a commanding 45% market share . Celcom , which had just become part of the Telekom Malaysia Bhd group , had revenue of RM3.87 billion . <p> RM1 = US$0.32 at current rates <p> Today however , DiGi 's annual revenue has exceeded RM6 billion and based on recent numbers , its market share has expanded to more than 29% . <p> " We think that DiGi will continue to gain revenue market share as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-end ( compared with 80% in 2013 ) , finally closing the gap with Maxis and Celcom , " CIMB Investment Bank analyst Kelvin Goh said in a recent report . <p> " This will not only allow it to drive higher data revenues but also put it in a position to gain new subscribers in areas where its network was previously not available . <p> " We expect DiGi to outperform its Malaysian telco peers in terms of revenue and earnings growth over the next three years , " he added . <p> During 1H2014 , each of the telcos managed to lead in different market segments .

He told the gathering of global business and political elites that China 's reform measures would exceed their expectations . <p> Mr. Xi 's circle of power is also expected to include Wang Qishan , who has run Mr. Xi 's anticorruption campaign and helped him sideline rivals . Mr. Wang is slated to be the nation 's next vice president with a prominent role in handling the relationship with the U.S. , The Wall Street Journal reported in January . <p> An important source of Mr. Liu 's power is his longtime connection to Mr. Xi . The two men have known each other since both attended Beijing 's Middle School 101 in the 1960s . Mr. Liu , known as " Uncle He " by many in the party , has been in Mr. Xi 's inner circle since late 2012 , often accompanying the leader on trips at home and abroad . <p> According to people with knowledge of the matter at the time , Mr. Liu was the " authoritative person " who took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy use of credit in driving China 's growth -- widely seen as a criticism by the Xi camp of Premier Li Keqiang 's stimulus policies . <p> Mr. Xi has relied on Mr. Liu in mapping economic policy -- though for most of the past four decades , it has been the premier who has managed the economy , with other duties divided among senior party figures . Mr. Xi reversed that collective leadership model and centralized decision-making within a number of small committees he heads , including over the economy . <p> Many former and current U.S. officials describe Mr. Liu as open-minded and thoughtful in his meetings with them over the years . <p> David Loevinger , the U.S. Treasury Department 's China coordinator during the first term of the Obama administration , recalls meeting with Mr. Liu often at the private Chang An Club , above a Beijing Porsche dealership . Unlike other senior Chinese officials , Mr. Loevinger said , Mr. Liu shunned a big entourage , usually bringing only one or two assistants , and was always prepared with binders filled with statistics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent a lot of time studying other countries ' experiences in deregulating and opening up , " said Mr. Loevinger , now managing director at U.S. fund manager TCW Group . <p> But Mr. Liu is n't Zhu Rongji , who as premier in the late 1990s and early 2000s made aggressive efforts to scale back the bloated state sector -- resulting in massive layoffs . Added to the urgency at the time were huge losses by state firms , an essentially insolvent banking system and Beijing 's desire to join the World Trade Organization . <p> This time , China 's economy is on a relatively solid footing despite high debt levels and industrial overcapacity . <p> A so-called " supply-side " reform designed by Mr. Liu to reduce industrial overcapacity helped lift prices for surviving state firms and led to a rebound in industrial profits and the overall economy last year . Detractors said the rebound was achieved mainly by the closures of private businesses . <p> In the past several years , Mr. Xi has made it clear the state sector 's role in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms have followed . Companies controlled by the government have piled on more debt to invest and expand . <p> When Mr. Xi was preparing to deliver his vision for China 's development at the October Communist Party conclave , Mr. Liu , seeing the need to inject more market discipline into state companies , proposed to tweak the goal of state-sector reform : " State capital " -- rather than " state companies " -- should become " stronger , better and bigger . " <p> It was a one-word change in a 30,000-word report , but a meaningful one , signaling that state firms , while key to the economy , must also improve their returns like any commercial entities . <p> The proposed change caused strong pushback from the guardians of the state interest , including the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission , according to the officials with knowledge of the process . But Mr. Liu prevailed . <p> In Mr. Xi 's October report , the new mission for state firms is " the most controversial " part , one of the officials said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Journal online , subscribe to StarBiz Premium Plus . <p> We 're sorry , this article is unavailable at the moment .

@@41635231 <h> MCA refutes allegations of profiteering from TAR UC <p> is scraping the bottom of the barrel by alleging that MCA has been profiteering from TAR UC via Delta Pride ( M ) Sdn Bhd , the company holding the 30 years Build Operate and Transfer ( BOT ) contract to build and manage student hostels for the TAR UC Kuala Lumpur campus . <p> He alleged that the company has been paying out director remuneration amounting to RM204,000 and that the company also has retained earnings of RM11.42mil for the year 2018 . And based on these facts , he surmised and deduced that this is the proof that the company is benefiting MCA financially . <p> Like the famous quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald , " There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind . " The following are the facts : <p> 1 . The proposal to build hostels was mooted by the Federation of Tunku Abdul Rahman College Alumni Associations Malaysia . As previously explained , MCA only came into the picture after the listed property company previously awarded the contract went into financial difficulties during the 1997 Asian Financial crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty bound to take over the concession , including the extended loans and build the hostels via Delta Pride . <p> 3 . The parent company then extended interest-free shareholder advances amounting to RM16mil to Delta Pride in 1998 to take over the project and to complete the construction of the hostels . <p> 4 . Delta Pride only managed to complete its repayments two years ago , back in 2016 - benefiting from a full 18 years of interest-free advancement . <p> 5 . If MCA were to put this <p> RM16mil into an interest-bearing account of just 4% per year instead , come 18 years , this RM16mil would have grown to whopping <p> RM32.4mil - RM16.4mil more ! Now , that is what one would call maximising one 's profit with minimal effort . <p> 6 . But instead , MCA took a rather more tortuous route to make a retained earnings with Delta Pride of <p> RM11.42mil which turned out to be much lower than interest earned by parking the RM16mil in a fixed deposit and do nothing but just twiddling ones thumbs . <p> Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostels is rather shallow . <p> The following are more facts for Chong and DAP to ponder on : <p> 1 . Delta Pride has never benefited one sen from government grants - either directly or indirectly . <p> 2 . Delta Pride has never declared a single sen of dividend to MCA since it started - preferring to keep all its retained earnings in the company . <p> 3 . The retained earnings of <p> RM11.42mil will be kept until the end of the concession period and will eventually be spent on remedial works before handing the campus ownership back to TAR UC - FREE OF CHARGE . <p> 4 . The directors ' remuneration of RM204,000 alluded by Chong are in actual fact directors ' allowances in the sum of RM3,000 per month . Please note that these directors are people of stature and altruistic enough to have volunteered to serve society by taking on the responsibility to oversee the management of these student hostels . <p> 5 . Many of these directors are also based out of state and it would be deemed appropriate if not decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover any travel expenses incurred when they attend any scheduled meetings . Furthermore , these selfless directors without a due to their own wellbeing , in the eyes of the law , will be held legally responsible should anything happen to the company . <p> 6 . The current hostel fees of RM215 per room is among the cheapest among all private and public universities and colleges despite the fact that the hostel is located in a densely populated prime area of Kuala Lumpur . In addition , this RM215 is for a fully furnished room inclusive of 24-hour security , electricity , water charges on top of other student amenities . <p> That sum equates to RM7.20 per day . Is that overly excessive ? <p> Perhaps DAP can assist in finding cheaper rates for something similar in Kuala Lumpur ? <p> 6 . Currently , the on-campus hostel provides safe and comfortable accommodation for 2,000 students every year and has benefited around 40,000 Malaysians since it started operation . <p> TAR UC itself has provided quality education to 210,000 Malaysians including several Cabinet Ministers and a Chief Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has not been a single allegation of mismanagement or financial controversy involving TAR UC or its hostels . <p> Instead , what has DAP done for our students ? <p> Chong should stop and take stock and not merely spew out such slander that MCA is profiteering from TAR UC or its hostels . <p> If MCA 's main objective was to score a quick profit , these 10 blocks of five-storey campus buildings would have been torn down to make way instead for 10 blocks of high-end luxury condominiums in the heart of Kuala Lumpur , listing it as the most exclusive premium real estate property owned by MCA . <p> But then again , what is MCA - we are definitely not as business savvy nor good with our numbers compared to DAP and most especially its honourable secretary-general cum our esteemed Minister of Finance of Malaysia . <p> Dr Pamela Yong <p> MCA central committee member <p> Member of the Board of Governors Tunku Abdul Rahman University College ( TAR UC ) <p> We 're sorry , this article is unavailable at the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Customer Service team at 1-300-88-7827 .

So when I translate all these individual qualities into illustrations , I find it really exciting to have observed what one possesses , and the other people do n't . <p> " If someone commissioned me to make a portrait , I 'll ask some additional questions about the person so that I could portray them in the illustration in a way to make it more personal and unique .

Number 13 also featured Drinkwater in the rear-view mirror for a simple pass to Sergio Aguero , who rifled in spectacularly from 20 yards to set himself on the way to a hat-trick . <p> Aguero 's part in this scintillating 6-1 spree saw him pass Thierry Henry as the Premier League 's top-scoring overseas player and Alan Shearer as the man with the largest collection of trebles ( 12 ) in the competition . <p> But there is no doubt De Bruyne is the beating heart of this City team , something that has become abundantly clear over recent weeks in the face of a new reality established by Jurgen Klopp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underplay Guardiola 's achievement in marching an intricate , high-end team to back-to-back Premier League titles , the past two seasons largely consisted of him sending out his favoured 4-3-3 formation and watching the marvellous Mancunian machine take flight . <p> Compromised by form and fitness problems for key players this time around , and with Liverpool disappearing over the horizon , the City manager has shuffled his pack into a range of tactical shapes over the past month . <p> A fluid 4-2-3-1 was rolled out for a 3-0 triumph at Arsenal in December -- the second victory in a run of 10 wins from 11 in all competitions , where City began a recent theme of doing decisive damage before half-time . <p> De Bruyne ran the show as a number 10 , scything a bouncing ball into the top corner with outstanding technique and curling home a more controlled effort either side of bursting through the right-hand side of the Gunners defence to set up Raheem Sterling . <p> There were similar antics the following weekend , from the right this time , as the Etihad Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jesus finish to a role in the supporting cast .

@@41664239 <h> Tug-of-war erupts over planned return of Jewish archives to Iraq <p> BAGHDAD/LONDON ( Reuters ) - Jewish books and documents found by U.S. soldiers in the flooded headquarters of ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and sent to the United States for restoration have touched off a dispute between Baghdad and Iraqi Jews who fled the country . <p> After a $3 million restoration , the collection has been put on display at the Washington-based National Archives . But bowing to demands from Iraq 's Shi'ite Muslim-led government , the United States says it will return the collection next summer . Some of the artefacts date to the 16th century . <p> A National Archives spokeswoman said the materials , whose removal from Baghdad was agreed in 2003 - when a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam and the country lurched into widespread sectarian turmoil - would be going back to Iraq and the decision was made by the U.S. State Department . <p> Members of Iraq 's Jewish community , many of whom fled the country in previous decades , say the materials were forcibly taken from them and should not be returned . <p> Edwin Shuker , 58 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1971 , said he had discovered his long-abandoned school certificate on display as part of the National Archives exhibition . <p> " This is more than a school certificate - it is the identity we were forced to leave behind , " he told Reuters , likening the document 's journey and survival to his own . <p> " I would like to be reassured that my children and future generations will have unrestricted access to this collection . " <p> Cynthia Kaplan Shamash , from the New York-based World Organisation of Jews from Iraq , said Iraqi Jews were grateful for the restoration but did not want the archive to go back . " Returning the collection to a Jewish-free Iraq in the current conditions is incomprehensible and unacceptable , " she said . <p> Shuker said : " It is not a sectarian issue . Nothing is safe , no shrine or holy place let alone a site where Jewish artefacts are stored . There is a complete breakdown in safety and security in Iraq now . " <p> Ali al-Moussawi , an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the United States were " in full swing " . <p> " They have agreed to hand over these documents to the Iraqi side and currently there is no problem , despite attempts by the Jewish community in America to obstruct this matter , " he said . <p> " The Iraqi government will not accept to give up any part of these documents . This is Iraqi legacy owned by all of the Iraqi people and belongs to all the generations , regardless of religious , ethnic or sectarian affiliations . " <p> MOBILISING SUPPORT <p> Iraqi Jews have mobilised support from members of the U.S. Congress to try to block the return . In a letter signed this month by nearly 50 U.S. lawmakers , Secretary of State John Kerry was urged to enable the return of the items " to their rightful owners or their descendents " instead . <p> " The government of Iraq has no legitimate claim to these artefacts , " the letter said . <p> Iraq 's Jewish community numbered around 150,000 in 1947 and has dwindled to just a handful today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500 years but anti-Jewish violence , fanned by Arab nationalism , started to sweep through the region in the early 1940s , gradually driving out most Jews . <p> Conditions deteriorated for Jews in many Arab countries after the establishment of Israel in 1948 and an Israeli-Arab war in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes . <p> The State Department has said it has made a commitment to return the archive . It has paid for Iraqi archivists to train in Washington to make sure that the pieces are preserved and protected , Brett McGurk , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iraq and Iran , told a hearing earlier this month . <p> U.S. authorities are expected to talk to the Iraqi ambassador in Washington about the possibility of longer-term loans in the United States to make sure that people can view the pieces , he added . <p> " We have heard very loudly and clearly the concerns from the community , We 've listened to those .

@@41714238 <h> Healing the mind and body <p> IN this article , I am addressing the Muslim readers with regards to the recent fatwa on yoga , and related matters . However , I am sure the non-Muslims will find it valuable reading too , so that they may understand the issues confronting their Muslim friends better . <p> Since the news first broke out that the National Fatwa Council ( NFC ) was going to ban Muslims from practising yoga , I have been inundated with calls from Muslims and non-Muslims , asking for my opinion . My reply was that we should wait for the fatwa or edict to be announced first . <p> Salat has spiritual and physical benefits . - AFP <p> Now that it has been officially announced , it has attracted even more controversy . The edict has yet to be gazetted in any state . And many are still confused whether yoga without the meditation and chanting is permissible , discouraged , or banned regardless . That yoga with the chanting of Hindu mantras should be banned for Muslims is clear . I hope that the physical yoga exercises , just like tai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a Muslim practising the traditional teaching of respect for the scholars and those in authority , I will not challenge the NFC 's decision , even if I have differing opinions . <p> Some Muslims have criticised the NFC for even bothering to tackle this issue . My opinion is that the NFC should deliberate over this and other issues where Muslims are involved because Islam is a complete way of life and we need clear guidance on all aspects of life , including if practising yoga is permissable . <p> What we hope is that the members of NFC are sufficiently learned and wise to come out with the right guidelines for us . And we hope that they fear only God and nobody else when making their decisions . <p> However , many have also rightly pointed out that there are other pressing issues which the NFC should focus its attention on . Although fatwas have been issued on some of these problems affecting Muslims here , the dissemination , implementation and enforcement of these fatwas are grossly lacking . <p> For example , among the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( interest-based banking/finance is the most obvious example ) because it will create economic disparity and hegemony over the poor ; and economic chaos due to reliance on unproductive financial instruments . <p> Before the advent of Islamic banking ( which is based on fairness and shared risks/profits for both lender and borrower ; and transactions based on real , productive economic activities ) , the Muslims here had no choice . But now that there are enough Islamic banks and Islamic banking counters , Muslims should not own or even work in riba-based banks anymore . What is the fatwa on that ? <p> What about Muslims being allowed to work as bartenders or serving alcoholic drinks in bars , restaurants and airlines ? All Muslims know that it is not only haram to drink alcohol , but also to serve it , or be associated in any way in the business , from planting ( of grapes or other plants meant for making alcoholic drinks ) , manufacturing , to selling it . Which means Muslims should not own or work in such places or businesses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as haram had long been made ( also by many other Muslim countries ) , but Muslims here ( including many Muslim MPs ) are still allowed to smoke with impunity , and Muslims also own cigarette companies and sell cigarettes as if the religion allows it . <p> In Islam , anything that is harmful to the body is discouraged . If it is proven to cause disease and death ( which cigarettes do ) , it is forbidden or haram . The body is a precious gift from God , and should be cared for with gratitude , nourishing it with good nutrition , and keeping it in good condition with proper exercise . <p> What about corruption , cronyism , nepotism and discriminatory policies ( or its politically correct version , affirmative actions ) that are entrenched in certain political parties , government departments and our society in general ? <p> And finally , does Islam allow detention without trial ? And does Islam allow anyone to be above the law ? I am asking as a Muslim who wants to abide by God 's laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to have clear fatwas , so that while we try to formulate laws and regulations to ensure peace and prosperity in our beloved multi-racial and multi-religious country , we do not inadvertently transgress God 's injunctions . Any practice that goes against God 's laws must be abandoned . <p> If the faith and piety of Muslims here have been compromised because of our indulgence in some of the forbidden practices , then we are in need of some " faith " healing . Is it any surprise that the Muslims here are lagging behind in wealth , education , and other indicators of prosperity , while being plagued with problems of drugs , the decline of morals , and other social predicaments ? <p> With the guidance of the NFC , Islamic scholars and leaders , we need to get the Muslim society to not take Islamic laws and guidelines for living lightly , but to submit to God in totality in order to live peaceful and prosperous lives . That is what Islam is all about , and the Qur'an reminds us to follow Islam totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If the Muslims here are peaceful and prosperous , the others will benefit too . <p> Mind-body exercises for Muslims <p> While we wait for the final outcome of the ruling on yoga , this is an opportune time for me to remind Muslims that they need not look further than their own ritual prayer or salat for an effective mind-body exercise . <p> I have related in several articles ( see www.superqigong.com ) about how I first experienced the life-force or qi when I was performing the tahajjud prayer ( optional prayer usually done between 2am and 5am , after sleeping ) almost 20 years ago ; and about meeting my first qigong sifu , Master Yusuf Yang Huaxiang , who introduced me to the world of qi and qigong . <p> Through these experiences I understood more of the health benefits of salat than what was previously taught to us . Salat has spiritual and physical benefits , but while the spiritual aspects are well understood , most Muslims believe in the physical health benefits of salat without knowing in what way . <p> Thus many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to achieve the health benefits of salat . <p> Salat is not just a spiritual exercise . If it were so , then God would have asked us to say our prayers in any position , without all those movements and postures being compulsory . It is a spiritual exercise that is also meant to benefit the physical body . <p> Salat is not meant to be an aerobics or muscle-building exercise . The physical movements are beneficial because they give flexibility to the spine and joints ; have reflexology benefits from the stretching of the soles and positioning of the toes ; and most importantly , because it increases and improves the flow of life-force ( qi or tenaga hayat ) . <p> The dutiful Muslim prays five times a day , repeating 17 cycles ( rakaat ) of movements and recitations . The physical aspect of each rakaat consists of standing straight , bowing 90 degrees , standing upright again before going down in prostration twice , and sitting in a prescribed manner in between the prostrations . There are also prescribed movements and positioning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than the compulsory prayers , and some routinely do 30-50 rakaats per day . Imagine if you do 50 cycles of the movements everyday without fail , then you should not get spinal and joint problems easily . That should be the least you can expect . <p> There are many other benefits that would take many pages for me to elaborate . In fact , many books have been written about this . But all these benefits will only be achieved if the salat is done properly , with full discipline and concentration on God ( khusyuk ) . <p> The physical movements and postures also have spiritual significance . For example , the prostration indicates our submission in body and soul , and not just by mere words . <p> Unfortunately , from my observations , many Muslims do not pray with full discipline , and so can not expect all the promised benefits . <p> I have been invited by many mosques , suraus , associations , groups and families to explain these benefits in detail . <p> Many who have followed my advice have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some have reported feeling the qi flowing up their spine every time they pray . <p> Salat is indeed a self-maintenance programme for the spiritual and physical health of the Muslim . It is an act of communion , devotion , repentance , gratitude , surrender and an expression of love and servitude to God , the creator and sustainer . It is also a mind-body exercise that improves the physical health and increases the life-force . <p> Comparing qigong with salat <p> The requirements for effective qigong practice are three -- mindfulness of the breath , movements ( or posture ) and qi flow ( for those who can already feel qi ) ; relaxed conscious breathing ; and coordinated body movements and postures . <p> The requirements for salat are similar , with the addition of spiritual requirements -- being focused on God ( khusyuk ) and mindful of the intention , recitations , body movements and postures ; proper and disciplined postures and movements ; and Quranic recitations and supplications . <p> What many Muslims miss out are the disciplined movements and postures ; and disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses and supplications properly . <p> If they do , then the qi or life-force will flow automatically , even if they know nothing about qi . This is the special benefit they will get if only they pray with full discipline . And if they pray that way five times a day , they will all be charged with qi and should be very healthy . That is the secret health benefit of salat revealed ! <p> If they also do aerobics , yoga , tai chi or qigong in addition to their prayers , they should be very healthy indeed . <p> Dr Amir Farid Isahak is a medical specialist who practises holistic , aesthetic and anti-ageing medicine .

@@41723232 <h> Is Malaysia ready to handle the 2019 Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan ? <p> Pick a random coffee shop . Walk in , and have a seat . Look around you , and if you listen carefully , you 'll notice that amidst the loud chatter of the boisterous Malaysian crowd , there 's a common topic being discussed : The Wuhan Virus . Officially called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ) , the outbreak of the virus has caused a reaction that is n't too dissimilar to mass hysteria , with reports of companies like Google and Apple shutting down corporate offices in China only adding fuel to the flames . <p> Of course , with over 31,340 confirmed cases around the globe , it 's not an unnatural response to what has become a global pandemic -- the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recently declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency , after all . Meanwhile , we 've seen the number of cases in Malaysia rise to 15 at the time of writing , which has led a host of strange and -- frankly -- unbelievable rumours making the rounds on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things need to be put into context . Out of the 14 confirmed cases thus far , only 2 are Malaysians . And out of the global number of 31,340 , only 217 cases are of patients outside of China . But the panic has truly set in , with pharmacies struggling to meet the abrupt ( and great ) demand for face masks , and there have even been arrests made in relation to unnecessarily inciting fear among the masses . Beyond keeping good hygiene practices -- and possibly figuring out how to wear face masks properly -- there is n't really much else you can do to " avoid " the coronavirus . <p> Based on their track record , perhaps we should give Malaysia 's health officials the benefit of the doubt . Historically , Malaysia has had its fair share of outbreaks to deal with . In fact , Malaysia ranks at No. 18 globally on the Global Health Security ( GHS ) index , which is a measurement of countries ' health security and capabilities -- Malaysia also ranks at No. 3 in Asia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , while Japan is at No. 21 . Arguably , this is evidence of a capability to handle outbreaks , which has also been commended by the World Health Organisation . <p> Still not convinced ? Let 's have a look at Malaysia 's proven track record at containing , dealing with , and surviving some of the world 's deadliest outbreaks . <h> 1 . Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) <p> The SARS coronavirus killed at least 774 people around the globe in the early 2000s , and just like the Wuhan coronavirus , was said to have its roots in bats . However , that is n't the only similarity when it comes to the novel coronavirus . Both viruses -- as zoonotic diseases -- spread to people from animals , which means that patient zero for both diseases probably transmitted the disease in a wet market . <p> The disease had been first detected in November 2002 , and the outbreak was deemed as " contained " by the World Health Organisation in July of 2003 . While 8,000 people were infected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 2 deaths reported . <p> Back in 2003 , Malaysia imposed a week-long travel restriction on visitors from mainland China , Taiwan , Hong Kong , along with Vietnam . A week later , the restriction was relaxed -- those from China and Vietnam only needed to obtain medical certificates to check that they were SARS-free to enter the country . However , the move had ramifications on the tourism and travel industry in Malaysia , with the total number of tourists visiting Malaysia falling by 20.5% in 2003 . <p> Still , it 's a move that the Malaysian government felt was necessary at the time , and the containment of the outbreak was given priority over tourism revenue for the year . <h> Swine Flu/Influenza A(H1N1) <p> Just over 10 years ago , another flu outbreak was happening . Influenza A ( H1N1 ) -- commonly known as " swine flu " -- began in Mexico , with Malaysia 's first case reported in May 2009 . For their part , the health authorities in Malaysia stayed on high alert , and closed schools in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , had reportedly infected almost 15,000 people , with a total number of 88 deaths . <p> But something to note is that there are still cases of H1N1 infections , more than 10 years on . 8 children in Sabah were confirmed to have H1N1 infections , and you can technically still get infected . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) confirms that there is a 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine , and recommends that pregnant women , people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age , health care and emergency medical services personnel , or those with chronic health conditions , get vaccinated . <p> Additionally , the Health Ministry also had the National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan ( NIPPP ) , which helped to coordinate the response plan for an influenza-related pandemic . The Health Ministry also imposed health screenings to and from Mexico , while thermal scanners were installed at entry points at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) . <h> Nipah virus <p> The Nipah virus was first seen in Malaysia in 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with infected pigs . From September 1998 to May 1999 , there were 265 cases of the virus with 105 deaths , and the outbreak severely affected the pig-farming industry . <p> Initially , the Malaysian health authorities were under the impression that Japanese Encephalitis ( JE ) was behind the outbreak . This meant that measures taken during the initial stages were rather ineffective , and the outbreak failed to be contained , spreading through the country and to neighbouring Singapore . <p> Eventually , a virologist at the University of Malaya discovered the root cause of the infection , with the origins coming from a native fruit bat species . Further studies eventually led to the culling of more than a million pigs , which -- again -- cost the Malaysian market significantly . Since then , there have been no cases reported in Malaysia ( or Singapore ) . <h> Malaria <p> Malaria is an on-going public health problem in Malaysia . However , the National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination was set up by experts and health authorities in Malaysia with the aim of eradicating malaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . <p> The World Health Organisation has shared that Malaysia achieved " zero indigenous human malaria cases " in 2018 , achieving its goal 2 years ahead of schedule . Here 's their analysis : <p> " Ensuring prompt malaria diagnosis , treatment and surveillance in remote , hard-to-reach regions played a key role in Malaysia 's elimination success . However , the risk of imported malaria remains a key concern . Temporary foreign workers in Malaysia , many of whom are undocumented , may expose the local population to the disease . " <h> Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) <p> A recent case of MERS was reported on the 1st of January , when a 55-year-old man returning from his pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia tested positive for the disease . The Ministry of Health investigated 70 individuals who came into contact with the 55-year-old , with a few hospitalised for further tests . <p> As of now , Malaysia is free of the MERS virus , and no new cases have been reported since . All in all , the total number of positive tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not all doom and gloom <p> No one is denying that the 2019 novel coronavirus is indeed a deadly outbreak . But despite the panic that has been setting in amongst the masses , it 's also reassuring to know that Malaysia has done well in handling similar times of crisis before . Contrary to what many on social media would have us believe , Malaysia 's preparedness and ability to handle an outbreak is seemingly at an international standard . <p> An official from the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recently commended the Malaysian authorities for how they have managed and contained the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus . Dr Lo Ying-Ru , the WHO Representative to Malaysia , Brunei , and Singapore , said that the authorities here have be excellent , while they 've also been transparent to the public -- crucial , in times such as these . <p> And despite the spreading of fake news that paint such a bleak picture of Malaysia and the Wuhan coronavirus situation , perhaps we should all have more confidence in our health professionals and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us anything , Malaysia has been proven to be rather good at handling deadly outbreaks .

Not only this provides greater power efficiency for next-generation mobile devices but also maximises 5G performance from the available spectrum . <p> Apart from the Snapdragon X60 , Qualcomm has also introduced its QTM535 mmWave antenna module that offers improved mmWave performance and it comes with an even more compact design . It is said to be narrower than the current QTM525 module that 's typically paired with the X55 modem . This could possibly address Apple 's 5G antenna concerns when it comes to size . The new antenna module can support 26GHz , 28GHz and 39GHz bands . <p> To recap , the MCMC has identified 700MHz , 3.5GHz , 26GHz and 28GHz bands for 5G usage in Malaysia .

It also supports 5G FDD-TDD sub-6 carrier aggregation , 5G FDD-FDD and TDD-TDD carrier aggregation as well as Dynamic Spectrum Sharing ( DSS ) which allow operators to reuse LTE spectrum for 5G usage . The solution promises to deliver higher average network speeds and accelerate 5G expansion . <p> On paper , the 5G modem-to-antenna solution can deliver up to 7.5Gbps downloads and up to 3Gbps for uploads . Qualcomm says that sub-6GHz carrier aggregation in 5G SA networks is expected to offer double peak data rates compared to solutions without carrier aggregation . <p> Unfortunately , the new 5G modem solution wo n't be ready for this year 's devices . At the moment , the new X60 and QTM535 samples are expected to ship in the first quarter of 2020 and you can expect it on new devices in early 2021 .

Routers and network devices play ... <p> In reality , however , the advertised speed of the broadband plan you 've subscribed to is merely the fastest speed achievable in an optimum scenario . Routers and network devices play a huge role in creating that optimum scenario for the best connection speeds , yet their importance is often overlooked . <p> Many users face a variety of issues with their home broadband connections , including latency spikes , network-related congestion issues , poor WiFi signals , and other issues that can be caused by having multiple devices and Internet users within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the best possible experience with your home network ? <p> Well , for a start , a good router can be a game-changer . TIME has recently updated its range of routers and broadband devices , with upgraded devices available for subscribers of TIME Fibre Home Broadband -- with a suitable option for everyone , regardless of what their broadband needs may be . Here 's a quick breakdown : <h> The gamer 's choice : Asus AC86U <p> First up , we have the Asus AC86U , a router that offers a number of gaming-centric features to help gamers enjoy a better home network experience . This includes " Double Gaming Boost " , a low-latency mode for online gaming , along with the WTFast Game Accelerator , which lowers ping times and minimises packet loss with route optimisation -- thanks to a built-in Gamers Private Network . <p> Meanwhile , there 's also adaptive QoS ( Quality of Service ) . This basically prioritises important traffic over the network , such as gaming , streaming , or transferring large files . If your priority is gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gaming to ensure that your experience is as smooth and uninterrupted ( by other activities/devices ) as possible . <p> TIME subscribers can purchase the AC86U for RM699 , which includes a 2-year warranty . <h> For the heavy-duty user : ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 <p> A more premium option , the ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 supports up to 10Gbps and is powered by a quad-core CPU . This also translates to better efficiency for multi-device households , with something called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access ( OFDMA ) dividing channels into sub-channels -- which allows users to connect more devices simultaneously and get faster speeds . <p> The ROG router also has WiFI 6 support , which provides wider network coverage and reduces device power consumption , along with a dedicated 5GHz band for gaming to avoid competing for bandwidth with other non-gaming activities . You also get Adaptive QoS ( also available with the aforementioned Asus gaming router ) , along with the same WTFast Game Accelerator . <p> The AX11000 is available for RM1,809 for TIME subscribers . Again , customers will get a 2-year warranty . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WiFi Systems <p> Meanwhile , there are also options for mesh WiFi . Essentially , mesh WiFi systems are made up of two ( or more ) nodes -- router-like devices -- that work together to provide your house with blanket WiFi coverage . The system consists of a main primary node that hooks up to your ISP modem , and a series of secondary satellite nodes that connect wirelessly to each other . <h> Linksys Velop Mesh WiFi <p> The first option is the Linksys Velop Mesh WiFi , which is available at RM649 for a single node or RM1,199 for the package with two nodes . This model has the benefit of being both a router and a WiFi mesh system , which means that you do n't need a router in addition to the nodes . Linksys also says that their router covers up to 2,000 square feet -- making it particularly useful for users who live in homes with multiple walls and floors -- and its Tri-Band system means that multiple devices can connect to the Internet simultaneously without congestion-related issues . <h> TP-Link Deco P9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a pretty interesting one at that . A combination of dual-band WiFi and powerline technology , you can use your home 's electrical wiring to establish an even stronger mesh network while still utilising the seamlessness of mesh technology to get up to 1,500 square feet of WiFi coverage . The package with two nodes is available for RM719 . <h> AirTies Air 4830 <p> Lastly , there 's also the AirTies Air 4830 , which is the most affordable of the Mesh WiFi options at RM570 for two nodes . You get WiFi coverage up to 1,500 square feet , and a single WiFi ID means that you can stay connected on the network seamlessly no matter what . <h> A device for everyone <p> With the sheer number of connected devices that everyone now carries , routers and broadband devices are the often underappreciated workhorses of home networks . However , choosing the right device for you really depends on what your needs are . Gamers have certain requirements -- low latency connections , primarily -- that might be best handled by the Asus AC86U gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large home might find one of the Mesh WiFi systems a better option . <p> So if you fall into the rather large category of users who find that you experience network issues with your broadband connection at home , it 's certainly worth upgrading to one of TIME 's newly offered devices . Check out the complete list of devices here . <p> If you are n't a TIME subscriber yet , it might just be the perfect time to sign up with the first month free for all 24-month contract TIME Fibre Home Broadband plans from 6th January to 29th February 2020 . TIME Fibre Home Broadband plans are priced at RM99/RM139/RM199 for 100Mbps , 500Mbps and 1Gbps respectively .

To clarify , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently looking into this together with ubisoft and will share update on this soonest . <p> From the looks of it , the broadband provider seems to imply that this is a technical issue and they are looking into solving the problem with Ubisoft .

@@41785240 <h> Huawei Mate Xs hands-on : This is how foldable phones should work <p> Today , Huawei launched the Huawei Mate Xs : the latest foldable smartphone in an ever-growing list of such devices in the market today . The device was launched via a global livestream broadcast from Barcelona , Spain , and as I was fortunate enough to be in attendance , I managed to get a quick hands-on with Huawei 's latest and greatest foldable yet -- although the greatest part might not be so readily apparent . But more on that later . <p> The Mate Xs , at first glance , looks identical to its predecessor , the Mate X. A flexible , 8 ? main screen can be folded into two smaller displays when in " phone mode " : a 6.6 ? front-facing display , and a 6.38 ? display on the back of the device -- pretty much an identical setup to the Mate X. <p> Still , I 'll say that that is n't a bad thing at all . Arguably , Huawei has stayed true to a form-factor that could potentially be the one that best utilises the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds with the screen on the outside of the device , rather that the opposite ( basically , the Galaxy Fold ) . <p> Obviously , this leaves the screen vulnerable to any number of potentially costly happenings . This is a phone that 's retailing for EUR2,499 ( RM11,399 ) , after all . But if you compare the benefits of Huawei 's design to the more conservative design of something like the Galaxy Fold , and do a rough cost-benefit analysis , it 's clear -- at least , it is to me -- that you get a lot more out of the Xs ' form-factor . <p> For one , you get a significantly larger screen to use when the device is folded . Many of the SoyaCincau team have had the chance to use foldable phones , and the answer is clear : despite the wow-factor of using a foldable phone in " tablet mode " , you spend most of the time using the device in " phone mode " , which amplifies the importance of the front-facing screen . <p> And that brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't need a separate front-facing camera , with the main camera setup doubling up as your selfie camera . Turn the phone around , the 6.38 ? secondary display lights up , and snap your picture . Again , this is something that was already present with the original Mate X -- but it offers more evidence that Huawei wants to fully explore the potential of the foldable form-factor . <p> Often times , many regard the foldable phone as nothing more than wow-factor device , which can not be further from the truth . Think about it this way . Essentially , a foldable smartphone is a 2-in-1 device : a tablet and a smartphone . Yes , we 've seen some design flaws of epic proportions in the past , but the tech has had some time to mature . Which might explain the naming of the Mate Xs -- an incremental upgrade , one to iron out the kinks . <p> Huawei told me that a lot of focus has been put into making the Mate Xs a viable , productive device , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the new " App Multiplier " function , which allows you to view two pages within the same app -- although this is only supported on a few apps . For example , you can use a news app to have a the homepage of a news website on the left half of the app , and specific articles loaded up on the right half of the app . <p> It 's an idea that has quite a number of practical uses , and I definitely appreciate the fact that the team at Huawei has apparently been putting some serious thought into fully utilising the real estate of the 8 ? display . <p> Additionally , there 's the multi-window function , which is basically Windows ' Snap Windows for the Mate Xs . You can have two windows simultaneously running side-by-side , along with a third , floating window . It 's not exactly the most ground-breaking , iconic feature -- it 's not even the most original idea , but I can see how it give the Xs a lot more functionality . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.0.1 ( based on Android 10 ) , including giving gamers a wider field-of-vision when playing PUBG ( supported games only ) and floating reply windows , and it 's all certainly promising . <p> Specs-wise , it 's nothing particularly shout-worthy , in comparison to the foldable nature of the device , of course . You get a 4,500mAh battery that can be charged at 55W , an almost identical Leica co-engineered quad-camera setup to the Mate 30 Pro 5G , and ( only ) 8GB of RAM paired with 512GB of storage with the single variant available . For some reason , however , Huawei decided not to include stereo speakers on the Mate Xs , and there 's also the notable absence of wireless charging . <p> Now , I know that some of you do n't consider wireless charging to be the most essential thing ever , but let 's face it : when you buy something at this price , you expect it to have the best specs possible . And why could n't we get a 12GB RAM option ? It 's disappointing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to me . When I think of a foldable smartphone , I think about the potential it has as a device for media consumption . A quick unfold , and I have the ideal device for some Netflix , a movie or two , or YouTube . And while the Mate Xs certainly has the display for it , the single speaker located at the bottom of the device ( or the side , depending on how you hold it ) is decent , but utterly disappointing for what the Mate Xs is . <p> But what is worth shouting about , judging by how Huawei talks about it , is the Kirin 990 5G powering the device ( the Mate X had a Kirin 980 along with a Balong 5000 5G modem ) . The integrated 5G modem with the 990 5G means that both NSA and SA standards are supported by the Mate Xs , and the fact that all global 5G bands are supported is a huge plus in my book ( in case you missed it , not every flagship 5G phone has this level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5G smartphone , it had better support 5G -- wherever I am . <h> The Mate Xs has the potential to be the best foldable yet <p> Yes , perhaps it 's a rather bold claim to make . And yes , the Mate Xs comes with Huawei Mobile Services ( HMS ) instead of Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) -- which means that you 'll need to depend on Huawei 's AppGallery for your apps . But in my brief time with the Mate Xs , I was struck with the possibilities that Huawei 's form-factor brings . I 've also had extensive time with the Mate Xs ' main rival : Samsung 's Galaxy Fold . It 's a super device , and definitely has a lot going for it now that they 've sorted out the hinge ( ... right ? ) , but as mentioned earlier , most people end up using the smaller , secondary screen for the most part . And the secondary display on the Galaxy Fold , lest we forget , is a 4.7 ? 720p display . <p> The Mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen when folded that pushes a resolution of 2480 x 1148 . Even the " secondary " screen on the back of the Mate Xs ( 6.38 ? , 2480 x 892 ) is larger than the Fold 's front-facing display . And when unfolded , the 8 ? flexible display of Huawei 's foldable pushes a 2K resolution of 2480 x 2200 -- compared to 2152 x 1536 on the Fold 's 7.3 ? full display . <p> But we ca n't talk about foldable smartphones without talking about the infamous issues that have plagued the form-factor ever since ... well , I 'm sure you remember . But it 's worth noting that Huawei 's first foldable did n't really have the same level of notoriety , perhaps due to its limited availability ( only in China ) . <p> There 's a new double-layer optical polyamide film that 's supposedly 80% stronger than the single layer film used in the past , while the new Mate Xs ' new , reinforced " Falcon Wing " hinge supposedly has 100 components to offer more durability -- it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can decide if something is actually durable . But now that the Chinese company has announced global availability for next month , perhaps it might be time to give the foldable phone a break . <p> So yes , the verdict for now : huge , huge , potential . The Huawei Mate Xs has so much going for it . But it also appears that Huawei has overlooked certain subtle , yet key , features . Stereo speakers , more RAM , wireless charging -- the absence of these might not break the Mate Xs , but it certainly dilutes the whole **40;4035;TOOLONG pricing model that Huawei has clearly gone with . And of course , there 's the fact that the top brass at Huawei still have some ... political issues to sort out . <p> But notwithstanding these negatives , I 'm excited . Excited to see something with this much wow-factor fleshed out with some practical features -- both hardware and software-wise . And I 'm thrilled that we 're going to see this hit the Malaysian market soon , too ( Huawei Malaysia says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 2020 ) .

PH leader Mahathir Mohamad stood down as prime minister last week as a result of political infighting . <p> " Recent days have brought worrying developments for those who value the democratic process in Malaysia , and now we are seeing what looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime that the people voted out of power , " said Teddy Baguilat , a former member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines and APHR board member . <p> " We had hoped that the intimidation of people voicing dissent at those in power was something that Malaysia had relegated to its past . <p> Support the struggle to build a New Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> " On top of ignoring the will of the people by installing a government that was n't democratically elected , now authorities are shutting down critical voices by intimidating those who have peacefully protested . They are showing a total disregard for the people 's voices , " said Baguilat . <p> Those facing potential charges for their roles in the protests include activist Fadiah Nadwa Fikri , who is being investigated by the police under Section 4(1) ( a ) of the Sedition Act , and Section 233(1) ( a ) of the Communications and Multimedia Act , for urging the public to join a pro-democracy gathering in Kuala Lumpur on 29 February . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police , reportedly under Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act , for their involvement in a separate protest about the current political situation , in the capital on 25 February . <p> A further 15 individuals , including a state assembly member , have reportedly been questioned by the police for their involvement in a peaceful pro-democracy gathering on 1 March , the day the new prime Minister was sworn in . <p> According to media reports , the police have also opened new investigations under Section 4(1) ( a ) of the Sedition Act and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act aimed at those who allegedly insulted the king on social media . <p> In the 2018 election , Malaysia voted for a Pakatan Harapan coalition based on a manifesto that promised institutional reforms as well as the repeal of repressive laws , such as those currently being used against democracy activists .

@@41814235 <p> Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin during the announcement of the new Cabinet ministers at Perdana Putra in Putrajaya , March 9 , 2020. -- Picture by Shafwan Zaidon <p> KUALA LUMPUR , March 10 -- Several political observers have lauded Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin 's decision to name four senior ministers instead of a deputy , saying it is a wise move to safeguard against political rifts . <p> The political observers polled by Malay Mail said the quartet may also go some way to satisfy all of the parties that have supported the Perikatan Nasional pact , and is provided for by the Federal Constitution . <p> " We know the deputy prime minister post is a critical position . Instead of risking it , the prime minister made a wise decision by appointing four senior ministers . <p> Azmi also said Muhyiddin made the right choice to appoint senior ministers with experience to critical portfolios such as economic affairs and defence , held by Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed and Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob , respectively . <p> " For example , by having a senior minister in the economic sector , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact the coronavirus brought to the country 's economy , " he said , referring to the Covid-19 outbreak . <p> Under Article 43 of the Federal Constitution , the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall appoint a Cabinet of ministers to advise him in the exercise of his functions , including first appointing a Prime Minister . <p> This includes the appointment of deputy ministers under Article 43(a) of the Federal Constitution , where the King may also on the advice of the prime minister appoints deputy ministers from among the members of either House of Parliament . <p> This means that , the prime minister has the discretion to appoint a deputy prime minister or otherwise . <p> Agreeing with this , Ahmad Atory Hussain , a former senior lecturer at Universiti Sains Malaysia ( USM ) , claimed that the PN Cabinet line-up is " better " in some way compared to the previous Pakatan Harapan administration , despite its dismal representation of minorities . <p> " The Cabinet line-up is better than expected , even better than PH 's line-up . The only thing that lacks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat to do with the nature of our political system , it is concentrated more on party performance , " he said . <p> Commenting on the absence of a deputy prime minister post , Ahmad said that it is better to not appoint one as all party leaders are aspiring and pursuing the post . <p> " Because to appoint a deputy prime minister , it has to be one of the leaders from one of the major parties within the coalition , all of whom are dogged with controversies , even Hadi , " he said , referring to PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang . <p> " Muhyiddin is trying is a new formula , which is untested but constitutional -- the position of a deputy prime minister is not necessary . <p> " Even in the United Kingdom , sometimes they have a deputy prime minister , and sometimes they do n't have one . It depends on the convenience of the prime minister , " he said . <p> He also viewed this as Muhyiddin playing safe and trying to avoid further controversy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move is Muhyiddin 's way of showing that he is being fair to all the leaders . <p> " Correct me if I 'm wrong , but all the leaders of the major Malay parties have been relieved of any Cabinet post , right ? " he added . <p> As for independent analyst Hoo Kee Ping , he viewed the Cabinet as clean and one that is filled with technocrats and efficiency-based . <p> " This is important as Malaysia is facing a tough economic climate made worse due to the Covid-19 outbreak , " he said . <p> He cited Muhyiddin 's move to appoint former CIMB Group chief executive Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz as the finance minister , deeming it as a right move . <p> " Mind you , there has never been a banker , a proper certified banker that has helmed the finance minister portfolio . <p> " It 's hard to see who else best to take over the post at the moment and clearly it was the right move , " he added . <p> He also noted that MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of International Trade and Industry back then , is now back in the Cabinet as the Economic Affairs minister under the Prime Minister 's Department . <p> He added that Muhyiddin 's move to elect senior ministers is also positive as he can count on four ministers instead of just one deputy prime minister to aid him in governmental affairs . <p> " It was also a masterstroke by Muhyiddin to form a new portfolio to look after East Malaysian affairs to ensure that they are given the appropriate attention . <p> " Datuk Seri Maximus Johnity Ongkili who is chosen for the post is a very senior politician and well respected in East Malaysia . <p> " This has never been done before even after the formation of Malaysia in 1963 , " said Hoo . <p> However , senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs Oh Ei Sun said the current Cabinet line-up will not achieve anything of note , whether or not there is a deputy prime minister in place . <p> " There are too many different factions gunning for that position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse their ambition by not having an obvious successor like previous administrations and hopefully avoiding some of those calls for him to resign . <p> " But this is not going to be a Cabinet with a lot of accomplishments -- with a DPM or no DPM it does not make much of a difference . So do n't dwell on that , " said Oh . <p> When asked if the current Cabinet ministers will be able to create a positive impact on the country 's economy , Oh also dismissed possibilities of such . <p> " No , I do n't think this government with all these old and tired faces in charge is going to really have any spectacular direction economically for the country , " he said . <p> He particularly pointed to the appointment of Tengku Zafrul , drawing comparisons to what was done previously by former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak who appointed Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar as minister in the Prime Minister 's Department in charge of economic affairs . <p> " This appointment of Tengku Zafrul , it is basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Tengku Zafrul will not survive long in this sort of extremely cutthroat political environment , " said Oh . <p> Ahmad Fauzi on the other hand , although he welcomed the appointment of Tengku Zafrul , he said the latter 's achievement in the corporate world may not necessarily translate similarly in Putrajaya . <p> " The appointment of Tengku Zafrul is something to be welcomed . But a new talent like him , if they succeeded in corporate world , it does n't mean they can do wonders . It is good to strengthen the new minister with good and experienced deputies , " he said . <p> Yesterday , Muhyiddin announced a new Cabinet line-up and expressed hope that those appointed into his Cabinet would be able to deliver the best and most efficient level of service to the people . <p> Muhyiddin said those appointed into ministerial positions were chosen to realise his vision of forming a Cabinet that is competent , people-centric , transparent and with integrity , focused on delivering effective services , while maintaining a solid structure . 
@@41814236 <h> Micro-credentialing : Towards better integration of work and study <p> Wednesday , 11 Mar 2020 08:14 AM MYT <p> PROF DR LATIFAH ABDOL LATIF <p> MARCH 11 ? Modern workplaces change at an unprecedented pace . The skills and knowledge acquired in a one-size-fits-all university degree obtained from higher education institutions become superseded by technological advances and new methodologies . Employers are seeking for individuals with detailed competencies specific to their hiring needs . Similarly , students are expected to acquire additional competencies to meet employers ' needs . As such , universities of the 21st century need to be responsive to the changing needs of employers and job seekers by creating a learning environment where new skills and credentials can quickly and conveniently be acquired , in an affordable manner . <p> A new model of learning , known as micro-credentialing , has emerged to fulfil the urgent need for upskilling and retraining in this day of digital economy . There are two broad types of micro-credential . One is credit bearing , incorporating an assessment component and contributing to a formal qualification . The other is a non-credit-bearing micro-credential in the form of an in-house credential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " massive open online course " ( MOOC ) . These may still require assessment , but does not contribute to a formal qualification or necessarily adhere to a set academic standard . The non-credit bearing micro-credentials basically contribute to lifelong learning . <p> Offering micro-credentials is not about replacing or substituting the current traditional time-based academic programme , but rather the micro-credential offers a flexible option to those interested in earning a formal qualification through a flexible education system . Under this concept , learners will have the opportunity to earn these credentials by submitting evidence of the work that they have done or their achievement which will be evaluated at an agreed level and standard set by both the industry and the university involved . <p> In March 2019 , the Malaysian Qualifications Agency ( MQA ) introduced a " Guideline on Micro-credentials " to share information on principles and good practices in the implementation of micro-credentials to HEIs and stakeholders in the country . It is a matter of time when the guideline mentioned above be developed into a full " Guideline for Good Practices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to micro-credentials and provider and ultimately integrate the micro-credentials into traditional awards and qualifications . <p> Genovasi University College ( GUC ) is a new dual mode institution with its vision " To be a renowned University pioneering in industry-based education " . As a new institution , it will embark on this new concept of micro-credential by collaborating and forming partnership with industries in offering new kinds of credential that is specific and relevant to today 's job market . Among the type of micro-credential that it will focus on will be Nano-Degree and Micro-Master Program Credentials . <p> This bold initiative augurs well with GUC 's vision ; it will enthusiastically forge links or connections with reputable industries in coming up with short and affordable Nano-Degree or Micro-Master program . At the same time , this effort is also directed at paving the way towards better integration of work and study . <p> The value of nano-degrees and micro-master program offered is ultimately determined by the employees who take up the courses and potential employers who consider its weight when comparing candidates ' CVs . <p> Generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs or other forms of certifications offers portability , simple proof of skills and motivation . Learners can : <p> Take accreditations anywhere , since learners can export micro-credentials and save them in the form of " digital badges , " <p> Showcase their learning beyond formal education ; <p> Become inspired to seek new skills . A well-developed system of micro-credentials can galvanise employees to pursue new learning experiences , take part in diverse training opportunities , and define their own paths to career success . <p> Can immediately apply their new knowledge to further their career , or they can put their credentials toward completing a master 's degree . <p> Take care of employees ' skills gaps at both the individual and the organizational levels ; <p> Boost engagement and productivity ; <p> Build a culture of lifelong learning or continuous learning in the organization . With micro-credentials , organizations can give employees incremental ways to progress and improve and show that they genuinely care about enabling their career growth . <p> In conclusion , micro-credentialing can become one of the most important tools an institution can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill connections and drive success in the future of work . This calls for a strategic implementation plan to ensure learners view nano-degree and micro-master program as a way to promote their achievements to potential employers , as well as for the potential employers to truly understand and value these credentials as evidence of learners ' achievements .

@@41855238 <h> 4 things that make the Garmin Venu the ideal fitness companion at home <p> When you think about buying a smartwatch in 2020 , the options are vast . Do you go for something with simple functionality , but an affordable price tag ? Or do you consider a smartwatch as an investment towards your better health ; a companion on your journey towards fitness ? <p> The Garmin Venu smartwatch was launched at the tail end of 2019 , along with a range of health and fitness functions . But perhaps one of the headlining features of the Venu is the 1.2-inch , 390 x 390 , AMOLED display -- a first for Garmin . Some of the watches in Garmin 's other series , like the Fenix 6X , have transflective displays , but the Venu represents a device that , according to Garmin , is " perfect for everyday usage " . <p> But what is everyday usage ? In light of the current situation in Malaysia , most workers are working remotely , with authorities recommending social distancing . Still , it 's important to stay active , even at home . Physical exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise social distancing , daily exercise routines must go on . <p> Here are 5 things that make the Garmin Venu the ideal fitness companion while you stay home throughout this time of crisis in Malaysia . <h> 1 . On-screen workout animations to help you help you visualise routines <p> The Garmin Venu features all-day monitoring , which basically means that you 'll be able to keep your finger on how things are going via the Pulse Ox sensor and Garmin 's vaunted Body Battery energy monitor . <p> But the appeal of Garmin 's smartwatches lies in their functional ability to go beyond tracking . The Venu pairs with Garmin Connect , the accompanying iOS and Android app . There , you 'll be able to download pre-made workouts to help you plan your fitness regimen ; these cover various options for activities , targeted muscle workouts , and levels . <p> Perhaps the most interesting bit that Garmin has included with the Venu is workout animations . For over 40 workouts , including yoga , Pilates , cardio , and strength exercises , your smartwatch will display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During yoga and breathing exercises , you 'll also be shown your respiration rate to better track yourself . <p> Additionally , those of you that want to modify and change your workout routine can also do so on the Venu -- or you can try out one of the venu 's 20+ built-in multi-sports apps . And like many of Garmin 's fitness watches , the Venu has support for Garmin Coach : choose an expert coach , a race goal , and once you 've got your smartwatch synced , the workouts will adjust ( easier , more difficult ) based on your performance . <h> 2 . Light enough to wear all day <p> The Venu is certainly a lightweight watch at 46.3 grams , which means that it 's well suited to being an all-day wearable . But the lightweight nature of the watch is contrasted by some strong internals : A 5ATM water resistance rating means that you can take the Venu with you when doing laps at the pool , or even when you 're in the shower -- further cementing its place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it can track your sleep patterns via a Pulse Ox sensor ) . <p> Garmin also promises battery life of up to 18 hours in GPS mode , the most battery-hungry mode . If you 're staying indoors and you do n't need the built-in GPS on , your battery life shoots up to 5 days in smartwatch mode . In GPS with music mode , you 'll get a decent 6 hours . <h> 3 . Garmin 's first smartwatch with an AMOLED screen <p> Garmin has included an AMOLED display with the Venu , which could appeal to those of you who want the bright , vivid colours of an OLED display but need the functionality and trackers of the Garmin smartwatch family . The Venu 's display measures at 1.2-inches , and you can also set the AMOLED display to remain always on -- which is all the rage in the smartwatch world right now . <p> There are also multiple live watch faces that take advantage of this ( along with the aforementioned animated workouts ) , but Garmin insists that this has not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Venu . Meanwhile , the watch comes with a full range of smartwatch features : Smart Notifications , Calendar updates , onboard storage for music , and even widgets and apps . <h> 4 . Serious tech under the hood <p> Still , that should n't detract from the tech within the Garmin Venu . Multi-GNSS support -- most Garmin receivers track both GPS and GLONASS satellites -- means that there is a safeguard even if one navigation system malfunctions or fails . In fact , a U.S. Air Force General recently shared that some Air Force reconnaissance pilots use Garmin smartwatches ( not the Venu ) as a backup navigation option . <p> You 'll also be able to track your breathing , stress , sleep , heart rate , hydration , and your menstrual cycle via a range of sensors . There 's even a VO2 tracker which helps to track your " overall cardiovascular health " . As with many Garmin devices , the Venu will also have the Body Battery function , which helps the wearer have accurate knowledge of their overall energy level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardware and Light Sand with Rose Gold Hardware , along with Granite Blue with Silver Hardware , and Black with Gold Hardware .

It indicates that much of the region remains on ' unhealthy ' air quality levels . <p> Now we may be very fearful of seasonal virus outbreaks , but air pollution is now globally the fifth leading cause of death among all health risks and 9% of deaths are attributed to it .

How electricity is generated and what emissions are released at the plant is a full topic by itself , but every bit counts . <p> A 55% reduction in current CO2 emissions is needed by 2030 to halt global warming , which of late has manifested itself in obvious fashion in Australia , where bushfires alternated with flooding in some pretty extreme see-saw weather .

More EV on the road , more demand for electricity , more emissions produce from those power plants . Maybe not strictly green house gas , but each of power plant type will pollute in some way or another . <p> Pool at one place is a good step to pressure gomen to change the energy source to greener ones . Despite that , EVs are still far greener than fossil cars even when they get electricity from coal powerplants , and they can get greener when the source is greener , compared to fossil cars that will always pollute more over its lifetime <p> because despite all that , ICE cars pollutes more over their lifetime because they use petrol/diesel which gets worse and worse over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more use . <p> That 's the part most EV producers and EV supporters skip because in reality EVs are n't much more environmentally-friendly than normal fossil fuel burning cars when taking into account electricity to charge the batteries is still mostly generated by plants burning fossil fuels . <p> Also most people do n't realize the potential for EV to become greener . Fossil cars will always pollute . EV manufacturing and power generation is easier to reach carbon neutral and EV tech still has a lot more room to improve , that means it can only get better . <p> Leaf EV lacks of battery ventilation . It will easily heat up in our climate . Once you charge it &amp; directly use it , battery temperature warning will show up &amp; power output will severely cut , hence limiting your speed . <p> Definitely they did n't consider majority of the electricity is still produced by burning coal and fossil fuel , pollutions caused by rare earth mining for the batteries ..

The exhibition featured a mix of artworks from indigenous artists from East Malaysia , recounting stories which have been passed down from generation to generation . <p> Besides using art as a method of preservation , Kendy also wishes to dispel the myth that art is just a hobby , and encourages young artists to not give up on their passion . <p> " In my opinion , art is more than just a hobby or a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have knowledge , passion and creativity , you have the means to change the world for the better .

" <p> " Malaysia is a melting pot of culture , in which each community 's heritage serves as an inspiration for design . There are now more opportunities for designers to showcase their work at medium scale events and activities related to arts , culture and design , " highlighted Kendy . <p> " Whilst the common misconception that a career as an artist is often unpredictable , the art scene in Malaysia has grown lively in recent years and with more people taking an active interest in art , there are now many new galleries and art spaces , " he added . <p> At TAR UC , design students are exposed to a wide range of design modules such as colour theory , typography , wet and dry media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe Illustrator , Photoshop , and InDesign . <p> Practical facilities such as multimedia labs , creative design workshops and studios provided by the faculty support the needs of TAR UC 's teaching and allow students to explore and develop their talents by supporting student 's hands-on learning in their respective programmes .

Its president Tan Sri Ter Leong Yap said the government 's immediate intervention was vital to help keep the cash-strapped businesses and companies stay afloat in these hard times , following the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> " Large businesses , too , need the compassionate support of the government and financial institutions . <p> " Short-term measures are critical to address immediate issues concerning cash flow and liquidity of businesses , " he said after a meeting with Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz to highlight the plight of the business community , especially SMEs . <p> Ter said the government ought to review its approach to the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) with greater coherence , by balancing the macro and micro elements of the business ecosystem . <p> " This will ensure the best interests of the nation , the survival of businesses , the welfare of workers , and the livelihood of citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to

will endeavour to raise these issues with his Cabinet colleagues for further deliberation , " said Ter . <p> NCCIM , Ter said , had put forward six main issues for the government 's immediate

filled . <p> He said there were cases of discrimination due to the inconsistency in the interpretation of what was considered essential and non-essential services , although the supply chain was wholly integrated . <p> Ter said NCCIM wanted the approved industries to operate on 50 per cent of their workers ' capacity , instead of 30 per cent , to meet their business orders . <p> " This is in view of the domestic services sector being severely impacted by a plunge in tourist arrivals , cautious consumer spending and restricted consumption and travel . <p> " As the manufacturing sector integrates with the global supply chain , the MCO has inflicted disruptions by loss of sales and a collateral damage on a permanent basis . <p> " Wuhan in China and Singapore did not shut down their

programme and wage subsidy , Ter called for the government to not make it compulsory for employers to pay full salaries during MCO . <p> For instance , Ter said employers , who suffered a declined revenue of more than 50 per cent since Jan 1 this year , were willing to pay only 50 per cent of salaries for foreign workers during the MCO period . <p> " Similarly , employers should be given flexibility to engage with the employees on unpaid leave , pay adjustment and annual leave offsets . <p> " We also proposed for an increase in wage subsidy from RM600 to RM1,200 a month ( which is at least 50 per cent of the median monthly salary level of RM2,308 ) . <p> " Also , we want the duration of wage subsidy to be raised to six months from the given three months , as the devastating impact could take longer to stabilise and recover , " said Ter . <p> He added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the employers should be given the flexibility to engage with their employees on the terms of salary payments . <p> On the employer 's statutory contributions , NCCIM wants a suspension for Socso , EIS and foreign workers ' levy , a 3-4 per cent cut in the EPF contribution rate till the year end . <p> NCCIM proposed for a special zero-interest payroll loan facility , equivalent to 12 months of an employer 's payroll . <p> " This is to assist companies in business for at least five years who are facing difficulties in paying salaries and wages , to help preserve jobs and income . <p> " This will help them to retain their employees for at least a year . <p> " The loan facility must be credited

malls , shops and business premises . <p> " The government can provide a special double-tax deduction on the amount of rental rebate provided during the same period , " he said . <p> On the property sector , Ter urged the government to consider allowing an extension of time especially for ongoing housing development schemes . <p> Alternatively , he suggested for a waiver of Liquidated Ascertained

@@41902230 <p> The tenth Malaysian general election concluded with a strange aftertaste . Never mind if the losers were devastated by the results . Even the victors did not find enough of a cause to celebrate . <p> First , victory was wrested through campaign strategies that were unlawful at many turns and phenomenally costly , both in terms of money and human dignity . Second , two states fell to Islamic governments , the very thing that Barisan Nasional voters thought they were going to the polls to prevent . <p> Instead of feeling smug over its two-thirds majority win , the Barisan Nasional , particularly UMNO is realising that the future for Malaysians on account of its performance may be a bumpy one ahead . Still we expect this government to go on , true to the Sinatra Principle , " Not the Shy Way , Oh No ? " . <p> Things Fall Apart <p> The stock exchange , the barometer of the Barisan Nasional ? s economic achievement reacted coolly to the results . For several successive days , the KLSE indices went down and gaming stocks took a beating . Investors will still be jittery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whittled Malay support for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad being one of the factors for concern . <p> Intra-party bickering within Gerakan came out into the open two days after the election . Disenchanted Gerakan members blamed the party for not bringing enough development into Penang and called for the state to be led by another . In typical authoritarian style , however , the rift was swiftly resolved by prime ministerial " decree " that the chief minister ? s post shall reside with Gerakan . <p> Most revealingly , before the dust could fully settle , UMNO leaders began calling for a ? reinvention ? of the party , including hinting of a leadership change . PAS would never be an alternative to UMNO trumpeted one minister when it was plain as daylight that it already is . <p> There were also accusations that the association with PAS caused the DAP its poor showing and that , on the other hand , Chinese votes more than anything else helped UMNO to retain its ground . Such an impression could lead to testier inter-ethnic and inter-religious relations . Non-Muslims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a burgeoning Islamic tide and Muslims are confused as to which Islam is more legitimate ; UMNO ? s or PAS ? . <p> Other uncertainties cropped up in relation to the appointments of mentris besar of several states ( Kedah and Negri Sembilan , among others ) which did not proceed with the usual cohesiveness . Most unfortunately , even leaders of the Barisan Alternatif were not spared the wrath of internal dissension and conflicts . The coalition looked to be on the brink of a break-up , with the DAP regretting its alliance in the coalition . <p> Among some , nation-building for the next five years is going to take a frightening course . So much for the Barisan Nasional ? s campaign slogan that promised unity , progress and freedom . What seems to loom on the horizon is more disunity , perhaps even an economic slide and possible contention over loss of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms because of widespread perceptions of a strengthening Islam . <p> UMNO : Losing Its Grip <p> The source of this cause for worry is UMNO ? s performance itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UMNO ? s losses in this election will have a reverberating effect on the political landscape . Besides losing a number of Parliamentary seats , it also lost popular votes compared with the previous general election . This time in constituencies where two-thirds of voters were Malays , UMNO received 48.6% of the votes compared to 60.8% in 1995 . In this election , UMNO suffered an 8% drop in votes compared with the 1995 election . On the other hand PAS gained 18% more of the popular votes in the seats it contested . <p> The chart shows that UMNO received more than two million votes in 1995 . The number of votes it received this time went down to about 1.9 million . On the other hand , PAS ? votes went up form 433,454 in 1995 to 996,512 votes in this election . For State seats PAS garnered about 1.3 million votes or more than a 50% rise from its previous performance . <p> No Kudos For The MCA Either <p> What was most revealing , besides UMNO and PAS all other parties performed consistently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , the MCA and other component parties in the Barisan Nasional received almost similar if not fewer votes than in the last election . <p> The chart in fact shows that popular votes for the DAP were higher than what it received in 1995 . Thus , despite the DAP ? s angst over its miscalculated alliance with PAS , it did not perform any worse than the MCA or Gerakan . The MCA ? s and Gerakan ? s hugging of the media to their advantage did not in the end deliver them much . One should only conclude that the MCA performed even worse than the DAP . <p> UMNO Recedes Into Johor , PAS Spills Out of Kelantan <p> UMNO only found comfort among Johor Malays . The pattern of voting there was an aberration in itself with 71% of the votes going to the Barisan Nasional . This number is 16.8% higher than the peninsula ? s average and 13.5% higher than the next best state for the BN ? Negri Sembilan which gave the coalition 57.5% of its votes . <p> UMNO lost even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the overall average . For Parliamentary seats , it suffered a 24.4% drop in popular votes in Selangor and the Federal Territory , 27.4% in Penang and 15.8% in Pahang . <p> PAS ? influence on the other hand is spreading out of Kelantan . In fact PAS ? share of popular votes ( 41.5% ) for state seats in Kedah ( which was retained under BN rule ) was even higher than UMNO ? s ( 40.55% ) . In Penang , UMNO ? s share of votes in state seats went down by 5% and in Terengganu it went down by 13% . <p> Thus , we are seeing a situation where UMNO is seemingly retreating into Johor , its original birthplace while PAS has succeeded in moving out of Kelantan , its home state . <p> Clearly , only PAS was the celebrant and only UMNO was the loser . The pie charts further represent the share of popular votes ( state seats ) of political parties in the 1995 and 1999 elections . A chunk of UMNO ? s share in 1999 appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , the tenth Malaysian general election was largely a contest between two Malay divides . UMNO was not damaged , but it became dangerously unwound . As the results show , its legitimacy as the voice and choice of the Malays , has been seriously undermined . <p> UMNO ? s Loss is the Coalition ? s Win <p> No doubt UMNO is still alive and kicking as it still managed to garner at least 50% of the popular votes in most of the constituencies it contested , and has remained the party which received the highest number of popular votes . It must be cautioned , however , that the above figures are not a reflection of Malay votes only but of all votes in UMNO-contested seats . If one were to assume that UMNO candidates also won through non-Malay votes , the proportion of votes lost among Malays may be even higher . <p> For a party that has been so used to getting almost undivided Malay allegiance and loyalty , this is a signal that it can no longer take its premier status in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing this election has shown that UMNO may not have done as well if not for non-Malay support . The question that arises is , will UMNO now be able to claim the status of primus inter pares or " first-among-equals " within the Barisan Nasional coalition ? <p> UMNO now has less than half the total seats within the Barisan Nasional government . Not a cause for worry in itself and may even be a good thing that the Barisan Nasional ? s support base is now more equitable , with East Malaysian parties contributing 24% of the seats , Chinese parties 24% , one Indian party 5% and UMNO 48% . UMNO may have lost a little bit of ground in pushing for a Ketuanan Melayu stance but that has nevertheless nudged the Barisan Nasional closer to a Malaysian Malaysia model . <p> Reclaiming Support <p> The question that will plague UMNO in its effort to " reinvent " itself would be over who will now form its core supporters . For sure , the party has alienated the Islamists and will not be getting the guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barisan Alternatif . <p> UMNO is presently depending on its core of loyalists from the older generation and a circle of members whose support has been assured through the party ? s patronage of their businesses , career positions and social status . They will not let go of UMNO because they simply can not afford to . If not for the sentimental reminder that UMNO was the original party of the Malays and that it promises some form of individual material mobility , it has little basis to otherwise attract new adherents to the party . <p> UMNO will have to decide if its makeover would mean fashioning itself into a more centrist party with liberal-democracy being its core value . If so , it would be a good thing , although this would mean getting rid of dead wood , old habits and arcane cultural practices . Most importantly , UMNO must go through the daunting task of ridding itself of its reputation as a party that wields power through money politics and avariciousness . <p> After Mahathir , Who ? <p> Foremost on most pundits ? minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the party . This is going to be a tough issue to resolve . Although UMNO deputy president Abdullah Badawi is the most likely contender , he does not come from a state that delivered the most number of Malay votes to UMNO . There is also an impression that he may not be business-savvy in the ruthless ( even shady ) way of the Mahathir-Daim genus . Not having an influential moneyed mafia backing him might also be a liability in the rough and tumble world of big business . <p> Abdullah Badawi lacks charisma , and unfortunately , anyone coming after Mahathir would find the man a tough act to follow in that department . One has to admit that that even Mahathir at his worst verbal spew can still be arresting . <p> Former UMNO dissident Tengku Razaleigh , after having proven that he could not deliver Kelantan from PAS , may not now deserve the honour to deliver UMNO from its disarray . UMNO vice-president Najib Razak , the other likely successor , appears to have blown his chances of leading the party after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are speculating that Johor UMNO leaders will now be in the best position to fill the vacuum . Nevertheless , if UMNO were to descend to assume a regional identity would this make it a stronger or a weaker party ? Would it not then alienate all the other Malays ? If Johoreans control UMNO this will go against the spirit of UMNO representing the greater Malay community . That in itself will spell the demise of UMNO as the supra-Malay designate . <p> In all likelihood , the party will survive by lumbering along . Its coffers are still filled and it is the government for the next five years . In the meantime , Anwar Ibrahim will continue to haunt UMNO in its search for the leader after Mahathir . Not only would UMNO need a healer to rehabilitate the war-torn party from its excesses in combat but it also needs someone who can be a firebrand to match PAS ? line-up of increasingly dynamic leaders . <p> With or Without Anwar , Islam Is Here To Stay <p> The election has almost promised that there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malay electorate into two directions . The Islamic State notion will lead many non-Muslims into supporting mainstream and racially based political parties . On the other hand there will be the push-appeal towards PAS among younger Malays who are emboldened by the prospect of Islam becoming a credible basis for government . If not managed astutely , this will lead to a spiralling of racial mistrust . <p> Malaysians will also continue to be confused as to why it was necessary for Mahathir to go through all that imbroglio with Anwar Ibrahim . At the end of the day , what did Mahathir achieve out of all that ? The very thing that he did not wish , that is the strengthening of radical Islamic movements , has happened and it will continue with even more intensity . Mahathir thought that by cutting off Anwar ? s influence as the lifeline of these movements , it would stave off their rise . Ironically , the Anwar Crisis gave the Islamic movements their greatest boost . <p> UMNO ? s Moral High Ground In Question <p> The fact that PAS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won handsomely is testimony that charges against Anwar Ibrahim for moral offences were not swallowed by the people . The fact that most of UMNO ? s religious representatives - the most prominent of whom was Religious Affairs Minister Hamid Othman , who was defeated by Shahnon Ahmad , author of a so-called " profane " piece of literature - lost their seats speaks volumes of Mahathir ? s attempt to use Islamic morals to sustain his credibility . Malay voting patterns in this election have convincingly revealed the futility of Mahathir ? s dalliance with Islam to outdo another Islam that is not of his own image . <p> It should be clear by now that every time Dr Mahathir and UMNO go through a political crisis , one Malay state will go the way of Islam . While many might think that only Dr Mahathir can be the bulwark against extremist Islam , it has actually been shown that he had been the best reason for Islamisation to flower . <p> Is There A Role For The DAP ? <p> The stock fear among non-Muslims now is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Islamic as a way of winning back the Malay heartland . On the other hand PAS can also try to become even more moderate and accommodating to non-Muslims as a way of winning over sceptics and tearing down fortress UMNO in the southern Malay states . There are many possibilities as to how both UMNO and PAS will be charting their paths in the bid to become the most credible alternative for Malays and Malaysians . It may develop positively contrary to the dark scenarios whipped up by politicians who can only think within a racially based paradigm . <p> Chinese-based parties like the DAP should seize this moment to carve a role for themselves in moderating the tensions that are now building-up . The association with PAS should be deepened and not severed as the DAP should serve as the conduit to cultivate and engage Muslims and non-Muslims in dialogue to bridge the gap in understanding . Malaysians may no longer be able to avoid the role of religion in building a more meaningful civil society . <p> The DAP as it turned out has been unnecessarily hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , as statistics show , none of the other Chinese parties , particularly the MCA , performed any better . Either the Chinese felt that they were merely bystanders in this whole episode of Dr Mahathir wanting to reassert his mandate ( among the Malays ) or they were left highly confused about the whole exercise . But now that the implications of a divided Malay constituency have finally sunk into the psyche of non-Muslims , the DAP must find for itself an appropriate positive role in the imminent processes of conflict resolution . <p> A Future outside UMNO <p> The aftermath of the general election will either be " more-of-the-same " or something new . In the meantime , we expect to be left with a judicial system that operates under the thumbs of the Executive . Herein , Anwar ? s fate in incarceration seems to be sealed . <p> We will likely be saddled with media that will slavishly continue to serve the political appetites of their shareholders . There will be no stopping how low they will stoop in the bottomless pit of indecency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We will not hope to see fair redistribution policies involving the provision for a minimum wage , housing for all , or other social benefits . Not when maha projects are revived and the whole vicious cycle of crony capitalism and corruption is churned all over again . With " business-as-usual " , the government will have to continue to lend extraneous support to big business conglomerates at the expense of distributive policies . <p> Vulgar Pragmatism Rules <p> Finally , what did the 29 November polls say about us , Malaysians ? Did we think that by going to the polls on that day we were outlining a splendid future for Malaysia or were we actually exposing ourselves for what we really are ? Nine days of an astounding media campaign by the Barisan Nasional that was Stalinist and Maoist in flavour beguilingly promised stability and the continuance of a " glorious " lifestyle . The message was that the corruption of government and the brutal victimisation of Anwar was but a micro-price to pay for an uninterrupted everyday existence that is familiar and therefore by habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seduction of the Barisan Nasional ? s trite sloganeering . <p> There were of course the 44 per cent who voted differently and were left dazed by the results of the election . They continued to clamour , " What about Justice ? What about Truth ? What about Accountability ? What about Fair Play ? What about Compassion ? " It was heard loud and clear and 56 per cent of Malaysian voters actually replied , " Frankly , we don ? t give a damn ! " Welcome to the Barisan Nasional ? s New Malaysia .

@@41917233 <h> 11 . Nate Stanley , Iowa <p> One thing to know : Nate Stanley played in a pro-style offense at Iowa that could be seen as a plus for NFL teams running a similar system and looking for depth . While he never put up " wow " numbers and could afford to be more accurate , he can make the throws he needs to make as long as he can contain his desire to do too much . <p> Key expert quote : From Lance Zierlein at NFL.com : " Big guy with a good arm who throws with nice touch to intermediate and deep windows , but failed to convince that he could manage games and play with an NFL level of consistency while at Iowa . The physical tools and traits are appealing and potentially moldable , but he may need plus talent to elevate his play rather than the other way around .

He takes good care of the ball , a valuable asset , but would likely fall into the role of " game-manager " over " game-changer " without some improvements . <p> If a few years on the sidelines can help him see the game better , he could become a prospect to watch . <p> Key expert quote : From Lance Zierlein at NFL.com : " Luton is an intriguing developmental quarterback with good size , adequate accuracy and an NFL arm . He 's operated in a pro-style passing attack with plenty of play-action and has the ability to push the ball into space both intermediate and deep . He values the football with few fumbles and interceptions during his career , but he 's more of a ' ball delivery ' passer than one who works through progressions and picks the defense apart .

He 's got a heck of a fastball but will need to figure out how to throw with a bit more consistency if he 's going to find a regular spot in the NFL . <p> Key expert quote : From Lance Zierlein at NFL.com : " It 's easy to tell that the Green Bay native favors quarterbacks like Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers when you watch his tape . Unfortunately , while he has similar zip to the Packer legends , he 's nowhere near as accurate and lacks any semblance of touch .

Can drop the ball in the basket . He shows the toughness to stand in the pocket and deliver the ball despite pressure from pass rushers . Does a good job of going through his progressions. " <h> 7 . Jake Fromm , Georgia <p> One thing to know : Jake Fromm 's journey through his college career will make some scouts swoon . Fromm toughed it out at Georgia after watching Jacob Eason take the starting job in 2017 . When Eason went down with a knee injury in the first game of the season , Fromm stepped up and led the Bulldogs to the title game where they pushed Alabama to the brink in overtime . <p> Fromm has a solid mind and can execute a gameplan . But compared to those above him in the 2020 draft class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fromm land in the right spot , surrounded by good pieces , his talent and poise could find success in the NFL . However , if you 're looking to build a franchise from the ground up , chances are you 're looking for a player with a bit higher of a ceiling . <p> Key expert quote : From Drae Harris at The Draft Network : " Very good competitiveness and efficiency to convert 3rd downs at critical moments in the game . Has shown the ability to change his arm angle to get the football where needed . He will be a QB who wins due to his cerebral play and his ability to take care of the football , not due to his physical attributes . Has shown good leadership in moments of adversity over the course of a game and is a winner , which is critical for the position . " <p> Still , Hurts has his areas of need .

This came after a decorated high-school career in Texas that he topped off as a four-star recruit and one of the country 's top dual-threat quarterbacks . Hurts ' style is perfect for the evolving football offense interested in running a scheme similar to that of the Ravens in 2019. " <h> 5 . Jacob Eason , Washington <p> One thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chance Jacob Eason would have been one of the first quarterbacks off the board out of this draft class . Eason is a sound pocket-passer , willing to stand and deliver with a strong arm and a good sense of where the ball should go . Watch Eason toss up a bomb off of play-action and you 'll see flashes of Kirk Cousins or Carson Wentz on their best throws . <p> What will determine if Eason can move from good prospect to great pro is how much nuance he can develop in his game . He has a heck of an arm , but can he develop the touch necessary in the NFL ? He 's not afraid to stand tall as the pocket collapses around him , but can he improve his mobility so opposing defenses will be forced to do more than simply surround and advance on him ? <p> In the right situation , it 's not hard to imagine Eason as a future stalwart of the league , but like any prospect in his position , there 's work to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Big-time arm , Eason has a howitzer for an arm . He can stand in the pocket and rip it down the field with ease . He really excels on deep shots coming off of play action . Scouts will salivate at his ability to make deep breaking routes to all areas of the field . He has plus velocity that allows him to get the ball into tight spaces despite coverages. " <h> 4 . Jordan Love , Utah State <p> One thing to know : While the top three quarterbacks in the 2020 draft class all seem to fit the bill , Jordan Love is a bit more perplexing . The Utah State product has plenty of tools that one can imagine would translate well to the NFL , but he had a tough senior season that saw him throw nearly as many interceptions as touchdowns . <p> The last quarterback to be taken in the first round after a season in which he threw 17 interceptions was Deshaun Watson in 2017 , but Watson threw 41 touchdowns in his final year at Clemson to Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love to protect the ball and improve his decision-making , he could wind up a steal . But those tendencies will only become more glaring against NFL defenses should they persist . <p> Key expert quote : From Joe Marino at The Draft Network : " Jordan Love is n't without his warts but he possesses a high-level physical skill set and peaks on tape that reveal the ceiling of a potential dynamic NFL starting quarterback . His arm talent and mobility is perfect for the trends of today 's NFL and there is no limitations to what he can do on the field . The full playbook is open for Love and then some . " <p> " With that said , he does need to make notable strides in several key areas including decision-making , timing and accuracy to achieve his ceiling . An early investment in Love is a bet on yourself to be able to develop his overall game but his upside is worth the calculated risk . " <h> 3 . Justin Herbert , Oregon <p> One thing to know : More than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part . Standing 6-foot-6 , 236 pounds with a cannon of an arm , it 's easy to see why scouts can fall in love with Herbert . <p> Herbert 's skills are n't raw unknowns either -- in two years starting full-time for the Ducks , he 's averaged more than 3,300 yards passing and 30 touchdowns per season . In the final game of his college career , Herbert showed an ability to take what the defense was giving him and find a way to win , rushing for three touchdowns to lead Oregon to a thrilling 28-27 win over Wisconsin . <p> If Herbert can continue developing as he begins his NFL career , he could have a bright future as a starter . <p> Key expert quote : From Walter Football : " The senior has all the physical tools to be a good NFL starter with a powerful arm , mobility and accuracy . When Herbert is given time , he is utterly deadly in his ability to carve up a defense . " <p> After a spectacular second season from Tagovailoa in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the title game , it still looked as though the Crimson Tide quarterback was destined to be the top pick in 2020 as the idea of " Tanking for Tua " was popularized amongst the fans of some NFL bottom-dwellers . <p> But Tagovailoa 's fortunes changed when he suffered a season-ending injury halfway through the 2019 season . He 's supposed to be ready to go by the time training camp comes around in late summer , but the coronavirus pandemic has complicated matters a bit as teams ca n't get a full view of his health status without an in-person meeting . <p> Tagovailoa is a complete prospect , sharing some important traits with Burrow -- remarkable accuracy , keen decision making , and phenomenal vision . That said , he 's dropped below both Burrow and Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert in some recent mock drafts . He wo n't fall far , but should an unexpected team be able to sneak into the top 10 to snag him , and his health checks out , they 'll get a steal . <p> Key expert quote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert feel for the pocket , stepping up or away from pressure while keeping a balanced base and his eyes downfield . The junior quarterback does n't have a rocket arm , but the ball jumps off his hands ; he can hit deep outs with plenty of velocity and he throws a pretty deep ball . In the short and intermediate areas , he leads his receivers away from big hits or hits them perfectly in stride so they turn upfield and pick up extra yards . " <h> 1 . Joe Burrow , LSU <p> One thing to know : Heading into the 2019 college football season , Joe Burrow was seen as a middling pro prospect , considered " at best a fifth-round pick " according to Robert Mays at The Ringer , who wrote about Burrow 's unprecedented rise up draft charts in November . <p> Burrow threw those projections in the trash by putting together one of the most dominant seasons in college football history , tearing through some of the best defenses in the country while leading LSU on an undefeated campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed pinpoint accuracy , impressive mobility both inside and outside the pocket , and a field vision that felt lightyears ahead of that of a college athlete . It 's impossible to tell how a player will fare once they make it to the NFL , but Burrow feels as close to a sure thing as the league has seen in close to a decade . <p> Key expert quote : From Danny Kelly at The Ringer : Burrow tallied 32 big-time throws ( a college football best ) but just nine turnover-worthy plays during the regular season , grading out tops among all quarterbacks both under pressure and on tight-window passes . The fearless demeanor he showed in the biggest moments in 2019 invites Tom Brady comparisons .

@@41923230 <p> As efforts to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus stretch into weeks and months , and wearing cloth masks in public becomes more commonplace , people are now starting to wonder about other possible sources of contagion , including their clothing . <p> Trending Google searches ( how long the virus survives on clothing , and how to wash clothing to prevent contamination ) suggest people are wary of whatever they 've worn in public . <p> But while the virus is believed to survive for up to two days on fabric , experts still say you 're less likely to be infected by your clothing as by another person . However , if you still want to take precautions , simple hygiene habits can help , such as an immediate shower and change of clothes after venturing outdoors . <p> Here 's how medical experts advise you should decontaminate your clothing if you think it 's been exposed to coronavirus . <h> How two doctors decontaminate their clothes after a shift <p> Dr. Darria Long Gillespie , an emergency physician and clinical assistant professor at University of Tennessee , said the viral outbreak has changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work . <p> Previously , she would pack a bag with a reusable water bottle and anything else she 'd want along for her shift .

Then , only after she 's washed and in a clean set of her own clothes , she rejoins her family . <p> Those precautions , or " firewalls " as she calls them , help give her peace of mind by separating her life into three zones -- the contamination zone , with active patients at the ER ; the clean zone of her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep that clean zone clean , Long Gillespie said she leaves as many items as possible in that transition area by changing out of dirty scrubs at the hospital and leaving other work essentials there . Anything she does bring home is carefully disinfected or contained -- the shoes she wears to work , for instance . <p> " My hospital shoes stay in a certain corner of the garage , and nothing else is near them , " she said . <p> Out of habit , Long Gillespie follows a similar routine when she makes grocery trips , removing her outer layers of clothing when she returns home and washing her hands thoroughly . <p> Dr. Lee Riley , professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at Berkeley Public Health , says his wife , a physician working in family medicine , has a similar routine now when she comes home after seeing patients .

Riley and his wife also have a habit of leaving their shoes at the door when they come into the house -- something he said is a good idea not only because of coronavirus but for general hygiene . <p> So far , the system has worked , and neither Riley nor his wife have developed COVID-19 symptoms . " I do n't know if we need to do that , but we do to be safe , " he told Insider . <p> For most people who are n't in close contact with patients on a daily basis , clothing is unlikely to be a problem , and normal hygiene habits should be enough to prevent contagion . <p> " It 's not necessary to wash your clothing all the time , " Riley said . " Just wash your clothes regularly and change them every day .

The UK 's National Health Service advises washing potentially " high risk " items like patients ' towels and clothing , as well as healthcare workers ' uniforms , on high heat .

Then you 'd have to touch that part of the clothing and touch your face to get infected , " Bell told Insider . <p> She said that while it is possible for clothing to be contaminated , and there are steps you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow previous advice about physical distancing and hygiene . <p> " That 's somewhat of a stretch . I would focus my efforts much more on staying at home , not being around other people who might be affected , wearing a face mask , and careful handwashing , " she said . <h> If you 're concerned about exposure , remove and bag clothing after being in public , and wash it separately from other laundry <p> Bell says that , to be safe , you could establish a protocol for returning home with possibly contaminated clothing , even if you 're not a medical worker or otherwise caring for a COVID-19 patient . <p> " If you 're very concerned about it , you could leave your shoes outside , and wash and dry clothes any clothes you 've worn in public separately , " she said . This is also her personal routine after seeing patients . <p> To do so , remove whatever you 've worn in public immediately when you get home , either in the entryway or garage if possible . Leave your shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disinfectant if you 're able to . Put your used clothing in a garbage bag and then shower , changing into a fresh set of clothes once you 're clean , Bell said . <p> If you 're able to wash your clothes immediately , that 's a good idea , she added , but for people without access to an in-home washer and dryer , you can repeat the procedure as many times as necessary , storing outdoor clothes in a sealed , disposable bag , until you have enough to warrant a trip to the laundromat . <p> When washing , be sure to not shake the bag , and keep it as close to the washer as possible while transferring clothes to avoid spreading any viral particles . Wash your hands thoroughly after contact with any potentially contaminated clothes , or use gloves . <p> A regular laundry cycle with hot water and soap , and a thorough dry , should be sufficient , according to CDC guidelines . <p> " With detergent , the virus would be killed very quickly , and with a dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Remember : The best defense against the virus is to stay home , wash your hands , and stay calm <p> " I think we need to be aware but not frightened , " Long Gillespie said . <p> " In the ER , you 're used to scary moments , you stay calm , you stay aware , and you have a plan . I do n't go more than I have to , I do n't spend more time than I have to , and I wash up afterward . " <p> If this kind of cleaning routine puts your mind at ease , it can be helpful to do so , Bell said . <p> But it 's still no substitute for other preventive measures like washing your hands , staying 6 feet away from other people , and whenever possible , not going in public in the first place .

The webinar was moderated by Tan Su Lin , co-founder of SMC Malaysia . <p> The panellists discussed many issues , such as the impact of a long-term MCO on mental health , life after the MCO , MCO exit strategies , preparations for the new normal , and the importance of effective science communication during the Covid-19 crisis . <p> Dr Amar opined that Malaysia is not ready to exit the MCO as there are many issues that still need to be addressed . He identified four weaknesses of the six criteria outline by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) for exiting the MCO . The four are testing and screening ; the capacity of the healthcare system ; contact tracing ; and , most importantly , the mindset of the community to live in the new normal . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped and adopted all the necessary preventative measures , such as physical distancing , to stop the spread of Covid-19 .

I do n't think that the general public has fully understood this . " <p> He added that the 33 new cases of Covid-19 among patients with influenza-like illness ( ILI ) and severe acute respiratory infection in the last two weeks showed that the virus is still spreading within the community . <p> " What we have yet to understand is , although the spread is under control , people are still being infected , which means that the virus is still spreading from one person to another in our society . <p> " What will happen if we are not careful is that the virus will continue to spread , and there will be an even larger second or third wave .

That is very dangerous , " said Dr Amar . <p> " It is unlikely that the disease will be fatal for children , nor will they fall severely ill , but they could carry the infection to their parents and grandparents . " <p> Meanwhile , Dr Zubaidah urged people to mentally prepare for and accept the new normal , which includes continuing with physical distancing and staying at home . <p> " Physical distancing is the new norm post-MCO .

" <p> Dr Mahaletchumy said strategies for exiting the MCO must be communicated clearly to ensure people understand the consequences if new-norm behaviours are not observed . <p> " General awareness and understanding of scientific issues in our society is low .

I hope that the Health Ministry plans a clear communication strategy before announcing any lifting of MCO restrictions .

Covid-19 has given me what I once thought of as a luxury , and for that I am grateful . <p> Naturally most of my thoughts these days revolve around the pandemic itself .

We applauded our doctors and nurses , those we call our frontliners in this war against a virus and rushed to ensure they had enough food and personal protective gear . Then we realised there were many among us who had suddenly found their lives circumvented in the most drastic ways . Businesses that relied on humans gracing their premises , like restaurants , stores and hotels , became empty . Cinemas and other entertainment venues went silent . The effect radiated outwards , knocking everything in its path . If tourists stopped coming , not only were hotel rooms vacant but there was nobody for taxi drivers to pick up or drop off at the airport or bus and train stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices closed , cleaners had nothing to clean . <p> We like to say that in times of trouble , Malaysians step up . And indeed , they did . Civil society groups and volunteers swung into action to help those who lost incomes with food and essentials -- the daily wage earners , the homeless , single mothers , the disabled . People gave whatever they could , to as many as they could . And they had to , because government aid was bureaucratic and slow . Ostensibly to keep infection under control , the authorities insisted that civil societies deliver their food packages to central collection points , after which the government would distribute them . As we now know , this was an untenable idea . How does the government distribute to people with no home addresses ? <p> The government 's own food aid programme turned out to be susceptible to politics .

But less goodwill was aimed at the government . People are able to recognise injustice when they see it . When ordinary folks are arrested and jailed for the mere act of going out to get food , and politicians and those connected to them are blatantly defying the movement-control order ( MCO ) , the rumblings soon started . Obviously , the pain of lockdown was not meant to be felt by all . Ordinary Malaysians were having to adapt to all sorts of new logistics , including designating only one person to grocery shop , yet some VIPs were shamelessly uploading photos of themselves with their spouses at supermarkets . As of mid-April , almost 15,000 people have been detained for violating the MCO and almost 6,000 have been charged and serving their sentences . None of them is VIPs . <p> As the anger towards the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incompetence and outright idiocies , suddenly things started to pivot away . This was occasioned by the arrival of a boatload of Rohingya refugees and news that other boats had been turned away from Malaysian shores by the Royal Navy .

On social media , Malaysians let loose with the most vicious and dehumanising tirades , using fake posts , deliberately mistranslating statements by Rohingya and viralling purported histories of the Rohingya that could have been written by Wirathu , the Burmese monk who has whipped up outrage against the Muslim minority in Rakhine state . <p> What caused this sudden xenophobic wave of anger ? It 's not as if Malaysia has never hosted any refugees , including Rohingya , before . Despite not signing the United Nations Convention on Refugees , Malaysia has been home to Iranian , Syrian , Palestinian , Yemeni , Karen , Somali and other refugees for decades . Some are waiting for repatriation to third countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with Rohingya is that few countries want them , although Canada , the US , the UK and Australia have resettled some . <p> The plight of persecuted peoples cramped into leaky boats and pushed out into the Andaman Sea , often by unscrupulous human traffickers , who are then not allowed to land in any of the countries nearby , seems to have elicited no sympathy . Yet previously , rallies have been held to support the Rohingya , framed as yet another example of the persecution of Muslims by those of other faiths . Money was raised to aid those who had fled to Bangladesh where they are cramped into unsanitary camps , not allowed to leave . Virtual gulags of misery . <p> Is it any wonder that people would want to escape those places ? Between being burnt to death and being forced to live in dirty hovels , are these the choices that human beings must be forced to accept ? Then to brave the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal without any guarantee there will be safe shores to land on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> But the hate spewed out this time seems several notches more violent and virulent than before . The link with the Covid-19 pandemic and the MCO must surely be there . Here 's what I think is the reason . <p> The MCO has caused more hardship than the government anticipated , if this government anticipated anything at all . People at the bottom of the income scale have lost jobs and are unable to fend for themselves , forcing them to rely on aid from civil societies , individuals and the unreliable and inept government welfare services . Naturally they are angry ; nothing makes a person angrier than when they do n't have enough to eat or are unsure where the next plate of rice will come from . <p> The government has shown scant sympathy for their plight . Some red zones have been thrown into enhanced MCO with barely any notice , leaving residents , most of whom are poor and live in cramped quarters , no time to stock up on food , even if they can afford to get any . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks is not possible . They simply do not have the cash for it . <p> But anger towards the government has been fruitless . Indeed , for years it has been rendered mute until 2018 when the general election gave vent to decades of frustration . But in an act of misplaced timing , the results of that election were overturned by a coup ( by any other name ) just as the Covid-19 had begun raging . <p> What the pandemic has done is expose the many fissures within society , revealing the gaps where the most vulnerable have fallen through . People are expressing shock at photographs of very poor people lying helpless in their shanties , not far different from those they see in media reports of Africa and indeed , Bangladesh . But these are not the newly impoverished . These are people who have been in this state for a long time . Federal Territories Minister Annuar Musa announced on social media he was helping an old man he apparently found in such deprivation that it shook him . But the thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Annuar 's predecessor but one , Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor , was FT minister . <p> Combine that with the general incompetency of this back-door government and anger grows . Leaving aside an obviously oblivious health minister , the many instances of backtracking has generally been eroding trust in authority . First , barbers are allowed to operate . When the public and even barbers themselves objected , the order is withdrawn . Couple that with nonsensical announcements by the new women 's minister and her deputy , two women who seem totally isolated from the problems of real women , and the public began to wonder if they are being led by a government of fools . The only public official who seems to be trusted at all is the director-general of health , Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah , although his popularity also seems to be viewed with suspicion by politicians . <p> Where once the government slogan was Leadership by Example , our current leaders seem bent on being poster boys for misbehaviour . The deputy health minister and a Perak executive councillor were finally hauled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with no jail time . Ordinary Malaysians have been jailed for far less or for being unable to pay the fine . <p> Anger towards the authorities however has no outlet , especially when we are told that we are in a state of emergency that takes priority over everything else . The government on the other hand also needs to deflect that anger away from its ineptitude . A new target needed to be found . What better one than the hapless Rohingya ? They are weaker than the weakest Malaysians who can at least demand some rights as citizens . They have no money , no country , no place to go . <p> But given that they are not the only refugees in Malaysia , what makes the Rohingya different ? Could it be that they look like the poor dark unwashed ? That they seem fit only for cleaning toilets and hauling garbage ? That they do n't seem as educated and suave as the Syrians and the Iranians ? That they seem so visible and do n't look healthy ? <p> I was accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohingya came from Bangladesh and not Myanmar . Yes , perhaps they do , if coming from the teeming camps in Cox 's Bazaar entitles them to be regarded as Bangladeshi . The Bangladeshi government certainly does n't think so . After being on an open boat on the high seas for weeks , how does anyone not look sunburnt and sickly ? I listened with incredulity as a Langkawi politician described the Rohingya boat as costing some RM300,000 as if it was a yacht . <p> Regardless of where they came from or why , why the need to hurl such racist language at them ? Is it not bad enough to attempt to survive under such horrible circumstances without then being subject to insults by people they have always thought of as friendly and faith brethren ? As dire as some of our people find themselves , how can it be equivalent to having your homes burnt down , your women and children hacked to death and survivors being forced to march hundreds of miles to safety to a country that , despite its own myriad problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Ultimately Covid-19 forces us to look at ourselves and what humanity may reside in us . Partial or conditional humanity is not good enough . As Martin Luther King was once quoted as saying , " An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere . " Our local anger is directed at the wrong people , at those who are suffering injustice rather than those perpetrating that injustice . Our anger should be directed not at the Rohingya but at our government , for its neglect of the poorest of us all this time . We should not fall for that time-honoured tool of all authoritarian governments , to divide and rule us , in order to perpetuate a system of inequality so that they remain in power . They are encouraging us to hate the Rohingya , people who have no way of defending themselves , because it makes us forget how they , our leaders , have betrayed us and are not serving us , their own people , in our time of need . When we are asked to sacrifice so much for everyone 's safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been and are still jockeying for posts ? When our jobs mean nothing anymore , why are they clamouring for jobs that by right should also be non-existent ? What is the point of being a director of a government-linked company when there should not be any money to be made from it ? Unless there is . <p> When our own government does not truly care about us , especially those of us who are most in need , then you can almost understand why the perception that they might care about non-citizens becomes a flashpoint for anger . It does n't excuse the vitriol , but we also can not ignore the fact that true education about the Rohingya is being neglected while false histories and propaganda are being circulated instead by trolls , some of whom may have government paymasters . Those who object to this obvious misleading of the public are then targeted for abuse . Interestingly , women , who are the most impacted by the MCO , are among some of the most rabid proponents of hate against the Rohingya . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your oppressors in order to be given whatever scraps they might throw you . <p> What could possibly be gained by heaping such hate upon the Rohingya ? Someone suggested that allowing the Rohingya in is rather like allowing Israeli settlers to build homes in the West Bank . That 's a false equation . Israeli settlers have their government behind them , encouraging them all the way . Their " settlements " look more like Subang Jaya than they do the shanties that the Rohingya , people that no government wants , are forced to live in . <p> The argument has been made also that if we allow the Rohingya to land , they will strain the already limited resources that we have . What limited resources ? Have we run out of food , or is it just badly distributed , with the better-off hoarding more than their share of it ? I look at the newly-devised delivery menus offered by some five-star hotels and a meal for four persons , to be consumed in one sitting , costs at least four times more than the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire lockdown . Civil societies are going through several rounds of fundraising to provide food and essentials to the poor as the MCO continues to be extended , two weeks at a time . The food is always there but individual pockets will soon be empty . Will the government announce that there is no more food , and risk social unrest ? Or will they truly make the effort to ensure that those who truly need sustenance obtain enough ? <p> So far there 's been no such statement of intent . In India , the Kerala chief minister , in announcing his plans to mitigate the effects of Covid-19 , clearly announced that nobody in his state will go hungry . He did n't put any conditions on that goal , because how do you differentiate between one hungry stomach and another ? Or maybe he understood that to feed everyone is to ensure the safety of all . -- April 29 , 2020 . <p> * Marina Mahathir is an activist . <p> * This is the opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are born with gold spoon and have the elite education because of your family status but you forgot that there are so many Malaysian in hunger irrespective of their race and religion .

During a global public health crisis , detention solely for migration-related reasons is unjustifiable . <p> " Immigration detention centres in Malaysia are well known for their poor conditions .

There was also very little interest for federal agencies to coordinate vertically with states and local authorities . <p> Now , let 's go back to the " no confidence vote " by state governments against Muhyiddin 's decision to bring forward the re-opening to May 4 , instead of May 14 , when the 4th MCO period was to end . <p> Hopefully , the prime minister will now realise that the era of one-party-government preeminence over the states and over the civil service effectively ended on May 9 , 2018 . <p> Federal governments before 2018 were able to cajole and compel states into following federal edicts mostly because Umno was also controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running Kelantan since 1990 and several states have been in the hands of Pakatan Rakyat/Harapan since 2008 , UMNO could still exert control through having the Prime Minister dictate to UMNO chief ministers his wishes , and through using federal-appointed civil servants to run affairs in the Pakatan states . <p> This aspect of a New Normal in Malaysian politics is already entrenched . Malaysian prime ministers are no longer able to control the states simply through party affiliation . Muhyiddin does not even control the parties in the Perikatan coalition . No MB or CM is going to do his bidding unless compelled by law . <p> With Muhyiddin having a maximum of only 113 seats in Parliament -- just a seat more than a simple majority -- the civil service is also acting very cautiously . <p> Muhyiddin will have to negotiate his way , all the time . <p> Having a state-level government system in our constitutional structure is now an obvious blessing which Malaysia should make full use of . <p> The state structure is very much the legacy of the 1946 Malayan Union crisis which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unitary state , and instead to adopt the 1948 Federation of Malaya . But be that as it may , federalism today is much more centralised than when it started , especially in terms of statutory powers and finances . That was the framework within which Muhyiddin 's misguided decisions in the last month stems from . <p> In India or Australia , which has almost the same constitutional framework as Malaysia , policing , hospitals and healthcare , and most of the education institutions are the domain of the states , not the federal government . <p> As we prepare for the long haul , surviving Covid-19 will require us to reconsider the roles and functions of the states , and to embrace these into our survival strategies . Devolution of power and the delegation of tasks to the states is the only way to make the struggle an effective and successful one . <p> The ideal situation is that in the years to come , the federal government will share income tax revenue with the states . This is much better than having the different levels of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states to revenues from lands , timber and properties . This current arrangement encourages the states not to be concerned about the climate and the environment . <p> Sharing tax revenue collected in the states will incentivise the states to do more to grow their share of the national economic pie since they would gain directly from it . This will foster federal-state coordination in economic developmental matters . The better a state 's economy , the more taxes there will be for both the eager state and its federal master . <p> With more revenues coming in , states would consequently be able to play a larger role in local policing , education , and health care . <p> When we were at the Defence Ministry , minister Mohamad Sabu and myself , as his deputy , were pushing for a rethinking on the wataniah , or army reservist force . Instead of being a reservist force only augmenting the regulars in a combat setting , the reservists can be trained in disaster relief work as well , so that when a disaster happens in a particular state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. these less-regular soldiers are able to act first in times of state-level emergencies such as floods . If this could be done , states could share the financial burden of running the reservist units and some form of US National Guard arrangement would develop , again adding to the collaborative spirit between the states and the federal government . <p> To move forward in dealing with Covid-19 and future challenges , I would like to suggest that the five states aligned to Pakatan Harapan Plus , namely Penang , Selangor , Negri Sembilan , Kedah and Sabah , get the ball rolling by coordinating more and act as a bloc to give confidence and assurance to the public . <p> The federal government has shown that it really does not know how to coordinate , horizontally or vertically , so it is up to the five Pakatan Plus to come together to formulate decisions and to lead the way into the new normal of democratic and efficient governance . Their tasks are often very concrete ones , and these tasks are all the more important at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -- May 4 , 2020 . <h> Comments <p> " ...... Clearly , the rightful agencies should be the licensing authorities on the ground , which are the local councils , who would know exactly which laundry shops , for example , are situated on which streets , and what their concrete situation is like ....... " <p> " ....... Devolution of power and the delegation of tasks to the states is the only way to make the struggle an effective and successful one ... " <p> ======&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So why did n't the Pakatan Harapan government devolved power to the local councils by REFUSING to have local council elections ? ? ? <p> So that Bersatu ( under the " Father of Corruption " and leaders of other parties ) can reward their " macais " by hook or by crook just like PM is currently doing ? ? ?

@@41970240 <h> By Danny Lim July 24 , 2017 <p> AS BUSINESSES undertake digital transformations , it becomes increasingly important to take steps to secure their data . <p> The propensity of a secure digital environment is largely being propelled by the rising demand for mobile and smart devices , cannibalising both enterprise and consumer markets . The need for enhanced security authentication leveraging on new technology tools offers significant advantages over traditional access controls . <p> Biometrics security is increasingly gaining interest as a key tool , and it is important for companies to know how best to harness its benefits . <p> The rise of biometrics in enterprise security <p> The government sector including border control , national identification and law enforcement agencies have been early adopters of biometrics . High-risk industries such as the banking sector are investing heavily in biometrics as well . <p> According to Frost &amp; Sullivan , in 2015 , banks and financial institutions spent approximately US$350 million on voice biometrics , with spending likely to double to US$700 million by 2019 . <p> The need for data security has grown , as consumers and industries incorporate the use of electronics in everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely being propelled by the rising demand for mobile and smart devices , cannibalising both the enterprise and consumer markets . <p> We are also seeing growing demand for biometrics applications for identity authentication and online transactions across multiple industries . <p> In Pwc 's Global State of Information Security Survey 2017 , biometrics was cited by 40% of executives as the priority safeguard organisations will be looking into in the coming 12 months . <p> Understanding the challenges of biometrics security <p> Biometrics presents certain unique challenges that might not arise from conventional methods such as password or paper documents . <p> Privacy is a significant concern among individuals using biometrics for identification . Biometrics is also inherently device-dependent . Almost all biometrics features and applications required is device-specific for individuals to get access to their sensitive information . <p> Another challenge for biometrics users and solutions carriers is that because of the multi-party system , the need to establish a biometrics propriety solution can diminish especially when there are more than two or three parties in the same working environment process . <p> There are different users with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device management profiles that are not controlled by the carrier . This could reduce standardization in working processes and policies , and decrease productivity due to lack of collaboration , resulting in poorer company performance . <p> Hence , new policy and biometrics security enhancement measures beyond devices are extremely important and essential for the future cybersecurity landscape . <p> The ultimate level of accountability : A hybrid approach to biometrics security <p> An effective biometric authentication needs to be permanent , universal , distinctive and easy to collect . Combining biometric authentication with existing access control , such as tokens , passwords or PINs provides the ultimate level of accountability . <p> With various biometric technologies available , organisations should consider five factors to select the most appropriate system : cost effectiveness , accuracy , ease of use , environment , and safety . <p> Cost effectiveness <p> Choose a biometric system that is right for the organisation 's budget . Weigh the costs of implementing and operating the application against the potential returns of investment in terms of strengthened security , improved user experience , and decreased amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accuracy <p> Accuracy is an important factor to consider while choosing between the various biometric technologies . It is based on several criteria such as the False Acceptance Rate ( FAR ) and False Rejection Rate ( FRR ) . <p> FAR measures the percentage of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted . FRR determines the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database . <p> Ease of use <p> Each person should be able to use the biometric application regardless of age , gender , ethnic origin or profession . Users should also be able to use the application even if they are wearing glasses , contact lenses or a beard , using a wheelchair , have high or low blood pressure , illness , using oils or creams on their skins , or have external injuries . <p> Environment <p> Consider the physical environment of your organisation in which the biometric application will be implemented . Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity can affect the quality of data gathered . <p> Safety <p> Biometric applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , institutes or organisations approve of the technology implemented . Should users be concerned with hygiene , organisations can consider applications such as palm-vein recognition technology that offer contactless operation . <p> Conclusion <p> The application of biometrics for identification across markets led by convergence trends affecting biometrics technology providers , ICT networks , security and cloud storage industries , at risk verticals such as banking , healthcare , and retail as well as OEMs and device manufacturers including smartphone makers is set to stay . <p> New developments and systems including encrypting biometric data on features like finger prints and palm-vein scanner technology can potentially be major security tools for the biometric industry . A strong and robust biometrics security authentication solution will help organisations secure their networks against unauthorised access , while also reducing the risk of attack from hackers and identity thieves .

The push for the Internet of Things ( IoT ) will also contribute to the rise in the number of connected devices . <p> Connectivity has enabled the creation of a borderless work environment which benefits many multinational companies based here in Asia . From a growth strategy point of view , connectivity has also opened up the possibilities of expansion into new geographic locations and market segments . <p> Connectivity has also shaped the way employees work and how internal operations take place . Travel has been reduced with more emphasis on virtual meetings , and job scopes have also evolved with the increased capability to communicate more regularly and to more parts of the world . <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access company resources at anytime , anywhere , from devices like smartphones , tablets and laptops . The proliferation of smart devices , complemented by the adoption of cloud computing , has definitely contributed to the growth . <p> However , this convenience comes at a price . The rise of Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) signifies that many employees are using their own devices to communicate and access the company infrastructure . <p> While this removes the need for companies to provide devices , it also means more unprotected devices tapping onto the network . <p> Moreover , a lot of companies do not have stringent BYOD policies . This exposes organisations to more security vulnerabilities and decentralises their digital environments . <p> While technologies , tools and platforms have advanced , companies continue to rely on traditional protection technologies like firewalls , antivirus and intrusion detection systems to prevent breaches . <p> Cybercriminals are also becoming more sophisticated with new tactics , techniques and procedures to circumvent traditional solutions . <p> Enterprises today require a comprehensive security solution in a landscape where a perimeter-based approach has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies purchasing specific security solutions to maintain data integrity , which creates an issue because a piecemeal approach hampers the IT departments from having complete visibility over the identities ' of employee access to corporate networks . <p> This results in holding up employee productivity while business demands take a backseat . <p> At the same time , users demand quick , remote access to corporate resources . Companies may not always be able to address these needs , and this eventually leads to a situation that will begin to frustrate internal and external stakeholders in a world that demands instant access to resources and applications . <p> A delayed response to access issues will eventually lead to employees and business units to disregard IT rules and take matters into their own hands -- the rise of ' shadow IT . ' <p> These covert IT applications , solutions and systems are created and applied to internal networks in order to get the job done . <p> However , this overrides security policies , procedures and tools placed to prevent corporate and personal data loss , opening the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reputation of the organisation . <p> IT departments typically only realise the identities of the offenders when technical problems develop , or when internal integration with corporate applications are required . <p> Such instances call for organisations to ensure that IT departments recognise the need for identity access in order to assume an authoritative role . <p> From a company 's security perspective , identity is important by virtue of being the only tangible concept of a foundation to ensure that only the right people have access to the right resources in a corporate network . <p> This is similar to the concept of owning a driver 's licence , a recognised identification document issued by a governing party that can be used for access in multiple environments . <p> Such a policy would vastly improve the horde of users accessing corporate resources , but allow businesses to achieve sustainable compliance across the enterprise . <p> In a data-enriched world , it 's inevitable that businesses will seek to constantly be one step ahead by taking advantage of analytics to directly impact company growth .

@@41984230 <h> Strange case of Muhyiddin , part 2 <h> Share this article <p> AT Sheraton Hotel in the early hours of May 10 , 2018 , the mild-mannered Muhyiddin Yassin pulled me and Lim Kit Siang aside to ask DAP to support a Bersatu candidate for the post of Johor menteri besar . He needed the favour to acknowledge his contribution to swinging the state 's vote to Pakatan Harapan . <p> Despite DAP winning the largest number of seats in the state assembly at 14 , compared to Amanah with nine , Bersatu ( 8 ) and PKR ( 5 ) , DAP was not claiming the post of MB . Kit Siang was open for discussion . After DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng consulted Amanah president Mohamad Sabu , DAP agreed to support Muhyiddin 's nominee for MB . <p> On May 11 , 2018 , the Johor sultan sent an aircraft to pick up Muhyiddin from Kuala Lumpur . I tagged along . It was my first-ever experience on a private jet . <p> Three months earlier , on February 8 , 2018 , Muhyiddin and I travelled together on a Malindo flight after a Johor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy prime minister , he travelled on a government jet dedicated to him . <p> As an opposition leader without any privileges , Muhyiddin said he felt good that people appreciated our struggle . When he was in Barisan Nasional , he did not experience random members of the public paying for his meals at coffee shops or warung to show their support . The public enthusiasm was very encouraging . <p> On that May 2018 flight , Muhyiddin 's aide told me that it was the team 's first experience flying aboard a private jet since their boss was sacked as DPM in July 2015 . They felt great with the 14th general election because we created history by doing the right thing for the nation , albeit Muhyiddin 's personal sufferings between 2015 and 2018 . <p> The next day , May 12 , 2018 , PH decided on Muhyiddin as home minister , Mat Sabu as defence minister and Guan Eng as finance minister . <p> And the following day , I was at Muhyiddin 's house , just me and him . He was feeling dejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all positions the night before , because his request to be made finance minister was turned down by Dr Mahathir Mohamad . He was persuaded to stay on . <p> He also told me that in 1995 , being the Umno vice-president with the highest number of votes , and after serving as Johor MB for nine years , he moved to the federal level expecting to hold a senior economic portfolio . But Dr Mahathir as prime minister appointed him only to the most junior position of youth and sports minister . He informed me that Anwar Ibrahim told him to be patient and wait for 1998 , hinting that Muhyiddin would be his choice of DPM . <p> In deep reflection that tranquil morning , Muhyiddin told me that after more than 20 years , after being DPM for six years ( 2009 to 2015 ) , would he still go on to serve as Anwar 's deputy should the transition of power between Dr Mahathir and Anwar happen ? Between us , there were no answer . <p> Muhyiddin was diagnosed with cancer in July 2018 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once by myself , and the second time , I accompanied Guan Eng . I considered Muhyiddin an elderly friend , and was really worried about his health . <p> In the months following his gradual recovery , at many of our meetings , he confided in me that he was thinking of calling it quits . The illness had changed his perspective on life . <p> The Johor quandary <p> On April 24 last year , after Muhyiddin and Dr Mahathir clashed over the choice of Mazlan Bujang as Johor Bersatu chief , I was with him at his Home Ministry office . He told me that he was thinking of throwing in the towel as Dr Mahathir would n't listen to his views even though Johor was his home state . Muhyiddin was chairman of the state Pakatan Harapan council . <p> Muhyiddin was upset , but still signed Mazlan 's appointment letter . He told me that Bersatu 's constitution dictated that as president , he had to consult with and accept the decisions of the chairman , Dr Mahathir . <p> In subsequent meetings over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still bitter with the Bersatu chairman over the choice of Mazlan as chief of the state chapter . <p> On June 6 last year , Muhyiddin told me he had mostly recovered from his illness . His doctor , who sat with us at the open house of Muhyiddin 's son , also said he was recovering very well . I was relieved to hear the news . <p> Fast forward to last October . The attempted political coup by the troika of Mohamed Azmin Ali , Hishammuddin Hussein and Hamzah Zainudin kicked up racial sentiments on both the Malay and non-Malay ends . It was an attempt to form a new Malay-unity coalition government without the participation of DAP and Amanah . <p> Muhyiddin was very concerned that " divergent views among us because of different ideological beliefs are becoming more pronounced now " . The viability of Bersatu-DAP coalition relations was being seriously questioned , and there was huge pressure from the hawks in Bersatu on him to act against DAP . <p> He hosted a small dinner between top Bersatu and DAP leaders on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both parties agreed that the extreme narratives on the Malay and non-Malay fronts were resulting in us suffering in the middle . We should do more to hold the coalition together . <p> The meeting effectively , but temporarily , fended off the attempted coup that month by Azmin , Hishammuddin and Hamzah using DAP as a bogeyman . <p> However , PH 's image did not recover , especially when abused racially by its opponents . <p> On the night of November 16 last year , I was in the operations room with Muhyiddin and his inner circle , watching the results of the Tg Piai by-election streaming in . The demoralised Muhyiddin commented that " this is worse than a tsunami . " <p> Peculiar moves , stranger motives <p> A special PH presidential council meeting was held on November 23 last year , with the sole agenda of discussing the presentation by Muhyiddin as chairman of the PH election campaign committee . <p> He outlined the following political challenges : <p> -- Racial sentiments resulting in negative effect on PH 's standing ; <p> - Malays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chinese perceiving that PH was controlled by Bersatu and Dr Mahathir ; <p> -- The question of transition of power between the seventh and eighth PMs caused the perception that the PH government was not stable ; and , <p> -- The PH cabinet was perceived as incompetent . <p> He proposed that PH : <p> -- Handle the issues of race and religion wisely by taking a more moderate and cautious approach ; <p> -- Change the image of DAP being anti-Malay , and Bersatu , anti-Chinese ; <p> -- Discipline party members who criticise their own party or leaders of another PH component ; <p> -- Handle the transition of power between the seventh and eighth PMs wisely ; and , <p> -- Reshuffle the cabinet to show that PH has a high-performance cabinet . <p> Muhyiddin said PH should work to recover to a level of 60% public approval within a year 's time . <p> After the special meeting , and as Parliament went into recess , Muhyiddin went on an overseas trip in late December and parts of January .

The then defence minister confided in me that he was worried that Muhyiddin had a new idea that was against the basic principles of PH . <p> It seemed that Muhyiddin was thinking of some form of Malay-unity government , and he was no longer keen on Anwar becoming the next PM . <p> On January 31 , I attended a Chinese New Year event with Muhyiddin in Grisek , in his Pagoh constituency . Subsequently , I visited Muhyiddin at his house for a long chat on February 5 . <p> He was very friendly to me , as always . But I detected a change in his view . For him , if nothing changed in PH , Bersatu would lose badly in the next general election .

But I believed he was still weighing his options . <p> I thought that the honourable Muhyiddin , who always saw the bigger picture and was prepared to concede to Dr Mahathir in 2017 , would probably still be there . I hoped that the Muhyiddin who repeatedly thought of quitting would not be tempted by worldly positions , but would think about his legacy . <p> But , he is only human . Perhaps , the temptation was so great that he could n't resist anymore . Perhaps , his frustration with Dr Mahathir , the prompting of the Malay troika of Azmin , Hishammuddin and Hamzah , and his own ultimate ambition of becoming PM finally tilted him towards the Sheraton Move on February 23 . <p> I am sad that my elderly friend Muhyiddin has chosen this path .

This hope-raising impression drives people to stake virtually all their material possessions to leave home , loved ones and friends in search of their dream of a better life . <p> Yet the first obstacle to present itself to the would-be migrant are the immigration authorities of these countries , in the embassies or at border crossings i.e. airports , ports , railway border posts , highway border check points etc . Potential migrants find themselves suddenly exposed to the reality of the workings of immigration at these places . <p> Support the struggle to build a New Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> Many experienced and inexperienced travellers tend to dismiss this as one of the hazards of migration . While it may seem to be the case , an experience of immigration processing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was so wonderfully just and fair . <p> It must be realised that immigration is a selection process and that it is the most opaque department of a country 's government machinery . Its values are seemingly different from other state agencies , particularly of apparently democratic countries in the world . There is nothing transparent about this department , although it may give the applicant limited information which may or may not make any sense . <p> Immigration policies change like the weather , catching the potential migrant , in every way it possibly can . Often , even if the applicant meets all the criteria stated and gives honest information on themselves and their purpose for wanting to migrate , immigration can ferret out any excuse to deny the honest applicant entry clearance to a country for obviously spurious reasons , if not outright refusals for apparently no real reason at all . <p> Visa applicants are asked for myriad personal details , many of which are confidential e.g. how much money one has , details of who their parents are , when and where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in , relatives living in the country the applicant is going to , their addresses and contact details , marital status , if they have a criminal record etc . Original or certified copies of documents as well as photocopies for the convenience of the immigration officer who will decide on whether one should have entry clearance into the country are compulsory requirements . In certain cases , the decision of this first level officer is ' unappealable ' and ' unchallengeable ' , even if it is seen as blatantly unfair or unjust . <p> So , the visa applicants would have wasted their time and in many cases their money , merely going through the proper channels and submitting a visa application . This can run into thousands of local or foreign currency , depending on what currency the immigration authorities of that foreign country demand . Sometimes , the expense incurred in preparing a visa application to submit to these foreign immigration authorities can be compared to a capital layout for an investment in the country the migrant is going to . <p> Developed countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middlemen immigration agents , which obviously gets a cut of the visa application fees for their services to the various immigration authorities of the countries who use them .

The potential tourist or migrant should be aware of such pitfalls and make an informed decision by visiting the websites of any country they intend to visit or migrate to . Otherwise , they would be wasting a considerable portion of their resources and time in the application process . <p> Further , it would be wise for any would-be tourist to visit the embassy websites of foreign countries to ascertain what documents they should carry with them to show the foreign immigration officer at the counter on landing in the country , even if the immigration section of the website says , short term visitors from particular countries or regions do n't need to apply for visas , or may get visa on arrival . <p> Expectations of a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country .

So , would it be worth it if one was simply going on a two-week vacation ? <p> Hitting border barriers <p> Security traps <p> An Iranian friend once said , about two decades ago , that on landing in the United States , persons from particular countries , including Iran were separated from the main queue of people lining up to go through immigration .

Footwear had to be removed when going through immigration , and lines of people could be seen sitting on seats and airport floors taking off or putting on their shoes . Since then , migrant paranoia seems to have stayed on ' high ' . <p> It is clear to ordinary migrants that migration is potholed with security issues in many countries and any misunderstood ordinary migrant , particularly those who ca n't speak and understand little of the country 's local language , may inadvertently fall into any of these ruts and be blacklisted for virtually no good reason . However , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their saving grace , but this does at times , prove to be the reverse .

At the time of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland , a rosary ( prayer beads ) found in the possession of a Catholic person may be deemed a suspicious object , as Catholics were generally under suspicion . It was worse for young Irish Catholics . <p> There are many other examples that illustrate the security link to migration and the obviously cold reception migrants receive at the borders of some developed western democracies which claim to be advocates and protectors of human rights .

With this possibility in view , conditions are placed on migrants allowed into a country . <p> About a decade ago , foreign students in UK universities were barred from taking up any work for the whole duration of their studies . It must be admitted that some Malaysian students did contravene this condition to supplement their tuition fees and living expenses while they were there . There were also some who illegally overstayed but escaped the immigration dragnets for unknown reasons . <p> However , not all migrants are apt to try to find loopholes in immigration conditions , and many do go through the proper channels if their circumstances change . The UK , being a country with an established welfare system after World War Two , was at one time a popular destination for families for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the global economy and the resulting downturns in national economy , increasing cutbacks have been made in social security benefits and the state National Health Service . Over the past 20 years , higher education has also seen cutbacks , and now home students do n't receive grants but have to obtain study loans or take up jobs to pay for their tertiary education . That the European economy is not at its peak now is global common knowledge . <p> Ironically , UK immigration seems to maintain the myth that this country is still a popular destination for migrants who want to ' grab ' unemployment benefits given to unemployed locals . Many former British colonies that do n't have similar welfare social security systems are now coming up on their own steam and have achieved a reasonably high level of development like India and Singapore . There are others that are similarly on the rise , where local populations remain in the country , although some may migrate to find suitable jobs or job opportunities . <p> But the UK and some other western democracies still keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out those they expect will ' sponge ' on their social security systems , making rather arbitrary immigration decisions , which bar beneficial migrants as well as non-beneficial migrants . <p> Paradoxically , immigration authorities seem to categorise migrants according to their nationality and the political relationship with the migrants ' country of origin . This may split up families where migrants who have become British citizens still have family members of different nationalities who may be barred from visiting them on the basis that they may remain with their British family once they come into the UK . <p> As some of these cases are not properly examined or investigated , with embassy immigration officers perhaps neglecting to interview particular visa applicants to ascertain their true intentions , the decisions made can be completely arbitrary and unjust based only on unproven and false presumptions . How fair and efficient then is border regulation ? <p> Overall , the immigration process sometimes makes no logical sense altogether -- being opaque and closely linked to national security and economic sustainability . The nature of immigration control raises a plethora of questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption , inhumane treatment of migrants , and actual policy decisions . The whole system sometimes seems to have little to do with honesty , justice , reasonableness or even logic . <p> Even though , migration has become a part of our lives for various reasons , potential migrants must be aware that immigration controls are the pivots of migration . The ability to migrate to a better situation depends on the immigration regulation system of all foreign countries . Developed nations sometimes turn out to be mere limes or lemons . Good to see but impossible to eat whole . Some will even leave a bitter aftertaste because of their immigration policies , procedures and personnel . <p> ( Visited 46 times , 1 visits today ) <p> Thanks for dropping by !

@@41999232 <h> Perodua Kancil -- a modern take by Theophilus Chin <p> The Perodua Kancil turned 25 last August , and it arrived on the scene as Malaysia 's most affordable new car when it was launched in 1994 . It reached 500,000 units in its second generation , with the milestone car being produced in April 2003 . What would a present-day version look like ? <p> Rendering whiz Theophilus Chin has offered his take on this . Given the Kancil 's Daihatsu Mira origins , Theo 's rendition retains the kei car proportions albeit with more simplified shutlines and creases compared to the current Daihatsu , particularly around the front end . In a tip of the hat to the original , the present-day rendition also sports a bee-sting antenna at the front of its roof . <p> At the back , the slight curvature of the C-pillar is somewhat reminiscent of the first-generation Myvi/Daihatsu Sirion , though here the digital rendition of the smaller car also depicts a simplified set of tail lights which are set lower down and interface with the rear bumper . Similarly , its design in profile is also simplfied , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door sections . <p> The simplified bodywork is in keeping with the Kancil 's budget-conscious roots , and its rolling stock is comprised of steel wheels with plastic covers , says Theo . That said , the modern-day Kancil has been imagined here to be slightly heavier at 900 kg when compared to the original , as the artist imagines the new car to wear thicker sheet metal along with added safety features such as airbags , ABS and stability control . <p> Theo also rendered a version of the Kancil in base-spec trim <p> This figure would in fact make it heavier than the Axia , despite measuring marginally smaller on most dimensions -- the new Kancil is rendered to be 3,540 mm long with a 2,420 mm wheelbase , 1,641 mm wide and 1,489 mm tall ; this compares to the Axia which is 3,640 mm long with a 2,455 mm wheelbase , 1,620 mm wide ( the rendered Kancil is 21 mm wider on this count ) and 1,510 mm tall . <p> Its styling also makes for an interesting counterpoint to the entry-level Perodua of today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more angular approach to its exterior styling , while Theo 's rendition maintains much of the original 's friendly ' face ' and a more minimalist set of lines throughout . <p> The rendering maestro has also made a ' driving school-spec ' base model , replete with unpainted mirror covers and bumpers , and which Theo says will have wind-up windows , manually-adjusted mirrors , no power steering and no central locking . Should this come to light , might this entry-level variant dip under the RM25,000 mark in today 's money ? <p> The Kancil was succeeded by the Viva which arrived on the scene in 2007 , though it remained on sale for a further two years as a more affordable option . The two continued on Perodua 's model line-up until the Kancil bowed out in July 2009 , with the nameplate reaching a tally of 722,223 units , and the Axia made its debut in 2014 . What do you think of Theo 's idea for a modern-day Kancil , dear readers ? <p> Open roads and closed circuits hold great allure for Mick Chan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on twisty paths ; prizes ergonomics and involvement over gadgetry . Spent three years at a motoring newspaper and short stint with a magazine prior to joining this website . <p> Ya , furthermore the Axia nameplate sounds like total shit ( read as A Xai ) , but anyhow both still a Game Over cars with ridiculous pricing ( previous Kancil sold at RM35k , and A Xai sold at nearly RM45k with crap bodyshell ) . <p> if Perodua is going to make a new Kancil , it better have the same dimensions as the previous one . It 's compactness is what defines its existence . super small and super light . very easy to park and navigate tight spots . <p> I feel that this would have been better as a successor to the Kelisa than the Kancil . The Kancil was produced as a means to liberate the masses through cheaper transport , and I think the Axia is doing that well . This car should posit as a left field option for those wanting something just a bit different , maybe better handling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kinda like what I think the Kelisa was meant to be . <p> I love my kancil 850 2001 version.its sooo compact n easy to park anywhere . I keep it as my antique car.difficult to get spare parts though . It should return in the market especially when the economy is not getting better for the next few yrs . i m waiting to see the next version <p> You can either post as a guest or have an option to register .

You see several cars braking in front of you because there seems to be a slight standstill . You apply your brakes too and come to a stop . Few seconds later , BOOM ! The car behind you could not jam the brakes in time and your rear-end is in a bad shape right now . <p> Rear-end collisions are more common than you think in Malaysia . Most of it is caused by the driver 's lack of attention , distraction , sudden panic ( the driver probably saw a cat or a dog cross the road . It happens ) , or speeding and not having enough time to jam the brakes in time ( we call this cockiness on the road ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to be upset .

Try and identify the situation and TURN ON YOUR HAZARD LIGHTS <p> Once the collision happens , try to breathe and stay calm . It 's completely normal to have a rush of emotions but it helps to try and calm down . Turn on your hazard lights , this is especially important if the collision happened on a highway and/or at night . Next check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are passengers on board , check if they have been injured in any way . Identifying the situation is important for the next few steps . <p> 2 .

Be sure to take a photo of the vehicle number plate and just in case , the damage done on both vehicles . It 's better to also take a photo of the road tax of the collider 's vehicle . Calmly ask the collider to move his/her car to the side of the road to discuss other formalities . <p> 3 . Fighting and arguing is a complete WASTE OF TIME <p> Look , you can feel frustrated and annoyed with the situation . But fighting and arguing is not going to help in any way . It would not fix your car or the situation . In some cases , the collider would probably try to intimidate and fight back .

There are also cases where the driver does not have a valid license , is underage and a variety of different reasons . <p> In the case where the road tax is expired , you will have to file for claims through a court . Be sure to take photos of the collider 's IC and get their personal details . Keep in mind , a court proceeding will take a long time .

Through those years , it produced more than 200,000 graduates , with its alumni even including present DAP leaders . <p> Millions of ringgit have flowed into the college , and anyone who has run an institution of higher learning would know that it hardly sets the cash registers ringing . Just survey the market -- many private colleges and private universities are up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university college named after Tunku Abdul Rahman , was set up in 1969 by the MCA . In 2013 , it was bestowed university college status . It 's 75ha main campus is located on Jalan Genting Kelang , Kuala Lumpur . It has five branches , one each in Penang , Perak , Johor , Pahang and Sabah , with an accumulated enrolment of more than 28,000 local and international students . With the upgrade to university college ( UC ) status , it can now offer bachelor 's degrees and postgraduate programmes . <p> But what has made TAR UC so special and tugged at the heartstrings of the Chinese is higher education becoming affordable and accessible to the community . <p> It was set up at a time when places were limited in the mere five public universities in Malaysia -- Universiti Malaya , Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia , Universiti Sains Malaysia , Universiti Pertanian Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia . <p> Today , we can barely keep count of the number of public and private universities and colleges . But even with the plethora of options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly secure jobs , since its array of courses are practical and marketable . <p> TAR UC is supported by seven faculties in undergraduate degree programmes , namely the Faculty of Applied Sciences , Faculty of Computing and Information Technology , Faculty of Accountancy , Finance and Business , Faculty of Engineering and Technology , Faculty of Built Environment , Faculty of Communication and Creative Industries and Faculty of Social Science and Humanities . <p> There is also the Centre for Pre-University Studies and the newest , the Centre for Postgraduate Studies and Research , which offers a variety of master 's and PhD programmes . <p> Having interacted with many TAR UC graduates , I 've found them humble , hungry and hardworking , a sentiment echoed by many employers , too . They may not be extroverts or the most eloquent , seeming a little timid and quiet even , but they compensate with their other qualities . <p> Honestly , employers are looking for quality workers and not just smooth talkers only good at presentation and public relations , with little to show in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will go a long way in helping TAR UC and its students who need financial aid . <p> Most significant is , the RM58mil will no longer be channelled through a third party . <p> This departs from the decision made by the Pakatan Harapan government , when former Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng insisted that TAR UC founder MCA must cede control of it to continue receiving government funds . <p> Explaining the RM58mil allocation , Dr Wee said the Finance Ministry retrieved the remaining RM18mil of the RM40mil that Lim had allocated to TAA 's trust fund previously . The fund , Tarcian Alumni Association Education Trust Fund ( TAA-ETF ) , has seen some of Lim 's critics claiming it even includes businessmen close to the DAP . <p> Although there are five alumni associations dating back to 1980 , only TAA -- which was set up only in 2012 -- was selected . <p> The other alumni associations include the Federation of Tunku Abdul Rahman College Alumni Associations ( founded in 1989 ) , the Tunku Abdul Rahman University College Engineering Alumni Association , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , both established in 1982 , and the Tunku Abdul Rahman College School of Business Studies Ex-students Association , set up in 1980 . <p> Dr Wee said the allocation by Lim to TAA-ETF was on an ad-hoc basis , an arrangement that was n't detailed in the national budget . <p> " To carry out the government 's commitment since the establishment of TAR UC , previously known as TAR College , a matching grant of RM40mil will be channelled to the university college through the Higher Education Ministry this year under Budget 2020 , " said Dr Wee , who is also TAR UC Education Foundation Board of Trustees ' chairman . <p> To cut a long story short , Lim wanted the MCA to severe ties with TAR UC , which the party set up and supported financially for over 50 years . It was to punish the MCA , basically . <p> For many Chinese , the act was simply unnecessary and even seemed vindictive . <p> The result was the Chinese voters revolted , lucidly reflected in the Tanjung Piai by-election , where MCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority . <p> According to a news report , Chinese voters -- who overwhelmingly supported Pakatan Harapan ( Pakatan ) in 2018 -- were the most unaccepting of the pact during the Tanjung Piai by-election , revealed findings by independent research firm Ilham Centre . <p> It said voters were disenchanted with Pakatan 's unfulfilled pledges , poor communication and leadership , and were generally unhappy with the state of the economy . <p> " The biggest sway or protest votes came from the Chinese , which was 34.5% , while Pakatan only lost about 5.1% of votes from the original votes during GE14 . <p> One sore point was Lim 's refusal to hand TAR UC its RM30mil allocation , but the final straw was his slashing of its government allocation from RM5.5mil to RM1mil under Budget 2020 . <p> One of the most unfair criticisms of MCA in many elections has been its perceived lack of contribution to the Chinese community , with finger pointers even including parents and graduates of TAR UC and Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman ( Utar ) . <p> The irony is , TAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pro-Opposition areas . Even Utar in Kampar , Perak , is in a pro-DAP parliamentary constituency .

Over the past two decades , more than 2,500 pre-school teachers graduated with recognised professional accreditations from this institution . <p> It has n't been an easy ride for the MCA , given how it has been chastised and rejected by the Chinese community , for whom the party was founded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painful as they are for its leaders , have also come from those who have benefited from these programmes . <p> As with all things , it 's always much easier to cast aspersions than to build and run these institutions which have produced many graduates . <p> The loudest politicians include those who have n't even set up a kindergarten , let alone college or university . <p> Wong Chun Wai began his career as a journalist in Penang , and has served The Star for over 35 years in various capacities and roles .

@@42084230 <h> Everyday Matters : Why waste a good crisis ? <p> There are a few situations that matter where leaders have to make absolutely good decisions . A crisis is one of them . And the present pandemic is as good a social and economic crisis as any . With millions of lives at stake , we look to leaders who are able to make decisions on the fly and , in some cases , to make the hard decisions , the ones they know are not going to win them any points . <p> Leaders who take action , who are decisive and who are open to adapting their decisions to suit the needs of a situation are going to have more success weathering a crisis than those who choose to wait and wait and not take action . Leadership is not defined when the going is easy ; where the path is straight and well worn . Leaders are created in the furnace of chaos and in the uncertainty of a crisis . <p> A tough crisis can really separate the wheat from the chaff . While a few , like Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding her nation through this social and economic turmoil , many have failed miserably , baring their inability for the world to see . <p> If , as a leader , you can confront the facts of your current situation with the right mindset , you are on the path to leading through the chaos . You must know where you are if you are to take any step forward . <p> The late Commander James Stockdale was the highest-ranking American prisoner of war in Hanoi during the Vietnam War . When asked by famed author Jim Collins how he survived his seven years in the prisoner camp he said , " You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end -- which you can never afford to lose -- with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality , whatever they might be . " <p> This statement is often called the Stockdale Paradox and it describes a required duality during hardship , that is be optimistic and have faith that you will prevail , but make sure you start from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand your current environment and situation without any cognitive bias . <p> The whole world heaved a collective sigh of relief recently when Ardern announced that the last of New Zealand 's local known Covid-19 cases had recovered , making the country arguably the first to achieve a clean bill of health since the current pandemic hit nations across the globe . This virus can be contained , and the Kiwis have shown us it can be done . <p> Many have heaped heady praise on the leadership shown by Ardern and her ministers in tackling this deadly health crisis and equally , many are eager to learn how they have done it . Case of " Let 's not waste a good crisis " ? You betcha ! <p> The bad news is , there is no handy manual out there that can guide leaders through a crisis . While there can be certain protocols in place that prevent a crisis from happening , each crisis is unique in its own way , with its own set of problems and will usually require a different approach from the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government do it ? I have dissected its actions , compared it with others around the world and unearthed some interesting findings . <p> While there have been condemnations of inaction or delays in action by many governments in the same situation , the New Zealand leadership acted swiftly -- the leaders lost no time in confronting the looming crisis . They started from where they were . They acknowledged the danger and their unpreparedness , and set out to correct it . The Stockdale Paradox in action . Failure to them was never an option . <p> Ardern got her team together , discussed the crisis as honestly as they could , and then held a pre-mortem . A pre-mortem focuses on working out all the possible things that could go wrong based on the current situation . In engineering , this step is called a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis ( FMEA ) and is used to build a case for safety and chart the risks . They analysed what failures could there be , and what the effects of those failures are . <p> They then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can stop these scenarios from eventuating , or getting to their worst . They then consulted the World Health Organization playbook . The goal was to find high-value , low-cost mitigations . <p> Once done , they crafted an action plan to get the country out of the crisis . In normal times , it is easy for a leader to determine the best ways to ensure success . This is not the case during a crisis . The leader must find the means without rancour , to get the country to acknowledge that it is now sadly on its back , before considering establishing an appropriate recovery strategy . <p> The final ingredient was to communicate the situation without overstating or understating it . In times of crisis , the hardest job of a leader is getting your communication right . You can not be too positive , and you can not be too pessimistic . You need to find credible aspiration and drive your communication to that . It is time for credibility -- to be honest , trustworthy and only slightly aspirational . <p> Most importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " say-do " gap , you ask ? Stanley McChrystal , a former US general , called the gap between words and actions the " say-do " gap . This is the most important part of being heard . If you had announced that you were laying off 20% of your workforce but then you immediately hire three new managers , you have a " say-do " gap . Eliminate your " say-do " gap , and you increase your credibility . It does not matter what you say if you can not be seen doing it yourself . <p> While we are encouraged that we may finally have a handle on the virus , it is nigh impossible to be prepared for a crisis . And neither can the next one be avoided . The most important thing to remember is that all crises do pass . Like you , I can not wait for this one to pass too . <p> Zakie Shariff is managing partner of Kuber Venture Bhd , a specialist investment company .

But Google 's 2014 decision to publish the racial and gender breakdown of its workforce appeared to signal a sea change . <p> The numbers revealed an industry dominated by white and Asian men .

Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , as other major Silicon Valley companies began releasing their own diversity numbers , Google announced it would dedicate US$150mil ( RM642.75mil ) to increasing diversity at the company . <p> In the years since , Google has more than doubled its workforce but made minimal progress toward a more representative one . The numbers are similar across the industry . <p> This lack of diversity -- as of May , Google reported that 5.9% of its employees and contractors are Latino and 3.7% are Black -- extends up through the ranks of top executives , entrepreneurs who found companies , and venture capitalists who invest in startups . <p> The industry , which prides itself on agility , has failed to move the needle on workplace diversity . The net result is an entire sector of the economy -- the sector that has created the most wealth in California in the last 10 years , minted billionaires , and reshaped the San Francisco Bay Area in its own image -- that is functionally barely open to Black and Latino people . <p> Tech leaders have often pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Black hiring and promotion . But in 2016 , 12% of graduates with a degree in science , technology , engineering or math were Black , according to the National Center for Education Statistics . Even the graduating class of computer science majors at Stanford , Silicon Valley 's elite training ground , is more diverse than the companies just down the road from campus . <p> Whether you set targets based on the national population or STEM graduates , few tech companies come close , said Freada Kapor Klein , a founding partner at the venture capital firm Kapor Capital who 's been advocating for increasing diversity in tech for decades . <p> " There are a lot of hard and fast numbers you could use to set the goalposts , " Kapor Klein said . " But ( tech companies ) are n't even in the parking lot -- they 're so far from the field they need binoculars to see them . " <p> The problem , in Kapor Klein 's estimation , is not one of education but of access and support . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on personal relationships to grant access and opportunity is partly to blame , producing a network effect that militates against Black and Latino inclusion . <p> Kanyi Maqubela , managing partner of Kindred Ventures , said that the industry 's reliance on personal relationships perpetuates a system of gate-keeping that is almost designed to keep investors like him out . <p> Black investors make up less than 1% of venture capitalists . And it 's a small world to begin with . In 2018 , just 713 individual investors at large venture funds , defined as having more than US$250 million under management , had the power to lead deals , sit on boards , and write checks to invest in companies , according to an Information survey . Of that group , 11 were Latino and seven were Black . <p> A number of premier firms -- such as Sequoia , Benchmark , Greylock , and Kleiner Perkins -- have no Black partners at all . <p> The large pools of money that invest in venture capital funds as limited partners will trust new venture capitalists to handle their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past will vouch for them -- and more established Black investors are few and far between . <p> When a Black VC goes out to try to raise a new fund from those limited partners , Maqubela said , " They 're taking all the demographic patterns they know and applying them purely against you . " <p> " I was fortunate to have attracted or recruited a number of mentors who decided to coach me and vouch for me , almost all white men , " Maqubela said , " so when I went out to raise a fund I had over a dozen people talking and making calls on my behalf as a way of indicating that I was in the club . " <p> That barrier makes it difficult for Black VCs to establish strong track records of investing large amounts of money and generating large returns for their LPs on their own . BLCK VC , a group founded in 2018 as a support and organising network , has the stated mission of increasing the number of Black VCs from 200 to 400 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide . <p> " I 've spoken to a black VC who could run circles around me intellectually on finance , product , you name it , but did n't know you needed strong references to go to LPs credibly , " Maqubela said . " It is a testament to the structural nature of how venture capital is broken . " <p> This system has made for a venture capital landscape that is less diverse than more mainstream financial institutions . Six percent of investment bankers and nearly 9% of financial consultants are Black , compared with less than 1% for venture capital , according to a 2017 Harvard Business School study . <p> The issues in venture capital persist throughout the industry . <p> The percentage of Black employees at major tech companies remains low : 2.9% at Salesforce , 3.8% at Facebook , 4.4% at Slack , 4.5% at Microsoft , and 6% at Twitter . Lyft and Uber 's workforces are 9% and 9.3% Black , respectively , but that skews heavily toward their lower-paid operations teams . Apple 's workforce is 9% Black , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800,000 people around the world , mostly in its low-wage warehouse and logistics jobs , has a workforce that 's 26.5% Black as a whole , but only 8.3% Black among managers . <p> The number of Black people in leadership or highly compensated technical roles is lower still . For instance , at Google , only 2.6% of leadership and 2.4% of technical workers are Black . At Facebook , Black people make up only 3.1% of those in leadership roles and 1.5% of those in technical roles . <p> Fewer than 1% of startup founders who receive venture funding are Black . And with few Black investors sitting on their boards , the percentage of Black top executives at major tech companies is even lower . <p> The problem is not a lack of qualified candidates , but the companies ' unwillingness to open the door , said Bari Williams , the head of legal at Human Interest , a financial services startup . <p> Companies are reluctant to broaden the schools they recruit from to include historically Black colleges and universities , said Williams , who advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to some semblance of seeing it as lowering the bar , " she said . Williams , who used to work at StubHub and Facebook , said she 's seen candidates get passed over because they attended an HBCU . <p> Many tech companies also rely heavily on referrals from current employees , a system that is not unusual in business but which can reinforce the network effects . " Who do you typically refer ? People that look and act and dress and speak and do the same things that you do , " Williams said . <p> Once hired , employees have to overcome further hurdles to success . People in senior roles " want to mentor and groom people who look like them or remind them of themselves " , Williams said . " So you do n't have somebody who 's going to advocate for you .

" If they 're biased , fix ' em , " she said . <p> Since the national protests over the killing of George Floyd in police custody sparked an examination of structural racism across American society , a number of venture capital funds and tech companies have announced initiatives to readdress the lack of Black and Latino representation . <p> The Japanese tech giant SoftBank , which has made waves in the tech world with its US$100bil ( RM428.50bil ) Vision Fund in recent years , announced a US$100mil ( RM428.50mil ) Opportunity Fund in early June to invest exclusively in entrepreneurs of colour .

In 2019 alone , the sovereign fund injected another RM800 million to keep it afloat . <p> Khazanah was also reported to be mulling another RM5 billion injection , according to Bloomberg sources , but Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Aziz has said there is no government bail-out for airlines in the pipeline . <p> MAB is not alone in dire straits . <p> Low-cost carrier AirAsia recently reported retrenchments due to the hit on air travel by the pandemic . The group , which currently has a 50% share of the total capacity in Malaysia , was said to have cut over 250 staff last month . <p> Even though the merger of AirAsia and MAB has been brought up several times , the two airlines remain separate rivals . <p> Nungsari said it is time to look at merging operations seriously again by all concerned in the industry , even if it means looking at foreign partners . <p> " It is not about MAB merging with AirAsia or anything like that . In fact , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some international alliances . <p> " Nationally , the country benefits from greater connectivity , regardless of how that is obtained , " he said in an email interview . <p> In July last year , Mavcom published a paper with a recommendation plan to develop an economically sustainable and resilient civil aviation sector between 2021 and 2030 . One of the ultimate goals was to maximise air connectivity via ownership liberalisation . <p> The Mavcom report said changes in the ownership of aviation services enterprises could be from government to private sector players or from domestic to foreign players . <p> Nungsari said any consolidation , however , must ensure fair competition between domestic players , but allow greater connectivity at the same time . <p> He said taking into account that fleets are reporting 90% of their planes grounded , it is a good time to liberalise the aviation sector under a strong regulator . <p> In March , market intelligence source CAPA -- Centre for Aviation warned that most airlines will face the risk of being wound up by May , if there is no mitigating plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The International Air Transport Association estimates the crisis would cost the industry US$113 billion ( RM484.39 billion ) for 2020 , or nearly 20% of its projected revenue this year . <p> Mavcom also recently revised its annual load factor assumptions lower to between 60% and 68% , and a further seat cancellation of six million for a total cancellation of 44.8 million seats or 40.3% of the originally-expected capacity this year . <p> As at early June , 38.8 million seats had been cancelled by local and foreign carriers , higher than Mavcom 's previous estimate of 31 million seat cancellations in 2020 . <p> Nungsari said MAB , which has been operating on negative cashflow even before the crisis , will have to rely heavily on Khazanah 's aid , failing which will make the 73-year-old company insolvent . <p> " Even airlines that were profitable need cash injection because of no or much-reduced revenues due to the crisis . It is much worse for MAB . Without a cash injection , MAB is doomed . Khazanah must make the call , " Nungsari said .

The newsroom journalists represent different political directions and come from different countries . Al Jazeera attaches importance to presenting topics from different perspectives instead of representing one-sided perspectives , ideologies or parties . 1Many Al Jazeera journalists have been trained at the BBC . From 2002 to 2012 , the Syrian journalist Aktham Suliman headed the Berlin office as Germany correspondent . 2 3 <p> The Arab media expert Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi points out that Al Jazeera 's Arabic-language program takes a completely different line than the English-language program . The Arabic-language program , which has a much larger audience , sees itself as a propaganda tool for the Muslim Brotherhood with Yusuf al-Qaradawi as a spiritual leader who regularly calls for holy war . According to the Middle East expert Petra Ramsauer , the Arabic-language program of Al Jazeera makes a significant contribution to the Islamist radicalization of the Arab world . 4 <p> In the Arabic-speaking world , Al Jazeera 's main competitor is the Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya and partly also BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the joint broadcaster of the BBC and the Saudi Arabian media group Orbit ceased broadcasting in April 1996 due to censorship demands from the Saudi government , the Emir of Qatar , Sheikh Hamad bin Chalifa Al Thani , founded the broadcaster Al Jazeera and provided 17 of the BBC 's Employees . On November 1 , 1996 , Al Jazeera began broadcasting its program via satellite . 6 The transmitter is allegedly funded with up to 400 million Swiss francs in the year of the Qatari ruling family . Arab News chief Mustafa Souag , thinks this prevents the broadcaster from becoming more commercial and thus having to take into account the sensitivity of its advertisers . He can not remember attempts to influence Sheikh Hamad. 7 <p> Through the presentation of controversial views regarding the governments of many Gulf states - including Saudi Arabia , Kuwaits , Bahrains and Qatar , as well as Syria 's relationship with Lebanon or the Egyptian judiciary - Al Jazeera has developed into one of the most important news channels in the Middle East with approx. 40 million viewers every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) have come out in support of the government 's current policy on illegal immigrants , saying that while measures taken during the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) were firm , they were fair . <p> They are of the view that the welfare of the group is protected in the country , and that Malaysia has earned a reputation as a safe haven and paradise , resulting in the influx of illegal immigrants in search of opportunities to earn a living here . <p> Antrabangsa NGO chairman Datuk Dr Mustapha Ahmad Merican said allegations that Malaysia does not sympathise with the illegal immigrants is incorrect as all these while , the group had been well-treated . <p> " What the government did during the MCO was the right decision as a COVID-19 cluster involving foreign workers was detected earlier . <p> " If there was no tight control , the infection could have spread further , " he said referring to the Malaysian authorities ' move in arresting and deporting illegal immigrants . <p> In fact , he said the government had allocated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of those detained , which included food , shelter , health care and screening during the MCO . <p> " So , there is no issue of us ill-treating the illegals .

Instead , they are taken care of while they are here , " he told Bernama . <p> In the meantime , he said the government needs to be firm when it comes to repatriation of the illegal immigrants and as for refugees , added that the United Nations and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) should take measures to guarantee their safety when they are sent home . <p> " This is to prevent incidents of them getting killed when they are back home , so , we have to ensure their safety as well , we have to be civil here , " he said adding that international media should be more cautious in making statements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20.25-minute documentary report , ' Locked Up in Malaysia 's Lockdown ' , today criticised Malaysia in its handling of illegal immigrants during the MCO enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> Commenting on the report , Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba said the allegations were baseless as Malaysia implemented the MCO in efforts to protect the public , regardless whether they were citizens or non-citizens . <p> " The Al Jazeera report is a false accusation . Protection of citizens or non-citizens is an action under Act 342 ( Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act 1988 ) to address the COVID-19 outbreak , " he said . <p> NGO Malaysia Action Council ( MYNAC ) president Mohd Ridzuan Abdullah said as a country with an open policy , Malaysia had been accepting immigrants and foreign workers without any discrimination . <p> He is also confident that all measures taken by the government are in line with current laws and requirements , especially in addressing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic . <p> " We ( Malaysia ) also have the right to make any arrest if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained , we still treat them well , we serve them food while they are in detention and we also have to bear huge expenses , " he said . <p> Senior Minister ( Security Cluster ) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob earlier said that the government would not bow down to demands by human rights groups claiming that the detention of the illegal immigrants was a discriminatory action . <p> He said as the group entered the country illegally , therefore they should be subject to legal action .

This could be the festering problem . <p> " The defining characteristic of a modern police force is that it is dedicated to prevention , which was not always thought to be the business of police , " wrote Michael Banerjee , a UC Berkeley PhD student studying criminology . <p> Closing the barn door after the horse has fled is futile in itself . <p> An equally vexatious question pivots around analysing the reasons for such misconduct be it bribe-taking , fleeing the country , custodial beatings , torture and death , failure to find the locations of certain fugitives , selective arrests , or unsolved kidnappings , etc . <p> The rakyat has to take stock of this dangerous development with meaningful and sustainable expressions of protests , but they usually come from the Bar Council and Suhakam with meaningless effect . <p> United States police departments are watched by an Internal Affairs Department which has exclusively different and separate functions reporting directly to the District Attorney , and not to the Police Commissioner , to bring in prosecutions . <p> Whether this will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally afflicted by the patronage pesticide where political , wealth , business and social connections rule the roost . <p> American citizens have the right to bear arms ( 2nd Amendment , Bill of Rights ) , but the recent George Floyd murder-by-cops agenda , continue to grapple with a huge unsolved malaise where guns , police , obedience , loyalty and discipline vacillate between faulty , corrupt , dangerous and ineffective . <p> Fearless investigations and prosecutions also have a bad taste and stench when the ugly head of patronage pops up here and there to mess things up , especially investigations and prosecutions . <p> Legislation can never be the answer as we seem to have the leadership turning a Nelson 's eye to the seriousness of police misconduct which is the same perspective granted to constitutional malfunctions . <p> Some have suggested increasing the salaries and perks of law enforcement rank and file like in Singapore .

The real Frank Serpico of the New York Police Department took a bullet to his face . <p> Fortunately , it was a .22 caliber bullet which he still carries . Serpico detail , if introduced in Malaysia , must report directly to the Attorney General for onward action instead of filtering it through the IPCMC and the MACC . <p> The key is vigorous and robust investigations and prosecutions where prevention fails .

Your own mind can be a prison if you do n't read books and the worst thing is to be trapped in your mind prison . So , to me , the key to unlock it is books , " he said . <p> When speaking of his favourite genres , Jeniri mentioned history ( particularly Sarawak 's history ) , political communications and biographies . <p> One of his favourite titles is " The Rising Moon : Political Change in Sarawak " by Michael Leigh .

Once you get hooked , there is no turning back . " <p> He advised that there were no shortcuts to knowledge and language . Instead , quality books had to be read in one 's field of interest . <p> As he humorously puts it , the only risk in reading is potential hair loss . <p> " I read a lot of books when I was doing my PhD , and within that year , all of this was gone , " he said with a chuckle , pointing to his hair . <p> " But I 'd rather have no hair than no knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen to his collection of books in the future , he said he had not yet decided whether to keep them or donate them to certain institutions . <h> About Us <p> New Sarawak Tribune is a Sarawakian news portal that highlights Sarawak-centric news and other stories of relevance to Sarawak .

@@42128232 <h> Most of world to face Covid without vaccine , virus hunter says <p> LONDON ( July 18 ) : Klaus Stohr has urged governments for many years to prepare for the grim possibility of a pandemic . <p> In 2003 , he played a key role in a World Health Organization investigation that swiftly identified a coronavirus as the cause of SARS . Stohr also sounded the alarm on the pandemic potential of avian flu , bringing countries and companies to the table to increase production of vaccines in case it began spreading widely in people . <p> In Covid-19 , which has killed almost 600,000 people , the world faces the crisis that the virologist has long feared . Stohr , who left the WHO to join drugmaker Novartis AG in 2007 and retired a couple of years ago , paints a sobering picture . He spoke with Bloomberg by phone , and his remarks have been edited for clarity and readability : <p> Bloomberg : How do you see the pandemic advancing before a vaccine potentially is available ? <p> Stohr : The epidemiological behavior of this virus will not be that much different from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There will be another wave , and it will be very serious . More than 90% of the population is susceptible . If we do not tighten again to a serious lockdown or similar measures , the virus is going to cause a significant outbreak . Winter is coming before the vaccine . There will be an increase in cases , and there will be problems containing it because people seem not very amenable to more constraints in their movement and freedom . <p> Bloomberg : When do you predict vaccines may arrive ? <p> Stohr : Countries like Germany may have a significant amount of vaccine by the beginning of next year and a rollout that may take four , five , six months for the elderly . The strategy may be different for a country like Brazil , Argentina or Chile , which may never get a single dose of a vaccine and still has to cope . <p> The world will be divided into two groups , those with vaccines and those with no vaccines . <p> Bloomberg : How do you see worldwide immunity ramping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Stohr : I would assume that by the middle of next year a significant portion of the world will have antibodies . That will increase gradually over time . Then there will be a third wave , and when that is over , I would think that 80% of the world may have antibodies if lockdowns are not instituted , which I doubt . <p> Bloomberg : What does that mean for vaccines under development ? <p> Stohr : We 're in a big , big quandary . We have to throw all the resources we can afford toward the development of a vaccine . On the other hand , I believe common sense tells us vaccines will not be available for the majority of the world . <p> There may be , by the end of this year or beginning of next year , a half a billion doses available . The world population is 7.5 billion . Particularly in those countries which have insufficient infrastructure and struggle with their health-care systems and have huge populations , what vaccine are they going to have ? <p> Bloomberg : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on equitable access . Wo n't that help tackle those concerns ? <p> Stohr : It would be irresponsible not to do anything . Nevertheless , the majority of the world population will not receive a vaccine . The virus will continue to spread , and it could take two to three years before the virus has affected a large majority of the population . <p> It 's not the vaccine that 's going to end the pandemic . The virus will end this pandemic by burning every piece of dry wood it will find . The fire will not go out before the last susceptible person has been affected . <p> Then the question is what role will any vaccine play afterwards . <p> Bloomberg : You seem optimistic researchers will succeed in coming up with vaccines . How do you assess the prospects and potential risks ? <p> Stohr : The coronavirus is not a particularly difficult virus to handle . Even the conventional vaccines could make a difference , and we have different approaches , vector vaccines , mRNA . That is very promising . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a gradual increase in its use , in the number of people immunized , and if anything comes up , even very rare events , they will be noticed pretty early .

So the question is if there is anything possibly lingering in the vaccine that can not be detected in the large-scale safety testing during the approval process . <p> It could hit many , many people . If you immunize 500 million , and it 's only 1 in a million who is affected , you still have a significant number of people who may have safety problems , so that is something that has to be addressed . But one has to balance the concern about the impact of the disease against the concern of the possible impact of the use of the vaccine . <p> Bloomberg : You 've said countries need to adjust their strategies . What is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a way to open our community in a way that supports our long-term medical goal , which is the least number of casualties over time , knowing that you can not avoid the spread of infection . There is no other tool available . If you 've got a medical problem , you go skiing , you break your leg , your knee ligament is torn , no problem , go to the doctor and get it fixed . We have no fix here . <p> We have to live with this virus and we have to find a proper way to ensure that when we are through with this we look back and say we did the best to prevent death and disease . But we can not do the ostrich policy here and hope that some miracle will happen and the virus will disappear . The perfect strategy is n't available . <p> Bloomberg : You 've tackled other viruses from SARS to bird flu , are there any lessons from the past that are relevant today ? <p> Stohr : Since 2003 we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used them . I believe those who had a decent pandemic plan were a couple of steps ahead . But there are still countries with no plans . The learning is get your pandemic plan ready . <p> It may be clear that only those who will have vaccine production on their soil will have access to vaccines during the pandemic . I hope it 's not going to turn out this way , but I fear it will . That hopefully will result in more investment into pandemic preparedness and vaccine preparedness in the coming years , so that the next pandemic will be addressed better than this one .

There will be a high dependency on automation and technology to keep the travelling public safe as the world waits for an effective vaccine . These mission critical upgrades mean that KLIA is ensuring that it is well-prepared for the post COVID-19 new normal , equipped with enhanced services and standards . <p> The slowdown period is also the perfect opportunity to perform these critical upgrades as it will cause less disruption to airport and airline operations , as well as passenger comfort . <p> In the next two to three years , KLIA will be upgrading its baggage handling system ( BHS ) , replacing the Aerotrains and completing its washroom refurbishment at its Main terminal . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BHS will streamline and enable seamless integration between baggage screening , transportation , sortation , and storage operations .

This will also allow the airport to monitor service levels better and reduce the risk of mishandled baggage or what is termed as short shipment within the aviation industry . <p> KLIA already has a low short shipment index when benchmarked against the regional index reported in the baggage report by SITA , the technology provider for the air transport industry .

This allows for higher control accuracies on train frequencies , vehicle speeds and precise alignment of platform stops and door shutters thus reducing the risk of abnormal operations occurring to the trains .

Sadly , this achievement likely wo n't make it into our history books , let alone our school textbooks . <p> Lim will say little of what he has done , except that he has been among those privileged to have worked with Mandela during his most glorious and defining moments . <p> After all , not many of us are blessed enough to be able to share a little anecdote of criss-crossing with Mandela and other ANC leaders on a campaign trail . <p> In the run-up to the ANC campaign , Lim produced 60 tonnes of billboards and posters to be put up throughout the country . <p> He worked with Dr Popo Molefe , who chaired the elections campaign committee and went on to become the premier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which showed the faces of young Africans and argued his reason for including at least two Caucasian teenagers , even if this irked some hardcore ANC leaders . Adding insult to injury for them was being " told off " by a Malaysian . <p> On a few occasions , Mandela had to step in to tell his supporters that Lim could easily shut shop and go home if tensions remained high , but he assured his people that Lim knew what he was doing and was willing to give it a shot . <p> But the road to redemption for Lim was a long and winding one . To kick things off unceremoniously , the posters could n't be printed in South Africa because printers were mostly owned by Caucasians . <p> And posters of Mandela were either taken down by irate Caucasians or blacks who wanted them as keepsake , so it was a struggle to maintain his appearance . <p> The billboards and posters were eventually made in Malaysia from funding by Malaysian businessmen , and then sent to South Africa by a chartered plane from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak glowingly of the work done by Malaysia , although in a far from enthusiastic way . But one thing 's for sure -- they 're certainly grateful . <p> Lim has been modest . He merely considers himself very privileged to have been involved in a small way in the sea change . But for me , as a proud History undergrad and a journalist , I have always insisted that the role played by Malaysia and this Malaysian , needs not only be recorded , but told , too . <p> As Lim embarked on his education crusade , I took a different path in this sprawling land . My thirst to understand Africa took off after Zambia . <p> Later on , I travelled to Botswana , Zimbabwe , Senegal , Sudan , South Africa , Egypt , Rwanda , Namibia and Uganda , as a journalist and traveller , and that 's just a fraction of what Africa has with its 54 countries . <p> Lim 's love for Africa did n't end with the general elections of South Africa . He continued to play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Africans through the Limkokwing universities which he set up . <p> His African journey then took him to South Africa , where it all began with a new campus set up in the picturesque Warrenton . <p> I 'm not a Dr Mahathir fan and I 've written critically about some government to government deals , such as insisting Malaysia Airlines fly direct to Zimbabwe and Peru , which were all counterproductive decisions . <p> But his early emphasis on Africa was spot on , and as China makes its impact in Africa now -- due to geopolitical reasons or its minerals -- there 's no doubt that the continent offers a potentially huge market , and Dr Mahathir envisioned that . <p> As we , Malaysians , join the world to remember Mandela , we should also know about the small but crucial part played by our countrymen . <p> Giving credit where it 's due , we need to put aside politics and our personal prejudices and just record history as it unfolds.

The savings part is the only part you can control <p> by FARNOOSH TORABI/ pic by BLOOMBERG <p> I RECENTLY did what most financial advice forbids : I stuck my hand in my retirement portfolio and backed out of some stocks . <p> Earlier this month , I stared at my long-term portfolio , got spooked by the 81% that sat in equities and dialled that figure back to a more moderate 60% . I also tripled the fixed income portion of my portfolio to 27% . <p> I 'd been pretty aggressive since I started investing in my early 20s and benefitted from the hefty exposure to stocks . In just the last two years , my portfolio has been up 28% . So , why the change in direction ? Why not just " stay the course " , as many financial experts ( myself , included ) encourage us to do , especially in these uncertain times ? <p> Here it is : I 'm concerned about the fundamentals of our economy . I 'm worried about if and how the job market can rebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term stock returns . Continuously exposing my nest egg to all this risk now feels overzealous . Although the stock market appears to suggest we 're headed for a robust recovery ( cocktails in hand , no masks required ) , I 'm not buying it . Literally . <p> More relevant , I turned 40 this year and am hoping to begin drawing down on this portfolio starting at 60 . That gives me a solid 20 more years to hit my savings target . I know that 's probably enough time to recover from this recession and likely the next one . But my appetite for " probably " is less so these days . <p> Also worth pointing out : I am the breadwinner in our marriage , with my earnings accounting for about 80% of household income . My business largely helps support our family of four and the house in the suburbs we just purchased . <p> My plate 's becoming increasingly full , and I do n't have as much room now for a highly unpredictable , volatile investment portfolio . If we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the adjustment . It felt like a betrayal , going against the " do nothing " advice that has become the industry standard . <p> Still , I 'm confident it was the right move -- for me , that is . And the certified financial planners I spoke to along the way , while not exactly high-fiving my decision , admit that I 'm not misguided . <p> " It 's not what I would do , but I 'm much more comfortable with risk , " says Anjali Jariwala , founder of FIT Advisors in Los Angeles , California . " Your risk tolerance has come down , as you 've gotten older and you have more responsibilities , which is very reasonable , " she said . <p> " The current events triggered you to reassess ... but really , this is something you should do annually or whenever there 's a major life event such as having children , ( making a ) career change or retirement , " adds Angela Moore , founder of Modern Money Advisor , a financial planning firm based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Constantly worrying about your investment portfolio is a valid sign that you may be taking on too much risk , the experts agreed . <p> " The best balance between equities and fixed income ... provides us the possibility of growing our funds to meet our goals , but also lets us sleep at night , " market veteran Linda Davis Taylor told me . She is the former CEO of Clifford Swan Investment Counselors in Pasadena , California , and the host of the podcast " Money Stories with LDT " . And that 's just it . I could n't sleep . <p> Besides my three-year-old daughter , who occasionally crawls into our bed at 2am , few things wake me up at night . But here I was , lying in bed in my brand-new Colonial , unable to stop thinking about what ifs . <p> What if the looming fiscal cliff leads to a second Great Depression ? What if a cure for Covid-19 is years away , if it ever comes at all ? What if our family depletes our more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with still no end in sight to this madness ? All these questions warranted a closer look at the numbers . <p> Making money moves based on pure adrenaline is never wise , and I was emotionally charged . So I asked , would I be willing to commit to this new allocation for the next , say , 10 years , and not be tempted to revert back on a whim ? I rationalised , ' Yes ' . <p> " Do n't just do it as a timing issue , " says Jariwala . <p> " Research shows you end up worse off because you have to time it right twice . You need to know when to get out and go back in . " <p> And what about hitting my target savings goal ? A more conservative portfolio may no longer get me to where I want to be in the same time horizon . To offset this potentially slower growth , I made a personal commitment to invest more of my income . This was something all the planners cheered . <p> " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your allocation is , " says Moore . " The savings part is the only part you can control . " <p> So , my parting advice for anyone considering a shift in their portfolio is to think of your investments as just one aspect of your overall financial solvency . If you 're going to take a smaller position in stocks , what else in your financial life may need to be adjusted to offset this potentially smaller nest egg ? Do you need to save more in an emergency account ? <p> Delay retirement ? Take out a long-term disability policy ? <p> " If you 're revisiting asset allocation , then you should just revisit everything on your financial checklist ... all the things that are there to protect your income and assets , " says Jariwala .

Employers are expected to continue thinking of reducing operating costs as economic recovery is expected to take several years . This is based on the forecast of the Statistics Department that the labour market in May and beyond will be affected as companies tend to restructure the size of its workforce to ease financial burdens . <p> Third , whether individuals who participate in the apprenticeship programme under a Penjana Kerjaya are guaranteed job opportunities after completion of training .

Employers have a responsibility to create more high-skilled jobs with decent wages and to take advantage of the Penjana Kerjaya initiative . So , how can the government ensure that the private-public partnership is enhanced through the Penjana Kerjaya initiative ? <p> Because the government provides incentives to employers who hire local workers and provides a training allowance of RM4,000 to one employee , employers have room to invest in automation and high-productivity economic activities . <p> It is unreasonable to have employers still relying on a low-wage economic environment and foreign workers while their businesses receive government assistance to increase productivity and boost stability of the company . <p> This will add value to Penjana Kerjaya as a key to creating more skilled jobs with a decent salary for young people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government formulates a policy to ensure that this group is absorbed by the employer or industry as permanent employees after training . <p> According to the latest Penjana Kerjaya projections , only four out of 10 unemployed or new graduates enjoy Penjana Kerjaya incentives .

Construction took just under 11 months ! <p> The government also discovered there were no premier hotels in Kuala Lumpur to accommodate the many dignitaries the Tunku had proposed to invite for the Merdeka ceremony . <p> The challenging task of building such a hotel fell on Low Yat , one of Kuala Lumpur 's most prominent and resourceful contractors .

When completed , it was the tallest and poshest hotel in Kuala Lumpur . <p> An ebullient Low Yat , a physically large man , threw a celebratory dim sum dinner for all his guests which ( unknown to them ) also acted as a dry run for organisation and timing . The hotel opened on 28 August 1957 , just two days before the eve of Merdeka . <p> One of those invited for the Merdeka ceremony , reflecting the Tunku 's eclecticism , was Nancy Simmons ( ' Bunny ' ) , an English woman who was his official chauffeur during the London talks in 1956 and 1957 .

Fashioning a national anthem was the responsibility of Radio Malaya , perched atop the newly built eight-storey Federal House , not far from the present Merdeka Square ( Dataran Merdeka ) . <p> The word merdeka for freedom was used in the Malay archipelago back then to denote a freed slave ( Wikipedia ) .

@@42166230 <p> A first-half loss of US$713 million ( RM2.99 billion ) , announced last week , was just the latest piece of bad news for PT Garuda Indonesia Tbk . The airline already missed a payment on an asset-backed security in late July , shortly after extending the repayment of a US$500 million sukuk -- an Islamic bond -- by three years because of its cash crunch . And it 's facing a lawsuit in London over aircraft rental fees .

According to domestic trade and consumer affairs ( KPDHNEP ) deputy minister Datuk Rosol Wahid , the government says it will not be implementing the targeted fuel subsidy scheme for RON 95 petrol . <p> Speaking in Parliament , Rosol said the government decided on this after considering the price difference of fuel between the peninsular and East Malaysia , among other factors . " The decision was made on July 9 in a meeting between the ministry and the finance ministry due to several reasons , " he said . <p> The programme was announced last year by the previous Pakatan Harapan government .

@@42166236 <h> Better work culture and streamlined operations are the main reasons for Proton 's turnaround -- Li Chunrong <p> One of the things Li Chunrong did when assuming the role as CEO of Proton Holdings was to set up a Cross Function Team ( CFT ) to identify and address internal issues the company faced , and at the same time develop a new working culture for the new Malaysian-China team . <p> According to The Edge , before Geely came into the picture , Proton suffered from weak operational management , and the first thing the CFT recommended was to ask Proton vendors to reduce costs by 30% if they wished to continue supplying parts to the group . <p> This , naturally , was met with resistance . Vendors immediately complained about how difficult it would be to cut costs by 30% and still remain in business . Such defiance inadvertently caused rumours about Proton outsourcing parts from China to spread , but Li insisted that local vendors start cutting costs . <p> " When I came here , I asked our vendors to reduce costs by 30% . Then , of course , they complained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them back , in terms of operation management skill , who is better ? You or Proton ? They did n't answer , because we Proton 's management were bad before . " <p> " I told them that your skill and my skill is the same , do you agree ? They agreed . If I can reduce costs , you must be able to reduce costs , " he said , adding that if Proton could reduce its operational costs by 33% , the vendors should be able to do the same as well . <p> For Proton , cost-cutting measures involved closing down three regional parts centres and sold them for RM1 million each . It also shuttered a dozen warehouses across the country , maintaining just four now ( Kuching , Kota Kinabalu , Shah Alam and Tanjung Malim ) . <p> The number of company cars were also trimmed -- Li said Proton had a whopping 1,700 cars for its management , which he said was too many for a company producing less than 100,000 cars annually . <p> " When I was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we only had four company cars . That means Proton has so many company cars ; so from my understanding , we can sell these cars , " Li noted . In the first six months , Proton had managed to sell more than 500 units of company cars . " This is one of the examples of how I reduce costs . If I can do it , definitely the vendors can do . " <p> Prior to the launch of the X70 , Li urged Proton dealers to upgrade their dealerships to at least 3S or 4S standards , knowing that customers would be more receptive of the renewed brand image and quality . Li believes that the upgrading of showrooms was not only good in terms of brand image , but also service improvement . <p> Again , dealers opposed , claiming that the showroom upgrades would cost huge capital outlays . To mitigate this issue , Proton offered assistance to dealers , but this varied depending on the size of the showroom , location , and service bay capacity . <p> Currently , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li explained : " Previously , more than 70% of our dealers were only doing sales ( 1S ) . Because of 1S , the store was small . The dealer could not store many spare parts . So that 's why Proton had to have many RPCs . But now , we have more 3S and 4S centres -- 124 centres -- so these RPCs are no longer necessary . " <p> " This is a business strategy . Why do I set up more 3S/4S ? We want to upgrade our customer experience because we have high confidence in the X70 . So we should put it in a high-quality environment , so that our customers can have a good experience , " he said . <p> Besides that , rumours swirled about an internal clash of cultures between Geely and Proton staffs , but Li said that was n't the case . In fact , they shared more similarities . " CFT was tasked to develop a new culture , combining Geely 's , Proton 's and DRB-Hicom 's values . We came up with TARI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is why I said that we have the same culture , " he explained . <p> " We also focus on the business . There 's only one reason why we are here -- to do business . Let Proton be successful . I do n't want Proton 's staff to be hooked on other things . Everyone here is making a living for themselves and for their family . " <p> " Everyone here is a worker . You are a local worker , I am a foreign worker . You are not a shareholder . But we have an overlap in targets , which is to let Proton be successful . Otherwise , we can not understand each other . There is a common interest to let Proton be successful , " Li added . <p> An ardent believer that fun cars need not be fast and fast cars may not always be fun . Matt advocates the purity and simplicity of manually swapping cogs while coping in silence of its impending doom . Matt 's not hot . Never hot . <p> It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form his CFT which came out with these GC ideas . That tells us our local DRB guys have the knowledge on what must be done but they were afraid and restraint by their old man big boss advisor from doing anything . Now they have been unshackled by Geely they are GC everywhere . Well done our local DRB guys ! <p> Thank you so much Li Chunrong for guiding our GO Proton to have a better work culture and more streamlined operations . Your GC guidance have made Malaysians proud of Proton again . Also , today Proton are able to compete with GC Perodua again . <p> Really ? honda is still doing well ? Honda have already lost more sales to proton last year . Even honda will be lose more sales to toyota , nissan . Even CRV sales will be going to lose more sales to Mazda CX-5 and Proton X70 . People already asking honda malaysia to improve their services , efficiently and management but they are so greedy which always concentrating on their profit which they do n't care about customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback about issues . <p> Half or more of the Proton management is still from the old blood . There 's only so much this Dr Li can do when DRB still holding majority stake . Please go to their Centre Of Excellence service centre and see the work culture there . Nothing has changed . There 's less than 10 customers at the lounge but they had to employ 2 customer service reps , 2 receptionists , 2 cashiers and 6 service reps and I 'm not even sure how many more they employ behind there . You can pretty much guess what they cashiers , receptionists and ' cusromer service ' staff are doing with their phones . With that many manpower they still ca n't finish a vehicle under 3 hours . <p> If the HQ is still like before , what more is to say about their dealers ? <p> thank you dr li for providing the guidance much required by proton. as with many malaysian organisations , proton has great people with high levels of skills and knowledge , we knew all along the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . <p> Two points I can observed to the successful turnaround of Proton&gt; 1 . Unshackling of Proton mgmt from the our politicians who always want to interfere in areas they have no expertise or jurisdictions . This allow the professional managers in Proton to flourish and be measured on their performance and key objectives . 2 . The market segments that has not been acceptin/buying Proton cars with remarks " made of milo tin " , inferior quality , bad products in general has been buying the products in drove.I guess we still suffer the " Made in Malaysia " products are not good enough for Malaysians . Though Toyota and Honda made/assembled by our Northern neighbours while similar in quality , sell fairly well . Lastly , these are anecdotal/observations and no scientifif data to support my claims are available . Maybe someone in the marketing/ sales academia may find it wothwhile to do a scientific study ? <p> The reason why Toyota was a successful brand from.the 80s throughout the 90s and into the new millennium . Proton achieved high rate of success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving saga lmst and lmss , wira SE , waja and perdana v6 . Reason for new plant in tg malim because tengku mahaleel was expecting proton to be able to sell 300k cars in 2007-2008 ) because of the govt protection against foreign makes but Toyota sales were strong because of good product reliability , after sales service and also positive work culture . <p> In 2008 UMWT for the first time hit 100k mark by having variety of car models ( vios , corolla , Avanza , rush , hiace , hilux , Camry ) when Honda sales was about 40k only ( , , jazz , city , Civic , accord , CRV ) . Honda introduced Freed but like the stream was n't successful . <p> Well that 's the story of Toyota success , similar to what Proton CEO wants . <p> However Toyota lost to Honda because of issues like 2 airbags versus 4/6 and also the zinc roof noise when raining in the 3rd gen vios . And Honda learnt the same thing what Toyota did -- adding more models . So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like jazz hybrid , city hybrid , Civic hybrid and Civic type R. <p> As someone who has been working in the industry for 25 years .. For Kia , Jaguar , BMW , VW , Kia , Toyota and Proton .. I know how and what was the work.culture in each company . <p> Why Kia was very successful in 2005-06 but hardly sells a car today . <p> Why was VW so great in 2010-12 but same story with Kia today . <p> Well , the management did n't know what 's happening on the ground , did n't want to learn and just did n't bother . <p> Sadly we need someone from a foreign company to tell Proton how to this . How to do that . It 's well described in this article . <p> Not really . Did you even read the article and try to understand what was said ? <p> He formed the CFT ( which comprised of Proton management ) that told him the true story of what ails them . He only help enabled them to do what needed free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stepping on vendors and dealers toes are like stepping on that person 's toes , and nobody dares to cross him so nobody dares to cross THEM . It not so much on the product or the staffs but management upstream and downstream no longer obstacled with personal interests . <p> Is he already succeeded ? I do nt quite think so . Proton needs to show ar least 3 years of continuous profit , or export &gt;50% of their output , or overtake Perodua locally . <p> The time to market also took too long . Ckd x70 took like 18 months . X50 teased for 1 year already but still not in market . The Mpv , planned launch date is still at least 2 years away . Why it takes this long if truly the culture has changed ? <p> No clear long term plan revealed either , but keeps emphasize the long-in-the-tooth 3 models revision last year . Whats next for Saga ? Whats next for Persona ? Whats next for Preve ? What platform or engine is in the pipeline ? Nobody knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at least moving in right direction though , but is far from a success story yet . Journey still long . <p> Depends on what is your definition of ' success ' . Did he achieve his target milestones ? Yes , so that is a measurable success for him . Has he completed his job ? Not yet so that final success is still some way out but he is getting there . <p> The debuts of these new models took time because they needed to be redeveloped . Keep in mind they were n't designed with RHD conversion so that needs to be redeveloped from scratch . It is not like making roti canai . <p> What is next is really their best kept secret , as seen Perodua had constantly tried to steal Proton 's thunder of late with Bezza tried to spanner new Saga , Aruz tried to spanner X70 , now D55 trying to spanner X50 so by not revealing what is Proton 's next model it will keep Perodua from trying to spanner it . In business world it is what 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wow did nt know that Proton managed to cut the vendor / supplier cost by 30% and also the cost cutting in overall Proton too and yet the savings are not passed to customers like us . <p> Also its quite interesting to know the inefficiency and management in the company which resulted in all the losses for example the company car LOL so now we know where all their executives test their cars everytime up the hill and back . <p> What do you mean the savings were not passed on to consumers ? Did you know that ever since SST 2.0 replaced GST , Proton had absorbed the sales tax imposed on each of their cars sold ? Is that not passing the savings to their customers ? <p> There was once a mat salleh said he wanted to change the working culture in a " prominent " GLC . In the end , he found it easier to change his job . Hopefully this apek is able to overcome the tremendous challenges in Proton dan tak kena hantar balik ke cHiNa awal . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register .

Is that offensive ? <p> Other than being born few minutes apart , all other micro events that are different can mostly be attributed to the choice made by the said twins . <p> A &amp; B are twins , both arrive in similar condition , having same parents , being indoctrinated in the same way by the family/society , the difference is attributable by the twins own action that differs from the others . <p> A may be more active , or maybe smile more , or does thing differently from its twin B , A end up getting more attention and so on . So the action or inaction of both twins does affect their own outcome in life even when both comes to the world with exact same DNA and environment . <p> Choices made but not controlled if you know what I mean . <p> They are not the full author of their **27;624;TOOLONG and if both twins swap places ( genes , micro events , etc ) , they would have the same end result , just swapped . Logical right ? <p> Their outcomes are caused by factors outside of their control and even their own decisions/actions are caused by external factors , they cant make fully independent choices/actions , its not possible in physic . <p> QUOTE ( Cincai lar @ Aug 4 2020 , 11:46 AM ) <p> i 'm more worried on your daughter development on your believe of " no free will " , .. <p> without " free will " then no need to make decision liao lor , .. all is predestined , .. your future is fixed , .. <p> free will is capability of making choice , .. u do n't believe in " free will " , .. u might not giving enough training for the kid on making choice , .. made wrong choice , .. learn from it , .. made right choice , .. celebrate it , .... it 's crucial survivor skill for a kid , .. <p> She is ok thank you . I give her hints and let her discover , I do nt preach , just told her check the facts always . <p> She made up her own mind . <p> It is luck she has good genes ( not sure from me or not ) and despite her father 's abuse she was loved enough by me and growing well in good environment now . <p> She knows she is lucky and empathize with other less lucky people , that 's why she nice to people , have many good friends . <p> Are you genuinely worry about her or is this something else you are implying ? lol <p> Not logical . I grew up in a staunchly patriarchal indian family environment within a majority Malay Muslim community . When I was young I was often taught to be suspicious of westerners and chinese folk because they are always trying to cheat and take advantage of us simpler folks . And that a woman 's place is in the kitchen and she has no say in family decisions . <p> Did I grow up to be a race hater with sexist attitudes ? No . <p> I expect people to continue learning and changing for the better as they grow older and not just stand still and blame everything else but themselves for their bad thoughts and deeds . <p> Can you try trace back to various moments in your life that you were " influenced " by something to behave differently despite the bad environment ? <p> I 'm sure there are many ? <p> Or are you implying every single factor/every single seconds of your environment is bad ( no good influences or information available at all ) and somehow your " inner " good survived ? <p> Did you know altruism and empathy have genetic causes too ? Some people can be born with it , even if they have bad parents . <p> If you are implying you have no good info or influences but somehow still good , isnt this more evidence that its not your own free will then , its probably genetic but most likely a mix of genes and various instances of " aha " moment when you were exposed to counter influences/info , which reinforces your gene preference . <p> QUOTE ( exsea @ Aug 4 2020 , 11:56 AM ) <p> if you do nt have enough money , you cant donate to everyone . logic right ? the best sympathy i can give to people who act in ways i dislike is just avoiding them . <p> Thats ok , nobody is perfect , its not easy to not react adversely to bad behaviors of others , but we can only try .

If you do n't like people posting your publicly available info , maybe either do not share those info in the first place or create a new identity here . <p> this one i usually do like this , put ourself in their position , mean imagine now he is you and you is him , then think again what would u do <p> if still believe need to get angry , then another thing is imagine he is your client , then sure ok ody , especially on the road i use that <p> say a car drive like sakai , u want to hon it , then immediate u tell urself i cant see who is driving , but that posiblely is my client , then u imagine the person is ur dearest cliente driving there , then you will not agitated anymore and ignore it <p> Do police feel empathy when they enforce the law ? They can still stop bad people without judging or blaming , correct ? <p> Can a psychologist treat patients without judging or blaming ? <p> i think you phrase it wrongly , the correct thing is not put emotion into their work , or when dealing with others <p> like say ur staff do thing wrongly , ur staff inform u and foward u the data , so you just reply what should be done according to ready procedure or past example , say give them reminder letter or anything , or you meet him and tell him this is worng ah so u do twice dy so this is reminder letter , also no repeat ya else warning letter susah prospect ohh then if he give excuses just tell him we do according to past example procedures so this is the outcome etc , you do it without get angry with them or anything , so not getting emotional or to hate them or how <p> i think a good police can do without get emotional , sometime they need to react fast/forcefull to control dangers , but they can do it without getting emotional towards others , thats a good policeman . their job is to control danger , to investigate , to eliminate danger , but not to hate others <p> honk if there is a immediate danger is ok , say if a car running out of junction obvious wrong , cos even if that is ur client he also would mind u honk him , cos that is obvius wrong , he might even feel malu of himself <p> sometime some people just drive annoyingly but not an obvious danger , so there i will not honk , i tot well that is my dearest client , poor them rushing bad life while i relax good life ohh things like tat <p> Have you properly read my first post ?

No offense . Lol , Please calm down . We can agree to disagree . <p> Well , saying about " police empathy " is from ur own post ... mehhh ... <p> So can u stop being such a judgemental person now ? Can u see people try to show u wat is u ? Seems u also dislike it , so thats how people dislike u . Got it ? <p> Do u think police bother to hate and having too much emotion ? They just do their job , their job is to maintain peace , to catch criminal , not to waste time talk n judge criminal . Judging is judge job in the court . So can u stop judging them now ? U go judge the judge in court better . Go n argue wif them in court.U open thread then hurt urself cos people here troll u more . <p> Have u ever agree with other /k ? Seems no to me . But expect people to agree wif u ? How pity . <p> U should calm down urself , not others . U cant even accept people opinion . <p> honk if there is a immediate danger is ok , say if a car running out of junction obvious wrong , cos even if that is ur client he also would mind u honk him , cos that is obvius wrong , he might even feel malu of himself <p> sometime some people just drive annoyingly but not an obvious danger , so there i will not honk , i tot well that is my dearest client , poor them rushing bad life while i relax good life ohh things like tat <p> But that 's like syok sendiri ........ what if the S hole driver is living a much better life than you , he is driving like an S hole because he is S hole . <p> my own experience really did happen lastime many years back mia story i honk a car , then nextday i go to factory found out he is my client , the car park there , then he did nt know i honk him cos i drive another company car , of cos i never tell him nor we discuss about the honk la <p> &gt; " nobody is truly in control of who they become " &gt; " we still can not condemn them all unless we have analyzed every member " <p> choose one . i do nt think you realise you 're arguing from both sides . <p> I do nt get what you mean . <p> QUOTE ( KineticKill @ Aug 4 2020 , 12:57 PM ) <p> Pertinent or not is secondary .

Like some people here judge me as a fucking dirty drug addict who tell his sad life on /k without even knowing me personally and my background story . Little did they know , i have contributed some psychological counselling to people , be it in /k or to outside people who ought to contribute to the betterment of themselves . <p> Its a fallacy to believe because primitive animals do this at some level that it is a good thing for human society too , its " appeal to nature " fallacy . <p> I think we need to treat people on per case basis , analyze and react rationally .

I take responsibility for the good and the bad things I say and do . <p> People can learn and change , and they do . <p> But some find it easier to blame their luck , genetics , environment , socio-economic status etc as long as they do n't have to be accountable for their speech and deeds .

@@42180237 <p> Qualcomm 's Snapdragon chip is one of the widely used processors in Android devices today . In 2019 alone , nearly 40% of all Android smartphones from Google , Samsung , Xiaomi , LG and OnePlus run on Snapdragon processors . <p> But researchers from cybersecurity firm Check Point recently discovered that the digital signal processor ( DSP ) in Snapdragon chips had over 400 pieces of vulnerable code that leave millions of Android users at risk . The vulnerabilities dubbed " Achilles " , could impact phones in three ways . <p> So what exactly is the DSP and what does it do ? According to a Gizmodo article , the DSP enables many of the modern features we have come to expect in phones from quick charging , HD capture and advanced Augmented Reality ( AR ) . This would , in essence , make the DSP a super-efficient and economical component but it also opens potential pathways for hackers to take control of devices . <p> Check Point said attackers need only need to trick a user to install an app that bypasses all usual security measures . The first way they can inflict harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone 's photos , videos , GPS and location data . Even scarier , hackers are could potentially record phone calls and turn on the phone 's microphones remotely , all without the user ever realising . <p> Another way is an attacker could choose to render an infected smartphone unusable by locking all data stored on it via a " targeted denial-of-service attack " . The third way they can get you is by hiding malware in your phone that is unremovable . <p> But why are there so many vulnerabilities ? Researchers said this is because the DSP is like a " black box " that can only be opened and reviewed by the manufacturer . Though this makes it hard to crack but it also means that security researchers can not easily test them , making them ripe for several unknown security flaws . <p> Check Point said it has disclosed its findings to Qualcomm and affected vendors . It , however , did not publicly publish the particulars of the Achilles flaw as millions of devices still remain at risk . Even though Qualcomm reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that your Android phone is safe . It is still up to individual phone makers to push the relevant security patches to truly resolve this vulnerability and that will inevitably take some time . <p> Qualcomm told CNET that it has " worked diligently to validate the issue and make appropriate mitigations available " to smartphone makers . So far the company has not found any evidence of the Achilles vulnerability exploited in the wild , it advised Android users to update their phones with the latest patches as they become available as well as to only install verified apps from official app stores . <p> At the same time , Check Point advises users to protect their data on their phones with mobile security solutions . Its SandBlast Mobile is said to provide real-time threat intelligence and visibility into the threats while providing complete protection against the risks posed by Qualcomm 's vulnerabilities.

And , it appears , the arrests are continuing . <p> The use of this draconian , colonial-era piece of legislation may seem out of place for a country that gained independence from colonial British rule . Many Malaysians would have thought that the government would have eagerly thrown away oppressive colonial laws that were used against the colonised people . But the use , or rather misuse , of this law has been alarming -- even the mere expression of a legal opinion on a constitutional matter pertaining to the Selangor impasse landed aperson in trouble big time . <p> The way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so disturbing that the UN Commissioner for Human Rights felt compelled to issue a statement , calling on the Malaysian government to repeal or amend the anachronistic law so as to be " in line with its international human rights obligations " . The Commissioner also feared that the law may serve as a convenient tool to stifle criticism and dissent . <p> Similarly , some Asian NGOsalso wrote to Prime Minister Najib Razak to express their deep concern over the clampdown on freedom of expression via the Sedition Act . They also reminded Najib of his well-publicised promise to repeal this undemocratic law . <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> Freedom of expression , as enshrined in the Federal Constitution , is jeopardised by this spate of sedition-related arrests , observes Aliran member Ronald Benjamin , because the very vocal and critical tend to be punished by this law . He is also concerned about what he deems as selective prosecution , given that a majority of those hauled up so far are critics of the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malaysian academia . The case of Universiti Malaya 's Azmi Sharom tramples upon the academic freedom to pursue truth and build knowledge that should be shared with the rest of humanity . Academics would be abandoning their social responsibility if they decide to censor or sugar-coat truth , especially if the truth is unpalatable to the powers that be . That is why Azmi urges his fellow academics to soldier on despite the climate of fear that the sedition law has brought upon the country . <p> Interestingly , student activists are in the forefront of the campaign to fight for academic freedom and civil liberties . Just as they had gathered around in support of Dr Azmi Sharom , these students are also planning , at the time of writing , to mount a protest in solidarity with Universiti Selangor 's Dr Abdul Aziz Bari should he be charged with offences under the colonial-era law . <p> It appears in this case that the use of the Sedition Act has only emboldened the resolve of certain quarters to still be vocal in their criticism and in their struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in feeling the heat from the sedition law . Journalists are also exposed to their " occupational hazard " of reporting what they see and hear . Malaysiakini 's Susan Loonewas the first ' casualty ' from the journalistic fraternity to be hauled up in the sedition-charge spree for merely doing what was expected of her as journalist , i.e. reporting what was said to her . The upshot of this episode is that freedom of the press , which has already witnessed a visible decline in recent years , is further jeopardised by the use of this colonial-era law . <p> It is said that the term " seditious tendency " in the law concerned can be so broad in definition that it allows for a variety of interpretations to the extent that it causes so much uncertainty and anxiety among Malaysians and consequently destabilises the country . At times , things can become really ludicrous as to invite cynicism among the rakyat , which in some ways only erodes the legitimacy and credibility of the federal government . <p> If the use of the Sedition Act is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unintelligent and crass way of countering dissent .

And it does n't make things any better when the diversity of views and differences of opinion are frowned upon or even criminalised by the powers that be ; such an approach only weakens democracy . <p> In short , the Sedition Act as it stands now makes us Malaysians much poorer in more ways than one . <p> Thanks for dropping by !

@@42207231 <h> DRIVEN : Ford Fiesta 1.0 EcoBoost -- jack of all trades ? <p> When the Ford Fiesta was launched in Malaysia in 2010 , the local B-segment hatchback market was still relatively quiet . Back then , its only real rivals were the less well-equipped Mazda2 ( the outgoing model ) and previous-gen Suzuki Swift -- the cheapest Honda Jazz and Volkswagen Polo were still north of RM100k and there were no tax-free hybrids to steal the little Ford 's lunch money . Smitten by the reasonable price , attractive Euro styling and sharp handling , buyers flocked to the Fiesta in droves . <p> What a difference four years make . In the interim , the duty-exempt CBU B-segment hybrids have come and gone , the Honda Jazz and Volkswagen Polo are both now locally-assembled and priced squarely to compete with the Fiesta , and the Peugeot 208 and cheaper models such as the Mitsubishi Mirage have also joined the party . <p> Hoping to battle the influx of new rivals , Ford has introduced an EcoBoost variant for the facelifted Fiesta , fitted with a tiny 1.0 litre three-cylinder engine . Despite the considerably smaller motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1.5 Sport , now sitting at RM93,888 . Has the company gone too far down the downsizing route , or will the newfangled mill make the Fiesta appealing again ? <p> The Mark 6 Ford Fiesta ( codename B299 ) remains fresh-faced six years after its debut at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show . All sharp lines and thrusting shapes in a market full of rounded forms and soft edges , it was a product of Ford 's then-new Kinetic design language and does n't feel dated , especially considering its age . <p> A facelift grafted two years ago , which made its debut at a Ford Go Further event in Amsterdam , gave the little tyke a large Aston Martin-esque chrome grille that perhaps feels a bit contrived for such a small car , but it did at least update the car 's styling to fit with the extroverted front fascias of newer competitors . <p> The EcoBoost model has been fitted with a bodykit with LED daytime running lights , as well as a set of black-and-grey graphics . Some may like the look these additions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they cheapen the car 's aesthetic . The cooking model 's design , after all , is already a rather sporty design , and there 's no need to jazz it up unnecessarily . <p> The interior , at least , feels well-sorted . The dashboard may appear to feature a riot of swooshes and a disarray of buttons at first , but actually everything falls naturally at hand and works in a logical manner . <p> The controls for Ford 's SYNC infotainment system are clearly laid out -- mode buttons ( mirrored by the illuminated symbols next to the display ) on the left , a directional pad and volume control in the middle , a numerical keypad on the right and four selection keys at the bottom . Browsing through menus is therefore a fast and fuss-free experience , like a Nokia from days past . <p> The blue monochrome screen may look anachronic next to the large colour touchscreen of the new Honda Jazz , but the system is as fully-featured as you 'd like , and the easy-to-use voice control system ( blissfully ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike its Japanese competitor . <p> Build quality is about average for the segment , but the plastics do have some interesting textures moulded into them , the gloss black and metallic-look trim the facelift brought adding some newfound class to the Fiesta and the part-leather , part-quilted fabric seats look great and offer excellent support . <p> Only space disappoints slightly , the new Jazz having moved the game on considerably . Rear head- and legroom in particular feels a little confined coming from the Honda ( and the view out is restricted by the sharply-rising beltline ) , while the boot is noticeably smaller . The cabin is still comfortable , however , and entirely useable , so if you 're in no need of so much real estate you wo n't feel so shortchanged . <p> A major perk specifying the EcoBoost brings is the inclusion of the Safety Pack , which includes seven airbags ( dual front , dual side , curtain and driver 's knee ) as opposed to the two in the 1.5 litre Sport and Titanium . These puts this particular Fiesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAP rating , while stability control that is present in the rest of the range continues to be offered here . <p> Peel back the skin and you 'll find the bones of an ordinary supermini . Sharing the same underpinnings as the previous-generation Mazda2 , the Fiesta features suspension that 's par for the course , with MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam setup at the rear . <p> The real gem sits in the engine bay under a mess of wires -- a turbocharged and direct-injected EcoBoost three-cylinder 1.0 litre engine . Displacing a scant 998 cc ( the block fits on an A4 sheet of paper ) , it nevertheless produces a respectable 123 hp at 6,000 rpm and an impressive 170 Nm at 1,700 rpm . As with the rest of the range , the EcoBoost is paired with a six-speed PowerShift dual clutch transmission for our market ( a five-speed manual variant is available in Australia ) . <p> Ford has expanded considerable effort to make its tiny mill smoother , more efficient and more responsive than a typical three-pot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offset the natural vibrations caused by such a piston count without resorting to heavy and expensive balancer shafts . <p> The exhaust manifold is moulded into the cylinder head for better efficiency , while a cast iron block reduces warm up times by as much as 50% compared to an aluminium unit . The timing belt is also immersed in oil to reduce noise and improve efficiency . <p> Be in no doubt , this is a right corker of an engine , pulling the Fiesta willingly from low down all the way to the higher reaches of the rev range . The car feels much faster than its claimed 9.4-second 0-100 km/h time would lead you to believe , and , slight grumble at idle aside , it remains uncannily smooth all the way . Great soundtrack , too -- a nice , rorty , hard-edged growl that really eggs you on . <p> It 's not all rosy , however , as the PowerShift does let things down ever so slightly . Pin the throttle and there 's a little hesitation as the gearbox fumbles to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surge of torque . This exacerbates the slight turbo lag the engine has at very low revs and makes driving the EcoBoost a bit more hectic than it arguably should be . <p> Eventually , you do learn to build a rhythm with the powertrain , to anticipate the downshift ( and the accompanying burst of torque ) that will come . In any case , there are no problems with the upshifts themselves , which are swift and smooth , making exploiting the engine a real joy . It 's a shame , then , that there 's no way to shift gears manually other than the rather unintuitive rocker switch on the gearknob . <p> Flicking the steering wheel reveals a rack that , being electrically-assisted , is devoid of much feedback . It is , however , quick and accurate , and crucially it does n't get in the way of ringing the Fiesta by the scruff of its neck at all . <p> Which is just as well , because the chassis is an absolute peach . It feels taut through the corners , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a playful streak running through the car , with the line of attack adjustable using the throttle , but it does n't feel unpredictable or unruly . The brakes , despite utilising rear drums , are strong and dependable , no doubt helped by the lightweight engine . <p> Yet , ease off the pace and you 'll find that the Fiesta settles down nicely , with a decent pliancy over bumps -- Ford has to be commended here for making a conventionally-suspended car handle well without jarring the occupants inside . The triple remains hushed on the highways , too , as does road and wind noise . <p> The Ford Fiesta has always been one of the star performers in its class .

" <p> Allegations of police corruption and excessive use of force have dogged the Malaysian police for decades , culminating in the establishment of the Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal Malaysian Force in 2004 .

That bill , while flawed , would have given the proposed commission the power to discipline police misconduct . <p> The current Perikitan Nasional government , which took power in March , withdrew the IPCMC Bill " because the police objected to it " and instead introduced an IPCC Bill that deprives the commission of enforcement powers . <p> When an investigation discloses misconduct , the proposed commission can only refer the findings to the Police Force Commission , headed by the home affairs minister and with a membership that includes the police inspector general , with the " recommendation " that it take disciplinary action .

The standing orders , the contents of which are not publicly available , generally govern issues such as the conduct of arrests , treatment of detainees and permissible use of weapons . <p> While the proposed IPCC will have the authority to summon witnesses and compel the production of documents , a witness may refuse to answer any question " the answer to which would have a tendency to expose the member of the police force , officer of a public body or person to a criminal charge or penalty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department in which the witness serves certifies that doing so " is prejudicial to national security or national interest " . <p> The proposed law is a major step backward from existing law .

The existing commission also has the authority to conduct searches and seizures of relevant evidence , but the proposed commission would not . <p> The bill would also preclude the IPCC from conducting unannounced visits to police lock-ups and other detention facilities . Under the draft law , the commission would have to give " early advance notice " of its intent to visit such facilities . <p> Some of the bill 's provisions raise serious concerns about the commission 's independence , Human Rights Watch said .

This so-called act of helping fellow humans thus became hypocritical and had the effect of destroying the self-esteem of the intended beneficiaries of this rushed development assistance . <p> Indeed , to turn of a community of human beings into political football is to demean and denigrate God 's creation . This can even be construed as an affront to the very teachings of most religious traditions , especially Islam . Needless to say , human dignity is of vital importance and nothing must be done to demean it if you are a God-fearing and justice-loving human being . <p> To be sure , when we say that we belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God 's creation , which should be appreciated and indeed celebrated . We come in various shapes , sizes and colours and this is divine beauty that awaits our appreciation . In Islam , this is diversity in unity as all these human variations eventually point to the one Creator . <p> Hence , humans are reminded in the Quranic verse in Surah Al-Hujurat ( 49:13 ) : <p> " O mankind ! We created you from a single ( pair ) of a male and a female , and made you into nations and tribes , that ye may know each other ( not that ye may despise each other ) . Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is ( he who is ) the most righteous of you . And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted ( with all things ) . " <p> This verse suggests that it is part of the Grand Design that we humans are made up of different ethnicities , communities and nations . The differences are meant to be celebrated in appreciation of Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to treat each other , i.e. God 's creations , with respect , dignity , love , compassion and justice . This verse also implies the universality of Islam . <p> And yet in multi-ethnic and multicultural Malaysia , despite the touristy slogan of ' Malaysia truly Asia ' , ethnic and cultural differences are often treated with disdain in contradiction to Allah 's divine message . <p> Take the controversy over the building of Chinese mosques , which became an issue early this year . It involved what was claimed by the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association ( MCMA ) to be the difficulty of getting approval from state authorities for the Chinese Muslims to build mosques of their own . <p> MCMA vice-president Mohd Ridhuan Tee Abdullah said his organisation had been trying to build a Chinese mosque in Selangor for about a decade but claimed that the religious authorities were not even interested in hearing their proposal . <p> Some of the state religious authorities argued that building Chinese mosques could split or disunite the Muslim ummah in the country . This argument is apparently based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malay and therefore to build a Chinese mosque is to erase the so-called Malay essence of the Muslim ummah . <p> As Perlis Mufti Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin rightly put it , it was unfair of state governments , particularly religious departments , to deny the right of the Chinese Muslims to build their mosque based on the misunderstood conception that Islam could only mean Malay language , customs and traditions . " The idea that Islam in Malaysia must be Malay in all forms is wrong , " he said . <p> To deny the right to build mosques for ethnic communities other than Malays is not only racism garbed in religious idiom but also symptomatic of an inability to comprehend the universality of Islam and the failure to appreciate human diversity , which is divine in nature . What is even worse is that this faulty thinking subsumes the universal Islam under the particular and smaller rubric of ' Malay ' . <p> If one may add here , the denial of the right to build other houses of worship also runs counter to the Islamic principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this one also suggest that racism and discriminatory and unjust practices are the antithesis to religious teachings , particularly those of Islam . If anything , these human misdeeds pour scorn on the divinely created diversity of human beings . <p> Stay connected , current and committed to justice .

@@42247234 <h> Malaysia 's centralised federal system <p> Compared with those states in other countries using a federal-state system , the constituent states in Malaysia play relatively limited roles in relation to the centre . Francis Loh examines the factors that have contributed towards Malaysia 's centralised federalism . <p> As a federation , Malaysia finds itself in the company of countries such as Germany , Spain , Switzerland , Austria , Belgium , Canada , the United States , Australia , India , Brazil , Argentina , Nigeria , and Ethiopia . But compared to these developed as well as developing countries , the constituent states in Malaysia play relatively limited roles . ( An excellent website on federations is www.forumfed.org ) <p> There are three factors that have contributed towards Malaysia 's centralised federalism . <p> First , the constitutional design clearly favours the central over the state governments , both in terms of legislative jurisdictions as well as in terms of revenue assignments . The Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution details the distribution of legislative powers and responsibilities between the federal and state governments . Apart from foreign affairs , defence , internal security , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes trade , commerce and industry , physical development such as communication and transport and human development such as education , health and medicine . By contrast , the state government 's purview is restricted to areas such as lands and mines , Muslim affairs and customs , native laws and customs , agriculture and forestry , local government and public services , burial grounds , markets and fairs , and the licensing of cinemas and theatres . The concurrent list covers social welfare , scholarships , town and country planning , drainage and irrigation , housing , culture and sports , and public health . <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> The Tenth Schedule of the Federal Constitution elaborates on revenue assignment , in part based on the division of jurisdiction spelt out in the Ninth Schedule . In the Tenth Schedule , income taxes , property and capital gains taxes , international trade taxes , as well as production and consumption taxes are all assigned to the federal government . The state government is allowed to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as forests . <p> But under the Petroleum Development Act ( PDA ) 1974 , all states give up their rights to petroleum resources found within their states . Ownership and control of petroleum and gas , though natural resources , are transferred to the federally owned and controlled company , Petronas , which is tasked with exploiting and mining the resource . In exchange , Petronas pays the state and federal governments five per cent royalty each -- Petronas receives 49 per cent while the producer-company receives the remaining 41 per cent -- of the gross value of petroleum production . In addition , the federal government taxes the producer company ( Sarawak Shell , Sabah Shell or Esso ) . Consequently , the federal government receives far more revenue from petroleum than do the petroleum-producing states . <p> The Constitution also stipulates that the federal government is obliged to provide two major grants to the state governments , namely the ' capitation grant ' , which is based on the population size , and the ' state road grant ' , which helps the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect also a grant that takes into consideration the geographical size of the state . Apart from these two , there are about 10 other tax-sharing taxes and levies that the state is allowed to collect or where the federal government has to reimburse the state . The petroleum royalty is one such case . In the past , ten per cent of the export duties on tin , iron and other minerals were also transferred to the states from which the mineral was derived . <p> At any rate , the federal government has sole jurisdiction , though perhaps not sole discretion over the disbursement of all development funds . The end result is a very uneven distribution of revenue assignment , and therefore financial resources between the federal and state governments . This fact highlights a major anachronism in fiscal federalism in Malaysia . In most countries , a fairer and more balanced distribution of revenue collection and resources has evolved through constitutional reform . The reverse has occurred in Malaysia . <p> What this means is that the federal BN government can , technically speaking , deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the federal government would not like to irk the wrath of voters in opposition-led states , who might further turn against them in future elections , the federal government usually continues to provide funds to these states with the proviso that these are channelled through federal agencies and the Federal Development Offices of each state . This was what happened in the cases of Sabah and Kelantan in the past . <p> Recall that the Pas-led Terengganu government was denied royalty payments from Petronas during 1999-2004 , on the basis that the petroleum resources which the Terengganu government claimed were located beyond the state 's territorial waters . That said , the federal government continued to fund development projects in Terengganu under the basis of wang ehsan for the state . Second , apart from the federal-bias in the constitutional design , the political process that has allowed a single political party , the BN , to control the centre for 50 years , has further facilitated a centralised federalism . This domination coincides with the increased role of the Executive in decision-making which has been legitimised in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve ethno-religious harmony in multi-ethnic , multi-religious Malaysia . The abolition of local authority elections in the 1970s has allowed the BN to further penetrate into the third tier of government where their appointed councillors dominate the municipalities , town councils and district councils . <p> Hence , not only can the federal government dictate the pace and direction of development in the states , including in opposition-controlled states . The federal Executive may also invoke party discipline to remove the Menteri Besar ( MB ) of constituent states whenever they challenge the prerogatives of the centre . In the early 1990s , several opposition leaders calling for greater autonomy for Sabah were detained without trial on the grounds of fostering secession while two Umno MBs who questioned or disobeyed their federal leaders were put into political limbo during the 1970s . <p> Third , the development process underscored by the implementation of the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) further contributed to the expansion and consolidation of the federal government . For in pursuit of the NEP , the federal government established numerous statutory bodies and public corporations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public sector and tight control by the central authorities which shifted even more power from the states to the federal authorities . A case in point is the establishment of the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board ( CVLB ) , a federal authority , charged with ensuring bumiputera participation in the transportation industry while licensing commercial vehicles . Consequently , the licensing and even the routing of buses providing public transport in the states and local authority areas came under the purview of federal authorities , in this case , the CVLB . <p> As well , through the auspices of Felda and regional development authorities , the federal authorities also penetrated into the states . Hence although the goal was to create a ' bumiputera commercial and industrial community ' to reduce inequalities and thereby foster national unity , the NEP also enhanced the powers of the federal over the state governments , indeed , the local authorities too . -- F Loh <p> Federalism and federal-state relations are topics that have not been adequately studied by Malaysian academics , let alone the public .

@@42247235 <h> When KPIs enter the courts <p> Key Performance Indicators ( KPIs ) have been introduced in courts to improve efficiency . But the preoccupation with the speedy disposal of cases may come at the expense of justice , warns the Penang Bar Committee . <p> The Penang High Court - Photo credit : Qing Moments , Holidays in Penang , PicasaIt has been more that a year since the Tracking System was first introduced to the courts in Kuala Lumpur . Since then , the Tracking System has been introduced in the courts in almost all the major towns in Malaysia . A key feature of this Tracking System is the Key Performance Indicator ( KPI ) with the speedy disposal of cases becoming the " be-all " and " end-all " of the court system in the administration of justice . This is an undeniable fact . <p> This KPI , which had until then been kept out of the judicial system , took the courts by storm with the sole aim of clearing the backlog of cases which had reached serious proportions . The Court was made to function like a government department e.g. the Passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " y " number of passports in a day ; courts too were given a target to dispose off " x " number of cases in a day . The clearing of the targeted number of cases meant that the KPI was achieved and justice served ! <p> Whilst the use of the KPI as a measure of competency and efficiency for the judiciary served its purpose of accelerating the painfully slow wheels of justice and may be accepted as necessary to get under-performing judges and other judicial officers and staff scrambling to their feet , unfortunately there are some notable unhappy features in the implementation of the KPI , which need to be addressed immediately . <p> Speedy disposal of cases as a measure of KPI <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> The introduction of measures and short time-lines to speed up the various processes in the administration of justice is indeed much-anticipated and long-overdue in the following areas : <p> a ) return of sealed copies of newly registered originating process and applications ; b ) return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft orders ; d ) return of sealed copies of orders and judgments ; e ) pre-trial case management before hearing dates are given ; f ) video and audio recording of trials and open court applications ; g ) significant increase in the number of courts , judicial officers and judicial commissioners and judges at all tiers ; h ) significant increase in the number of supporting staff ; and i ) introduction of the T-Track , A-Track &amp; M-(FLJC) Tracks <p> The Penang Bar finds that the above-mentioned measures have gone a long way in speeding up the disposal of cases , extraction of sealed orders and originating process although there are still hiccups here and there due to shortage of supporting staff and documents , such as draft orders getting lost after being submitted to court . <p> In these areas of the administration of justice , we find that the use of time-lines and fixing a rate for disposal of the tasks as measures of KPI as not only useful and effective but a sheer necessity . All lazy personnel must therefore be weeded out because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judicial discretion or the judicial mind and may be put on the administrative conveyor belt without much thought . <p> Lives and Liberty are not involved in these manual tasks . No one is sentenced to death nor loses his home by this administrative task . The use of KPI as a measure of performance is therefore fine in these areas . <p> The use of rates for disposal of cases as a measure of judicial expediency in the courts is , however , one that needs serious re-thinking because of the far-reaching consequences it has brought about and the repercussions that will necessarily follow . <p> The sanctity and quality of justice can not be sacrificed in the name of speed and statistics . Although we agree that tougher measures had to be taken to get the entire judicial system moving at a much faster speed , it is regretted that the emphasis has been solely on the speedy disposal of cases -- and all other important features to create a good judiciary , namely the emphasis on the integrity of judges and judicial officers ; having sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving due consideration of evidence and arguments and well-reasoned written judgments , which all are crucial for the development of law , have all been unceremoniously sacrificed in the process . <p> Courtrooms , which should be the last bastion of justice , have become the very places where so-called speedy justice or injustice is dispensed because members of the bench are compelled to race to meet their judicial KPI . The steps that have been put in place in the name of speedier disposal of cases are in effect steps which will slowly and effectively destroy the Malaysian judiciary which , for all its shortcomings , was up to now still a significant contributor to the development of the common law by its judicial precedents reported in the law journals . <p> The question of what constitutes a " backlog " should also be given some serious consideration for old and/or dormant files and cases do not automatically slow down or prevent the disposal of newer cases when neither party to such actions are interested in pursuing them further . In these circumstances , the Court may call up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate manner . <p> It should also be pointed out that although cases of this nature may have a minor bearing on the overall statistics of " outstanding " cases , they do not have any direct or immediate consequences on the actual number of trial cases that are pending hearing or which need to be disposed off expediently . <p> It must be remembered that judges are " demi-gods " who determine the fate and lives of those who appear before them ; they are looked upon as the fountains of justice . The speedy justice expected to be delivered by the judges may deprive them of the opportunity to do justice , which often requires long and careful research and deliberation . <p> In time to come , there will not be any complaints of delay in the disposal of cases but the complaints will grow about the quality of the rushed justice being handed down . Any judge will readily admit that they have no time to deliver or write well-researched and reasoned judgments because Courtrooms have been turned into " statistical " departments to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the number of cases disposed for otherwise the presiding judge will not be considered a " good " judge worthy of promotion . <p> What is the effect of KPI on the judiciary ? <p> The preoccupation with the speedy disposal of cases overlooks the following repercussions : <p> ( a ) the requirement that judicial time on the bench between 8.30am to 5.00pm or more is to be spent to race against time to clear the " targeted " number of cases set for disposal , failing which the presiding judge has to explain himself , means : -- <p> ( i ) there is no time at all allowed during the work day for reading and considering written submissions filed by parties , for his own research and for delivering or writing well-reasoned judgments -- all of which are important tasks for a judicial officer who is tasked with dealing with the lives and liberties of the public . The public go to court not for speed alone but for justice as well . Even the one hour the judicial officers had from 8.00am to 9.00am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 July 2010 with the courts being directed to start at 8.30am , supposedly on the instructions of the Prime Minister 's Department ; <p> ( ii ) the judiciary is expected to carry out all the above tasks in their own time , thus relegating very significant tasks to the sidelines . We can not develop a world class judiciary with the present emphasis on speedy disposal as the only yardstick of a good judiciary . International investors may shy away when good , reasoned judgments became scarce . The government is rushing around the globe to bring investors into Malaysia and the judiciary should follow suit by to creating a world class judiciary to complement the government 's efforts ; <p> ( iii ) as not enough time is given for these important tasks , judges who are not able to cope with them resort to short-cuts as a means of coping -- for instance , striking out of cases , hearing cases and applications without reading the file or , worse still , deciding cases without giving consideration to the written submissions or oral arguments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to do a decent job will more adversely affect those handling the A-track and M-track cases as they will have to prepare for and hear not just one case a day but many . In some courts , the number of cases coming up before them range from 15 to 40 with at least four or five cases coming up for decisions on a daily basis ; as such , the judge must not be forced to flip a coin to decide the case ; <p> ( iv ) having to perform part of their judicial tasks at home means that family life is adversely affected as time that is meant for the family is usurped by having to read files and write judgments etc . This is contrary to the objective of the government 's introduction of a five-day week so that the Malaysian public can spend more quality time to raise their families ; <p> ( v ) this also affects quality of life and health . The number of deaths in the Penang Bar recently has been unprecedented ; some reportedly due to work pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise and relaxation after a full day 's hearing . The much-needed opportunity for judges to unwind and to relax with their families , which is essential for mental , physical and emotional well being in this line of work , has been sacrificed . Many judges have complained that their health has suffered after the KPI was introduced into the Courts . The consequence of this may mean more broken marriages , deterioration of relationships , poor parenting and abandonment of responsibilities on the family front ; and <p> ( iv ) there is bound to be adverse effects on the mental and physical health of members of the judiciary at all levels ; the constant pressure to perform at present levels daily and the need to remain competent in order not to lose out on promotional prospects will definitely trigger a host of health problems , burn-out , mental depression and emotional problems as well , and lead to an unhealthy judiciary in the immediate future . <p> The pressure is greatest on Judicial Commissioners , who are constantly bugged by the acute awareness that their contracts may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long while before they are confirmed . Such uncertainties , whilst it may be good to ensure that they work hard , nevertheless have negative impacts . The emphasis on faster disposal of cases as a criteria for measuring KPI will make many decide to concentrate solely on disposing off cases at all costs -- thus the refusal to allow adjournments even on reasonable grounds , a higher rate of DNAAs , the demand that cases be closed even if witnesses are not available for good reasons , the refusal to fix dates suitable to parties , etc. ; <p> ( b ) the emphasis on speed as opposed to competence gives an opportunity for incompetent and low-calibre judges or judicial officers to make their mark and be touted as role-models even though they succeed only because of the short-cuts they resort to in the name of speed . As a consequence of this , good , competent judicial officers who still believe in giving a good hearing and sufficient opportunities for parties to put forward their case and who write good , reasoned judgments may find their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead ( some in fact have already done so ! ) ; <p> ( c ) the emphasis on speed does not take into consideration that there are different levels of competence and knowledge amongst judicial officers . For instance , a judicial commissioner who has spent all his working life in the Attorney-General 's chambers or who has done mainly prosecution work will need time to familiarise himself with the law if he is placed in the civil court . <p> However , once he has been given time to familiarise himself with the processes and the law , the Judicial Commissioner may prove himself to be very good in the field ; but only if his acquisition of knowledge can be harvested and the need to maintain a speed for disposing off cases remain secondary only ; <p> ( d ) There will be gradual deterioration in the quality of judges and judicial officers because of the lack of emphasis on integrity , acquisition of knowledge and research , writing of reasoned judgments , judicial temperament and proper exercise of judicial discretion . There have been so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been almost completely over-ridden by administrative directives and the KPI and some may say that judges are becoming robotic ! ; <p> ( e ) There will soon be little or no growth in common law in Malaysia because judges are not encouraged to , and are not given time to , write reasoned judgments but are told to keep judgments short . As there is then no need to justify their judgments and set out their thought process in arriving at decisions , judges and judicial officers will not bother to give much thought to decisions they make and there will be an avalanche of appeals to the appellate courts , which we believe has already taken place ; <p> ( f ) The future of the judiciary is at stake because magistrates are not given the right on-the-job training to become good judges in future -- everyone is caught up in speedy disposal of cases and producing statistics and there is so little emphasis on justice in the courts . This is of special concern given the impending increase of jurisdiction for lower courts ; <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the requirement for written submissions in almost every case . The future generation of lawyers will be purely solicitors ! Why call yourself an advocate when advocacy is forbidden in many Courts . <p> ( h ) public frustration with the judiciary will soon increase considerably because they may find their cases which had been languishing for years in the courts suddenly being disposed off without much of a hearing . They are not able to be represented by , say , a senior criminal lawyer of their choice in a capital case or a senior civil lawyer in a complex commercial case . Their life and liberty may be compromised . The client will then find himself in a position akin to a heart patient being operated on by a general practitioner and not by the heart surgeon he has so carefully chosen to save his life . <p> Conclusion <p> If remedial measures are not taken to address the above concerns , then the legacy of the Tracking System will not be a speedy and efficient judiciary as hoped for , but a judiciary that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation of justice . Needless to say , in time to come , the public will lose confidence in the judicial system and foreign investments will look elsewhere . <p> It is time to reflect , make adjustments and help to create a judiciary that the public can be really proud of . This memorandum is presented by the Penang Bar Committee , after careful thought , as joint stakeholders in the administration of justice in Malaysia . It is not intended to play down some good achievements after the introduction of KPIs in Court , as stated above . At the same time we can not lose sight of the fact that the present system of concentrating only on speed -- and without sufficient emphasis on quality of justice -- may mean that we are heading in the wrong direction . <p> The judiciary can not be statistics driven ; it must be justice driven . <p> Justice comprehends not merely a decision after a case but also a fair hearing where litigants , lawyers and judges alike are not rushed and pressured to complete a case just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial of a fair hearing/trial and consequently a denial of justice . One of the components of natural justice is the guarantee of a fair hearing/trial to litigants who appear before the Court . A backlog of cases can not be a reason to deny the litigant a fair hearing/trial . A fair hearing/trial is as important as a just decision ; neither can be sacrificed for the sacrifice of one may lead to the sacrifice of the other . <p> This open memorandum is sent to the Chief Justice and Chief Judge with the hope that our views and the general views of the members of the Bar will be taken into consideration and that a compromise between speed and quality of justice can be achieved . <p> Thanks for dropping by !

@@42247236 <h> 1 Factory , 1 Employer , please <p> Charles Hector alerts us to attempts to amend the Employment Act , which could fundamentally dilute or obscure the employer-worker relationship through the use of labour outsourcing contractors . <p> The Barisan Nasional government once again shows itself as being anti-workers and anti-unions , by trying to change the very nature of employment relationships in Malaysia . <p> They are trying to ' save ' companies and corporations from the ' burdens ' of being employers . They are trying to free them from their obligations as employers to provide for the welfare and rights of the workers who work for them -- the same workers who produce the products or carrying out the services that earn these employers their profits . <p> If you do not have employees , then you do not have to worry about any unions , collective bargaining agreements , employment agreements , getting rid of workers , rest day , annual leave , sick/hospitalisation leave , maternity leave , retirement age , social security schemes ( Socso/Workmen 's Compensation ) , contributions to employees provident funds ( EPF ) or other retirement schemes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Departments or courts , levy payments , lay-offs and retrenchments . If you want to get rid of a worker , just pick up the phone and call their ' employer ' and ask them to take the worker away -- no worry about due process , domestic inquiry , termination notices , and wrongful dismissal allegations . <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> The situation in Malaysia today is that already many workers in many factories and workplaces are already not being considered as employees of the factories where they work . Instead , they are considered to be ' outsourced workers ' -- employees of the agents or companies that supply these workers to the factory ( the principal ) . <p> One interesting phenomenon is that factories are not just using one supplier of workers , but many different suppliers each supplying a certain number of workers . Hence , we have workers in the factory , some still direct employees of the factory , while the others are employees of many different employers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not all , workers in a factory may no longer be employees of the factory but employees of external third-party employers , whose business is just supplying workers . <p> Even though , in my opinion , this is illegal and contrary to the laws in Malaysia , especially the Employment Act 1955 , the Malaysian government seems to have chosen to ignore this breach in law -- and is once again trying to legalise this by amending the Act . The latest attempt is through the Employment ( Amendment ) Bill 2011 that was tabled in Parliament on 21 June 2011 . <p> 1Factory , 1Employer , 1 Union <p> It becomes very important for us to remind ourselves what an employment relationship is , and why it must be a direct relationship between the owner/operator of a factory ( the principal ) and the workers that work in the factory producing the products that earn profits for that factory . There should never be some third party inserted into this current relationship or partnership . <p> On the one hand , there is the person/entity that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory , plantation , construction company and workplace ) . To carry out production or services , this entity needs labour , and this is provided for by human workers . <p> A relationship or partnership is thus created between the entity that owns the means of production and the workers who can provide the required labour . This relationship justly has been an employer ( the principal ) -- worker relationship , which naturally always is an employer-employee relationship . <p> The employer ( the principal ) thus enters into a contract of service with its workers . For the work done , workers are paid wages and provided other benefits and rights including rest days , annual leave , public holidays , paid medical/hospitali-sation leave , maternity benefits , social security , retirement provisions , and bonuses . <p> In the determination of this contractual relationship between the employer and workers , negotiations and interaction between the worker/s and the employer on all aspects related to the work , including wages , better and safer working conditions and other benefits will take place . <p> To better negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and will likely do so collectively as a trade union or as a workers association . The strength or power that a worker has in this negotiation process is of course the capacity for collective worker actions , which could include joint demands , protests , pickets , strikes , go-slow actions and other forms of collective action . This is the only bargaining strength that a worker has , and the law recognises these rights including the right to strike . <p> To protect this right , there are laws that guarantee freedom of association and the right to form trade unions and take workers ' action . Employers by law are prohibited from impeding this right to associate and form trade unions . Employers are clearly prohibited from getting rid of workers who try to form unions . <p> Realising also that workers generally are in a less favourable bargaining position compared to employers , governments have stepped in with laws , like our Employment Act 1955 , that stipulates the minimum rights that workers are entitled to , and employers are obliged to provide . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a contract of service ... which is less favourable to an employee than a term or condition of service prescribed by this Act ... shall be void and of no effect to that extent and the more favourable provisions of this Act .... shall be substituted therefore .... " <p> If there is a breach by the employer or the worker-employee ( or their unions ) , the law has set up mechanisms or avenues for justice , including the Labour Department , Industrial Relations Department , Labour Courts , Industrial Courts and other civil courts . An employment relationship beyond contractual and legal obligations <p> This employment relationship also goes beyond contractual and legal obligations . Better employers will reward workers with bonuses , employee outings and holidays when the business is doing well . Worker-employees also do not just do the work but also develop a sense of responsibility , belonging , care and pride in being part of the company . A relationship that goes beyond merely a ' work-for-pay ' relationship also encourages better productivity and an improved relationship between the factory and workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for workers , when times are bad , to agree to take part-pay first until the situation improves or even work overtime and on rest days when there is a need . Sports and other social activities develop this kind of environment . Workers develop a sense loyalty and will generally stay on working for the factory until retirement . Good employers reward this loyalty with wage increments and better benefits . <p> This was how a employment relationship was and should always remain -- and this is also reflected in the employment laws of Malaysia that provide for increased entitlement for longer service , like annual leave and medical leave . Length of service is also a consideration when it comes to calculating termination and lay-off benefits . <p> This employment relationship has a humane caring element about it , and this is good . It was never driven just by profits and losses , and it should never be so since we are dealing with human beings . <p> Government out to destroy just employment relationships <p> Sadly , our current Barisan Nasional government seems to be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of third parties into what should be a two party relationship . The government is trying to make new employers out of suppliers of workers to factories , by legalising ' contractors for labour ' . This was something that , I believe , was intentionally left out from the Employment Act 1955 by earlier law-makers . <p> In July 2010 , the government tried to amend our Employment Act ( vide Bill DR 25/2010 ) . They tried to clearly and transparently extend the definition of " employer " to include also " any person who supplies or undertakes to supply any employee engaged by him to any employer , principal , contractor or sub-contractor " . This Bill , after much protest was withdrawn in October 2010 . <p> Now in June 2011 , they have introduced again the Employment ( Amendment ) Bill 2011 ( DR152011E ) , but this time they hide the intention to make the supplier of workers employers . Again , they try to introduce the " contractor for labour " , and that same new section 33A , which states " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply any employee " , which from the wording used can imply that after the worker is supplied to the factory by the ' contractor of labour ' , that worker may still remain the employee of the supplier -- and not the employee of the factory . They are still trying to make ' suppliers of workers ' into employers , even after the worker has been accepted by the factory and started working there . <p> This is wrong , for once a factory accepts the worker , it should be the factory that becomes the employer , and the ' supplier ' should cease to be in the picture . <p> One of the main objections in 2010 was about the introduction of this ' contractor for labour ' , but somehow this BN government does not listen to workers , their unions and others . <p> Because they have the majority of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , and given the fact that BN MPs do not have the guts or the freedom to vote against Bills put forward by the government , these Bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last so-called ' minimum wage ' Bill , was tabled on 21 June , debated for about four hours and passed in less than 10 days . There was no time for public consultation , let alone time for MPs to even study the Bill and get feedback from their constituents . <p> Well , the current Employment Act recognises the ' sub-contractor for labour ' , who can only supply workers to contractors and sub-contractors but not the principal ( being the factories , plantations and workplaces ) . This was intentional to ensure that as far as principals are concerned , there will only be one kind of employment relationship , that is the one between the principal and the workers that work for them -- an employer-employee relationship . <p> Contractors and sub-contractors , are those who are given certain , usually short term , contracts at the premises/workplaces of the principal -- generally nothing to do with the usual work/business of the principal . This work would be maybe some electrical/piping work or repair , painting , some construction work , and the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of late , some kinds of work , again not related to actual production , like security and cleaning services have also been contracted out -- or rather ' outsourced ' to some security companies or cleaning/maintenance companies . There is a doubt whether these security and cleaning companies would come under the original meaning intended for the words contractor or sub-contractor that is found in the Employment Act . <p> Malaysian law already allows for the private employment agency that " acts as intermediary for the purpose of procuring employment for a worker or supplying a worker for an employer " , but this is very different from what the ' contractor for labour ' is expected to do . They would not be supplying workers for an employer , rather supplying their own employees to work for the employer ( principal ) , and this is very different . There is really no need for ' contractors for labour ' -- for the problem of finding workers can already be handled by these private employment agencies . <p> Now , employers ( principals ) can always use agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management of workers , but these will always be the employer 's agents , and the ultimate responsibility of being the employer rests with the principal . The government did state once that they never wanted ' outsourcing agents ' to be the employers -- but alas , lack of enforcement of the law has allowed many bad employers ( principals ) to try to evade/disguise employment relationships with workers in their own factory , claiming that workers supplied by these ' outsourcing agents ' ( contractors for labour ) are not their employees . How will this affect unions and bargaining powers ? <p> Well , if there is a significant number of workers working in a factory who are not employees of the factory , that will certainly diminish the bargaining power of the unions . Why ? Because if there is to be a union action like a protest , go-slow or even strike , it will not affect the factory much as operations can still proceed with the other workers who are not employees of the factory . <p> The factory will be practising a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' struggles for better working conditions , rights and benefits in the factory . <p> In fact , even the desire to join or form such a weakened union will decrease . As it is , when employers were allowed to avoid security of tenure for employees by resorting to the use of workers under fixed duration contracts and more recently that new class of ' part-time employees ' , interest in unions diminished significantly . The worry of fixed-term employees has always been that their contracts would just not be renewed if they joined unions or started claiming rights . <p> MTUC and the trade union movement <p> As it is , the number of trade unions and workers who are members of unions is already very low , about 8 per cent of the workforce . Apparently , only 3.2 per cent of private sector workers are unionised . The reason for this has not only been the difficulties in organising and forming unions that have been imposed by law , but also the new employment trends that our pro-employer government have been adopting . The entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already affected trade unions . Soon , if we do not manage to stop it , we will see the emergence of a situation where in a factory , there will be a large number of workers who are just not employees of the factory , but employees of many different ' contractors for labour ' . That may be the last nail in the coffin that will put many unions in Malaysia to rest . <p> The problem of these ' contractors for labour ' , if they are to be legalised , is that they supply batches of workers to different factories and workplaces . As such , their own ' employees ' not only would not be able to physically meet each other , organise and form unions -- but they may also not be able to be part of any current national , state or regional trade unions that are all sector-based . The ' contractor for labour ' may be supplying 500 workers to the plantation sector , 200 to the electronic sector , 200 to the textile sector -- so , which national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed ' contractor for labour ' come under -- the National Union of Plantation Workers ? The Regional Union of Electronic Workers ? The Textile Workers Union ? How then do they enter into collective agreements that deal with work conditions -- for their working conditions will certainly differ depending on where they actually work . ( Our proposed ' contractor for labour ' really will not have any control about working conditions in the factory , would they ? ) <p> Will the rights and welfare of workers and their families be our priority ? <p> Well , the problem in Malaysia is that workers ' rights and concerns certainly have not attracted much media attention , and one wonders whether the government had a hand in this . We do not see the Prime Minister or ministers visiting workers at their workplaces , listening to their grievances and doing something about them . Likewise , alternative media also do not give much coverage to workers ' issues . Sadly , there is also no regular workers ' magazine or periodical -- and for this , maybe the bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the blame . Building up workers ' awareness and union-building activities is also much lacking . <p> What is sad is that at one time , the workers ' movement was a very influential player in society , and governments and political parties struggled to get their support , and to do that workers ' rights and welfare were a priority on the political agenda . Today , let us not forget that there are still more than 10 million workers in Malaysia , and they constitute a large percentage of the electorate who vote in parliamentarians and the government ; so maybe there must be a renewed interest in matters affecting workers and their unions . <p> There is an urgent need for not just politicians , but all justice-loving Malaysians to come together in defence of workers and their unions . Maybe the first thing that we need to do is to lobby and ensure that the new Employment ( Amendment ) Bill 2011 does not get passed . We have to lobby for the maintaining of a just employment relationship , so that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers working there are employees of that one employer . We have to lobby against the turning of ' suppliers of workers ' or ' contractors for labour ' or ' outsourcing companies ' into employers . <p> Some may not be bothered because they believe that all this will only affect migrant workers -- but it is already affecting local Malaysian workers , who are already today being supplied by ' outsourcing agents ' to factories , who do not regard them as employees of the factory . Some believe that it will only affect the private sector , and again they would be wrong : if the act is amended , then sooner or later , those working in government establishments may also end up not being employees of the government -- but some third party ' contractor for labour ' . Many civil servants were indifferent when they started ' fixed-term contracts ' in the private sector , but alas today , governments also are using workers employed on fixed-term contracts . <p> This is an issue that concerns all workers , now and in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barisan National government 's attempts to destroy just employment relationships -- which will be highly detrimental to all workers and their families . Given the state of affairs in our Malaysian Parliament , maybe we may need to come out again in large numbers in peaceful assemblies , as was done recently with regard to free and fair elections , to effectively communicate the position of Malaysians on this issue that will affect workers and their unions .

By winning an election , the government receives a mandate from the people to govern . It is fair to expect the government to exercise good judgement in making decisions even by themselves on most ordinary matters . <p> It is , however , paramount that at all times the government decides and acts on behalf of the people .

@@42253240 <p> The costs of India 's Covid-19 crisis are too high Tuesday , September 8th , 2020 at , Opinion <p> by MIHIR SHARMA / pic by AFP <p> INDIA is reeling from a quadruple whammy that is practically unique even during this pandemic . First , growth has taken a hit that appears to be larger than any of its peers , with GDP shrinking 23.9% in the first post-pandemic quarter . <p> While the economy has reopened somewhat since then , it remains beset by supply constraints . That means -- second -- that inflation may have reached almost 7% , according to Bloomberg Economics ' Abhishek Gupta . <p> That 's well out of the Reserve Bank of India 's comfort zone . And , third , all this has hit an economy that was already suffering from slipping potential growth and a major tax revenue crisis following the underperformance of a national Goods and Services Tax . <p> India might still have managed this economic storm if its Covid-19 case total was not exploding as well . The country is now registering over 83,000 new cases a day . Most nations across the world have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India , on the other hand , new daily records are still being set . <p> It 's likely that the pandemic has , as feared , moved out of urban areas into India 's vast , and crowded , rural hinterland . <p> Here , health services will be far less equipped for a surge in cases -- and a distant state machinery itself may not know of localised outbreaks till it is too late . The government , faced with a crashing economy and with its cupboards completely bare , has no real way to directly improve the welfare of those most affected . <p> Programmrs like Britain 's furlough scheme or the US ' US$600 ( RM2,496 ) per week unemployment aid are a distant dream in India . Even if the government had the money -- which , thanks to its tax botch-up , it does not -- it could n't be sure of getting it to the people in need . <p> So , as far as officials are concerned , the only way to get people back on their feet is to gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Restrictions are being removed without any consideration for the increasing caseload and with minimal information about possible infection clusters . <p> Strangely , there 's very little panic in India , either among policymakers or the public in general . Perhaps , that 's because the case fatality rate , as far as the government can tell , is well below 2% and thus among the lowest in the world . <p> We do n't know why -- are we missing cases , as the Lancet suggests ? India is increasingly using buggy antigen tests , so that is certainly a possibility . It 's also possible that Covid-related deaths are n't being recorded as such . <p> While there are no signs yet that the health system is overloaded , it may be getting there . Delhi 's most prestigious state-run hospital recently tried to shut down all outpatient work to focus on hospitalisations . <p> Worryingly , the drumbeat for a big " stimulus " has begun . Pressure is growing on the Finance Ministry -- which has so far been impressively careful -- to start shelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even gone to the Supreme Court demanding the judges ensure they do n't have to pay interest on their loans . <p> The fact is , however , that a " second stimulus " -- especially one directed at business -- would be fiscally dangerous . It would also be wasted money , because neither consumer nor business sentiment is going to revive , while case numbers are growing so fast . Everyone can see the curve and nobody knows how bad it may still get . <p> Meanwhile , as the Delhi hospital 's attempt to cut off routine health services indicates , the silent costs of the pandemic are building up . The immunisation programme , for example , has essentially been halted , which means that a generation of children will be particularly vulnerable to communicable diseases , such as measles . <p> Millions of kids who already receive an education that is not up to global standards can not go to school . And , unlike in the West , only a quarter of students in India can access online classes . Given that this generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last shot at prosperity , that 's especially bad news . <p> India wo n't get a proper sense of the extent of these silent costs for some time , certainly not before next year .

Additionally , customers for each of the 500 units exclusively for the Vietnamese market can select from a further 18 customised colours " according to their preferences , personalities and feng shui requirements , " says VinFast . <p> The President SUV is on display at showrooms and dealers in Vietnam , and customers can place orders for the vehicle from today . <p> Open roads and closed circuits hold great allure for Mick Chan .

In fact , even the kids ' parents should read it , instead of whining all the time about safety standards and what-not . <p> Our nation 's history is told through a somewhat different perspective because it foregrounds the role of economic exploitation in the shaping of our society . There are lots of interesting nuggets that may not make it into standard history texts .

We would now have a multi-racial peasantry , with arguably different repercussions for how we view ourselves now . <p> Although it ends in 1957 , this is not a story marked by mothballs and cobwebs .

@@42273231 <p> And here it is ! The hotly-anticipated 2020 Proton X50 has been officially revealed by the national carmaker , showing off the new compact crossover with the trademark Infinite Weave grille , blacked-out roof and red interior . Looks mighty good , does n't it ? <p> There are little surprises here , of course , with it being very closely based on the Geely Binyue ( or Coolray in the Philippines ) , with just the grille and Proton logos marking it out . Nonetheless , it 's a handsome and thoroughly modern design , far more edgy than its bigger brother , the X70 . <p> Design highlights include the subtle red splashes on the grille , both front and rear brake calipers and of course , the black and red interior . The high-angle view shows off a panoramic sunroof too , which is definitely a first for this class of cars . Not too long ago , we also sighted the key fob that comes with the car , which does n't differ heavily from its counterparts in China and the Philippines , save for the Proton script at the back . <p> Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Binyue in terms of design , but flipped from left- to right-hand drive and with the latest Proton logo on the steering wheel . On the dash is a wide-format touchscreen powered by a GKUI infotainment system , while other available features as far as our eyes can see include automatic air-conditioning , an electronic parking brake , selectable drive modes , second-row air vents with USB charging ports , and a digital instrument cluster display . <p> Click to enlarge <p> Further specifics have yet to be revealed just yet , but the X50 is likely getting a 1.5 litre turbocharged and direct-injection three-cylinder petrol engine with 177 hp and 255 Nm of torque , paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission as available in both China and the Philippines . The 0-100 km/h time as claimed by Geely is 7.9 seconds . <p> Built on the modular BMA platform , the X50 is expected to be offered with class-leading safety features . Six airbags and electronic stability control will be standard , while the upper variant(s) are likely to have autonomous emergency braking ( AEB ) and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist . Proton CEO Dr Li Chunrong even confirmed that it will get a full-fledged Level 2 semi-autonomous driving features ! <p> Now that we have our first official look at the new Proton X50 , it 's clear that we 're very close to the new model 's official debut . Li himself mentioned to expect big news this coming Tuesday , so as usual , stay tuned to paultan.org ! <p> Preferring to drive cars rather than desks , Hafriz Shah ditched his suit and tie to join the ranks of Malaysia 's motoring hacks . A car 's technical brilliance is completely lost on him , appreciating character-making quirks more . When not writing this ego trip of a bio , he 's usually off driving about aimlessly , preferably in a car with the right combination of three foot pedals and six gears . <p> Perodua D55L will not only disrupt Proton X50 sales , D55L will also disrupt Honda HR-V sales as well . If you look at Japan sales data , Toyota Raize sales is No. 1 ! This is why I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car just like in Japan <p> This car is good but I am waiting for the Game-Changing D55L . When I was in Japan , I test drive the Toyota Raize and it feels so premium and fun to drive . It has a lot of safety features as well as cool gadgets . The exterior is stunning , even headlamp got sequential turn signal just like Lexus cars . The engine is very powerful , fuel saving and reliable . This is why I ca n't wait for Perodua to launch the D55L . I 'll skip the X50 . <p> The same goes to some of hondii sales men also trying hard to make silly comments . Can see hondii designers are getting lousiat and hondii cars also getting even more buruk now . That 's why hondii and their hondii R&amp;D team decided to produce badge and put on General Motor Cars . <p> @Maclaurin But Mario , we have n't seen any Honda cars rebadging GM cars yet . But , it is GM who is rebadging China cars . This shows that China knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebadging China cars now . Even Proton R&amp;D also resorted to produce badge and put on Geely cars <p> And yet for all the bash you give to Honda and praising every other carmakers including Toyota , Nissan , Hyundai , Kia , etc , you still drive a Honda City . Either you must be lying or too tsundere to admit you loved Honda ! LOL <p> The Game-Changing X50 is clearly superior to Honda HR-V but I do n't understand why in China alone the Geely Binyue sales is still below Honda HR-V . I guess people still trust in Honda quality more than Geely . This is why Honda is positioned in No.3 while Geely in No.4 <p> @Murtabak kampung I agree bro . It always happens before . Last time Proton Savvy hype is so huge but in the end Game-Changing Myvi sales is 6X more than Savvy . Same thing happened to Iriz too . Now the same will happen again with Proton X50 VS Perodua D55L . <p> MAA sales figures say otherwise with both Honda and Toyota losing significant volume the past 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proton . The latter is regaining lost ground with its new model offensive but the former is getting increasingly desperate as witnessed by their disparaging Honda City RS ad . <p> That 's their company attitude problem when posting unprofessional Honda City RS ad by showing off and attacking to few of car brands . But every car brands did n't do anything wrong . And yet , Honda salesmen refusing for all sorts of wrongdoings against any of car brands including famous kimchi brands , as honda salesmen thinking that they did n't even done anything while every car brands SA are all wrong . Shows that they are always lying . Even , most honda owners complaining their honda cars about spare parts , Honda Malaysia also always refuse to listen about their spare parts problems . <p> You are right . Geely has given a wonderful gift for all Malaysians . Now everyone will be so proud of buying Proton X50 . Thank you Geely , thank you Li Chunrong . You have made Proton shine again . We thank you all for your hardwork and guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And yet for all the bash you give to Proton and praising China , you still bought a brand new homegrown Proton Persona last year .

For an automotive writer who also owns a Merc , that is a huge challenge . Proton really hit the ball out of the park for a homerun. ; - ) <p> Enough with the Game Over fake news john . Up there you said I owned a 2019 Persona , now you say Kunta also owned the same 2019 Persona , which one is correct ? Did n't Hafriz already reminded us all before not to post fake news ? Please bertaubat john , I know you can do it ! <p> X70 and X50 are not actual Protons , they are rebadged Geelys with minor Proton design input , such as the infinite weave grille . So when it comes to the whole vehicle , whether Proton 's quality of indigenous design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question mark . <p> Proton have long ago unshackled themselves from protectionism , they are today competing against Japanese brands on equal term . What is still dependant on the teats of protectionism is Perodua . They will suffer most , if not totally closed down , when protectionism ends . <p> Did you forget X70 selling at Rm123k ? That was withing eyeshot of CR-V Rm140k pricing and yet soon after debuting it conquered the SUV market which also included the much cheaper Aruz . What is your excuse for that ? <p> Toyota , Honda are not allows to sell cheap . Their selling price have to get govt approval b4 they can annouce to the public . Car industries should be liberalised and all car brand are freely allowed to set thier own selling price without interfere from govt . <p> Toyota , Honda not allowed to sell cheap ? Then what about Nissan ? They had Almera @RM69k which is close to Persona prices . Why Nissan can do it but not Toyota or Honda . Is it the Gomen or just their greed stopping them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , Honda is so cheap but other japanese cars , korean cars and proton are not allowed to sell cheap and decided to make price hike that happened in 4-5 years ago . Is it because Gomen also making protectionism for Honda as well ? <p> It has been unfair for Perodua as well as the manufacturing plant majority share own by Daihatsu . Malaysia only has majority share in selling the car not in manufacturing . But nobody highlights this matter . That 's why Proton was severely handicapped back then when it has to build the engine and chassis from scratch . Do try and error own their own meanwhile Perodua just rebadge and only recently build the outer shell for Bezza and third generation myvi . <p> So in order to level the playing field , Proton has opted for Perodua way . It has been unfair for Proton all along the way but nobody bothers . Why people only highlight Proton but not Perodua ? <p> What 's matter with that ! You go to other brands articles , honda fanboys bash other brands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honda fanboys have been badmouthing to other brands too often . Please think more logic bro <p> Not need to worry , this P X50 confirmed sell like no body business . Guess price around RM78 -- RM95 , if cheaper more damage to other same segment party . For Perodua , think maybe it will hurt Aruz sales , but for Axia , Bezza &amp; Myvi still can escape from the heatwave .

Those that do n't comply with the face mask directive can be slapped with a RM1000 compound notice under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 .

What next ? <p> Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices , a rottenness begins in his conduct . <p> -- Thomas Jefferson , third US president <p> The polling booths opened to much anticipation . <p> However , by the end of the evening , the much-vaunted Warisan Plus landslide did not materialise . <p> I am , of course , referring to the results of the hotly contested 16th Sabah elections last Saturday . <p> A netizen summarised it well , " The unthinkable has happened " , alluding to the fact that Sabah would remain under the strong grip of Malayan parties . <p> The expected landslide victory for Warisan Plus only translated to 32 seats . <p> GRS , on the other hand , garnered 38 seats with the three independents aligning themselves to them , giving them a total of 41 seats . <p> Despite the multitude of candidates in each constituency , it was a straight fight between Warisan Plus and GRS . <p> This 41-32 gap of eight seats , given the nature of Sabah politics , hardly translates to a stable state government . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Unity ' at its core did garner Warisan 29 seats but not the much-touted 40 plus seats . <p> In fact , its message has much in common to GPS in Sarawak . <p> The electorate snubbed the other parties . The voters also disregarded all 73 candidates from Parti Cinta Sabah ( PCS ) . <p> In addition to this , out of a total of 447 candidates vying for the 73 seats , 275 each lost their RM5,000 deposit after failing to secure one eighth or 12.5 percent of the total votes counted . <p> This might serve as an early warning to the non-mainstream parties in Sarawak . <p> The narrow issues of MA63 , Sarawak and oil rights might not get them much traction and therefore , electoral support . <p> Therefore , what went right or wrong ? This depends which side of the current political divide you are standing on . <p> One issue was Mohamaddin Ketapi , of Warisan , a serial ' foot in mouth ' politician and his uncalled-for remark that the Lahad Datu incursion was wayang , thereby hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed by militants from the Philippines . <p> Chief Minister Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal also appears to have failed to allay the fears of the Kadazan Dusun Murut ( KDM ) community when it came to ' PTI ' ( pendatang tanpa izin ) migrants . <p> The last-minute swing away from Warisan is also speculated to be attributed to alleged financial inducements in rural areas . <p> If this is true , some voters have also joined the ranks of kataks . So sama-sama with the elected representatives . <p> The immediate impact at the national level of the GRS victory has been to strengthen Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin who , since March 2020 , has been hanging on with a two-seat majority in a 222-seat parliament . <p> The prime minister 's popularity is due to his management of the Covid-19 pandemic and his management of our economy during the movement control order ( MCO ) seems to have had a larger than projected impact in Sabah . <p> This will also possibly strengthen his hand in dealing with Umno , especially related to the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of last Saturday 's 16th Sabah election will not have any direct effect in Sarawak or its upcoming election . However , there are some learning points . <p> One such point is DAP . It stood in Sabah under the Warisan logo and won six out of the seven seats . <p> How is this possible if DAP was said to be useless while it was in power for 22 months ? Surely , it ought to have been rejected due to its inability to deliver on its promises . <p> This is an important point to note in the upcoming Sarawak election . <p> It is widely agreed that DAP more or less tore up its Buku Harapan Manifesto when it came to its much-publicised promises on Sarawak rights and development . <p> The question arises if these broken promises will result in loss of seats here . <p> Well , if what happened in Sabah is anything to go by , better not hold your breath and make such assumptions . <p> You know what they say about the word ' assume ' -- make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ' . <p> Moving on , there has been much moralising about political kataks over the last few months . <p> However , in the Sabah polls , it seems the voters do not really mind them . Even the ' King of Kataks ' Datuk Dr Jeffrey Kitingan was voted back in . <p> So has all the derogatory talk about them become merely academic and therefore mute ? <p> Looks like they are here to stay and are actually accepted -- so another new normal in politics . <p> At the time of writing this , both Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin of Barisan Nasional ( BN ) and Datuk Seri Hajiji Mohd Noor of Perikatan Nasional ( PN ) are still waiting for Governor Tun Juhar Mahiruddin to call either one to form the next government . <p> Some are also wondering if the delay is to allow Shafie Apdul time to attract more elected representatives to allow him to form the government . <p> Amid rumours and speculations , the game continues ... and perhaps constant changes in the governance of Sabah . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the New Sarawak Tribune . <h> About Us <p> New Sarawak Tribune is a Sarawakian news portal that highlights Sarawak-centric news and other stories of relevance to Sarawak .

" <p> Despite that , Alan Lennox-Boyd on November 29 , 1956 , informed the Governor of North Borneo , Sir Roland Turnbull , " The possibility of a federation of North Borneo and Sarawak and indeed of all three Borneo territories ... is a matter for the people of the territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at no time did it HMG envisage self-government by the people of Sarawak . <p> However , it must be noted that the colonial officers in the two territories were initially adverse to the idea of a merger of the Borneo states with Malaya and Singapore which they considered premature . <p> More concerned with their populations of different ethnicities living in harmony , they had in mind a more gradual move towards independence with the possibility of first forming a Borneon federation before a merger with their more politically savvy neighbours across the South China Sea , Malaya and Singapore . The " Borneo Proposal " was put forward in 1958 , but , as Poulgrain notes , it was already foreshadowed by the 1953 paper , so even though the 1958 proposal presented the facade of official approval , " there was already an alternative plan " afoot . The Borneon proposal was in fact disparaged by the noted historian on South East Asian history , K.J. Tregonning as " a disguised MI5 exercise " . <p> Despite that , it is still widely believed and propagated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Borneo territories was made by then Prime Minister of Malaya , Tunku Abdul Rahman , on May 27 , 1961 , to the Foreign Correspondents " Association Club in Singapore . The British had more than ample reasons to let Tunku take the credit for what was in fact their brainchild , given the potential of the material benefits at stake for Britain . <p> It may be noted here that after the war , British interests in Malaya in the form of investments exceeded those that they had in India and the revenue from rubber and tin was sorely needed for post-war debt payment and reconstruction . The financial stake in having a peaceful merger of the Borneo territories and Singapore with Malaya was , therefore , huge . <p> Lee Kuan Yew , having been elected the Prime Minister of the self-governing colony of Singapore , then assisted the British to push forward the idea at the same time consolidating his own party 's position against that of the Barisan Socialis Socialist Front whom he characterised , together with the Chinese opposition in Sarawak , as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , Indonesia and China . <p> Lee between September 13 and October 9 , 1961 , made the 12 radio broadcasts ( published as The Battle for Merger ) in favour of the merger . <p> To Poulgrain , however , the primary impetus for forming Malaysia was oil , not ethnicity , even though much was made in the press then and in the mainstream books since of the Tunku 's insistence in having the Borneo colonies aboard in order to balance out the large Chinese population in Singapore with the indigenous populations in the Borneo territories . <p> In fact , as Poulgrain points out , by the time Malaysia was formed in 1963 , the Chinese were the largest ethnic group in Sarawak , according to the census taken in 1962 . The real focus was , therefore , on Brunei which Britain was determined to retain as " the biggest single source of dollars in the Sterling area . " <p> The oil industry being under the sole dominion of the Sultan of Brunei , it was to the advantage of the British Malayan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunei Shell Petroleum Company ( BSP ) and a subsidiary of the transnational Royal Dutch Shell Group , to continue the one-to-one arrangement to maintain its monopoly . <p> As early as March 1956 , the Sultan of Brunei , wary of the merger becoming a means of an enforced sharing of its oil wealth , had issued a press statement rejecting the notion of Brunei merging with Malaya . <p> This was followed by the redefinition of the maritime boundaries by Britain in September 1958 by the Queen 's " Order in Council " separating the offshore areas of Brunei from those of North Borneo and Sarawak . <p> Poulgrain notes that the delineation of new boundaries for Brunei was in contradiction to the purported intention of closer Borneo association , and , from the perspective of the Sultan , this timely redefinition of Brunei 's boundaries could only have been interpreted as support for his wish that the sultanate ( and with it , the oilfields ) remain distinct from any merger , amalgamation or plan for closer association . <p> Poulgrain continues , " remarkably the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the giant South West Ampa oilfield in Brunei territory , Even though a solution for the decolonisation of the Borneo territories had not yet been concluded , this arrangement prepared for an eventuality whereby Brunei and its rich offshore prospects would remain under a British monopoly and under a British defence treaty . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Poulgrain 's interviews in 1991 with both Captain D.R. Gribble , and Captain Albert Young confirmed that the huge oilfield was known to the authorities in 1958 , years before its " official discovery " in 1963 . <p> As for the oil in Sarawak territory , the British were prepared to surrender that to the new federation under control of Malaya . Sir Anthony Abell , then Governor of Sarawak , in April 1956 observed in a communication to the Colonial Office that " the politicians in both Malaya and Singapore were showing considerable interest in the Borneo territories " including its empty spaces , its potential wealth , and its oil " . <p> Poulgrain inexplicably added that it is " noteworthy " that the Governor could admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then to treat this as a reason for merger . <p> He observed however , that the prospects of exchanging the existing colonial master for another one would certainly not be welcomed by those Sarawakians ( and Sabahans ) with a historic fear of Malay domination . In fact , by 1949 , in " Malaya , anti-Chinese sentiment had become enmeshed with anti-communism . " Public Record Office documents reveal that the largest riots -- called the Communist Front Riots of October 1956 -- were deliberately provoked , for example , in Singapore by the authorities to enable the arrest of some prominent anti-British activists . <p> In addition , Poulgrain makes a vital contribution to the formation narrative by drawing attention to the shadowy yet critical , but hitherto unknown , role played by the Deep State of the British Establishment in the shaping the final configuration of the Federation . In the face of post-war demand for decolonisation , the UK , to prime her political successors in the areas she would be vacating , was motivated by " the need to ensure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and militarily secure . " <p> To ensure that ( political control ) was met , the " second-in-command of MI5 of Britain was seconded for one year 's term of duty to reorganise and expand the Special Branch " . From that point onwards , Whitehall moved quickly to protect most , if not all , of its interests in the region . <p> Of critical concern to the colonial authorities was the surging sentiment among the local politicians in the three Borneo territories for self rule before merger , and of pre-empting the merger by forming a federation of the Borneo territories . A meeting was held in Jesselton of the representatives from the three territories , Ong Kee Hui , from Sarawak , A.M. Azahari , from Brunei and Donald Stephens , from North Borneo and a joint statement in favour of a Borneon Federation issued in August 1961 . <p> The insistence of the Brunei nationalist , A.M. Azahari , upon his return to Brunei after his participation in the independence movement for Indonesian Merdeka , that self-determination for the Borneo territories must precede federation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fiat of the colonial rulers , " raised the ire of the British authorities in London . <p> Poulgrain notes that " British Intelligence aided by misinformation fed by the British Malayan Petroleum ( BMP ) corporate intelligence network , continued to depict Azahari as anti-British , an " irresponsible opportunist , " and a subversive backed by Indonesia . On the role of BMP providing intelligence to the British authorities , Poulgrain has this to say : " Because BMP intelligence sources had the power to restrict information being relayed to Sir Anthony Abell , this would suggest that the Seria oilfields , and not Kuching , had become the real centre of political power . " <p> An example of the depth of the research Poulgrain conducted on the subject is his reference to an incident recounted by Kee Tuan Chye in his book , Old Doctors Never Fade Away ( 1988 ) . Having collapsed with acute appendicitis in January 1959 on the eve of the third PRB congress in Brunei , Azahari was not operated on upon admission to Brunei Hospital by attending Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strict orders from the British authorities higher up . " <p> So Azahari discharged himself and flew to Singapore whence he had intended to fly to India for the surgery , but once there , the Indonesian Embassy offered a mercy mission to fly him to Jakarta for the operation . <p> He then spent forty-five days recuperating in Indonesia , thus lending fuel to the British Establishment 's narrative of the depth of his complicity with the ruling party in Indonesia at the time . Poulgrain , relying on his interviews in 1990-91 of Azahari then in exile , said that this deliberate depiction of Azahari as having a political affiliation with Indonesia served to alienate the Sultan from Azahari despite his close relationship with the royal family of Brunei . <p> At the time Poulgrain did his research , the Azahari " files " had not been released from the archives , the files having been classified for a period of fifty years . Meanwhile , the colonial authorities in Sarawak witnessed an awakening of political consciousness , brought about undoubtedly by the " wind of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talks between London and Kuala Lumpur in early 1960 . <p> All this together with the preparation for elections to the new municipal and district councils led to the formation of political parties among the various ethnic communities . The first , the Sarawak United People 's Party ( SUPP ) , was registered in June 1959 , with the slogans , " Sa'ati " and " Sarawak for Sarawakians , " aspiring for the unity of all ethnic groups in Sarawak to fight for independence so that Sarawakians could enjoy the abundance of their natural resources instead of being exploited by a colonial power . <p> However , these first indicators of the infusion of a nationalist spirit within Sarawak were construed by the British colonial government to be moving in a direction that was likely to jeopardise " the grand design " of the British , who were then already experiencing difficulties trying to impose the same on their colonies in Central Africa and in the West Indies . <p> In July 1960 , Sir Alexander Waddell , the new Governor of Sarawak , issued a White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communist activity among the Chinese educated . <p> SUPP , aware of the attempt by the colonial government to alienate the general public , especially the natives and their leaders , from the party warned party members , " of people against the SUPP who were always trying to paint it red , " and advised " those with artistic inclinations and talents not to carry this pot of paint into the party premises ' . <p> In August of the same year the editor of a Chinese newspaper was deported to China despite the fact that he was born in Sarawak , and , therefore , technically a British subject at the time . Tim Hardy , then the deputy head of the Special Branch , Sarawak , recounts in his book , The Reluctant Imperialist ( 2009 ) , what followed : When news of a " communist organisation " ( CCO ) filtered up , " the affected governments wanted information . <p> Malayan and Australian Cabinet ministers together with Singapore-based brass hats and big-shot spooks came to Kuching looking for on-the-spot-news . ... The Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefties in Borneo ? London prodded Kuala Lumpur and Singapore , and at the end of the chain it was Kuching that took the jabs . " <p> Poulgrain 's book confirms that the authorities went beyond just isolating the pioneer political party of SUPP from broadening its membership base among the indigenous groups to the extent of attempting to sabotage the party . <p> The Anglo-American intelligence organisation based in Singapore , Security Intelligence Far East ( SIFE ) , stepped in as agent provocateur to " politically engineer " an entrapment set-up . William Andeas Brown ( CIA ) , assisted by Frank C. Starr ( CIA ) and John Slimming ( MI6 ) , in 1962 ran a covert arms-running operation supplying rifles to the so-called underground Sarawak Chinese youths with strong historic ties with the Chinese across the border in Indonesian Borneo . Sir Alexander Waddell later in an interview in 1991 with the author confirmed the involvement of the CIA in 1962 in instigating the " leftist " elements in the party by supplying them with rifles . <p> So apart from these connections that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing tangible to connect the Brunei Malays in the North to the Sarawak Chinese located in the First Division at the southern end of Sarawak . This was confirmed by Hardy , who did not think much of the Chinese schooled Marxist ideologues that preached anti-colonialism and proletarian revolution . According to him , " What support there was for them came not from the advocacy of Maoism which few people either understood or desired but from its uncompromising opposition to plans to federate the country within Malaysia , a prospect that left the majority of Chinese fearful of Malay domination . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> The analysis of this British colonial officer of the situation in Sarawak on the eve of Malaysia is most telling : " On its part , the Malayan government more or less openly promised to bankroll any political party that would do its bidding in Sarawak . <p> Five brand new parties registered in quick succession , each claiming to represent group interests but each in turn doing no more than provide the screens behind which opportunists hoped to lay hands on Kuala Lumpur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pro-Malaysia " Alliance " which by " winning " the 1963 elections cleared the way for KL and London to claim that absorption within a Malaysian federation was confirmed as the choice of the majority of Sarawakians . " <p> Azahari 's Partai Rakyat Brunei ( PRB ) was in fact " well penetrated " by agents-informers of the Special Branch including Zulkifli and H.M. Salleh at the executive level . This penetration would later allow Roy Henry , the head of the Special Branch , to engineer a " false flag " operation in instigating the Brunei Rebellion in late 1962 . <p> The penetration is perhaps not surprising , considering that the British secret service in Malaya had even recruited the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Malaya ( CPM ) , Lai Teck , as a double agent for the British . He was the Secretary-General of CPM from April 1939 to March 1947 when he absconded with the party funds . The Brunei State Intelligence Committee was linked to the Special Branch in Sarawak and Brunei . <p> The London head office of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Colonial Office . In the early 1950s , BMP had set up its own oil intelligence network which closely collaborated with Special Branch to look after its own interests , which no doubt included confidential information of the discovery of the giant West Ampa oilfields . <p> The secret required political discretion to ensure that British interests remained paramount and , secondly , political manipulation , to ensure that those interests were implemented . <p> Roy Henry of the Special Branch of Sarawak and Brunei in his open admission in 1991 to Poulgrain of his role in starting the Brunei Rebellion , supplied the key to the " spontaneous outbreak " of the rebellion in Seria . as well as confirmation that " Konfrontasi ... was a joint program set by British and American Intelligence . " <p> When H.M. Salleh of the PRB executive decided in the absence of PRB leader A.M. Azahari from Brunei to launch an ill-prepared and ill-timed armed rebellion before dawn on December 8 , 1962 , those Chinese youths in faraway countryside of First Division of Sarawak , who managed to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to flee across the border to seek refuge in Indonesian Borneo . <p> In the wake of " Operation Cold Store " of February 2 , 1963 , in Singapore , followed by its counterpart in Malaya on February 13 , 1963 , " the leading figures in the left-wing political parties in Sarawak , Singapore and Malaya were detained prior to the formation of Malaysia . " The way to the formation of " Malaysia " now appeared cleared in one fell swoop with the arrest of the political activists who could reorganise and lead any grassroots resistance . <p> It is now clear from the evidence Poulgrain uncovered in the British archives and further supporting evidence gathered from the oral interviews provided to him by the British government and security service officials that these coordinated moves to put the blame on " the Communists " collectively , " was a political contrivance . " The Brunei Rebellion also " cemented the relationship between British oil interests and the Brunei Sultan ; and it led on to Konfrontasi which forced the decision of Sarawak into joining the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the British . <p> These research findings of Poulgrain have been confirmed and supported by the independent research of Dr Yong Kee Howe , the Malaysian anthropologist and ethnographer , in his book , The Hakkas of Sarawak : Sacrificial Gifts in Cold War Era Malaysia ( 2003 ) . Yong documents the harrowing experiences of those who opposed the colonial authorities in their push for merger in interviews with the survivors of the era in his field work in Sarawak in the nineties . <p> Yong has given voice to the surviving victims of state/governmental violence that had hitherto remained mute , unexpressed and silent in the written records deposited in the official archives . <p> Setting aside political correctness , Yong 's blunt characterisation of " the annexation of Sarawak into the greater Malaysia Plan in the context of the Cold War military gift economy " receives confirmation from two surprising yet conventional sources . First , the historian Dr Tan Tai Yong makes the following assessment in his book , Creating " Greater Malaysia " ( 2008 ) : <p> The Tunku was therefore clearly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after was the Borneo Territories , and Singapore was the price he had to pay to secure it . ... There was clearly no cultural or social basis for the state ; Malaysia was strictly a product of political expediencies . <p> The second source is none other than Tunku Abdul Rahman himself , the former Prime Minister of Malaya and then of Malaysia , who in the early 1980s engaged in a series of conversations with Abdullah Ahmad , which was later published in 2016 in a book entitled , Conversations with Tunku Abdul Rahman . The Tunku candidly admitted thus : <p> " Yes and they the British gave us Sarawak , Sabah and Singapore and so many other things in 1963 with the formation of Malaysia . The British could have given Singapore , Sabah and Sarawak independence , but they did not . Instead , they handed them to us " . <p> Given that its primary focus is on the Indonesian policy of Konfrontasi in response to the proposal to bring the Borneo territories into a federation with Malaya and Singapore , The Genesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics resulting from the proposal , in particular the moves deliberately engineered by the major powers behind the scene . This review in contrast focuses only on that portion of the book that touches on Sarawak , in particular , the devious manipulations and stratagems driven by a hidden agenda to " push " her involuntarily into a federation . <p> In this respect , the book deserves to be read by all Sarawakians , and , yes , studied , for it is an instructive trove of information that hitherto has remained personal or been deliberately kept hidden/censored from the general public .

@@42327230 <h> From snollygoster ' frogs ' ... to three PMs in a year ? <p> Perhaps , now more than ever , we need ' anti-hopping ' legislation to be passed urgently , Henry Loh writes . <p> On 26 September , Sabahans went to the polls . The snap state election was triggered after Umno 's Musa Aman claimed he had gained enough support from state assembly members to topple the existing government . <p> Musa had sought an audience with the Sabah governor to prove he had the numbers to take over the state administration . To preempt this , then-Chief Minister Shafie Apdal met with the governor to advise him to dissolve the state assembly so the people would have the chance to decide . <p> The Sabah State Legislative Assembly was then dissolved on 30 July , and the Election Commission set 12 September for nominations and 26 September for polling . <p> When the dust settled after days of post-election intrigue over who would be the chief minister , Bersatu 's Hajiji Noor was sworn in on 29 September . Sabah Umno head Bung Moktar had been eyeing the position , but after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the First Deputy Chief Minister and Public Works Minister . More on this further below . <p> Support the struggle to build a Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> To trace the events leading to the snap state election , we need to go back to the infamous " Sheraton Move " in late February , the resignation of then-Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad and the collapse of the legitimately elected Pakatan Harapan government . That series of events paved the way for the formation of the Perikatan Nasional government with Muhyiddin Yassin as PM . <p> In the months that followed , the PH-led state governments of Johor , Perak , Kedah , Malacca collapsed due to defections and fell under PN control . Only the Selangor and Penang state governments remain under PH control . Hence Musa Aman in Sabah was merely trying to follow the trend that had been set in motion . <p> What stands out are the defectors , who were willing to jump ship and topple legitimately elected governments . Several commentators have remarked that calling these defectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphibians . A rarely used term -- snollygosters -- to describe such unprincipled politicians has gained traction of late . <p> What motivated these snollygosters to switch sides and topple these governments ? Observers pin it down to their pursuit of power and expectation of personal gain , as many of them were rewarded with ministerial appointments or high-paying jobs in government-linked companies . <p> The Sheraton Move has rankled many Malaysians , especially those who rallied and voted for change . They feel cheated and robbed . It would have been different if the current government had won the right to govern through an election rather than getting in through the back door . <p> If responsible politicians are serious about reform , they must look into the viability of passing " anti-hopping " legislation to curb such defections . As Aliran 's Mustafa K Anuar put it aptly , we need such a law " to combat political uncertainty and the desecration of the people 's right to choose their government " . <p> The oft-heard argument that an anti-hopping law would violate freedom of association , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly studied . After all , Article 10(1) ( c ) " guarantees Malaysian citizens the right to the freedom of association " . <p> However , this freedom is not absolute . Article 10(2) ( c ) states : " Parliament may by law impose on the rights conferred by Article 10(1) ( c ) , such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation .... public order or morality .... " <p> To me , as a lay person , an anti-hopping law would fall into the category of defending public morality . Legal experts can debate the finer points , but MPs must have the political will and the resolve to push through legislation to curb defections . <p> The Election Commission must propose changes to promote free and fair elections . This would include studying the feasibility of replacing or adapting the first-past-the-post electoral winner-takes-all system with a mixed-member proportional representation system . <p> Back to the Sabah state election . Warisan-plus , led by Shafie Apdal , had tirelessly promoted the narrative of unity for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now famous quote -- " We are here to build a nation not a particular race or religion " -- was trumpeted throughout Sabah and resonated with all who believe in a Sabah for all Sabahans and a Malaysia for all Malaysians . <p> That clarion call for unity inspired Aliran 's P Ramakrishnan to issue a challenge to Muhyiddin , Zahid Hamidi , Hadi Awang and Najib Razak to declare their stand on this matter . Rama said that , out of political expediency , the leaders he challenged would never be brave enough to subscribe to this ideal of a nation for all Malaysians , irrespective of their ethnicity , religion or creed . Instead , we hear calls for " ketuanan Melayu " ( Malay supremacy ) or that non-Malays are " pendatang " ( immigrants ) . <p> In the Sabah election , Warisan-plus collected 43.4% of the popular vote and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah ( GRS ) received 43.2% , ie they were neck and neck . Other parties received 8.4% and independent candidates 5.0% . <p> We should n't simply conclude that those who voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Warisan had promoted . Rather , as commentator Joe Samad put it , " ( the issue of unity ) .. is like preaching to the converted in Sabah where there is little concern over the matter .... " <p> So what motivated 43.2% of voters to support GRS parties ? Much as these voters may value unity and nation-building , Warisan , in hindsight , should have prioritised bread-and-butter ( or nasi-and-sayur ) issues in its campaign . <p> Joe Samad again : " People need to be fed , people need jobs , people want economic and infrastructural development . Warisan should have promised to solve these issues instead of just talking about unity , which does not put food on anyone 's table . " <p> The coronavirus pandemic has hit many households , and all responsible politicians should focus on reaching out to their constituents who are in financial difficulty and going through hard times . <p> The big question is , can we trust and rely on the newly elected Sabah government to ease the people 's burden by carrying out programmes and activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unemployment , lack of accessible healthcare , shortcomings in education , the influx of undocumented migrants and glaring income inequalities ? <p> To be fair , it has been only a week since the Sabah chief minister was sworn in , so it is too early to tell . But the tussle between Umno 's Bung Moktar and Bersatu 's Hajiji Noor for the coveted chief minister 's post has not inspired confidence . After finally reaching a compromise , Hajiji was sworn in as Chief Minister and Bung as First Deputy Chief Minister . <p> But then , a big fight broke out between Bung and Bersatu 's Masidi Manjun over who would hold the public works portfolio , which oversees big-ticket infrastructure projects . Early reports had indicated that Masidi had already landed the portfolio , but after protests from Umno and with Muhyiddin 's intervention , the post was given to Bung . Masidi had to settle for Second Finance Minister and Housing and Local Government Minister . <p> All this serious tussling for positions makes us wonder whether it is a reflection of the elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or could there be more sinister and personal motives ? Frankly , the antics of past political leaders make me doubt that the fight to helm the public works ministry was for altruistic reasons . <p> The new state government must realise it is now being watched by the people . Making election promises is easy , but delivering and fulfilling them is another matter . <p> Elected representatives should work on Sabah 's rights contained in the Malaysia Agreement 1963 , especially over petroleum revenue and oil royalties . Better internet connectivity , proper roads , reliable electricity and water supply are a few of the many issues that must be tackled . Can the elected representatives deliver -- or will the people of Sabah have to wait for yet another state election ? <p> At the federal level , Anwar Ibrahim has claimed he has enough support from MPs to form a new government . Since 23 September , he has been seeking an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agung in a bid to become the next PM . <p> If that happens , 2020 will surely go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers ! That might elicit a laugh -- but it is no laughing matter as it reflects just how fractious and divided our politicians have become . It also reflects how unstable the present government is . <p> Worse , if all those switching allegiances were enticed with the promise of rewards or some other personal gain , it would mean we have quite a few elected representatives who are snollygosters . That would not speak well of their integrity and loyalty . <p> Perhaps , now more than ever , we need ' anti-hopping ' legislation to be passed urgently . <p> Thanks for dropping by !

The answer is : the greed of the European Powers who traded in the Eastern seas . <p> Even time immemorial outside commerce with the Archipelago had been in the hands of the Chinese , whose junks would come down in the north-east monsoon and return in the south-west laden with precious cargoes of spices , rattans , edible birds ' nests , camphor , sharks ' fins and pearls . <p> Then came the Portuguese and after them the Dutch who , bent on securing the trade for themselves alone , created a system of monopolies and by treaties with the Malay rulers were able to command the produce at their own rates and so undersell the Chinese . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Archipelago , they diverted to Malacca or Batavia the trade which for centuries had gone direct to China , so that in time the junks could complete no longer and came no more . <p> Chinese traders <p> " One result of this change was that the Chinese immigrants -- the forebears of these settlers to whom modem Malays owe so much of its prosperity today -- returned to their native shores and no others came to take their places . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> These Chinese had been a source of revenue to the rulers in whose territories they settled ; nor were those revenues increased by the coming of the traders from the west who took all and gave in return as little as they could . <p> A chapter which lingers in the memory is that which tells the story of the founding and raiding of the ill-starred settlement of Balambangan .

They aim to measure the energy flow in these structures and make the necessary adjustments to maximise efficiency . <p> The solar energy company managed to do so in 2017 by setting up Source , its energy performance management system that takes advantage of advancements in the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and machine learning technology . <p> Source allows building or machinery owners to visualise and control their energy use in real time on a computer or app . It collects data from sensors installed in buildings or machinery , analyses it and comes up with solutions to help customers save more energy or increase efficiency . <p> Ko Chuan Zhen , co-founder and CEO of Plus Solar , believes this will be the next step in the global energy revolution . " The first phase of the global energy revolution was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and other renewable sources , " he says . <p> " The next step is digital transformation . This means we can capture energy data from buildings , analyse it and provide a diagnosis of energy consumption for the building owner . <p> " People do n't talk much about digitalisation in energy . So , we want to raise awareness that a digitalised energy system can generate important insights and increase productivity for businesses . " <p> Smart energy management platforms are different from current building management systems , say the founders of Plus Solar . Generally , the latter captures data but does not provide analyses or suggestions to increase efficiency . Meanwhile , solutions such as Source aim to not only collect data but also provide solutions in areas like energy savings and maintenance of equipment . <p> The digitalisation of energy systems in individual buildings can be seen as a step towards creating smart cities and a smart energy grid , as well as promoting the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( IR 4.0 ) . <p> " At first , we just wanted to help our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realised that this solution could move the industry forward because our solution goes beyond just energy savings . We want to help our customers improve their production yield and efficiency , " says Ryan Oh , co-founder and chief technology officer of Plus Solar . <p> ( Photo by Suhaimi Yusuf/The Edge ) <h> Future possibilities <p> Source offers three kinds of services -- Navi provides customers with a high-level overview of a building 's energy data , Kai manages the energy demand and consumption of industrial buildings , and Gabi allocates and readjusts the energy consumption of commercial buildings . Those who do not have solar power systems can also use Source . <p> " We sell Source as a service , so we charge a monthly fee . It covers the IoT hardware and software services . Depending on how many units the client requires , the price starts from RM499 per month . One unit refers to the use of one smart meter or sensor . We can also work around a set budget to monitor different equipment or buildings , " says Oh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many features of both kinds can be added to the platform going forward . One feature that the company is interested in adding to Source is battery solutions . This will enable building owners to load the excess electricity generated by solar power systems during peak hours into the battery storage , so it can be used at other times . <p> Plus Solar is also hoping to introduce blockchain and peer-to-peer ( P2P ) trading of energy into Source . P2P trading of energy is a solution to decentralise energy generation , whereby electricity is no longer transmitted from a central point to substations . <p> As more people generate their own electricity from solar power systems , it could be possible for them to sell their excess electricity to their neighbours . In 2019 , the Sustainable Energy Development Authority announced plans to launch a pilot P2P energy trading project for eight months . <p> If P2P trading of energy is implemented , blockchain technology can be used to keep track of all the transactions . " Blockchain is a smart ledger system that keeps track of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , when I transfer a unit of energy to you , it is recorded in a smart contract . This can be used to track how much energy one has transferred to another as well as the payments required . When things get crowded , this kind of technology can be put to good use without relying on a central server . " <h> Case studies <p> So far , Plus Solar Systems Sdn Bhd has installed Source in more than 100 commercial and industrial buildings in Malaysia . The solution for each client depends on their individual needs . For instance , the company worked with a Shell MarkMaju Corp station in Sabah to help it save 25% of its electricity costs from running air conditioners all day . <p> For commercial buildings , HVAC ( heat , ventilation and air conditioning ) systems are a major source of total energy use , according to Plus Solar . Some companies try to save costs by setting a timer to adjust temperatures throughout the day . <p> " But they may sacrifice human comfort when they do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plus Solar . " We can circumvent that by using camera sensors or computer vision to create a heat map and track to see if there are people in particular spaces . If there are n't any people there , the central controller will direct the chilled air to other areas with more people or turn the air conditioning off so that the building owner can save energy while maintaining consumers ' comfort levels . " <p> Another Plus Solar client that uses Source is Tan Kian Huat Fishery Sdn Bhd in Penang , which has a cold storage facility . The company started by installing a solar power system . After it managed to see energy savings from the system , the owner wanted to know what else Plus Solar could do to help reduce its electricity bills . <p> " The owner is a very curious person who values the benefits of using technology . He just wants to save energy costs no matter what , " says Oh , adding that this is particularly important to the company as it has to pay Maximum Demand charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <p> To save energy costs , the company previously needed to turn on cooling machines when solar energy generation was at its peak in the middle of the day . This way , it could generate its own electricity and save on utility bills . <p> Taking that into consideration , Plus Solar fitted sensors in its cold storage room to detect temperatures at various locations . This was complemented with sensors that detected solar energy generation throughout the day . <p> Then , it created a system whereby the cooling machines will be turned on whenever solar energy generation is active . When solar energy generation is down at other times of the day or when the sky is overcast , some of the machines are switched off . But the temperature in the cold storage room is still maintained as it was already cooled when the solar energy generation was active . <p> The client managed to save 20% of its Maximum Demand-related costs , which translated into RM8,000 to RM9,000 shaved off its utility bills per month , he adds . <p> Other places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , which have high electricity bills because they need to generate heat to dry materials . <p> " We use IoT sensors to help customers cut down on the energy it takes to dry materials .

@@42430240 <p> ON Tuesday , Bank Negara Malaysia will have a final opportunity to reduce the overnight policy rate ( OPR ) when it concludes its final Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) meeting for the year . Most economists are of the view , however , that the central bank is likely to stay put . <p> The last cut to the key rate was in July , when it was trimmed by 25 basis points ( bps ) to a record low of 1.75% . <p> Is another rate cut warranted now that Malaysia and its major trading partners are grappling with a new wave of Covid-19 infections that has brought about the partial lockdowns of economies ? <p> Or is our economic data strong enough to weather any shortcomings shown up by the virus ? <p> For one , Malaysia 's exports performance in September was promising , according to MIDF Research , as it returned to positive territory , registering a solid double-digit growth of 13.6% year on year in September -- the highest expansion since October 2018 . <h> Why the OPR will likely remain unchanged <p> Most economists believe the odds of a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current situation does not call for one right now . <p> Lee Heng Guie , executive director at The Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce And Industry of Malaysia 's Socio-Economic Research Centre , is one such economist . <p> " We reckon that the third wave of Covid-19 infections in the country is likely to temper the economic recovery that we have seen so far , and we believe the central bank will also assess the number and duration of the infections , and how widespread the impact of the Conditional Movement Control Order ( CMCO ) is to the economy . <p> " So far , we know that the CMCO is only being implemented in areas with a very high number of infections , so it is not like a total lockdown per se , which we saw earlier this year . Therefore , I would think Bank Negara will probably put on hold any OPR decision at its November meeting , as Budget 2021 is to be tabled on Friday . <p> " There is only so much you can do with the interest rate policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , which is more effective during a downturn . The problem with a rate cut now is you may not see the intended effect of spurring new consumption or demand , because at the end of the day , it is about the level of confidence among businesses and consumers , " he tells The Edge . <p> UOB Malaysia senior economist Julia Goh is more ambivalent as she believes the coming MPC decision will be a close call . However , she says to some extent , Bank Negara has taken into account the risk of a spike in Covid-19 infections in its GDP projections for the year . <p> " The lower bound of Bank Negara 's GDP projections of -3.5% to -5.5% for this year does assume such downside risks , including a setback in global growth , prolonged second/third wave of infections and a targeted MCO in high-risk areas , " she observes , adding that the central bank had previously pointed out that there are other policy levers that could be used to support economic recovery . <p> " This includes over RM18 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise ) financing . We understand that Bank Negara has the capacity to increase this allocation for guaranteed funds and upsizing of funds when the need arises . <p> " Meanwhile , banks have intensified engagements with customers who require further assistance and offered ongoing support for households and SMEs that are facing difficulties , " she adds . <p> Vishnu Varathan , executive director and head of economics and strategy at Singapore-based Mizuho Bank , opines that Bank Negara does have a strong case to ease the rate further in the face of the Covid-19 resurgence , but believes the central bank is unlikely to resort to a rate cut as " the first port of call " . <p> " Moreover , external headwinds re-emerging from an outbreak of a second or third wave , which require the re-imposition of social restrictions , only heighten the urgency for more easing . <p> " However , in terms of ordering priorities and mitigating wider risks , Bank Negara will first and foremost resort to backstopping cash flow or liquidity risks , loan relief and access to credit . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lower the policy rate . <p> " Instead Bank Negara , justifiably , will focus on taking care of the access to -- rather than merely on the price of -- money as a matter of utmost urgency . This is especially as fiscal policy , with the budget in view now , is more suited for tailored measures that the economy will need to sustain a better-footed recovery . " <p> He says the good news is inflation remains exceptionally low , allowing for greater room for rate cuts , which may be implemented in concert with more targeted and tailored credit and liquidity measures . <p> " Perhaps one reason not to resort to a suite of easing -- constituting both rate cuts and broad-sweeping credit/liquidity measures -- is to hold the rate steady through the uncertainty of the US elections -- just in case a spasm of capital outflows is triggered at a time when political risks also cast a shadow , " he remarks . <h> The grounds for a rate cut <p> Standard Chartered Global Research is one of the few research firms expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The latest extension of the CMCO to Nov 9 may threaten the lower bound of the government 's 2020 GDP growth forecast of -3.5% to -5.5% . This may provide an anchor for Bank Negara 's decision in November , " the firm says . <p> The firm adds that while external demand is expected to support economic activity , Malaysia has grown more domestically oriented in recent years . <p> " The trade-to-GDP ratio fell to 120% in 2019 from 131% in 2015 , while household consumption accounted for about 80% of GDP growth from 2015-2019 . Further rate cuts may not boost investment activity at this time . But lower interest rates may help to lower financing costs and provide a bit more of a cash buffer for households . For example , mortgages are worth about 41% of GDP and a 25bps cut may save indebted households about 0.1% of GDP in financing costs per annum , " says Standard Chartered . <p> CGS-CIMB Research is also pencilling in a 25bps cut in the OPR to 1.5% , in order to support the economic recovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer and business sentiment , with downside risks in the near term to the recovery in imports of consumption goods and capital goods . <p> " We maintain forecasts for 2020 gross exports at -2.0% and gross imports at -3.5% , which collectively underpin a current account surplus of 2.8% of GDP , providing a degree of stability to the ringgit from dislocations in financial flows , " the firm says . <p> Exports , so far the key source of recovery , will be under fire from renewed lockdowns in Malaysia 's main trading partners , according to ING Asia economist Prakash Sakpal . <p> " Moreover , the export recovery also is lopsided , coming mainly from the electronics sector while commodity exports like crude petroleum continue to reel under weak global demand and prices . <p> " As such , more central bank rate cuts wo n't hurt , while there is scope for the same provided by an ongoing negative inflation trend that 's likely to be stretched further ahead and leave real interest rates one of the highest in Asia . The ringgit also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide some comfort to Bank Negara in cutting rates . <p> " Indeed , broad-based policy support via both monetary and fiscal sides will go a long way in shoring up demand . However , not much could be expected on the fiscal side given the massive stimulus already unleashed earlier this year and prevailing constraint of public debt . Hence , the monetary policy will have to do all the heavy-lifting . I think Bank Negara should ease to the extent possible in the unprecedented crisis , and whether it does this week still needs to be seen , " he adds . <p> Bank Negara 's decision on Tuesday comes a few hours ahead of the US election results and three days before Budget 2021 is tabled in parliament . As at last Friday , there were 10,392 active Covid-19 cases reported in the country . It remains to be seen whether this is reason enough to trigger a pre-emptive rate cut .

Yet as the current outlook for an export- and foreign investment-driven recovery remains grim , we can not look to the world for help .

With Malaysia being an original signatory of the CPTPP , it might come as a surprise that we have yet to formally ratify the agreement , despite having extracted strategic concessions in the form of Bumiputera development , including special preferences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation ( GLC ) presence , such as the dominance of Petronas in the petroleum market . Seven existing members have already formalised the partnership , including Japan , Singapore and Australia . As such , the prospect of expanding trade with these nations without compromising on key components of our national agenda makes the agreement a logical progression towards economic growth -- boosting export-led growth with limited domestic consequences . <p> Furthermore , many countries , including the UK and Taiwan , have expressed interest in joining , presenting an opportunity to benefit from low- to zero-tariff commitments with some of our largest trading partners , while cementing our existing carve-outs . IDEAS ' recent work on the CPTPP is in line with this view , estimating a 1% increase in GDP including a 1.45% rise in exports from ratifying the agreement , and perhaps more importantly , creating an additional 140,000 jobs for Malaysians . <p> Malaysian manufacturers are currently slapped with high import tariffs in the automotive , biotechnology and electronics manufacturing sub-sectors , raising costs from 20% to 40% and effectively reducing our competitiveness vis- ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Given that Taiwan is consistently among our top 10 trading partners , having it also join the partnership would be strategic for Malaysian trade . Taiwan provides more high technology intermediate goods to Malaysia than any other CPTPP member , particularly in the above manufacturing sub-sectors . Delaying the ratification of the partnership may therefore hinder Malaysia 's progress in transitioning towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution , overall reducing our short-term recovery outlook and long-term development . <p> The ratification of the CPTPP has the potential to improve our relative competitiveness , and at no time is this more pressing considering the current wave of supply chain relocations out of China , following the US-China Trade War and Covid-19 supply chain disruptions .

In fact , their needs are really quite simple . <p> a Provide a conducive business environment in which Sabah entrepreneurs can operate without hindrance and/or obstructions from politicians and the government administrative system . Most Sabah entrepreneurs do n't dare to complain but political leaders should reach out and listen to their woes .

@@42561239 <h> Speaker must schedule confidence vote at this Parliament sitting <p> Aliran notes with grave concern how Dewan Rakyat Speaker Azhar Azizan Harun has refused to bring up any of the 27 motions to test whether the prime minister enjoys the confidence of the House . <p> MPs have been trying to put a no-confidence motion to the floor since the Perikatan Nasional government seized power in a coup in March . <p> In the absence of a popular mandate from the people , it is all the more crucial to test whether the prime minister enjoys the confidence of the majority of the MPs in the House . <p> So far , 25 no-confidence motions and two confidence motions have been filed . But these languish at the bottom of the order paper with little chance of seeing the light of day . <p> The reasons for not bringing forward these motions as a matter of priority have been frivolous . The Speaker insists he has no power to move businesses out of the regular order and says only a minister can initiate the process of moving any non-government business up the queue . <p> Support the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity : <p> But Minister in the Prime Minister 's Department ( Parliament and Law ) Takiyuddin Hassan says there is no urgency as he claims " there are no clear indications that the MP for Pagoh ( Muhyiddin Yassin ) has lost the confidence of the House " . <p> Thus far in all the bloc votes on Budget 2021 since 26 November , even though the PN government has prevailed in the voting by precarious margins , the highest number of votes the government has mustered is 110 -- two short of a simple majority of 112 MPs in the 222-seat Parliament . <p> This means that , while the 27 motions lie at the bottom of the order paper , the public remains uncertain whether Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin enjoys the confidence of the majority of MPs in Parliament . This is an affront to democratic principles . <p> While it is true that private members ' matters come after government matters in the order paper , Azhar himself pointed out in 2015 ( before he became Speaker ) that a motion of no-confidence is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had asserted , takes priority by convention or constitutional practice : " A motion of no-confidence must be brought first on the list . " <p> It would seem that Azhar 's stand has changed since he was brought in as the Speaker by the PN government . <p> Aliran calls for the PN government and the Speaker to adhere to the Westminster parliamentary convention , which Malaysia follows , and allow for the motions of confidence and no-confidence in the PM to be debated and voted upon . <p> Until that happens , Muhyiddin Yassin as Prime Minister -- and by extension , his government -- will lack the moral legitimacy in the eyes of many . Any bill that is passed in this sitting may also become questionable as long as the political legitimacy of this government remains in doubt . <p> Once a vote is taken , let the cards fall where it may . Enough with horse trading regarding numbers to hold on to or to sway the base of power . <p> And once this issue is settled , the MPs , politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nation is grappling with a pandemic and an economic slump -- which need their immediate and undivided attention . <p> Thanks for dropping by !

So , the question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown to be talking big , he does not have the numbers in Parliament .

With only RM200 , she combined what she knew from working at a premium jewellery store and her interest in e-commerce to start her enterprise . <p> Now 28 , she is known as the founder and owner of Celovis , the first female titanium jewellery brand in Malaysia . From humble beginnings , building on almost a decade of experience , Chong has big plans for her brand . <p> How did you start Celovis ? <p> When I started the brand , I picked the name Celovis because it did n't have a meaning . I had to build the whole brand by myself . <p> I started my business when I was 22 in 2014 . I am very interested in e-commerce because I used to buy clothes online . <p> I was fascinated by it all , we could buy clothes online and have them shipped to our house , it is so convenient . <p> So , I was into e-commerce when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even wanted to study e-commerce but I could not find classes for it , so I studied psychology instead . <p> During my third year , I met a friend who worked in e-commerce and I learnt a lot from him . <p> He encouraged me to get into business . <p> When I started , I did n't have any focus , and I only had RM200 . <p> How difficult was it to start your business ? <p> I had to figure out everything on my own . When I started , nothing was as convenient as it is now . We had to separately buy almost every component of our website . <p> Nowadays , e-commerce is just " plug-and-play " . There are many platforms that you can choose from . Just start with good visuals and you are on your way . <p> Before , we had to learn simple coding and even photo editing on our own . <p> But , it is so much easier now . The logo that I made and still use was done on Microsoft Paint . Seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what category does Celovis titanium jewellery fit in ? <p> It 's premium fashion jewellery , but if you are talking about fine jewellery or costume jewellery , this counts as costume jewellery . <p> In terms of metal , we could only afford to buy gold jewellery once a year , maybe a little bit more . One of the reasons is because it is expensive , but there are other reasons as well . <p> Some people worry that titanium could cause an allergic reaction like itchiness . Some worry about its durability and that it could tarnish . However , the titanium that we use is the same quality as the type used for making scalpels for surgery . <p> It is very skin-friendly and is affordable . If the piece of jewellery is tinted rose gold , for example , dipping it in chlorinated water will not tarnish it , but the colour might fade , turning it closer to its original silver metal . <p> Do you design your own jewellery ? <p> I 'm not a designer , but we do have in-house designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process as well . We work on the fashion trend , analyse the upcoming popular design and then put our twist on it . <p> We currently have more than 500 designs and we introduce a new design every month . <p> The idea is similar to fast fashion . I put in a lot of research when picking or getting into a design , which is why you do n't see any brooches or men 's accessories in our collection . <p> Currently , we are researching designs for brooches and are planning to introduce the product soon . As for men 's accessories , I am not familiar with them so that will require more study . <p> How has the pandemic affected your business ? <p> I thought that during the Covid-19 pandemic , a lot of people would lose their jobs . <p> Most people would want to save money and spend on essentials and necessities . I was also worried that it would affect my business . <p> However , I noticed that every time a lockdown is announced , the business would spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures . <p> So , I figured , women still want to look good despite the lockdown , such as during video calls and meetings .

@@62484230 <p> Have you seen this game ? The cars ( and motorbikes ) of the supposed dark future look incredibly advanced but also fashionably retro . <p> They have fold-out doors , are capable of fully autonomous driving , some are bulletproof , have LCDs instead of windshields/windows for privacy , six wheels or more , are turbocharged and even have sonorous V10 and V12 soundtracks ! <p> This might be a gritty dystopia , but if these are the cars we can enjoy , where do I sign up ? <p> Sure , we have a lot of smart people speculating on where the industry is ultimately heading , but the future of the car as we know remains ambiguous . So far , the two main contenders looking to take over the reins from internal combustion are batteries and hydrogen , both of which still use electric motors to make the wheels turn . <p> This is what makes the portrait that Cyberpunk 2077 paints so interesting . Yes , it 's a video game . Not only does it paint a beautifully detailed and fleshed-out open world , but its longstanding lore was created over 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futurescape that has undergone multiple global conflicts and rampant technological growth . <p> In this fictional year 2077 , the line between man and machine continues to be blurred , corporations have more power than multiple world superpower governments combined , and much of the earth is a barren wasteland of depleted natural resources . Trees are a luxury and even having a simple pet iguana is so rare and exotic that it 's outlawed . <p> Yet , given how grounded the world-building is , what 's fascinating is that there still are cars as we know them . People do still need to get around , after all , but while there are fundamental advancements such as VTOL airborne vehicles ( called AVs ) as well as electric cars sold to the public , the majority of automobiles still utilise internal combustion . <p> In-game , those flying vehicles are much too expensive for the average non-billionaire NPC to afford and electric cars have generally proven to be saddled with too many practical drawbacks to be viable at a large scale . Hmm . Sounds about right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any open world game they will still explode if you shoot at them . Only , they do not deposit petrol or diesel but instead a synthetically created substitute called CHOOH2 ( pronounced " chew two " ) , the result of harvesting and processing a genetically engineered wheat to create an alcohol-like chemical that 's very combustible . It 's bio-fuel , which is already a reality today . <p> If you 've played the game or have seen footage of it being played , you might recognise that these cars in the open world all have very familiar engine notes despite their very futuristic look . The game 's sound design ( and soundtrack ) is also very well executed , by the way , making them a real joy to listen to . <p> We have heard a lot from automakers who have publicly gotten behind the biofuel initiative , essentially creating a carbon-friendly and renewable alternative to petrol and diesel that will be able to utilise the existing vehicles and oil-centric infrastructure we 've oriented our world around . <p> Nissan have been trumpeting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from corn and sugar cane to power an electric motor with any resulting carbon emissions being offset by the growth of the initial crop . <p> More recently , Porsche has announced a partnership to help create a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel that 's a 1-to-1 replacement for petrol and kerosene ( jet fuel ) through a climate-friendly wind power production process for use in their sports and race cars . In the game , there is even a 1977 Porsche 911 Turbo ( 930 ) - a 100 year old car in the Cyberpunk timeline - that 's capable of running on CHOOH2 , which belonged to rockerboy Johnny Silverhand , the game 's secondary protagonist played by Keanu Reeves . <p> Wind the clock back 50 years and pretty much everyone imagined 2020 to be very different .

In the end , practicality does tend to win over blind optimism , and there 's something very compelling about bio-fuel ( or eFuel as Porsche calls it ) insofar as how they conform to the world 's immediate needs as we grapple with the depleting reserves of crude oil . <p> I 'm not saying that it 's a ' better ' solution to fully electric or hydrogen fuel-cell cars , but they surely represent the path of least resistance while maintaining carbon-neutrality . <p> There 's just something about cars . It 's a conveyance , it 's a liability , it 's a tool ; but it can also be a source of joy , pride , inspiration and passion . It 's much like clothes versus fashion .
