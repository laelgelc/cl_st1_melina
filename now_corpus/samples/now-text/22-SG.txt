@@43797237 <h> ' The IPO is just one part of the journey ' -- Bukalapak 's Teddy Oetomo <p> Bukalapak has transformed into a lean , sustainable business with a record IPO , but according to its president Teddy Oetomo , the journey of the Indonesian ecommerce firm has only just begun <p> In 2019 , WeWork 's failed IPO sent shockwaves through the world of startups , leaving many companies scrambling to re-examine the ' growth at all costs ' playbook . For those yet to learn that lesson , the COVID-19 pandemic was a harsh teacher through 2020 . There were pivots , staff cuts and frenetic attempts at building a viable business model , all while trying to stay afloat . <p> Through these turbulent times , Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak was among the few who had a distinct advantage . Having voluntarily put itself through some of this turmoil , Bukalapak was poised to reap the rewards of an influx of first-time online shoppers through multiple waves of the pandemic . Unlike its metro and tier 1 reliant competitors , Bukalapak saw 70% of its business coming from the hinterlands , which accounts for a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less exuberant approach powered the firm to a record $1.5 billion IPO in 2021 . But Bukalapak had started laying the foundation to this approach as far back as 2018 -- a decision taken by the company that overlapped with Teddy Oetomo coming on board as chief strategy officer . <p> Currently president at Bukalapak , the shift marked Oetomo 's first foray into retail , having previously worked at Schroders and Credit Suisse . And yet he considered the move " a no-brainer . " He said , " The founders started Bukalapak with a vision to empower MSMEs and create a fairer economy . If Indonesia wants to avoid the middle-income trap , the first thing that needs to be solved is this sector . " <p> His near decade and a half in asset management left him well-equipped to deal with the shifts and high-pressure situations at Bukalapak . At Credit Suisse , he learnt the value of perseverance . He said , " You were practically doing the work of two people . You had to find a way to get things done . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered through . " At Schroders , Oetomo managed a senior team , many of whom had over 15 years of experience and were domain experts . Leading a more experienced team and communicating complex concepts in layman 's terms were skills he picked up on the job . <p> Navigating a tough transition <p> These skills served Oetomo well when joined Bukalapak -- a company in the throes of transition in 2018 . To raise more capital from investors , the e-commerce firm needed to demonstrate a sustainable business model . Which meant shifting away from magnitude of growth -- necessary when Bukalapak was younger , trying to prove itself and gain market acceptance . Oetomo said , " We moved to quality of growth . To build something that will charge onwards , rather than just looking at growth for its own sake . " <p> Like all transformational changes , it brought a fair share of pain . Proposed long before the misadventures of WeWork and Uber became public , even the board was not entirely convinced . However , the senior management at Bukalapak had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The more sustainable approach came to life in different ways . A notable shift was in Bukalapak 's view of merchants and consumers . Oetomo said , " When a young tech company lands a customer , the underlying assumption is that acquisition is 100% targeted . It may not be true , especially when you are acquiring in the order of millions . You will be lucky to have a high hit rate . " Continuing to support this irrelevant audience meant a higher operational cost . <p> Another example was around how Bukalapak launched features or ran campaigns . Oetomo said , " We used to do this based on what was available and if we could collaborate to roll it out quickly . But there was no thought of ' Is this the right thing to do ? ' " <p> Bukalapak started to track such initiatives on expected behaviour change and desired results . And to study just why a program or feature had worked out better or worse than anticipated . Oetomo said , " If something tracks better , you must ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an unnecessarily conservative assumption , initially . If it 's bad , you need to ask why and if it 's something that can be fixed . " <p> It put an end to the ' sample of one ' approach -- decisions taken on gut-feel and how strongly an individual felt about a particular change . The new outlook significantly reduced feature creep -- the compulsive desire to make ' nice to have ' additions that ultimately bog down the core offering . Oetomo said , " In 2019 , we had a hardware division in a tech company ! We cleaned up a lot , if not all of it . " Today , all proposals go through a product committee review process and are judged on their relative merits . The committee keeps in mind the finite resources on hand , and prioritises the best ideas . <p> This fiscally prudent approach even affected parts of the business that were doing well like Mitra Bukalapak , an online-to-offline ( O2O ) platform aimed at warungs and other small business owners . Oetomo said , " Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clap , cheer and leave it alone . But our senior management actually asked questions on whether this was sustainable and how it would affect the health of the company . " <p> With these steps in place , Bukalapak was well poised to take on the pandemic . Oetomo said , " By the end of our revamp , we were leaner , more focused and efficient . The financials were robust and we did n't need to let go of anyone during the pandemic . The only adjustment we had to make was work from home . " <p> A cautious approach to acquisitions <p> This abundance of caution is evident even in Oetomo 's philosophy when it comes to acquisitions . Speaking about his approach , Oetomo said , " We pursue an acquisition if there 's a firm readily available , reasonable priced , and most importantly , a management team , we can work with , because we take a majority stake , if not 100% . " Another key consideration is whether Bukalapak can build the product , feature or audience , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it worthwhile . <p> This approach was evident in Bukalapak 's acquisition of Five Jack , which owns Itemku , a marketplace for the online gaming community . Oetomo believed his firm would n't have been able to get the merchants that already existed on the platform , even after years of trying . He said , " They address a very specific community -- gamers -- that the founder was from . None of us had that background . " <p> Asked about the red flags he looks for during an acquisition , Oetomo said , " We have not gone forward with proposals where there was no cultural fit . The numbers tell their own story . When you start doing financial and legal due diligence , no acquisition is free of red flags . We just have to decide if it is solvable , or a risk that we can absorb . " <p> Creating the Bukalapak way <p> Oetomo has also spent time crafting and articulating the Bukalapak way of doing things -- a philosophy that guides the actions of the firm . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something to our target segment ? We are not comparable to many companies , since we handle both online and offline , operate outside tier 1 cities and target MSMEs . Anything we do , needs to gel with that overall strategy . " <p> The second aspect is being very data oriented and collaborative . Projects at the company are typically never the responsibility of a single group , unless all that they require is a specialist skill set . The company is structured to avoid silos and is viewed internally as a group of startups . Oetomo said , " While they have a vertical reporting line , we challenge them to collaborate and work together . That 's why we can do this with a lot fewer people compared to many of our peers . " <p> IPO a waypoint and not a destination <p> Oetomo had a different perspective even on the company 's IPO . He said , " It 's part of a journey that 's still about empowering MSMEs . What we have done so far focuses on one vertical : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demand Bukalapak 's attention : building materials , auto repair and eateries . Oetomo said , " We are far from where we want to be when it comes to bringing multiple sales channels to merchants . " At the same time , Bukalapak is committed to delivering on numbers and meeting the performance expectations of being a public company . Oetomo said , " It 's important to show that we have taken the fiduciary duty of the investor 's capital seriously , and are turning it into a worthy performance to enhance shareholder value . <p> This article was created in partnership with Bukalapak .

@@43863236 <h> With smoke haze posing a significant pollution problem for Southeast Asia , a victim-pays approach could result in cleaner air for all . <h> Share <p> The dry season is the period for slash and burn in Southeast Asia . Each July to October , smoke from agriculture and clearing of forests chokes not only the countries burning ( mainly Indonesia ) , but also neighbouring countries , Singapore , Malaysia , Brunei and Southern Thailand . Forest fires and smoke haze in Southeast Asia have , over the years , resulted in serious health risks , environmental damage and economic ramifications well beyond borders . <p> Fining the perpetrators is risky . Boycotts of haze-linked products such as palm oil penalise well-behaved plantations as well as errant ones . <p> What if , instead , the victims were to pay ? Paying polluters to adopt fire-free land clearing practices could be the economic solution the region needs , particularly if countries were willing to overlook narrow national interests and acknowledge the transnational effects of haze on economies and societies . <p> Preventing the economic consequences of forest burning is among the many activities undertaken by developed countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank under the label of development assistance . <p> If those wanting a haze-free life contributed financing , farmers and plantations would find it possible to ditch slash and burn . Payments could be used to fund appropriate land-clearing equipment , and financial incentives and disincentives to small landholders to adopt land-clearing practices without the use of fire . Funding and fund transfer among the stakeholders could pay for fire monitoring and prevention activities in a bid to control and influence the polluters . <p> On the other side of the ledger are the many tangible and intangible costs associated with transboundary haze . The tangible costs of haze pollution include health costs , productivity loss due to restricted activity days , loss of tourism and its knock-on effects , and the cost of mitigation and adaptation by government agencies and households . Intangible costs may be difficult to measure but nonetheless have a real impact on society , such as general discomfort suffered by the public and loss of enjoyment of outdoor activities . <p> It may seem unfair -- extortionate even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed . But realistically , many in Southeast Asia may be willing to pay to end the annual haze . <p> A central tenet of welfare economics sees welfare enhanced if those who are better off can compensate those who lose and still be better off . <p> The cost of controlling the haze pollution could be shared by the victim nations in proportion to the damage they experience from the pollution . Game theory could be used to set the rules so no country would be tempted to walk away . In 2004 , it was suggested that 93.8 per cent of the victim damages were in Indonesia , 5.1 per cent in Malaysia and 1.1 per cent in Singapore . A calculation of the tangible and intangible costs of the haze impacts amounts to about S$1.83 billion ( US$1.2 billion ) . If the costs of direct fire damages in Indonesia were factored in as well , the relative proportions of victim damages suffered by each country could then be calculated by dividing the total damage costs to each country over the total costs of forest fires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$1.125 billion , US$61.2 million , and US$13.2 million a year , respectively . This method only works if the amount paid is less than or equal to the harm suffered . For example , if the cost of reducing land-clearing activities is lower than the cost of the fires for its own country , Indonesia could manage the fires themselves . <p> International expertise and financial support could improve environmental conditions in Southeast Asia , saving the region 's countries billions of dollars while modernising production methods used primarily by small landholders . The benefits of transforming the agricultural sector in Malaysia and Indonesia might deliver spinoffs to other sectors in the economy including agricultural machinery . Over the long term , the health benefits might be considerable and lead to an improvement in the sector 's image . <p> Another source of transboundary haze mitigation funding might be ordinary people who are willing to pay for not enduring pollution . In 2018 , a willingness-to-pay survey found that , for a one-month haze episode , Singaporeans were willing to reach into their own pockets for approximately S$51.31 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of Southeast Asian haze in victim countries would help each country to better decide whether and how much aid to offer Indonesia , and how best to assist sectors hurt by the haze .

Musk has also said that the only gasoline cars he owned are a 1967 Jaguar Series 1 E-Type Roadster and a Ford Model T. <p> The same is true for Sergey Brin and Larry Page , who are Tesla owners . <p> Here are some of the world 's wealthiest people , who made their money on Wall Street and hit the city streets with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions around the world , Musk is unlike any other billionaire perhaps because of his unconventional ways of doing things , such as his penchant for sharing memes on Twitter . <p> The world 's richest man has made his fortune from PayPal , Tesla and SpaceX , which has revolutionised aerospace . While he has his eyes on Mars , Musk has zipped across the ' Pale Blue Dot ' ( our humble planet ) in cars that anyone would love to have in their garage . <p> His most famous four-wheeler was perhaps the McLaren F1 , a car that would cost around USD 1 million when Musk purchased it after selling his first company , Zip2 , to Compaq in 1999 . <p> That car was also famously featured in a CNN TV interview of a young Musk .

Bezos and Musk are usually seen topping Forbes ' billionaire index . <p> Even though the 57-year-old owns a Gulfstream G-650ER and many properties , Bezos is not known for his cars . Despite having the money to buy practically any car ever made , Bezos ' taste in four-wheelers is reportedly modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in 1997 , Bezos was driving a 1987 Chevy Blazer . <p> Speaking to Alan Boyle ofGeek Wire in 2016 , Bezos said , " Amazon opened its doors in 1995 , so that 's 21 years ago .

( Image credit : Porsche ) <p> Unlike Bezos , Gates can be called a true car fanatic . He has been a proud owner of multiple mean machines since he became proverbially rich . His fascination with Porsche is known to all who have even the slightest interest in billionaires or cars . <p> His first " indulgence " was a Porsche 911 , which Gates bought in 1979 when Microsoft had just started its rise . He drove the pearlescent turquoise-coloured beauty along the sandy stretches of Albuquerque , New Mexico , and was even jailed for recklessly driving it . <p> However , it is his latest possession that deserves our attention -- Porsche Taycan . Gates bought the all-electric car in 2020 , months after its launch in September 2019 . <p> The car has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross Turismo . Its top speed is between the ranges of 220-260 km/h , while the acceleration is 0-100 km/h in 2.8 to 5.4 seconds , depending on the variant .

It can be customised by the buyer , especially when it comes to interiors . <p> " I have to say it 's a premium-priced car . It is very , very cool . This is my first electric car , and I am enjoying it a lot , " Gates had said during a conversation with YouTuber Marques Brownlee . <p> As one of the richest persons in the world , Arnault knows how to spend his wealth . <p> Although his collection exudes affluence with an island , business jets and a yacht , Arnault does not seem like a car enthusiast .

He pledged to donate over 99 percent of his wealth and according to Forbes , has already given away over USD 45 billion to charities , including Gates Foundation . <p> He leads a very frugal lifestyle , in stark contrast to someone whose net worth is over USD 100 billion . A hugely successful investor , many cite Buffett as an example of how and where to spend your money . <p> He continues to live in the same house that he purchased in Omaha , Nebraska , in 1958 for USD 31,500 . The maximum he might spend on his breakfast would be roughly USD 3.89 for a bacon , egg and cheese biscuit sandwich . <p> Coming to the vehicles he owns , he travels in is a Cadillac XTS , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail price was around USD 45,000 . Perhaps the nonagenarian is a fan of Cadillac , as he had a 2006 Cadillac DTS before General Motors ' Chief Executive Mary Barra convinced him to upgrade his ride .

Produced between 2007 and 2017 , it came with a 5.0-litre V8 with a hybrid drivetrain that delivered 438 horsepower . High on the luxury factor , the car was meant to be exclusive . <h> Steve Ballmer <p> Ballmer 's time as the CEO of Microsoft may not have been an exciting one , but he led it for around 14 years from 2000 to 2014 . <p> Now the owner of NBA team Los Angeles Clippers , Ballmer is among the top 10 Forbes billionaires . He has been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USD 2 billion fund to uplift Americans out of poverty and investing in a company that makes software for nonprofits and government agencies . <p> Ballmer is a fan of Ford vehicles , reportedly because his father worked with Ford Motor Company as a manager . <p> In 2009 , when he was with Microsoft , Ford 's then CEO Alan Mulally personally delivered an SYNC-equipped Ford Fusion Hybrid to Ballmer at the Microsoft campus . The SYNC is Ford 's voice-controlled communication and entertainment system that was co-developed with Microsoft . <h> Sergey Brin and Larry Page <p> Sergey Brin and Larry Page are perhaps the most famous names in the internet 's history . After all , they created Google , which practically is the backbone of the World Wide Web experience today . <p> Both founders are individual billionaires and remain in news for their ambitious projects . <p> While Page owns flying cars ( yes , you read that right ) and has prototypes , he has perhaps not flown any of them . <p> Brin , on the other hand , is reportedly busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . <p> Though Page and Brin are currently focusing on different projects , they have a lot in common as two old friends who built a colossus that straddles the universes of business and technology . This is perhaps why both have had the same type of cars . <p> Page and Brin travelled in their respective Toyota Prius cars . However , it is not clear which model they had or if they have it currently , but a 2018 CNBC list mentions that they have the cars . <p> As for the car itself , the 2022 model of the elegant sedan is simply beautiful to look at . It has a 1.8-litre , 4-cylinder hybrid engine , which delivers a net 121 horsepower or 90kW . <p> The other automaker , which has a special place in the minds of the two geniuses is Tesla . In particular , Brin 's 2013 Tesla Model S became famous on the Internet after Google employees pulled off a prank on him on April Fool 's Day . <p> The employees turned his Model S into a Batmobile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zebra-striped seats , pink-coloured vinyl paint and bat wings on the rear . <p> Manas enjoys reading detective fiction and writing about anything that interests him .

While many of us are not directly involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict , there are some measures we can take to minimize the economic impact of the war on our daily lives . <h> Save <p> - Advertisement 3- <p> One way to increase your financial security is to save some money in a bank account . This allows you to set aside a sum of money that can be used for emergencies . To better mitigate the inflationary pressures caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict and other events around the globe , you should deposit your money in an account with a high interest rate .

You can check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more of our recommendations . <p> Standard Chartered Bonus$aver Account is the best option on the market for affluent individuals open to a banking relationship with Standard Chartered . Account holders earn rate boosts by : <p> crediting a salary of at least S$3,000/month <p> spending S$500 -- S$2,000+/month on a Bonus$aver credit or debit card <p> purchasing an eligible investment or insurance product <p> paying at least 3 bills per month online <p> These bonuses can be unlocked individually but obtaining all 4 will allow consumers to earn up to 2.38% p.a. interest .

A disaster-prone country that was formerly thought to be riddled with political instability and violence , unable to provide for its own population , is today wealthier than many of its neighbours . <p> It has outperformed many other countries in its region in terms of per capita income , which has attracted the attention of extra-regional powers . It has remembered its oath of supporting anyone in need , and has stepped forward to lend money to Sri Lanka via a currency swap . <p> Different arguments have been presented as to what contributed to Bangladesh 's remarkable success ; but four key areas are generally highlighted : the ready-made garments ( RMG ) sector , Bangladesh 's demographic dividend , its burgeoning online workforce , and the knowledge-based economy . One argument that has undermined its achievements is that the country has benefited from quota facilities from the US and Europe , which is a key reason for its amazing development . <p> Yes , several assessments come close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all four indicators will continue to grow for a variety of reasons . During the pandemic , Bangladesh specialised in many types of RMG items and also began producing and exporting high-quality personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , which will continue to be in high demand in the near future . <p> As a developing manufacturing force , Bangladesh is moving away from " Made in China " and toward a " Made in Bangladesh " period . For example , Bangladesh 's pharmaceutical industry has grown at an incredible rate . <p> Bangladesh 's demographic dividend , which may last till around 2040 , indicates that it can produce low-skilled and semi-skilled labour in a globalised world . The number of medical institutions that have been created in Bangladesh has been able to generate goodwill , as evidenced by the fact that a number of South Asian countries have sent their students to study medicine in Bangladesh . Lotay Tshering , the current prime minister of Bhutan , is an example of a South Asian student who studied medicine in Bangladesh . <p> Bangladesh is likewise attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is presently the world 's second-largest online labour force supplier . Furthermore , the rise of think tanks and their analysis have paved the way for Bangladesh to transition to a knowledge-based economy , which would ensure the country 's economic viability in the long run . To put it another way , Bangladesh has not followed a traditional western model of growth ; rather , it has done so in its own unique way . <p> Bangladesh did not follow the traditional road of economic diplomacy in pursuing its development ambitions , instead opting to form a developmental relationship with whoever offered a fair bargain that would benefit Bangladesh 's national interests . <p> As a result , it has established development links not only with China , India and Japan , but also with Persian Gulf countries to expand investment opportunities . Bangladesh has been able to model a unique route for others to follow in order to learn how to achieve " development without hostility " .

Min Aung Hlaing against renewed calls for him to follow the five-point consensus to solve the country 's crisis is undeniable evidence of his lack of respect for Asean . <p> It is time for the leaders of the regional association to hold him accountable for his reckless acts . Myanmar 's membership in Asean should be suspended until the military gives back the power it robbed from the country 's democratically elected government on Feb 1 of last year . <p> Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has reportedly relinquished the mandate given to him by Asean to ensure that the Myanmar general complied with the consensus he agreed to at the Asean emergency summit in Jakarta in April of last year . Hun Sen was initially optimistic that he would be able to engage with the junta , knowing well how Asean had helped end the civil war in Cambodia in the 1980s . <p> President Joko " Jokowi " Widodo , in a message to Hun Sen in January , said Hlaing had no choice but to carry out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistakes of Brunei in failing to inform other Asean member states before and after sending an envoy to talk with the Myanmar junta . <p> As this year 's Asean chair , Hun Sen was initially confident that his engagement with the junta would be more fruitful than Asean 's rigid position .

The two missions , however , failed . <p> Hun Sen later said it would be better if Indonesia , the 2023 chair of Asean , took over the job .

But knowing the mistrust of Suu Kyi in Indonesia and Malaysia , it will not be easy for the two countries to accommodate the NUG . <p> Myanmar leader Suu Kyi declined to make introductory visits to Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur , flouting a long-standing norm for Asean , likely because of tensions over the Rohingya , a persecuted Muslim minority group in the predominantly Buddhist Myanmar . <p> Asean also needs to work together with the outside world , especially the West and other advanced countries such as Japan , to enforce economic sanctions against Myanmar 's generals and suspend military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar generals may think they can survive without Asean - or even the world .

Finding that potential in our children , on the other hand , is the key to assisting them in developing it . This article will teach you how to raise a super smart baby . <p> If you 're like most parents , you are always concerned about your child 's growth . Are they gaining enough knowledge ? Do they have the same linguistic skills as their friends ? Is n't it too soon or too late to be reaching these milestones ? <p> It is just natural to want your precious child to be the best and brightest , and you may struggle with comparing your child to his peers . But how do you know if your child is on the right track ? And what can you do to help them reach their full potential ? <h> How to know if a baby is smart <p> Every parent enjoys learning that their child is exceptionally bright . But what you might not realise is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurture so that your child reaches their full genius baby potential ! <p> The trick is to recognise these early indicators of a smart baby so that you can bring them out and watch your baby shine . <h> 1 . Hits milestones earlier than other babies their age <p> You may be aware that baby developmental milestones are an important indicator of whether your child 's physical , cognitive and emotional development is on track . <p> However , if your baby is reaching these milestones much sooner than their peers , this could be one of the signs of a smart baby . For example , your three-month-old is already sitting up on his or her own . Or your 10-month-old speaks in complete sentences . <h> 2 . Has very good focus <p> Babies and young children have notoriously short attention spans -- give or take 15 minutes and they 're off on another adventure . However , one of the signs of an intelligent child is the ability to focus on a task for extended periods of time at a young age , usually before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may notice your highly intelligent five-month-old concentrating intently on playing with wooden blocks without becoming distracted . Or she may sit with you while you read a book , pointing out favourite images or turning the page . <h> 3 . Likes solving problems <p> If your child shows signs of being an intelligent baby , do n't expect him or her to give up easily ! That 's right -- in addition to extreme focus , such babies have exceptional problem-solving abilities . <p> If you keep their favourite snacks in a cupboard , for example , your child is likely to devise a clever way of obtaining these treats . Stacking the queue box on a toy truck ! <p> And , while all children demonstrate problem-solving skills in accordance with developmental milestones , a child who is exceptionally advanced will demonstrate these skills much earlier than their peers . <h> 4 . Enjoys ( or even prefers ) solitude <p> We all know that children are fun-loving little beings who rarely want to be left alone . However , one of the signs of a smart baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 'll notice them having a great time playing on their own . Or , for slightly more advanced emotional and intellectual stimulation , they may prefer the company of older children rather than that of their peers . Hello there , tiny genius ! <h> 5 . Extremely curious <p> Have you noticed your baby looking at you very keenly , like she 's inspecting something on your face ? Yes , children can be inquisitive little creatures . However , one of the signs of an exceptionally intelligent baby is that they are naturally very curious . <p> Smaller babies may use their eyes to investigate faces and sounds , while toddlers can grab interesting objects and become engrossed in a wide range of activities . <h> 6 . High birth weight <p> It may sound strange , but studies show a link between a child 's birth weight and intelligence . <p> Researchers discovered that having a higher birth weight correlates with having a slightly higher IQ throughout life . The full paediatrics study can be found here . Meanwhile , continue to nourish your baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and then with brain foods such as avocado and fish once they begin solids . <h> 7 . Alertness <p> A high level of alertness is one of the first signs of an intelligent baby . These babies are also acutely aware of their surroundings and loved ones , recognising and bonding with family members almost immediately . They will make direct eye contact with you and reward you with a smile or other signs of recognition , such as cooing or waving their fists . <h> How to raise a super smart baby <p> Keep in mind that parental influence can be very powerful . Consider this when trying to encourage your child 's development : researchers who studied Einstein and other high achievers believe that certain parenting behaviours may lead to more successful adults . <p> You do n't need any special training or equipment to do this . Your baby only needs you and the environment around them to learn ! Consider the following as you consider how to give your child the best possible start : <h> 1 . Take good care of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are still in the womb . Proper nutrition and avoiding unhealthy habits such as smoking and drug or alcohol use can help your child reach their full potential . <p> Regular prenatal care can help to prevent complications and premature or preterm deliveries , which can have an impact on a baby 's brain . <h> 2 . Address your baby 's needs <p> You 've probably heard of psychologist Abraham Maslow 's hierarchy of needs . Food , water and shelter are at the bottom of his pyramid . Self-actualisation is at the top of the pyramid . <p> Lower level needs must be met in order to achieve one 's highest potential and purpose , according to the pyramid . <p> This is also true for your child . They must be fed , kept clean , and kept warm in order to develop properly . They can not reach their full potential unless their basic needs are met , so time spent feeding or cuddling them in preparation for sleep is time well spent . <h> 3 . Play together <p> Taking time to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as the foundation for future relationships . Playing allows for the development of important social-emotional , communication , and cognitive skills . Even with the smallest newborns , it 's critical not to overlook this special time . <h> 4 . Encourage good sleep <p> Sleep is essential for consolidating memories , integrating our experiences , and gaining more knowledge at all ages , but it is especially important for infants as their brains continue to grow and process information . <h> 5 . Provide nutritious options <p> It is important for your baby 's brain development that he or she receives adequate nutrition . The majority of those nutrients will be obtained from breast milk or formula during the first year of life . You 'll want to make sure your child is drinking frequently and getting enough fluids . <p> You 'll want to make sure they 're getting a rainbow of colours and a variety of food groups on their plates as they transition to solid foods . <h> 6 . Read together <p> You may want to read aloud to your baby even before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have no effect on their development , it will establish a pattern of reading together that will be beneficial once they are out of the womb and in your arms . <p> Books provide opportunities for language learning , bonding with caregivers and exposure to things that a child may not be able to see physically . <p> Remember that the interaction between you and your child is a big part of what makes books so educational . Consider combining books with cuddles , songs , and silliness for some excellent brain development . <h> 7 . Talk to your child <p> Language is important ! The number of words you expose your child to influences their vocabulary and research has shown that frequent communication with your child can improve nonverbal abilities such as reasoning and number understanding . <p> His overall development is likely to improve if you make an effort to engage in positive conversations with your child on a regular basis . Conversations can result in improved behaviour , reduced anxiety and increased self-confidence . <p> Do n't forget to sing together and use music as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain development . <h> 8 . Provide toys that are developmentally appropriate <p> Toys can assist your child in learning new skills . You can provide a reasonable challenge to your child by selecting developmentally appropriate toys . <p> Learning new ways to play with their toys can boost their self-esteem , spatial awareness and cognitive development . There is no need for a plethora of toys if the ones that are available promote learning and growth . <h> 9 . Avoid screen time <p> Several studies have found that screen time in young children has a negative impact on brain development . <p> As a result , the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommended in 2016 that children under the age of 18 months limit their screen time to video chatting only . The AAP recommends that only high-quality programming be shown after 18 months . <p> It is recommended that children aged two to five limit their screen time to no more than one hour per day of this high-quality programming ( shown with an adult present to provide real-world connections and help your child understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Being physically active is beneficial to both mental and physical health . Endorphins are released during physical activity , which can aid in managing feelings of depression and anxiety . It can also increase self-confidence , self-esteem and cognitive skills . <h> 11 . Focus on exploration over memorisation <p> While it 's exciting to see a toddler recite state capitals or multiplication facts , do n't mistake memorisation for intelligence . <p> Your child needs to spend a lot of time working on their gross and fine motor skills , especially in the early months and years . Developing these skills necessitates the ability to explore , touch , and move . <p> Many words and facts can be learned in real-world contexts even as your child grows older . Providing this context can aid in information retention . <h> 12 . Manage your expectations <p> Keep in mind that growth takes time . Do n't forget to set realistic expectations based on commonly expected milestones and to celebrate even minor achievements along the way .

Find articles like this there . <p> In the past two decades , many of us have gone from saving up to buy clothes that we kept and treasured to consuming pieces designed to be ordered via mobile , worn a couple of times , paraded on social media once and then discarded by the end of the month . <p> Studies show that young women are some of the biggest culprits of fast-fashion culture -- buying 50 to 60 items a year and not even wearing one in seven of them . <p> The fast-fashion market continues to weather the global storm kicked up by climate-change awareness . Chinese giant Shein , for example , which sells clothes aimed firmly at under-25s for rock-bottom prices , announced it expected sales to jump from roughly US$6.2 billion ( S$8.4 billion ) in 2020 to over US$15 billion in 2021 , with the US its biggest market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , Shein raised another US$1 billion or so in a funding round last week , according to reports , valuing the company at US$100 billion . By comparison , Inditex , which owns Zara , has a market cap of roughly US$68 billion . <p> The EU has decided enough is enough . Last week , Brussels announced plans to crack down on throwaway fashion with a new initiative whereby any clothes made or sold in the EU will have to be repairable and recyclable . <p> Quite what this means is still unclear -- " and we do n't yet know whether there will be penalties for serial offenders , or incentives for good practice " , says Fashion Roundtable CEO Tamara Cincik . " But it is an exciting next step for circularity in the fashion industry .

No one has earned what they are worth . You are contributing to global poverty by buying that cheap shirt . " <p> This obsession with endlessly new , ever-more-affordable clothing is a blip in our increasingly woke world -- one where Greta Thunberg is a figure of admiration among Gen Z , but where fast fashion is a forgotten black hole for the same age group . <p> Young people are buying more clothes -- but this does n't yet have the social stigma of eating red meat or regularly flying long haul among this environmentally conscious generation . <p> Interestingly , the pandemic led to a slew of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brands were cancelling existing orders because of the pandemic or refusing to pay in full . <p> In Cambodia -- an economy powered by clothing manufacturing -- most workers earned the minimum wage of US$182 a month pre-pandemic , but this fell sharply amid cancelled orders , leaving those already vulnerable to human trafficking and forced labour -- mostly women -- even more exposed . <p> That fast-fashion brands are making more money than ever shows that by highlighting the human cost , campaigners have been barking up the wrong tree . <p> If there is one cause Gen Z has pledged itself to , it 's climate change . Take veganism for example . Reports on animal welfare have been around since Linda McCartney , but once the impact of methane became common knowledge , the allure of the animal-free diet increased . <p> Can fast fashion get a similar treatment ?

You buy fast fashion , or you buy second-hand . The latter has far less of an impact on the environment and I think increasingly more young people will turn to it . " <p> The popularity of pre-loved clothing , as it 's now called , has bloomed , leading to sharp growth for resale sites like Depop , which counted 30 million users in 2021 and was the 10th most-visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the US , according to reports .

" <p> Lauren Bravo , the author of How to Break-up with Fast Fashion , agrees . " The fast-fashion bubble has to burst soon , as those Gen Z shoppers become more and more clued up about ethics and governments finally issue the sanctions and regulations on the industry that are so badly needed ... and when that happens , it 'll be the brands who have built for a kinder , slower future that retain some loyalty .

@@63931234 <h> ' Nobody will look after us ' if S'poreans ca n't look after ourselves : Bilahari on Ukraine in 2014 <p> COMMENTARY : In March 2014 , former permanent secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Bilahari Kausikan , published a commentary on lessons for Small States from Ukraine in The Straits Times . <p> He visited Ukraine in December 2013 and had the opportunity to observe the EuroMaidan demonstrations . After his visit , he reflected on how a country has fallen prey to Great Power politics and what this means for Singapore and Singaporeans . <p> The essay was written in the wake of Russia 's invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea in early 2014 . It can be found in Bilahari 's 2017 " Singapore Is Not An Island : Views on Singapore Foreign Policy " book . Published by Straits Times Press , you can get a copy of his book here . <p> Bilahari Kausikan is chairman of the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore . <h> By Bilahari Kausikan , first published in 2014 <p> Last December , finding myself in Ukraine , I took the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On one visit I listened to some European Union ( EU ) politician -- I think it was a member of the European Parliament -- give a rousing speech . He spoke of freedom and democracy , the usual phrases tripping off his tongue fluently . <p> The speech was in English and I do not know how much the crowd really understood . But the intent was clear in any language and the crowd responded enthusiastically to the expression of support . There was an almost festive air . <p> But the thought crossed my mind : This could end up like Hungary in 1956 . At that time , the West encouraged an anti-Soviet revolt , then folded its arms as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest . <h> Relationship between Russia and Ukraine <p> Thankfully , the current Russian intervention has so far been limited and less bloody . <p> But Russia 's response was entirely predictable , as anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the region 's history and Ukraine 's complicated relationship with Russia should have known . <p> Russia can not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential part of itself and without abandoning President Vladimir Putin 's goal of a revived Russia as a great power . And Mr Putin 's own authority rests in no small part on his reputation as a strong Russian nationalist . <p> Some 17 per cent of Ukraine 's population -- more than eight million -- is ethnically Russian , the largest Russian diaspora in the world . Ethnic Russians constitute the majority of the population in the Crimea . There are also substantial numbers in East and South-east Ukraine next to the Russian border , as well as in the major cities . <p> Indeed , the origin and heart of Russia 's Slavic culture lies in the mediaeval kingdom of Kyivian Rus centred in modern Ukraine , not Moscow . <p> The pipelines that supply Russian gas to West Europe pass through Ukraine . That revenue is essential to the Russian economy . Geopolitically , Sevastopol on the Black Sea in Crimea is Russia 's only warm water port . <h> Ukraine , Russia , and the West <p> In August 1991 , with the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. W. Bush flew to Kyiv and cautioned the Verkhova Rada , Ukraine 's Parliament , against " suicidal nationalism " . <p> He was roundly criticised by the Western media . But the wisdom of Bush senior is now clear . <p> Ukraine was and remains deeply divided over the question of closer association with the EU , opinions generally mirroring the ethnic divisions . It was reckless of the post-Yanukovych government to have abolished Russian as Ukraine 's second language as its very first act . <p> It aroused the worst fears of Russia and Russian Ukrainians . In January and February this year , it is estimated that almost 700,000 Ukrainian citizens , most believed to be ethnic Russians , fled to Russia . <p> It was inevitable that Russia would move decisively . And so it did , with its customary ruthlessness that caught the West flatfooted . <h> What can the West do to Russia ? <p> U.S. President Barack Obama has said the Russian intervention will have " costs " . But what costs ? <p> The United States and the EU are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr Putin well knows . After a decade of wars in the Middle East , the American public is weary of foreign adventures . <p> That was among the reasons that Mr Obama was elected in the first place . The EU has neither the capability nor the stomach to wage war on Russia . <p> Will there be sanctions ? Perhaps there will be some symbolic sanctions , and they may inconvenience individual Russians and businesses . But they will not bite deep enough to make Russia reverse course . <p> Will -- or can -- Western Europe stop buying Russian gas ? That is the only sanction that would really hurt , and it is not going to happen , as Mr Putin again well knows . <p> There will probably be a boycott of the Sochi G-8 Summit . Russia may even be expelled or suspended from the G-8 . So what ? Does Mr Putin really care ? Ukraine is a vital interest to Russia and to him personally . <p> Weighed in that balance , any cost the U.S. and EU can realistically impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emergency session . Predictably , it achieved nothing . As a permanent member , Russia holds a veto . The U.S. and EU know this . <p> Arguably the very reason they convened the Security Council was precisely that it would achieve nothing : It was a low-cost gesture to preserve some semblance of amour propre . <h> The annexation of Crimea <p> Crimea is lost to Ukraine . In some weeks or months , there will probably be a referendum or some other act of self-determination . A new state will then be set up in Crimea on the model of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which Russia established after its 2008 intervention in Georgia . <p> I doubt that Russia will intervene in East or South-east Ukraine in the same way as it did in Crimea . Moscow need not resort to naked military intervention again to drive home the point that Russian interests can not be disregarded in its " near abroad " . <p> On a personal level , Mr Putin has made himself look strong and American and European leaders look weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval , the U.S. and EU will again " reset " relations with Russia . As a nuclear weapon state , a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a major energy supplier , Russia simply can not be ostracised forever . <p> The EU was itself divided over the prospect of a closer association with Ukraine . The EU members that were formerly part of the Soviet empire -- Poland and the Baltic states -- were the most enthusiastic . Other EU members were more ambivalent , fearing the costs of a closer partnership with such a huge country at a time when their economies were still fragile . <p> The EU politician I heard last December was not the only or the most important Western leader to give encouragement to the Ukrainians . It was irresponsible to do so without the capacity to deter a Russian intervention or to respond effectively when Russia did intervene . <h> Lessons applicable to Singapore and Singaporeans <p> None of this in any way excuses Russia 's actions . As a small country , Singapore must take seriously any violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever they occur . <p> I am certain that those Singaporeans who have paid attention to recent events in Ukraine feel sympathy for its people . <p> But more importantly than empathy for yet another country that has fallen prey to Great Power politics , the plight of the Ukrainians holds valuable lessons for us . <p> Do not just listen to the sweet words of foreigners , however pleasing to the ear . We must calculate our own interests as clinically as we can and not let anyone beguile us into believing they know better . <p> The West speaks often and eloquently of democracy and elections with a near religious fervour . The ousted Yanukovych government , whatever its failings , was popularly elected in a manner that just four years ago the U.S. and the EU hailed as free and fair . <p> Yet when the U.S. and EU thought that it was in their interests , they did not hesitate to recognise the government that seized power in Kyiv after President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from office . In doing so , they broke an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yanukovych , the Ukrainian opposition and the European foreign ministers themselves just weeks earlier . <p> A Russian Special Envoy was present at those negotiations but did not sign . That was a strong signal that should have been heeded . Why did the U.S. and EU miscalculate so disastrously ? <p> One important reason why they were blindsided by Russia was that having no stomach for drastic action themselves , they thought everyone else was similarly squeamish . <p> The U.S. and the EU responded to the new government in Kyiv by immediately offering International Monetary Fund assistance . This was undoubtedly very necessary . But they failed to understand that Russia 's calculations and priorities were entirely different . <p> The U.S. and EU mistook their own beliefs and hopes for reality . We must never do that . <h> An ideal world or a dangerous world ? <p> A world ruled by international law is the ideal world for small states . But is this really such a world ? Perhaps sometimes ; or even most times ; but not all the time . <p> International law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . Great powers resort to it only when convenient . Russia is not unique in this respect . This is a dangerous world . <p> The U.S. and EU have suffered a blow to their credibility . But they , or at least the U.S. , will eventually recover . <p> It is the Ukrainian people who paid and who will continue to pay the heaviest price for Western miscalculations . <p> There is yet another particularly apt lesson here for Singaporeans . Calls for a reduction in national service commitments should be regarded with great scepticism . <p> We must never lose the ability to look after ourselves , because if we can not look after ourselves , nobody will look after us.

@@88693235 <p> SINGAPORE - The impact of the goods and services tax ( GST ) hike will be delayed for the majority of households in Singapore , and the date the rise takes place is not when Singaporeans will feel its impact , Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah told Parliament on Tuesday ( Jan 11 ) . <p> And as it prepares for the upcoming Budget , priority will be given to helping Singaporeans cope with the cost of living .

" <p> While B Corp certification may be lauded as a new gold standard for brands and companies , its impact is n't far-reaching just yet .

More commonly seen in luxury hotels rather than the everyday home , open-plan ensuite bathrooms can visually enhance your space space to feel bigger and brighter .

@@90460233 <h> Designed by an architect for himself , his wife and several cats , this airy open-plan house in Kuala Lumpur brings the outdoors in <p> Designing your own home from the ground up is a unique opportunity , an opportunity which architect and co-founder of Design Collective Architects , Chan Mun Inn explored to its fullest for his home , fondly known as 38Mews . <p> Located in Kota Damansara , the land is a compact 9,000 sq ft adjacent a forest reserve . Chan and his wife had been living in a 1,000 sq ft apartment for eight years with an increasing number of cats and one dog . <p> " Eventually I had to take the dog to my parent 's house which has a garden so they could take care of the dog , We still had four cats to share the apartment with and it started to feel crowded . That 's when I decided to start looking for a piece of land to build our new home . I wanted to give the cats a bit more space to move about , " he recalls . <p> Above The sloping roof provides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor master bedroom and study <p> From the outset , Chan was certain he did n't want a big house which led to the built-up of the house to be a neat 3,000 sq ft which provided a good ratio of built-up to land size . The house 's intended functions informed its design and that was to have sufficient place for the couple to work at home and ample and secure indoor/outdoor space for the cats to roam freely . <p> To this end , the ground floor is isolated as a working area away from the living quarters while the residential unit is located on the upper floor with two bedrooms and a large open terrace . The large open terrace has a sliding gate which provides the cats with a large outdoor area within the house to roam freely and securely . <p> The sloping roof provides for a double volume space that flows vertically into these second-floor master bedroom and study . The roof continues to slope into the bedroom itself and terminates at the large picture window that overlooks and frames the views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to be ' just enough ' for us to use . There was n't any need for additional bedrooms , so we only built one master bedroom and one guest bedroom . We had many friends and colleagues that were surprised to find out that our house only had two rooms . The living spaces are one continuous open-plan layout with the living and kitchen occupying one large space . There is no defined dining area in the house . We would usually sit on the recycled wooden table on the verandah for dinner , " explains Chan . <p> " Bedroom doors were designed with the door handle higher up at 5 ' instead of the usual 3 ' . This is because one of our cats has learnt how to open doors in our previous apartments . Windows are also placed higher up at 5 ' to prevent them from jumping out , and kitchen appliances and doors are all tucked away behind shutters . " <p> Above Tall tress shade the house <p> Above The sloping roof makes for high ceilings <p> The large open terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chan dismisses any concerns that this is a privacy issue : " How this was designed was that the house is actually placed back with a large garden just in front of the terrace and windows . Large trees were planted surrounding the terrace which provided the necessary screening effect that 's sufficient to give us enough privacy without taking away our garden views and daylighting . Privacy in a home does not automatically mean an enclosed space with small windows which is what I was trying to avoid . <p> Apart from reinforced concrete structures and brickwork , the most common and significant material used in the house is glass with large panels of clear , non-tinted glass filling up the eastern fa ? ade of the house <p> " I never liked dark gloomy interiors and have always preferred bright and naturally lit spaces . I wanted a house whereby I never needed to turn on any lights during the day . What surprised me after the completion of the house was that I did n't need lights for some areas at night as well . The large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living spaces at the night thus providing just enough ambient lighting for moving about .

" <p> Durable furniture was added to deter the cats from scratching the furniture <p> ' carousel left ' <p> ' carousel right ' <p> Context and climate were key considerations in Chan 's design and 38Mews incorporates a lot of basic modernist elements that are also present in traditional vernacular Malaysian architecture . " This includes elements such as pilotis ( or stilts ) that elevate the house and improve cooling and cross ventilation . The intricate roof details found in old kampung houses function aesthetically but at the same time channel warm air out of the interior , cooling the inside spaces . 38Mews was designed with this in mind , " muses Chan . <p> " The movement of wind and air and how to dissipate warm air from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air towards the top of the house . The windows placed in those areas function as exhausts , releasing warm air out . This is visible , especially in the master bedroom where a high-level motorised window is placed at the top of the picture window to allow for this release of warm air . " <p> The orientation of the house was one of the most critical design decisions made early on in the design process . Large openings and glass were only designed into the eastern fa ? ade , allowing the morning sun to enter the house . The large terrace also comes with a deep overhanging roof which provides shade as well as protection from the rain . The western facades have minimal windows , just enough to light up corridors and spaces without bringing in too much of the hot afternoon sun . <p> Above The living spaces are designed as one free flowing open plan <p> External walls for the house were also constructed with a double-brick cavity wall which provided added insulation to the internal spaces . The warmer outer layer that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing heat transfer into the internal spaces . All internal spaces are also designed with windows and openings on opposing sides of the room , allowing for cross ventilation . <p> As for drainage , the roof was designed as a one-piece single pitched metal roof that flowed in one direction towards an oversized concrete gutter at the lower end of the house . This gutter then transfers the rainwater into a rainwater harvesting tank that is later used for gardening purposes . Excess water is drained off into the storm drains . <p> Above How the cats used the space was considered in the design <p> Being very clear about what he wanted from the start , Chan states that he barely veered from the initial design . However , there were some minor adjustments that needed to be made once they moved in for the feline occupants . <p> Soft furniture had to be completely replaced with more durable timber and plastic ones as the sofas were inevitably scratched up within six months .

@@90618237 <p> INCHEON - Mention Incheon and most people will just think of South Korea 's main air gateway , Incheon International Airport . <p> That is a shame , because Incheon has so much more just waiting to be discovered . <p> This sprawling west-side coastal city is the country 's third largest city and flanked by 168 islands . <p> As Incheon was the point of entry when the once-isolated Korean Peninsula first opened up to foreign merchants in 1883 , it became the earliest to become modernised and boasts many firsts , such as the first modern park , designed by a Russian , and the first Western-style hotel . <p> The Chinese left indelible footprints here . Incheon is home to South Korea 's only official Chinatown , where the ubiquitous jajangmyeon ( noodles with black bean sauce ) was first created and shot to global fame , driven by the power of K-dramas . <p> For tourists , Incheon will be a mix of old and new , and you can see how external influences have shaped the city without rocking its uniquely Korean core . <p> Here are four places to visit , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of K-style paradise . <h> 1 . Open port street : Nostalgia and noodles <p> Begin your journey from Incheon station , the birth place of the Korean railway and the oldest station in the Seoul metropolitan area . <p> There is a nostalgic charm about this station , as it still looks the same as it did when it first opened in 1899 . <p> A stone 's throw away is Gaehangjang-gori ( Open Port Street ) , the old quarters of the city . <p> Chinatown is unmistakable with its red and gold paifang ( traditional Chinese gate ) and many people flock here on weekends to enjoy authentic Chinese food , but lesser known is a Japanese street and an enclave filled with fairy-tale characters . <p> Join an electric car tour that will take you to the main sights in Incheon 's historical Open Port Street in about 50 minutes . <p> You can explore on foot , but I find it faster and more fun to join an electric car tour that will take you around to the main sights in about 50 minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 19th century . A friendly guide will explain the many historical icons of the area and help you take pictures at the most photogenic spots . <p> You can book directly at a small container booth outside Incheon station , but it would be wiser to reserve online to guarantee an English-speaking guide . <p> On Viator.com , it costs US$45 ( S$61 ) for a three-seater car and US$60 for five-seater . <p> Since you are going on a ride through history , how about renting some vintage outfits to match ? <p> Kyeongseong Boutique ( also known as Jang Boutique ) is one of many clothing rental stores in the area that sprang up after the vintage-photography trend took off three years ago . It was inspired by the 2018 drama , Mr Sunshine , which was set in the early 1900s . <p> You can dress up like characters from the drama or pick something from the racks of colourful clothing . Two hours of rental cost 25,000 won ( S$27.60 ) and women get a matching hair accessory and bag , while men get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinatown 's restaurants and street snacks ( think bing tang hu lu , or candied fruit on a stick ) . Foreign merchants lived in this neighbourhood until it fell into disrepair in the 1970s . <p> Rent a vintage outfit from Kyeongseong Boutique so you can pose prettily when you visit the Open Port Street 's main historical sites . <p> Songwol-dong Fairytale Village was born in 2014 when the government stepped in with an urban renewal project . <p> Now , it is a place where Western story characters such as Alice in Wonderland , Little Mermaid and Snow White come to life in colourful paintings and wall murals , with an occasional Korean folk hero too . <p> Just remember there are people living within those Instagrammable walls , so try not to disturb them . <p> The next stop is Jayu Gongwon , or Freedom Park .

Ganghwado : island of thrills <p> Ganghwado is one of the largest islands in South Korea , connected to Incheon by a 780m-long bridge . It makes a great weekend getaway for Seoulites , and tourists can also easily explore the island by car . <p> I have come to associate the island with thrills as it boasts the longest luge course in Asia and what my 12-year-old daughter calls " the best zipline ever " . <p> The luge at Ganghwa Seaside Resort overlooks the sea , so the best time to visit would be before 5pm , when the hill and waters start to glisten in the evening sun . <p> There are two 1.8km-long courses to choose from - the more gentle and scenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ganghwa Seaside Resort offers a luge ride that is the longest in Asia . There are two courses , both 1.8km long . PHOTO : INCHEON TOURISM ORGANISATION <p> Tickets include a gondola ride up to the peak . I suggest getting three rides ( 30,000 won or S$36 on weekdays , 38,000 won on weekends ) as one ( 15,000 won on weekdays , 19,000 won on weekends ) is definitely not enough . <p> For the zipline , head to Tianlim Lesports Park . It is a great place for family bonding and fun as it offers a range of activities from ziplining and electric karts ( say goodbye to the pungent smell of gas burning in conventional go-karts ) to rock-climbing and a laser-tag survival challenge . <p> My daughter loves the zipline as it is not just one but five courses , so you get your money 's worth . <p> Ride a five-course zipline at Tianlim Lesports Park in Gangwhado , an island in Incheon city . <p> Also found in Ganghwado are some of the prettiest cafes in Incheon , including Joyang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Korea , abandoned and then reborn as one of the biggest and most unusual themed cafes in the country . <p> The owners have retained the industrial feel of the factory while jazzing up every corner with retro decor and upcycled items .

You can also check out our comparison between different health insurances here ! <p> Hospitalisation coverage is a must-have tool to have in your life due to the ever-rising healthcare costs in the country . According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the cost of Medical &amp; Dental Treatment has risen nearly 78% in the last 20 years , or more than 2.9% per annum , which is twice as high as the MAS core inflation rate of 1.5% per annum . <p> In 2015 , the MediShield Life Scheme was introduced as a replacement and an enhancement for the older MediShield Plan introduced in 1990 . MediShield Life is a basic hospitalisation coverage plan that provides life coverage for all Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents , including those with pre-existing conditions . MediShield Life covers most basic hospitalisation fees such as Inpatient/Outpatient Treatment subsidised bills incurred at Class B2/C wards in public hospitals . <p> However , you might need an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and AIA HealthShield Gold Max to enjoy a more comprehensive coverage for your hospital expenses . <p> IP provides additional benefits such as claiming higher coverage for general medical procedure costs and higher class ward stays and other advantages such as pre-authorisation , higher coverage under panel doctors , and Preferential Health Screening Rates . <h> Integrated Shield Plan <p> So what is an Integrated Shield Plan ( IP ) ? An IP is a hospitalisation plan administered by private insurers , as approved by MOH , providing enhanced coverage beyond MediShield Life . Various plan types are available for stays in private hospitals or Class A/B1 wards of public hospitals . <p> Diagram Provided by MOH <p> Since it is an extension of MediSheild LIfe , the MediShield Life component of the IP is fully payable by MediSave . In contrast , the private insurance component of the IP is payable by MediSave up to the Additional Withdrawal Limit ( AWL ) , and the remainder is payable by cash . Riders can not be paid using MediSave . From 1 November 2015 , the AWL is set per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Age Next Birthday ( ANB ) <p> Premiums <p> =40 <p> S$300 <p> 41-69 <p> S$600 <p> =70 <p> S$900 <p> Unlike MediShield Life plans , Coverage for the private insurance component of the IP may be declined or imposed with exclusions or restrictions arising from pre-existing conditions . There is a minimum and maximum entry age limit . However , some insurers would allow those with pre-existing conditions to take on an IP plan with a higher premium price via Risk-Loading . <p> There are different Tier of IPs depending on how much you can afford and how comprehensive you want your coverage to be ( Class B1 Wards for Public Hospitals vs Class A Wards for Public/Private Hospitals ) . <p> As of 1 May 2016 , all IP insurers must sell the Standard IP regulated by MOH . The benefits of Standard IP are identical across all IP insurers and have claim limits sized to cover nine out of ten Class B1 bills fully . Like other IPs , it also has co-insurance and deductible components . As of 2022 , there are 7 Standard IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced plans that can cover more aspects of Class B1 plans , Class A plans for public hospitals , and private hospital expenses . <h> Co-Insurance , Deductibles , and Pro-Ration Factors <p> As health insurance will not fully pay for your medical expenses as regulated by the government , you should understand three Health Insurance terms before getting a shield plan from your relevant insurer : Deductibles , Co-Insurance , and Pro-Rations . <p> Deductibles are the flat rate of how much you have to pay for your medical bills before any insurer can pay any benefit payment under the IP policy to ensure that the premiums of the hospitalisation plan remain affordable , as the onus is less on the insurer . Deductibles are usually counted on a per-year basis , meaning that all eligible expenses incurred within a policy year will be used to satisfy the deductible amount . However , some plans have per disability deductibles . <p> Co-Insurance is a specified percentage ( Usually 5-10% , depending on the inclusion of Riders ) of the total medical expenses post-deductible payment that you must pay according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-consumption of medical costs , and some riders will provide a reduction in coinsurance and deductibles . Click here to read more about IP Riders . <p> A Pro-Ration Factor is an additional charge ( a percentage expressed as a pro-ration factor in the benefits schedule ) that you have to pay if you are admitted to a hospital or ward that is higher than what your current shield plan allows , e.g. , if you get an IP that entitles you to B1-Class Ward stays . <p> However , you are admitted to an A-class ward/private hospital . The benefit payable by the insurer will be reduced to consider the differences in the government subsidies applicable to the ward type of your current policy . This ensures fairness in payment ( those who pay higher premiums for better coverage can enjoy , and those who pay lower premiums should only use what they are entitled to ) . <h> Should I Switch my Insurer for IP Plans ? <p> Some people might be tempted to switch their insurers for their IP if they already have an IP Policy prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to integrate all things insurance with a new financial advisor from a different insurance company . We do not recommend switching your IP Plans for whatever reason . <p> Integrated Shield Plans by private insurers will subject you to underwriting to check if you are eligible for insurance and if you have any pre-existing conditions that might subject you to risk-loading . You would also have your original coverage terminated and face the possibility of not being able to reapply for your original plan . <p> If you switch to a new IP , you can have the option to return to the previous insurer within 30 days from the date of notification of termination of the initial IP policy . No re-underwriting is allowed by your previous insurer , as though the first IP policy had never been terminated in the first place .

Even for the super rich , those bejewelled tiaras seemed a little over-the-top . But then when you consider that extravagance is at the very heart of Dolce &amp; Gabbana , the haute couture fashion brand behind those regal accessories , it makes sense .

It 's from the French brand 's 2010 Les Eclatantes haute joaillerie collection . ( Fun fact : Chinese actress Gong Li wore a ring from the same collection at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival . ) That means that Christine had to go out of her way to purchase hers from an auction or an online reseller , probably at around its original price of US$152,000 ( THB 4,558,480 ) .

He used the modern ROC flag as the national flag and continued to use it after the KMT established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917 . <p> In 1921 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared the abolition of the use of the Five-Coloured Flag . <p> In Dec 1928 , Sun 's prot ? g ? and successor Chiang Kai-shek led the KMT to defeat the central government dominated by warlords and the Blue Sky has remained the official national flag of the ROC since then . <h> ROC flag and Chinese communists <p> The Chinese Communist Party acknowledged the use of the ROC flag when the two rivals agreed in 1937 to join hands in fighting the invading Japanese . <p> This flag continued to be used by the two sides during the eight-year war with Japan and even in the early days of the People 's Republic after the Communists defeated the KMT in their civil war in 1949 , forcing its leaders to flee to Taiwan where they formed an interim government . <p> It was not until the Communist Party took full control of mainland China in late 1949 that it ordered an end to the use of the Blue Sky flag . <h> ROC flag in Taiwan <p> Despite being used by Taiwan for more than seven decades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From time to time , the pro-independence camp questions the flag 's representativeness , due to its association with mainland China . <p> Such criticism has become stronger since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) defeated the KMT to form the government in 2016 . <p> " While this flag is not recognised in most parts of the world , it is in no way truly representative of Taiwan as it came from mainland China and resembles the party flag of the KMT , " said Wu Shuh-min , chief coordinator of the Taiwan National Alliance , a pro-independence group whose goal is to build a Taiwan nation . <p> nid:581451 <p> Such denunciation however , creates a conundrum for the DPP , and neither former DPP president Chen Shui-bian nor incumbent Tsai Ing-wen could do anything to change the flag , observers note . <p> Two-term president Chen formed Taiwan 's first DPP government in 2000 , ending half a century of KMT rule , while Tsai was first elected in 2016 , and re-elected in 2020 . <p> " The flag issue has put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kung-yi , director of Taiwan International Strategic Study Society , a Taipei-based think tank . <p> " On the one hand , it has to stick to the ROC on concern that if it changes the ROC title and uses either a DPP or a new flag , it would draw a military attack from Beijing , " Wang said . <p> " On the other hand , it has difficulty convincing its pro-independence supporters that there is no way for it to make any changes , given that the DPP adopts a pro-independence platform .

The Kardashians have also been seen sauntering in and out of this hot spot . And now , you can get a taste of what they have been enjoying . <p> The famed Japanese restaurant Nobu is finally here in Singapore . <p> Known for its Japanese techniques and South American flavours , Nobu opened its doors at Four Seasons Hotel along Orchard Boulevard on June 1 and it 's been packed ever since . <p> And before we tell you if it 's worth the hype , here are five things you should know about before making reservations at this new spot in town . <h> 1 . There is n't a Singapore-exclusive dish on the menu ... just yet <p> With nearly 50 restaurants around the world , it wo n't come as a surprise if globetrotting Singaporeans have eaten at one of celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa 's restaurants . <p> At this new establishment , while there are quite a few Singapore-exclusive features , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you must order , however , is the chef 's most well-known dish , Black Cod Miso ( $68 ) . <p> I have tried it once in Nobu Kuala Lumpur and once in Singapore , and it is always done to perfection with simple flavours that enhances the seafood , not cover it . <p> If you are excited to try something more exclusive , perhaps wait a month or two before visiting .

@@91308235 <h> House hunting : Which condos are the best for a family of 3 whose priority is school proximity ? <p> June 06 , 2022published at 10:12 AM <p> Stackedhomes <p> Hello , <p> Firstly , thanks for all the articles , enjoy reading them . <p> We are a family of three , with a two-year-old and would like to upgrade to a condo ( big two bedder unit or a regular three bedder ) , and having primary school options within 1-2KM will be our priority . <p> We like City Square Residences for its location and freehold nature and would like to seek your opinion if it is still a good buy now for own stay , considering that prices seem to be at an all-time high . While City Square Residences is freehold and closer to the train station and mall , however there are fewer choice primary schools within 1KM , as compared to Kerrisdale , where HongWen Primary school is within 1KM . <p> Our next concern will be affordability as we can get a three bedder unit at Kerrisdale , while we can only afford a two bedder at City Square Residences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten years until our son completes primary school . <p> We are also open to Potong Pasir area , like One Leicester / Nin Residences , but am afraid that we may need to worry about exit strategy as that area has many condo projects . Bartley Residences is also one of our option as it is very near to the train station and Maris Stella Pri Sch but has lesser amenities compared to Potong Pasir . <p> Thanks for taking your time to read our email and sorry if our thoughts are not too clear , as this will be a very big purchase and we want to be sure we will not be overpaying or have to worry that the property does not appreciate as the past trend . <p> Thank you <p> Hey there <p> Happy to hear that you have enjoyed our content ! Thank you for sharing your intended purchase with your requirements too . As school proximity is the main priority for the upgrade , we will share some of our thoughts and analysis on the developments based on the criteria that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will categorise based on the three different districts and we will try to shed some light on the future potential for your future exit strategy . <p> Let 's start with District 8 . City Square Residences and Kerrisdale share the same set of amenities and transport links with Farrer Park MRT station nearby . For those that drive , it is within a minute 's reach of the Central Expressway ( CTE ) and is in close proximity to Central Business District ( CBD ) . Between the two though , Kerrisdale is located slightly further away and on the quieter side of Farrer Park . <p> On the other hand , we do like the separation between the residential blocks and commercial space for City Square ; which allows for some privacy from the main buzz on the commercial side with a road separating the two . But because of that , it puts all the residential blocks out of the 1 km radius from Hong Wen School which is your preferred school , which then leaves only Kerrisdale to be within proximity to Hong Wen School . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School are within the 1 km proximity range . However , do note that the two schools will be merged from next year onwards . <h> City Square Residences : <p> With an extensive land size developed by reputable developer , CDL , City Square Residences offers a good range of facilities including two tennis courts , Karaoke television ( KTV ) , a bowling alley , and even an extensive park ! However , with over 900 units here , it comes as no surprise about the facility offerings here . <p> It does also have a wide range of unit offerings here from studio units to the biggest four-bedroom units , so the developer has catered to both investors and own stay profiles . Price-wise , it has risen well over the years , and currently stands at $1,8xx psf . <p> Plus , with its freehold status and it being an integrated project with a mall and connectivity to Farrer Park MRT station , you do have value retention in the long run . <p> The launch of Piccadilly Grand does give some indication of the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on launch day is very encouraging indeed . While it could partly be attributed to a dearth of major new launches in 2022 so far , the addition of Piccadilly Grand and the new Build to order ( BTO ) flats in Farrer Park will be helpful to support prices here in the next few years . <h> Layout analysis : <p> At 840 sq ft , the two bedder units here are definitely larger in size as compared to the average new launch today . The unit opens to a long foyer area which allows for some privacy . <p> In addition , the entrance comes with a neatly tucked closet/storage cabinet for shoe or storage purposes . The unit comes with a good-sized enclosed kitchen with plenty of cabinet space on both sides of the area . <p> We do like the wide living and dining area here ; as it is spacious for a two bedder unit . Like most older developments , bedrooms here are of a decent size however the master bedroom here comes with bay windows which takes up unnecessary space . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathtub and shower ; a rarity in two-bedroom units today . <p> Lastly , both bathrooms and kitchen areas come with ventilation windows which is great for natural ventilation . <p> On to the downsides ; we are not too sure of your laundry regime , personally , we prefer a proper yard or balcony area for laundry ; which is lacking here . <p> While a dryer may solve the laundry issue , most family profiles still prefer the traditional way of drying their laundry by hanging in a yard or balcony space . Thus this layout would cater to a smaller group of buyers . <h> Kerrisdale : <p> Located just a few hundred metres away from City Square Residences , Kerrisdale is a leasehold development and the oldest development on your list . It is situated on a quieter street ; and is away from the main road with only 481 units so Kerrisdale is less dense as compared to City Square Residences . <p> It offers a decent range of facilities though again ( the pool is big and there is a badminton court ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of layout efficiency . Prices have appreciated well over the years , and currently stand at $1,2xx psf which is decent for an RCR development and as you mentioned , for the same quantum as City Square , you could get a spacious three bedder unit here . <h> Layout analysis : <p> At 1,270 sq ft , it is an efficient and squarish layout , and a relatively safe choice for a family own stay profile . We do like the flexibility of the kitchen setup here , with the lack of internal columns , which allows for an open kitchen layout as well if you prefer that . <p> In addition , the unit comes with a decent yard area for laundry and an en-suite utility room with a proper ventilation window panel and WC ; which could potentially be used for storage or to house a helper . The living and dining areas are of a good size which is great for families with young children ; as there is more space for the kids . <p> The bedrooms are all of an acceptable size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with both shower and bathtub set-up . <p> On the other hand , the unit comes with planters instead of a proper balcony space ; a downside if you are one that prefers proper outdoor space with comfy seating to enjoy some fresh air . All in all , this is a very decent layout , especially for family own stay profiles . <p> On to the next district , District 13 with One Leicester and Nin Residences ; both of which are located within 1 km proximity to St Andrew 's Junior School ; with Nin residence set slightly further away . <p> Amenities-wise , both developments are located within walking distance to The Poiz Centre , The Venue Shoppes , and the nearby HDB enclave for basic amenities options . Additionally , Nin residence stands out with additional amenities options located over at the new Bidadari BTO enclave . <p> In terms of connectivity , both developments are within walking distance to Potong Pasir MRT station . And you also have ample bus services along Serangoon Road ; connecting the area to other parts of Singapore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute 's reach with CBD about a 20-minute drive away . <h> One Leicester : <p> With only 194 units in total , the majority of which are three and four bedder units , we do believe this development caters to a specific group of buyers ; owner own stay profiles . From the data below , backed with low transaction volume and very few unit offerings on property portals ; One Leicester ticks the boxes for proximity to St Andrew 's Junior School , amenities , and Potong Pasir MRT station . <p> It offers a decent range of facilities including a tennis court , a rarity today , especially with a unit count under 200 . However , despite the spacious size offered here , it comes with lots of bay windows which most buyers are n't really fans of . Overall , with its freehold status , it does stand you in better stead if your plans change and you are planning to hold on for a longer time period . <h> Layout analysis : <p> Similar to Kerrisdale , the three bedder unit sizes here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is slightly larger than the usual five-room BTO flats if we were to compare it hence this may be considered a slight upgrade in terms of unit size . <p> On to the plus points of this unit , the unit opens to a foyer area which provides some privacy , and with a horizontal unit set up here , it allows for more natural lighting into the unit via the balcony and window panels respectively . The unit comes with an enclosed kitchen in an L-shape layout and in addition , there is a proper yard area for laundry and an in-unit household shelter for storage or as a helper 's room . <p> All bedrooms here are reasonable in size ; and can accommodate a queen-size bed minimally . Lastly , both bathrooms come with ventilation windows for natural ventilation . <p> On a less positive note , units here come with bay windows in the dining , bedrooms , bathrooms , and even the bedroom walkway ! This takes up a lot of the internal space and if you 've been looking for developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the 2000s through the early 2010s . Overall , with the sheer unit size and squarish layout , it can cater to most family own stay profiles . <h> Nin Residences : <h> Layout analysis : <p> For a relatively new development , the three bedder units here are considered quite spacious and well laid out . At 1,238 sq ft , it ticks a lot of boxes , especially for a family own stay unit . <p> The unit opens straight to a good size kitchen area with the provision of a wet &amp; dry kitchen ; a great set-up especially for those that love to entertain . <p> Plenty of cabinet space for storage but it comes with the expense of the lack of a proper yard area for laundry and an oddly placed washer area right next to the household shelter doorway . <p> However , we do like the in-unit household shelter here which could be used for storage or a helper 's room . Moving further into the unit , it offers a wide living area that could potentially fit in a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining area as it is bounded by the foyer and the entry into the hallway leading to the bedrooms . <p> We do also like the neatly tucked storage cabinet along the bedroom walkway ; extra storage space is always a huge plus for families . <p> Bedrooms here are decent in size while the master bedrooms are spacious in size , especially for a relatively new development . <p> We do like the addition of a walk-in wardrobe here and the two extra window panels are a great welcome to see ; which allows for more natural light and ventilation into the bedroom . Plus having a little balcony is also a rare perk to find . Lastly , both bathrooms and kitchen area come with windows which is great for natural ventilation . <h> Bartley Residences : <h> Layout analysis : <p> At 1,098 sq ft , this is the smallest among the three bedders mentioned here . <p> The unit opens to a foyer area with a wall that provides some form of privacy . Similar to One Leicester , the layout comes with a horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit though we must say the living and dining area is on the smaller side . <p> The unit comes with a decent-sized kitchen with an L-shaped configuration ; this allows for a little more cabinet space . In addition , it comes with a proper yard area for laundry . <p> As mentioned earlier , the in-unit household shelter is a plus for storage space or to accommodate a helper 's room . Additionally , we do like the provision of a jack &amp; jill common bathroom here ; as it is efficient and effectively makes one of the bedrooms an " ensuite " . Lastly , both bathrooms and kitchen come with ventilation window panels which is great for natural ventilation . <p> On the downside , while the master bedroom is of a good size with a small balcony ( although it looks too small to be really useful ) , the common bedrooms here are on the smaller side . <p> We are uncertain about the exact area but a comfortable size common bedroom should at least be able to accommodate a queen-size bed minimally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side when it comes to a future exit plan . <h> Future potential : <p> The Boon Keng area has seen quite a few BTO launches in the past few years and we do foresee future upgrader 's demand for resale options in the vicinity . <p> Similarly over at Bidadari Estate , with 12 BTO projects , four of which were completed have made the area more lively with more amenities added into the area including The Woodleigh Mall . <p> This indirectly puts Nin Residences and Bartley Residences with an upper hand when it comes to convenience to amenities as both developments are located closer to the new estate . Nin Residences would cater to family own stay profiles that prefer to be in a smaller community yet are within walking distance to amenities over at Potong Pasir side . <p> Additionally , with over 7,800 BTO units in the area , upgraders demand that prefer to stay in the same locality may likely pick the condos in the Bartley/Potong Pasir region , especially with Nin Residences located within the 1 km range to St Andrew Junior School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stella High School ; which will likely attract an upgrader family profile when it comes to future exit . <p> Hence it boils down to layout efficiency as most family profiles would still prefer a spacious and efficient unit size to take the leap from their BTO flats to a private property . <h> Conclusion : <p> The most important thing to identify for a property purchase is the motivation for doing so . And because you 've already highlighted that the proximity to a primary school is the most important criteria , that should form the basis for you to make your decision on which is the most ideal development for you and your family . <p> As such given the options that you have picked out , it is quite clear that City Square Residences would be the first to go , given that it does n't quite fulfil the school option for you . Not to mention , your budget is only able to purchase a two-bedroom unit here is a major downside as no yard , utility room , or third bedroom for future proof if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so while it ticks the boxes for convenience to amenities and the MRT station , the rest of the package really does n't fit your requirements . <p> Many upgraders sometimes forget to think about the practical aspects , and switching costs . Moving from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom in the future can be a lot more troublesome than you think , both in the aspects of time and stress . <p> Personally , out of the three-bedroom options , we would pick Nin Residences for the newer facilities , lower unit count , and proximity to St Andrew 's Junior School and CBD . Additionally , Nin Residences stands to benefit with walkable distance to both Potong Pasir and the newer Bidadari estate , and this leaves you with tons of options when it comes to basic needs/amenities . <p> To be honest , a ten-year timeline is a long period of time hence a development that is within walking distance to amenities , transportation links , and school ( covering the basics ) is always going to be a safer bet . <p> Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road which could be a disturbance to your kid 's sleep in the afternoon ( so be careful which stack you pick ) . We understand your concern about competition from neighbouring projects when it comes to future exit , but with the Bidadari estate nearby you do have a large pool of HDB upgraders to support the prices in the future . <p> nid:580434 <p> To be fair , Potong Pasir/Woodleigh and Bartley area are pretty much built up and the developments in the area are a mixture of various development types from small boutique developments to full-fledge condominiums with a full range of facilities hence catering to different groups of buyers . <p> Nin Residences in this case offers convenience to public transportations and amenities across two neighbourhoods , plus with two primary schools options within 1 km proximity namely , St Andrew 's Junior School and Cedar Primary school - it fulfills your main criteria here . <p> Bartley Residences will be our second pick for proximity to Maris Stella High school and relatively decent facilities offerings but on the other note , unit sizes are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smaller living , dining , and common bedrooms which may be a huge drawback , especially among family own stay profiles . <p> Do take note that most of the three bedder stacks here face the main road and BTO construction hence noise would be the major issue here . Although to be fair , with the completion of the BTO project and The Woodleigh Mall , the area will see more amenities added into the area . <p> One Leicester for a smaller community with decent facilities offerings added with freehold status ; which is great for value retention in the long term . However , do be mindful of the maintenance fees due to its lower number of units here and the upkeep cost over the years . Additionally , units here come with lots of bay windows which take up space . <p> Kerrisdale , is the oldest development among all and we are wary of the lease and upkeep cost in the long run since you are looking at a beyond ten years exit plan . <p> With this , we hope that this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@92182236 <p> After 30 years and six blockbuster films , Steven Spielberg 's Jurassic Park franchise changed the dinosaur game for audiences around the world , placing bigger expectations from viewers who want larger than life creatures on screen . How the prehistoric creatures look , move , and behave have been shaped by Hollywood , so imagine how much more realistic a documentary on these creatures have to be . <p> Actually , forget imagining , just catch Prehistoric Planet on Apple TV+ . Prehistoric Planet is the streamer 's latest documentary that unveils the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth in an immersive experience . Running the show is Tim Walker , who has Mike Gunton and Jon Favreau as his executive producers . <p> Advertisement ? <p> " If you 're going to be authentic , about as if you are actually filming these animals for real , you have to replicate that . I think that when you see the images in the show , they feel as if they were filmed by real people in real-world environments , " assured Walker in a press conference that Geek Culture attended . <p> Gunton , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker with his past experiences producing for National Geographic and Favreau , for his CGI-magic on Disney 's most beloved franchises including Marvel Studios and Star Wars , bring a bit of movie making magic to the series , as Prehistoric Planet fuses science , CGI and real-world filmmaking to bring the dinosaurs to life in the most realistic way possible . . <p> " Jurassic Park , you know , the first , and still for my money , one of the best utilizations of CGI ! When Spielberg had originally done it , they were dealing with scales and skin and that took everything that they had from a processing perspective , " said Favreau . " Well , now we can do fur . We can do feathers . There 's so much more that 's available to us just from a feasibility standpoint that really , the research and our imaginations are the only limitations now . " <p> Lending experience from making Jungle Book and The Lion King , Favreau shared how he worked with effects house MPC ( Ghostbusters : Afterlife , Spider-Man : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolls that allowed him to emulate what it would be like to film real animals using real camera equipment , and translate that onto a screen . <p> When making The Lion King , Favreau barely left the studio and was able to render all of the images and create them in a photo-realistic way thanks to all of the groundbreaking technology developed . This was later applied when making Prehistoric Planet . <p> " Instead of having animals that were doing scenes together or singing together , we were actually trying to fool the audience into believing that they had a privileged view into the past , to be able to be a fly on the wall as these creatures just behaved in a naturalistic way , " continued Favreau . <p> " And that 's the goal , right ? The goal is to make it look like we just had a camera , we went back there . " <p> The makers of Prehistoric Planet also involved palaeontologist Darren Naish , an expert in dinosaurs and other animals of the time , in the process . Whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentaries , Naish did more than that and served as a live-in expert who was heavily involved and embedded in the documentary making process . <p> " Ordinarily , experts are consulted kind of on an ad-hoc basis . They 're used here and there . I had very deep involvement in all appropriate steps of this project . I think that really has made quite the difference , " said the palaeontologist . <p> " I think it was important to have that involvement . And as a consequence , you 're seeing as best as possible an up-to-the-minute , cutting-edge portrayal of our scientific understanding of these animals for the first time ever . " <p> So what exactly can audiences expect from Prehistoric Planet ? For starters , the docuseries will be narrated by the brilliant David Attenborough , a voice well-known for narrating the likes of Our Planet , Planet Earth and The Green Planet among many others . Viewers will be taken on an educational and captivating journey as the renowned biologist and natural historian narrates all five episodes , each episode focusing on various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look forward to include the Tyrannosaurus Rex , Triceratops , Velociraptor and the Deinocheirus amongst many others . <p> And just like Planet Earth , Prehistoric Planet delves into the various habitats these creatures live in . This is because the creators believe that a creature 's habitat is just as important as the animal itself as it gives real insight into the way said animal behaves and interacts with their world around them . <p> " Each episode looks at a different habitat of that time . You look for the animals that most represent the challenges that those environments provide . But also , you also have a little bit of a matrix . You look for the big powerful one , you look for the hunting story , look for the mating sequence , you look for the slightly comedic one , because animals are always funny . They 're funny today , and I 'm sure they were funny 66 million years ago , " said Gunton . <p> " So , there 's quite a detailed tapestry that you try and weave different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly rich time in the earth 's history , the number of animals was enormous . It was a golden age of animals . " <p> Although it was the golden age of animals , the series mainly focused on the Cretaceous period , particularly the Maastrichtian period . This is simply because the period of time holds the most interesting dinosaurs , as well as household names like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops . According to Naish , this period was also the best-preserved period , meaning that the series is as accurate and extensive with its information . <p> " It 's the youngest part of not just the Cretaceous but of the whole age of dinosaurs , the Mesozoic era . It 's also the bit for which we have the most amount of information . It 's the bit that 's best-preserved in the fossil record , " justified Naish . <p> " You do n't just have the animals themselves well-represented but their environments are better known . The animals and plants that they lived with are better known . So , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real environments realistically as we 've done , you kinda have to start with the Maastrichtian . " <p> Despite having the best on the team and a treasure cove of hard-earned evidence at their disposal , making Prehistoric Planet did come with challenges too . The biggest challenges the team faced were getting the animated animals look realistic , as well as apply what they know to real situations . <p> Unlike many other documentaries on animals where creators could easily shoot and record with a camera pointed at the creature , the animals featured in Prehistoric Planet no longer exist . The animators had to not only reimagine , but also reconstruct some of the creatures based on the current evidence presented . <p> For example , the giant long-necked Sauropod dinosaurs may not just use their necks as a structure to increase their reach and give them a bigger range of feeding area -- it could also be used as a structural display . As seen in the evidence collated , the Sauropods were pneumatic and had inflatable air sacs distributed throughout their bodies . Understanding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team intellectually but thankfully , the creators got around it by learning from similar animals that do exist . In this case , birds . <p> " Birds , which are a group of living dinosaurs , have these inflatable air sacs , as well . So if you have a giant neck that could well be used in display , and if you have this inflatable air sac system , does it mean that some of these animals might have had frigate bird style actual inflatable balloon-type structures on their neck ? " pondered Naish . <p> " So we show one species of sauropod , the Argentinian Dreadnoughtus battling for mating rights , females evaluating the males based on how good their display is , and we show them doing this remarkable display . And that is an example of something that fringes , ' This is a genuine possibility that this could have been a thing ' , and getting it right was a real challenge . " <p> Despite the challenges it posed , the team felt like now , more than ever , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With global warming and the deterioration of natural habitats , Earth and nature are getting more and more fragile . With Earth vulnerable , the interest in her history , at least according to showrunner Walker and Gunton , has increased . And what 's a bigger part of Earth 's history other than the dinosaurs that roamed 66 million years ago ? <p> " I think that 's growing enormously . I 've been doing this for over 30 years , and I 've never been busier in my life making wildlife shows because there seems to be a global appreciation and understanding and interest in both the wonders of the planet , but also its fragility and just another perspective on the planet . One that , you know , is historical , but still shows the wonder and how extraordinary this place is that we live on . I just think that 's another reason why it 's the right time to do this , " said Gunton . <p> Walker concludes , " We often got quite emotional whilst making it . Thinking of the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer here in that glory . You know , as Mike says , the fragility of the natural world is on everybody 's minds at the moment and it 's been a fragile place for a long time .

@@92444233 <h> " HR has a crucial role to play in providing different insights to different stakeholders , and in order to do so , they need to keep abreast of what 's happening and stay in tune with the business , " Olivia Chua says . <p> To reach where she is today was not by sheer luck , but by pure grit , grind , and ( a lot of ) planning . When Chua graduated from university , she already had the experience of eight jobs -- across industries such as F&amp;B , retail , and sales &amp; marketing -- in her portfolio , credit to stepping into the corporate world at the age of 15 . <p> Her next step of personal ( and professional ) growth was then to " join a firm where I could learn how to be a professional " . <p> " I sought to learn the ethics around being a young professional and learning how to conduct myself , " Chua tells Lester Tan . " My thinking was that this would open a lot of doors for me . So , I applied for jobs at major multinational companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> With that , Chua landed a role with Accenture , and was placed in-charge to take care of graduate recruitment for Asia -- which kickstarted her journey in the human resources space . <p> " This is where I got to travel to different countries , like the UK , Hong Kong , and the Philippines , so I got a lot of exposure even in a junior role . This was something I treasured greatly at the start of my career , and it sparked my interest in going deeper into human resources , " she shares . <p> Subsequently , Chua secured positions at Korn Ferry , the Sunway Group , and WTW -- where she managed to learn the fundamentals of HR and development -- before settling down at Jebsen &amp; Jessen Group . <p> " To anyone contemplating making a change , I would strongly encourage to plan first . Planning helps to reduce risk and make changes more palatable . Also , do n't be afraid to fail , know that everything that happens is part of the learning process and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Continue the conversation below as Chua dives into her HR life and responsibilities such as the hardest decision she had to make as a leader , the specific projects that she and the management work closely on , and more . <p> Q What was the most innovative HR campaign that you 've worked on , and what was your biggest learning from that ? <p> In my first corporate role , at Sunway , organisational development ( OD ) was not very well-known in Malaysia at that time , and Sunway was one of the first to introduce OD , so I was kind of a pioneer in that space as I helped to set it up . <p> Beyond talent management , succession planning , etc. , I went deeper into designing systems . I am not an IT person but I designed the workflows and worked with the IT people to do the programming . I do n't like admin work and am always looking for ways to shorten the process or time taken to do something , and since the company wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , I would say this is the most innovative project I 've worked on . <p> When I started moving from consulting to corporate , I found that many HR people are afraid of changes and are stuck in routine work . The problem is , when we are so used to routine , we tend not to want to change , even if there are improvements that can be made . What I learned during the OD project I mentioned was that because the system was completely new , it made the change management easier . Moreover , I discovered how important it is to offer support ; to sit down and share the load with HR team members . This is where you can really spark some innovation and get people excited about changes . <p> My message is similar to the one I mentioned previously : do n't be scared of changes or of failures , remember you are not alone , and that the journey is more important than the outcome . <p> Q On the other hand , what is the hardest decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Personally , the hardest decision I 've had to make was to leave a company because I could not condone their ethics . I 've had to do this twice in my lifetime so far . The first time I was only in my 20s and I spoke up to the owner . I felt there was discrimination happening , which I decided to speak up against and I was prepared for the consequences . I did n't get fired but I decided to resign . I felt an immense relief after doing so . <p> Some people may think : why do n't just leave as you know nothing is going to change , but I do n't believe in that . If everyone believes in this , then nothing in the world will change . And I did this for my own conscience and that 's good enough . <p> Q How closely do you work with the CEO , and what are the specific projects that both of you work closely on ? <p> I would say that on most projects I work independently . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessen , and the Chairman and Group CEO on the executive board are a great sounding board . <p> If there is a significant project on which we can both bring different things to the table then we work very closely . For example , we were working together on a management excellence programme . The topic was on managing the employee lifecycle and corporate governance , so this is where Per Magnusson , the Group CEO gave a lot of input and it was very enjoyable working on it together . <p> Another current example is designing and implementing flexible work arrangements now that we are coming out of the pandemic . It is a complex issue which will impact the way we work and may gradually change the culture of the organisation if we are not careful , so it makes sense to work very closely with the executive board to ensure we find the best solution . <p> Q Who is the one person who has inspired you the most in your career , and why ? <p> Larry Yap , the Executive Director while I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was my first corporate leader who is also a business leader . I was very inspired by his management style ; he was all about brainstorming , finding new ideas and making us feel like nothing was impossible . He saw possibilities rather than problems . <p> Q How would you describe your leadership style , and how has it worked out for you so far ? <p> I have tried different styles , but most people would say that I am democratic . I also make sure I delegate well , but I also believe you need to provide a lot of support while delegating . As you move up the ladder , you come to a realisation that you can not achieve things on your own , especially when expectations become higher , and you can only do this through managing others . I admit there are times where I am more autocratic , in situations where I feel urgent decisions need to be made and instructions need to be clear . <p> Q With today 's rapidly evolving environment , what do you believe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would say being an advisor or business partner . HR people are important advisors in the areas of structure , employee development , employee engagement and retention , talent attraction etc . People are really the greatest asset to any company . So , beyond the administrative part , I 've seen how much value and insights HR can add in other areas of interest for stakeholders ; they are often great listeners and can provide a different perspective . <p> For instance , during the pandemic , we saw how many people struggled to cope with the situation . It became a struggle for managers to navigate , and this is where HR came in to provide them with different ways of managing these challenges on employees . <p> Q Is there a mentality that you believe HR professionals should do away with ? And what should they replace it with ? <p> The mentality of HR professionals who believe they have nothing to say and their strength is only in admin work . What they can do instead is ask " how can I understand this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals are typically the ones organising the trainings , but they often forget about their own development . <p> Like I mentioned earlier , HR has a crucial role to play in providing different insights to different stakeholders , and in order to do so , they need to keep abreast of what 's happening and stay in tune with the business . <p> Q Before we conclude the interview , we 'd like to ask : since Jebsen &amp; Jessen always finds its way in a changing world , let 's bring this to the HR context -- what 's the one thing you wish to see invested in HR 's future to ensure it will be more impactful to guiding the business function , talents , and the workplace towards their " true north " , and why ? <p> I would love to see investment in HR systems to make them more automated ; to allow more time to be spent on business partnering . Manager and employee self-service became even more apparent during the lockdown where workflows and approval process could be further automated . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over conversations ; this is where HR plays an important role to bridge that gap as conversations and connection will always be more crucial to human engagement . <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

For one couple , they went the distance for their feathery pets -- they hired Goy Architects to build a dream home for their prized Silkie chickens in a style that would complement the modern design of their home in Singapore . <p> The house , which was designed and realised by Ipli Architects , features a minimalist concrete facade with sleek black details and ample use of wood to create a cosy and homely setting . When the clients asked to build an extension for their pets , the firm referred the owner to Goy Zhenru , founder of Goy Architects . <p> Above The main residence designed by Ipli Architects ( Image courtesy of Ipli Architects ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a modern house with timber characteristics , which faces the park , is surrounded by mature trees , and is a green space that 's elevated above road level , " shares Goy , commenting on the site . <p> Adds Goy : " The clients are a doctor and a ceramics enthusiast who both have a keen interest in physical and mental wellness . The wife likes to be in nature , and has a soft spot for animals -- it 's just a very cosy , naturalistic space that they 're living in . " <p> The family lives with a mini menagerie of animals that they have adopted over the years : a dog , a clowder of cats , a brood of chickens , and a tortoise . The commission started with a " catio " ( a portmanteau of a patio designed for a cat ) that was created when one of the felines could not get along with the rest and had to have its own area separated from the other cats . <p> Above The catio is attached to the facade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external stimulation to the cat <p> Above The catio features a metal screen with three-dimensional leaf-shaped motifs , made and spray painted by Indonesian sculptors . It also features a little walkway with outdoor timber flooring to create a space that 's durable in all weather conditions <p> Pleased with the outcome of that earlier catio commission , the owners then enlisted Goy Architects to design a cosy hut for their chickens . This space had to be future-proofed so that it be converted into the wife 's ceramic studio in the future after the chickens pass on . It also incorporates storage for gardening tools at the back and had to be comfortably sized for the client to move around to tend to her pets . Additionally , the owner was clear that she wanted as much natural light as possible in the shed , and for it to provide shelter from the rain for the chickens . <p> " She wanted to make the structure very light and translucent , so we needed to think about ways to achieve this ; we used chicken netting to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reflects the materials of the timber construction of the house itself , " shares Goy .

A pebbled-wash platform was constructed so that the chickens could rest on it in case of wet weather . The floor of the shed had to be close to the ground level , and lined with tree barks and sawdust . The firm also created ladders that the chickens could use their claws to perch onto . Additionally , a sink was installed in the coop that the owners could use after handling and caring for their pets . <p> Above A view of the chicken shed designed by Goy Architects <p> Above The free roaming fowl often wander around the property <p> The unusual commission had to accommodate other unique needs of chicken rearing , which Goy familiarised herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake that we made was that the proportion of the shed should be even smaller .

@@92623236 <h> A Pink Pandemic Recovery Plan <p> The Pink Pandemic has taken an incredible toll around the world . According to the World Economic Forum 's Global Gender Gap Report , at our current trajectory , East Asia and the Pacific ( including A/NZ ) will take another 168 years to close the gender gap -- which means we will not see gender parity in our lifetimes . <p> We 've identified four paths to recovery . These include female empowerment , effective allyship , organisational support , and societal responsibility . Each can work together to advance women in the workplace and help regain the ground women have lost to the pandemic . <p> Regaining power and influence <p> For all women , whether currently in the workforce or not , it 's important to keep skills and mindsets agile , transferable , and relevant . This can be accomplished through connection , competency , and community . <p> Perhaps the most important thing women can do now is develop meaningful connections . Support systems are more vital now than ever before . Yours might include mentors , sponsors , friends , or family members who have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's also essential for women to retain and develop new competencies . How can your strengths , abilities , and mindset help you down the road ? Today , every company is a technology company , so think about how new skills might help set you up for success . Embrace a growth mindset to build confidence and competence in the face of change . <p> Women can also use this time to engage in non-work leadership . Volunteering for a non-profit or within a community is a great way to develop leadership skills and build relationships with others . And those same leadership skills can be transferred to a work environment . <p> Empowering through advocacy <p> The second path is allyship . Allies may be male peers , women , or non-binary individuals in a position of power to advocate for women . We all must engage in " intentional allyship " to enact real change . <p> So , where do we focus as allies ? There are three primary areas : awareness , advocacy , and action . <p> As an ally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand any implicit or unconscious biases you may have . <p> Allies must use their voice to advocate and influence others on behalf of women . Experienced allies should sponsor women and speak up against misconceptions and negative micro-behaviours . Avoid bystander syndrome and focus on intentional enablement . <p> Finally , there 's action . Allies must not only " talk the talk " but also " walk the walk . " To promote genuine change as an ally , we must be active , not passive . Host women 's gatherings , volunteer at or donate to organisations that support women and girls , be relentless in the pursuit of justice and equality , and for those fortunate to be in a leadership position and have a seat at the table , use your voice to advocate on behalf of other women who can not . <p> Supporting female talent <p> Organisations have a dual responsibility : an obligation to develop an immediate response to the " pink pandemic " and a need to focus on long-term , sustainable solutions for women 's development and advancement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nearly 50 per cent higher when women are well represented at the top . <p> Organisations should focus on three key areas : empowerment , enablement , and engagement . <p> Empowerment ensures the advancement of women in the workforce . As an organisational leader , you must apply conscious empowerment to ensure that power structures enable diversity without diminishing it . <p> We also need organisations to enable women by investing heavily in upskilling , reskilling , and developing women in the workplace . <p> Finally , organisations need to remain engaged with their present and future female employees . They must review employee benefits and strengthen the resources necessary for women , like healthcare , wellness , maternity leaves , flexible schedules , and support for childcare and eldercare . <p> Giving women an equal say <p> Whether the goal is to address the Pink Pandemic 's repercussions or attain equity and equality for the world 's women in the future , society has a responsibility to roughly half its constituents to level the field . We can do so by focusing on three key elements : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with granting women the status they deserve in society . This achieves two important goals . It elevates women and puts them on equal footing with men , opening more opportunities and ensuring women have a voice when decisions are made . And it raises the status of women 's issues so they can not be ignored or pushed aside . <p> Society needs to support women with educational and employment opportunities that match those afforded to men . Their equal rights in all endeavours must be granted -- and protected -- by law . <p> And advances for women must be permanent and sustainable , so that future generations of girls and women can move on from the struggles of their mothers and grandmothers . <p> Reversing the Pink Pandemic <p> Women , allies , organisations , and societies must unite to reverse the Pink Pandemic . We must first recognise the current challenge and then formulate and carry out meaningful plans to enact real change . The power rests in our alignment with each other . <p> Today 's widening workforce gender gap will not resolve itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legacy -- gender biases . <p> It 's important to point out that women are n't the only ones who benefit from improving gender equality .

By the end of the millennium , Hong Kong filmmakers were feeling desperate , wondering whether the city 's film industry could survive . <p> The 2002 production Internal Affairs , co-directed by Andrew Lau Wai Keung and Alan Mak Siu Fai , marked a concerted effort to entice viewers back to locally made films and , although its effects were short-lived , it did provide a big boost to Hong Kong 's film industry . <p> The movie was remade by Martin Scorsese as The Departed , an all-star Hollywood crime drama which was named best picture at the 2007 Academy Awards . <p> " It is rare these days for Hongkongers to stand in line for any movie -- let alone a local production -- and it is heartening to see that a hunger for Cantonese-language cinema still exists , " wrote Post critic Paul Fonoroff on the film 's release . <p> The film 's 20th anniversary is being celebrated in a retrospective at this year 's Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequels . All three films have been restored in 4K . <p> Infernal Affairs is more of a drama than a police actioner , and the action scenes are sparse and short . <p> The story revolves around a triad member ( Andy Lau Tak Wah ) who infiltrates the Criminal Investigation Bureau , and a police officer ( Tony Leung Chiu Wai ) who simultaneously goes undercover in his triad gang . <p> The police are led by Anthony Wong Chau Sang , who was then a regular in crime films , while Eric Tsang Chi Wai plays the gang boss . <p> Conflict ensues as both sides try to outwit each other to discover their respective moles . The twist is that Andy Lau 's character ultimately decides he likes life on the right side of the law , and is happy to kill anyone to keep his secret and remain a police officer . <p> Internal Affairs slick production values were far ahead of the local competition at the time , the casting was terrific , and there was a freshness in the way the film broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hong Kong-based consultant for Italy 's Udine Far East Film Festival . <p> " The film fitted in with a tradition of undercover police officer and identity-switch stories which went back to films like Alex Cheung Kwok-ming 's 1981 film Man on the Brink , which also explored the psychological pain and identity crisis of a mole . <p> " But Internal Affair pushed harder by having multiple plants entrenched on both sides of the law , and it dropped the regular police-officer-film fights and chases in favour of intimate , character-driven drama and slow-building tension , " says Youngs . <p> " It drew on triad cinema too , but avoided clich ? d scenes of gang war and posturing young thugs . " <p> Much of the success of the film came from having a strong script in place before shooting , something which had fallen out of favour amid the quick-fire production schedules of the late 1980s and early 1990s . <p> Co-director Mak wrote the original script with Felix Chong Man Keung , and then persuaded Andrew Lau -- a long-time cinematographer and director who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendy triad " Young and Dangerous series - to direct . <p> Mak has said that he was inspired by John Woo 's Hollywood film Face/Off in which the hero has his face surgically altered to resemble that of his murderous quarry . Mak liked the idea of an identity swap , but thought the surgery part of Woo 's film was unrealistic . The idea set his imagination racing , and Internal Affairs was the result . <p> The casting was a big draw when the film opened in Hong Kong , and the filmmakers had cleverly covered all the bases with their choices . Not only did the film feature Andy Lau and Tony Leung , but their characters ' younger selves were played by teen idols Edison Chen Koon Hei and Shawn Yue Man Lok . <p> Pop icons Sammi Cheng Sau Man and Kelly Chen Wai Lam had supporting roles , as did Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao , in a " particularly inconsequential part that would best have been left on the cutting room floor " , the Post noted . <p> Andrew Lau let Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the hero , and they both chose the opposite of what he expected , although he went with their decisions . <p> " My responsibility in Internal Affairs is the commercial element , " a modest Andy Lau said in an interview , " while Tony is there to provide the artistic element . " <p> " Their characters are well drawn and distinctive , playing off each other smoothly while both tackling inner turmoil , " says Youngs . " There 's a great deal of emotional complexity , and Lau and Leung both pull it off . Lau is cold and sinister , while Leung has warmth and melancholy , especially in some great scenes with Anthony Wong , Eric Tsang and Kelly Chen . " <p> There is a Buddhist backdrop to the storyline which is sometimes lost in translation . The Chinese title translates as Continuous Path , and the film 's final quote refers to avinci or " continuous hell " , one of the many Buddhist iterations of hell . <p> " It is the worst part of hell . Those who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great suffering , " said Andy Lau , who is a Buddhist . The relation of the title to the film is oblique , either referring to the life of deception the characters lead on earth , or to their punishment in the afterlife . <p> The film cost HK$40 million ( S$7.1 million ) , and was a popular , critical and financial success , taking HK$43.7 million in 19 days at the local box office and winning seven prizes at the 2003 Hong Kong Film Awards , including best picture , best director and best screenplay . The film also pulled in around US$1.5 million for Hollywood 's remake rights . <p> Internal affairs had top stars , arrived with a huge marketing push , and maintained consistently high-quality production values that competed with Hollywood fare . It scored incredibly positive word of mouth . Catching the film became a point of Hong Kong pride , " says Youngs . <p> " The burst of audience support carried Internal Affairs II and III the next year , after the Sars crisis ended , " he adds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as inferior . <p> " If filmmakers wanted the budget to match Internal Affairs ' star power and pricey production standards , they increasingly looked to reach cinemas across the border through Hong Kong-mainland co-production .

Task force members inspect the stage set-up in question at the Hong Kong Coliseum . <p> South China Morning Post <p> The tragic accident at a concert of Canto-pop boy band Mirror last month that left a dancer critically injured has prompted questions about welfare of performers in Hong Kong 's entertainment industry . <p> " Many dancers are afraid to speak up because they fear being labelled ' troublemakers ' and losing job opportunities , " said Alan Wong Sui-lun , 36 , a professional dancer and choreographer with 15 years ' experience . <p> He was one of the first in the industry to go on social media after the July 28 accident , saying performers needed better labour protection . <p> Dancer Mo Li Ka-yin , 27 , suffered spinal cord injuries and has been in intensive care after a four-by-four-metre overhead video monitor weighing 560kg came loose and crashed onto the stage during the concert . <p> Telecoms firm PCCW , which owns MakerVille , one of the organisers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire medical bill for Li , who faces the prospect of being paralysed from the neck down . <p> But others in the industry said performers were mostly on their own if they were injured on the job , because of their loose terms of employment . <p> Professional dancer Franco Chu Kai-sing , 34 , recalled being too afraid to make a fuss after being injured while rehearsing for a 2011 concert by actor and Canto-pop singer Leon Lai Ming . <p> He said an elevating platform had been lowered from the stage for repair , leaving a gap . With his vision partially blocked by the mask that was part of his costume , he fell and was left with a painful , palm-sized bruise on his lower left abdomen . <p> The event organiser took him to hospital immediately and promised to cover his medical expenses , but said nothing about whether he would be paid if he needed time to rest . <p> Afraid to lose the job , at his first concert performance he took painkillers and concealed the bruise with make-up and went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that if I chose not to perform , I would not be paid , " said Chu , who has been dancing for 11 years . " I might have considered resting if there was a dancers ' organisation that provided financial support after the injury . " <p> Wong and Chu said dancers were paid for rehearsals and shows and , like other gig economy workers , did not get benefits or protection . <p> Chu said the going rate for dancers with major roles was around HK$100 ( US$13 ) per hour for rehearsals and HK$2,800 ( S$496.64 ) per show . Those in minor roles get half the rehearsal rate , and HK$2,000 to HK$2,500 per show . <p> He said it was a struggle to make ends meet when he worked solely as a dancer early in his career , and he had to teach dancing , take up choreography and accept a post at a dance school to earn more . <p> " Our job is very unstable , we do not know for sure when our next performance will be . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our payments , " he said . <p> He added that production companies frequently took advantage of passionate newcomers willing to work for less pay . <p> " Even though concerts nowadays have fewer shows , live streaming also contributes a major part of ticketing revenue . The salary of dancers should be adjusted accordingly instead of sticking to the same old standard that has not kept up with inflation , " Chan said . <p> He said the lack of industry codes made it difficult for dancers ' pay to be regulated , and they lacked labour protection because of the absence of official contracts . <p> Fay Siu Sin-man , chief executive of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims , an NGO that helps workplace accident victims fight for their rights , said dancers were at a great disadvantage if they were injured at work . <p> Most were hired by choreographers or production companies with only self-employment contracts , or service or verbal agreements . <p> " Concert dancers do not have control over their working hours , they are provided costumes and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that they are actually employed by production companies and are not self-employed , " Siu said . <p> She added that firms bore less labour costs and legal responsibility with self-employed workers and were not legally obliged to purchase employee 's compensation insurance for freelancers . <p> Under the Employees ' Compensation Ordinance , injured workers who are temporarily incapacitated can receive up to HK$370 a day for medical expenses and paid sick leave for up to two years . Those with permanent partial incapacity are entitled to additional compensation . <p> Lawyer Samuel Hung Wan-ki , a partner at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain , said setting up service contracts between freelance performers and production companies could provide better labour protection . <p> Having a contract that specified what insurance would be bought and who was expected to purchase it could help improve the coverage for these workers in case of injury on the job . <p> Dancer Chu said that apart from insurance coverage , the industry should introduce proper employment contracts that clearly stated the salary , time frame for payment and scope of work .

With the phenomenal growth of digitalisation - from the rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain , to new developments in open banking , businesses have what seems like endless opportunities at their feet . Despite this , Baker McKenzie 's digital transformation report revealed that 79% of executives in APAC still identify as digital laggards rather than digital leaders within their industry . <p> As organisations scramble to catch up with the latest technological developments , even straightforward digital upgrades can sometimes be too much for them to handle . For many incumbent institutions , there is the realisation that the need for speed and agility when implementing new products is very much at odds with their current capabilities . However , finding the right partners to accelerate the deployment of new technologies is challenging , and many have fallen victim to delayed , fragmented and even failed transformations .

Many incumbents have already started to see problems in their original core platforms that were architected well before the millennium . <p> From global leaders to smaller players who have built their platforms by integrating packages , it is not surprising that the current challenge is to keep up with the demand for customisations and integrations . For them , the direct solution is to modernise legacy systems .

Only with the right data strategy and analytic capabilities built into operations can organisations engage in iterative evolution of their digital offerings to tackle everyday problems . <p> Setting your infrastructure up for success <p> Legacy infrastructure is often another cause for concern due to the lack of expertise , outdated cost models , and overall ownership and maintenance risks .

This time , there will be a set of 3 that will form a mural when placed side by side . The next 2 tokens will be released in conjunction with future sets , so we 'll have to wait for the full artwork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but considering this is the 1st time transparent cards are being made for Magic : the Gathering , this could become a hot ticket collector 's item in the future .

These will likely be completely different cards , though some might have leftovers that they can give out .

Unlike the petrol 2008 , which has a more basic Allure Premium trim ( S$156,888 with COE ) and upper-spec GT version ( $164,888 with COE ) , the e-2008 comes in a singular GT trim variant . <p> CarBuyer reported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rundown of the specs and trim levels here the key fact is that the car has a 130hp electric motor driving the front wheels , and that makes it eligible for a less expensive Category A COE . <p> It 's also a small SUV , meaning it also consumes less energy and is eligible for a Vehicular Emissions Scheme ( VES ) rebate of $25,000 , and the early EV adoption rebate ( aka EEAI ) . That 's the reason why it only costs around $10k more than the petrol 2008 , which has a 129hp , 1.2-litre turbocharged engine . <p> Peugeot Singapore says that the first allocation of 30 cars was already sold out before the public launch . This indicates , at least , a good response to the car 's pricing strategy . A second shipment of the e-2008 is coming to Singapore in October , so if you want to buy one , best register your interest early . <p> Both cars are identical in overall dimensions , and the e-2008 's battery pack does not impinge on boot space , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally the electric version is more than 200kg heavier at 1,548kg . <h> Peugeot E-2008 vs Peugeot 2008 1.2 - Performance <p> Energy Type <p> Power Torque <p> 0-100km/h <p> Kerb Weight <p> Consumption <p> Peugeot 2008 1.2 <p> Petrol <p> 129hp 230Nm <p> 9.1s <p> 1,205kg <p> 5.1L/100km <p> Peugeot e-2008 <p> Electric <p> 130hp 260Nm <p> 10.1s <p> 1,548kg <p> 14.5kWh/100km <p> In charging and range terms , the e-2008 offers decent performance .

The car is capable of DC fast charging at up to 100kW , and plugged in at that power it will go from zero to 80 per cent in half an hour . <p> The launch of the e-2008 signifies another entry into the mainstream EV market for European brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through Korean and Chinese brands , with European EVs largely being driven by luxury European brands , including Audi , BMW , Porsche , and Mercedes-Benz . <p> Assuming energy/petrol prices remain stable , the e-2008 is slightly less expensive to run - $830 - per annum , than the petrol version , especially if you compare it to the GT spec petrol 2008 .

That car was only offered for fleet customers though , so it was n't truly for sale to the general public . <p> But the e-2008 already has a close competitor : German mainstream brand Opel just announced the debut of its own small , electric SUV , the Mokka-e , earlier this month .

And if you want to know more , stay tuned for the full review . <h> It looks and feels just like the iPhone 13 Pro <p> This should n't be surprising . Both have the same design , are made of the same materials ( glass and stainless steel ) , and have the same number of cameras . <p> If you pore over the spec sheets , you 'll find that the iPhone 14 Pro is slightly taller , thicker , and heavier , but you do n't really notice that in your hands . <p> Though some might be disappointed that Apple did n't do anything to make it look different and special , it , crucially , still feels and looks like a piece of quality gadgetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep Purple , you should know that it 's less bright that what the videos and press photos depict . Most times , it looks to me like grey but with a very slight purplish tinge ( just look at the photo above ) . <h> You need new phone cases <p> Despite being very similar in appearance , you will need new phone cases for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because the slight size differences are reason enough for old cases not to fit the new phones . <p> Furthermore , Apple has oh-so-slightly moved the positions of the buttons . <p> You wo n't notice just by looking , but they are quite obvious if you place an iPhone 14 Pro next to an iPhone 13 Pro and examine them closely . <h> It 's fast <p> The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are the only phones to get a new chip , the A16 Bionic . <p> It 's built using a 4nm process ; has around 16 billion transistors ; and although Apple did n't say how much faster it was compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent faster than the competition . <h> The always-on display is nice to have <p> Only Apple will know why it took so long to implement this technology in their iPhones because many Android phones have had it for years . <p> At any rate , it 's much welcomed because you can now glance at the phone to quickly look up certain information ( weather , calendar , messages , and more ) without having to power up the phone . <p> That said , I do wonder if it is n't possible to bring this tech to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus . It ca n't be that complicated , can it ? <h> The 48MP main camera takes nice photos <p> There 's no doubt that the new 48-megapixel main wide camera is one of the biggest updates to the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro Max . <p> The new sensor is 65 per cent larger which means it 'll capture more light -- though at the cost of smaller pixels . <p> However , it 's using pixel-binning techniques to get around this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro users , however , can opt to shoot photos in full 48-megapixel resolution using ProRAW . <p> In my limited time with the camera thus far , it seems to take really nice photos . <p> That said , I need to test it further to ascertain just how much better the new 48-megapixel camera is . Because in well-lit situations ( like the photo below ) , I do n't really see a big jump in photo quality . <p> Take a look at the sample photo . <h> The ultra wide camera is also much improved <p> The ultra wide camera did n't get much attention which is a pity because this year 's unit is much improved . <p> According to Apple it has a new sensor that 's nearly twice the size and has 100 per cent Focus Pixels . This means it can focus better in low-light scenarios and can capture more light . <p> And together with the new Photonic Engine , Apple claims it can deliver up to three times better low-light photos , which should be very handy when taking macro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality in the ultra wide camera is more noticeable than that of the main wide camera . <p> Take a look at the sample photo below and see how much detail is captured .

As for a release date , all that we know right now is that Mirage will arrive sometime in 2023 . <h> Assassin 's Creed Infinity , Codename Red ( and Codename Hexe ) <p> Now , Mirage might be easy enough to understand since it 's simply another mainline entry , but where things get confusing is when Assassin 's Creed Infinity comes into play . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't consider Infinity as a game per se , but rather as a conceptual stem - one that Ubisoft is using to complement and support subsequent titles like Codename Red and Codename Hexe . <p> In other words , it is functionally going to be what the Battle.net launcher is to Activision Blizzard titles - a central hub of sorts , albeit one that will also offer an independent , refreshed Multiplayer experience for players to enjoy . <p> As such , the aforementioned Codename Red , which is set in feudal Japan , and Codename Hexe , which supposedly explores the use of witchcraft in 16th Century England , will both branch out from this " hub " as full-length games of their own . <p> Unfortunately , we 're still in the dark about when they intend to drop any of these three titles , though the presence of Mirage in 2023 suggests that they 're scheduled for release in 2024 and beyond . <h> Assassin 's Creed : Codename Jade <p> Although Jade does share the Codename tag with Red and Hexe respectively , it is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to worry about how this one fits into the development pipeline . After all , it 's not like we have a release window to work with in the first place . <p> Set in China in 215 BC , players will reportedly have lots of freedom to customise the appearance of their Assassin , though there 's not much we can glean from the trailer regarding gameplay . I will admit that it looks quite good for a mobile title , though , so this one might be worth a shot when it does actually show up .

@@93568238 <h> Apple Watch Series 8 review : How do you make the best smartwatch better ? <p> Apple unveiled the new Apple Watch Series 8 last week . But before we start the review , let 's recap the history of the Apple Watch a little to understand what we are looking at . <p> The Apple Watch has been with us for seven years now . And for the past couple of years , it received only incremental updates . Last year 's model brought about a larger display and slightly tweaked cases , while the year before saw the introduction of the blood oxygen level sensor , a brighter display , and a faster processor . <p> In fact , you have to go back to Series 4 in 2018 when the Apple Watch was thoroughly revamped . Series 4 had a new case , a larger display , a faster processor , a new wireless chip , louder speakers , and it was the first Apple Watch that was able to take your ECG reading . It was a milestone for the Apple Watch . <p> The new Series 8 , I 'm afraid , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch that has received small updates . So what are they and is this watch any good ? <h> What 's new ? <p> The big update this year is the inclusion of a temperature sensor . And like most things that Apple makes , it 's a thoughtful piece of engineering . It uses not one , but two sensors . There 's one on the back of the caseback near your skin and another under the display , this configuration reduces the effects of ambient temperature so that it can more accurately measure your body temperature . <p> To start , you ca n't use it to get an on-demand temperature reading to check if you are running a fever . Mainly , it 's used to measure your temperature at night , which it can do once every five seconds . <p> It can also detect changes in body temperature as small as 0.1 ? Celsius . You 'll need to wear it for at least five nights with Sleep Tracking and Sleep Focus enabled before Apple can accurately determine your baseline temperature and begin showing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used for advanced female health tracking features with the highlight being retrospective ovulation estimates . According to Apple , an increase in temperature could be the result of ovulation and the Apple Watch Series 8 can tell you when you might have ovulated . <p> Obviously , this could be helpful for couples trying to conceive , but beyond that , the Apple Watch Series 8 can also use temperature data along with ovulation estimates to provide more accurate period predictions . However , I have to stress , these are just estimates and should not be used to make any decisions about your health . <p> Unfortunately , since a ) I lack a uterus , b ) I have no intention of ruining my finances further by having another offspring , and c ) have no medical degree , I 'm afraid I 'm unable to test this new feature and say with any certainty how accurate it is . <p> I 'm afraid I ca n't test the other new headline feature either because it 's Crash Detection . Safety has always been a tenet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Apple is improving its safety feature set with the ability to detect severe car crashes . <p> Using the motion sensors and " advanced sensor-fusion algorithm trained on over one million hours of real-world driving and crash data to detect if you 're in a severe crash , " the Apple Watch Series 8 can detect if you are in a serious car crash and alert emergency services and provide them with your location even if you are unresponsive . It can also notify your emergency contacts . Needless to say , this is something I hope I never have to test . <h> Does that mean it 's bad ? <p> The rest of the watch is unchanged . It still comes in two sizes - 41mm and 45mm - and you can get them in aluminium , stainless steel , and in various finishes . As usual , there are also Nike and Herm ? s variants for fitness enthusiasts and the fashion-forward crowd . There 's no titanium option this year . <p> Other features remain such as the always-on display , 50m of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood oxygen level sensor , multiple workout tracking , fall detection , and so on . Essentially , whatever Series 7 can do , Series 8 can too . <p> And although Series 8 features the new S8 SiP , the actual processor is actually the same - so Series 8 is n't any faster than previous Apple Watches . The S8 SiP simply incorporates the new sensors required for telling your body temperature and Crash Detection . <p> Series 8 also comes preloaded with watchOS 9 , which was announced at WWDC 2022 earlier this year in June . This brings four new watchfaces , improved sleep tracking , advanced workout tracking ( particularly for runners ) , the new Low Power Mode , and more . <p> So as you can see , Series 8 is n't a big update over Series 7 . But does n't necessarily mean it 's a bad thing . As I said in the beginning , the Apple Watch has been with us for seven years now , and just like the iPhone , Apple has already more or less nailed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's model , then yes , this year 's Series 8 is disappointing . But nobody can argue that the new features - advanced female health tracking and Crash Detection - are n't nice to have , even if not everyone would find them useful . And in the case of Crash Detection , I hope it 's something you 'd never have to use . <p> Should the Series 8 have more sensors ? There were rumours for a long time that we might get the ability to measure blood pressure and blood sugar levels , but that has n't happened . It 's disheartening but the fact that it has taken so long for someone to come up with a non-invasive method of measuring blood sugar levels must mean that it 's not an easy feat to pull off - so I 'm not going to give Apple too much grief for that . <p> Ultimately , none of these considerations makes the new Series 8 a bad smartwatch . If you use an iPhone , the Apple Watch Series 8 is the best smartwatch you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's true . Name me another watch that works with iPhones that 's as well-made , as powerful , as tightly integrated , and has even half the features and capabilities of the Apple Watch . <p> There 's none . Sure , there might be the odd Garmin or Casio that 's more rugged or has better outdoor tracking capabilities , but for most users , the Apple Watch is more than good enough . <p> It 's by no means perfect , of course . Battery life is still not the best . Low Power Mode stretches it to 36 hours and it 's useful for long flights , but the Apple Watch is still a device that requires daily charging if you want to use all of its features . And speaking of charging , I wished there was an easier way to juice it up . <h> Closing thoughts and buying advice <p> Let 's see how much the watches cost first . Interestingly , Apple did not raise the price of the aluminium models , though prices of the stainless steel models went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45mm models are now $40 dearer . The Herm ? s models are much pricier , but that 's the price to pay if you want the exclusive Herm ? s watch faces , which , I have to admit , are very nice . <p> Apple Watch Series 8 pricing <p> Case Material <p> Aluminium <p> Stainless Steel <p> Nike <p> Herm ? s <p> 41mm ( GPS only ) <p> From $599 <p> - <p> From $599 <p> - <p> 45mm ( GPS only ) <p> From $649 <p> - <p> From $649 <p> - <p> 41mm ( Cellular ) <p> From $749 <p> From $1,049 <p> From $749 <p> From $1,749 <p> 45mm ( Cellular ) <p> From $799 <p> From $1,119 <p> From $799 <p> From $1,819 <p> My buying advice remains the same . Only upgrade if you have an older watch , especially if you have a Series 5 watch or older . Not only will you get the benefits of a larger display , but you will also get a faster processor , more efficient charging , and the blood oxygen sensor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 6 to upgrade unless the advanced female tracking features are compelling to you or if you feel your daily commute is treacherous enough to warrant having Crash Detection . <p> That said , folks considering the stainless steel models should also take a moment to check out the Apple Watch Ultra , whose prices start at $1,199 and goes on sale a week later on Sept 23 . At that price , the Apple Watch Ultra is just $80 more than a 45mm Series 8 in stainless steel - or , to put it in another way , 7 per cent more . <p> The Apple Watch Ultra has all of the capabilities of the Apple Watch Series 8 but comes in a ruggedised titanium case , has a larger display , and much longer battery life . Assuming you can pull off the 49mm look and do n't mind that it 's substantially bigger and perhaps a little less versatile ( in terms of style ) , that might actually be the better value buy . 
@@93605232 <h> Critical new technologies hold key to emerging energy trends <p> In the absence of collection , plastics are finding their way into our waterways and oceans and , increasingly , into the global food chain . <p> PHOTO : PIXABAY <p> THE term " new energy " covers a number of concepts -- some established , some new , including the use of new technologies to generate electrical energy and increasingly capture the production of " future fuels " , such as hydrogen , ammonia and methanol , says Michael Harrison , a partner in Ashurst LLP who 's based in Singapore . <p> Harrison , along with colleagues , has been involved in over 30 waste projects , and is currently working on 10 projects , all of which are at various stages of development . <p> " We are seeing a focus -- as yet a niche one -- on technologies to create biogas and bio-methane and liquid fuels and feedstocks from waste streams . Things are moving beyond the ' proven ' technologies , that combust waste to produce steam to create electricity , and into the realms of deriving hydrogen from waste streams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells The Business Times ( BT ) in an interview . <p> " There is also an increasing buzz around biogas or bio-methane , where food waste and organic waste are processed into methane for blending into mainstream gas distribution networks . " <p> Commercial , industrial and municipal waste can often be reused for the benefit of those who produce it and for society at large . Commercial and industrial ( C&amp;I ) waste and municipal solid waste ( MSW ) often contain materials that can be recycled and , if not recyclable , can be used as feedstock for waste-to-energy ( WTE ) projects . <p> " ( This ) means that those wastes do not go to a landfill -- which , in itself , has very real benefits to society : organic waste in landfill gives rise to landfill gas ( comprising methane and carbon dioxide ) as it decomposes ; methane and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse gases which , when emitted to the climate system , give rise to climate change , " says Harrison . <p> The use of C&amp;I waste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse-gas emissions . And the benefit to those that produce these wastes is that the energy or feedstock can , in some cases , become part of a virtuous loop . For instance , combustible parts of C&amp;I can produce energy that can feed back into district heating or cooling systems for customers that produce the C&amp;I , he adds . <h> The next level <p> WTE , sorting plants and biological treatment ( biogas ) are important as the spotlight on waste management grows larger in global efforts to protect the environment . <p> In some parts of the world , even landfills represent progress in efforts to protect the environment and oceans , as pollution becomes an ever-rising challenge . Taking WTE and sorting to the next level helps in further protecting oceans and undeveloped land . The use of sorting plants also allows for the recycling of materials that might otherwise have to be produced using energy and to transport both raw materials and finished products to the point of use , he adds . <p> " Anaerobic digestion plants are likely to increase in use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste stream and in the context of the processing and treatment of waste water -- again , reducing greenhouse-gas emissions , " Harrison tells BT . <p> In the field of waste management , the collection and recycling of plastics is important because of the mass of plastic produced each year ( made from hydrocarbons -- fossil fuels ) and in the absence of collection , plastics are finding their way into our waterways and oceans and , increasingly , into the global food chain . <p> " The collection and recycling of plastic allows some plastics to be recycled , but not all . In fact , the majority of plastics produced are not capable of being recycled effectively using current mechanical thermal technology , " says Harrison . <p> " In more recent times , technologies are being developed and deployed to allow the chemical recycling of plastics to reduce plastics to their original compounds , and to reuse those compounds to produce new plastics or to refine those compounds to produce future fuels , including sustainable aviation fuel . " <p> Michael Harrison of Ashurst LLP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where food waste and organic waste are processed into methane . PHOTO : MICHAEL HARRISON <p> Of the virgin plastic produced since 1950 and is no longer in use , it is estimated that , by mass , 9 per cent has been recycled , 12 per cent has been treated thermally , and 79 per cent has been discarded or disposed of via landfills ( the vast majority , other than by safe disposal , to controlled or sanitary landfill ) . Any initiative that increases the recyclability of plastic has to be good , including chemical treatment to allow for the production of recycled plastics or liquid fuels . But the phasing-out of plastics that can not be recycled is just as important . <p> Harrison says that the pace at which the recycling industry is moving to a quality-based approach is a function of both technology ( critically chemical recycling ) and the market for recyclables . In respect of plastics , as the price of hydrocarbons rises ( to produce virgin plastics ) , so the demand for recyclables increases -- in more developed markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price ) increases , so do collection rates . <p> There is a role for the government in respect of all the materials that may be recycled -- the provision of funding to allow effective separation at source and collection from source . For example , the introduction of container deposit schemes that encourage the depositing of containers which can be recycled by providing for a payment to be made with the deposit of each container . <p> Harrison says that for a circular economy to work in real life in the context of waste , the model requires policy settings that encourage the separation of waste streams at source -- critically , the organic waste stream from the inorganic -- and recyclables , including cardboard and paper , glass , metals and plastics , as well as the commitment to move to zero use of landfills . <p> As for obtaining financing , he says it is important to keep in mind that waste projects of any kind are environmental and greenhouse-gas abatement projects and as such , many of these are equity-financed rather than debt/project-financed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of waste arising , waste projects are able to obtain debt/project financing . Critical to project financing is getting comfortable with a change-in-law risk in any country , as well as understanding the practical impact that change in law may have on a project , " Harrison tells BT . <p> " The more developed the market for waste , critically the more established the collection systems , the greater the certainty of the mass of waste that will be available , " he adds . <p> Certainty or at least relative certainty around these matters is key to any waste project , whether equity-funded only or debt and equity funded , he says .

That is roughly equivalent to the annual methane emissions of Austria , according to World Bank data . <p> " The more coal China builds now , the harder it becomes to finance and deliver renewable energy projects later , " said Wu Jinghan , climate and energy project leader for Greenpeace East Asia .

What is quantum computing ? <p> It is similar to traditional computing but operating at the far cooler temperature of nearly absolute zero , the temperature at which a thermodynamic system has the lowest energy corresponding to minus 273.15 deg C. <p> Under layers of casing and cryogenic components to attain this super cool state - colder than in outer space - quantum objects ( an electron or a particle of light ) are manipulated to execute complex mathematical calculations out of reach of traditional computers . <p> Traditional computers store information as either 0s or 1s . Quantum computers , on the other hand , use quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a complex mix of 0s and 1s simultaneously . As the number of qubits grows , a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful . <p> Quantum computing 's long development history dates back to the 1970s , when the late American physicist Paul Anthony Benioff demonstrated the theoretical possibility of quantum computers . <p> By harnessing quantum physics , quantum computing has the potential to comb vast numbers of possibilities in hours and pinpoint a probable solution . It would take a traditional computer hundreds of thousands of years to perform a similar task . <p> Japan 's first prototype quantum computer , unveiled in 2017 , could make complex calculations 100 times faster than a conventional supercomputer . <p> Google 's quantum computer created in 2019 could perform in 200 seconds a computation that would take the world 's fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years . <p> A year later , in 2020 , a team at the University of Science and Technology of China assembled a quantum computer that could perform in 200 seconds a calculation that an ordinary supercomputer would have taken 2.5 billion years to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks . <p> SPH Brightcove Video <p> Singapore is stepping up its investments in quantum computing . But what is quantum computing and what benefits will the technology bring ? <h> 2 . What are the real-world benefits of quantum computing ? <p> The first real-world application could be in chemistry . Today , a traditional computer can simulate the structure of a simple water molecule , but only powerful quantum computers will be able to accurately simulate more complex molecules such as enzymes , proteins and DNA . Complex molecular simulations are key to the discovery of new drugs . <p> Riding on the success of their messenger RNA ( mRNA ) Covid-19 vaccines in the current pandemic , biomedical firms are developing mRNA vaccines for malaria , tuberculosis and HIV , all of which are still causing many deaths in lower-income countries . <p> For instance , BioNTech , joint developer of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine , is working on an mRNA vaccine for malaria , tuberculosis and HIV .

Specifically , more efficient , safer and greener batteries are needed for electric and autonomous vehicles . <p> Lithium-ion batteries that power automotives use liquid electrolytes to move energy around . But these batteries can be slow to charge and do not last long enough for longer journeys . They also freeze in sub-zero temperatures and contain flammable material . What 's more , their production requires the extraction of rare earth materials using large amounts of water . <p> Hyundai is working with IonQ to explore ways to supercharge lithium-ion batteries . IBM and Daimler , the parent company of Mercedes-Benz , are working on lithium-sulphur batteries for a more powerful charge that lasts longer than lithium-ion ones .

" <p> He was speaking at an hour-long dialogue moderated by Mr Rich Karlgaard , editor-at-large at Forbes Media , during the Forbes Global CEO Conference at The Ritz-Carlton , Millenia Singapore hotel . <p> Themed The Way Forward , the conference - now in its 20th year - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world over two days . <p> Mr Wong , who is also Finance Minister , took questions from the audience that ranged from growing US-China tensions to strengthening intra-Asean trade and political succession in Singapore . <p> Asked by Mr Karlgaard about the challenges of navigating growing tensions between the US and China , Mr Wong said the relationship is the most consequential one in the world , shaping the tone of global affairs . <p> " Unfortunately , relations are worsening ... The countries are divided on many issues , ranging from different rival ideologies to systems of government , and now more recently sharply escalating tensions over Taiwan . " <p> The fortunate thing is that leaders on both sides do not want direct confrontation because they know much is at stake , said Mr Wong , although there could be accidents and miscalculations . <p> Singapore is friends with both the US and China , and has been encouraging both sides to keep open lines of communication , especially at the highest levels , he added . <p> It is a positive sign that leaders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have agreed to meet face to face soon , he noted . <p> " So we hope with that ... ability to come together to meet in person , there will be an ability to establish a new modus vivendi ... recognising that the world is big enough for the US and China to coexist , and the two countries do not have to define their relationship in adversarial terms . " <p> On trade , Mr Wong said Singapore 's philosophy is that it wants all the major powers to have stakes in Asean . <p> " And that 's why we tell our friends in both America and China : Engage the region more constructively and comprehensively , and engage the region on its own merits , not through the prism of a US-China relationship or competition , " he said . <p> " We hope that this would be one platform which would allow America to engage the region more comprehensively . And the key is to make sure that this continues through different administrations . " <p> On de-globalisation , Mr Wong said that whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest available , now they do not mind paying a little bit more for greater resilience . <p> " Previously , the logic was countries do not have to be friends to do business with one another - in fact the hope was that the more we trade and invest in each other , we will tamp down geopolitical rivalry , " he said . <p> But now , geopolitics is shaping trade and investments , and the " golden age of globalisation " of the last 30 years since the end of the Cold War is over , said Mr Wong . <p> However global supply chains get reconfigured , Singapore wants to remain a key node , he said . A key prerequisite is that it must always maintain reliability , and have the confidence and trust of businesses . <p> That is why at the height of the pandemic , when Singapore was short of supplies like other countries , " we never contemplated export control measures " , he said . <p> Asked about when he would take over from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can answer because honestly we have n't decided .

@@93803236 <p> SINGAPORE - Law academics and senior members of the legal fraternity on Monday said repealing Section 377A of the Penal Code , which criminalises sex between men , is the right move . There was a real risk of the law being struck down by the courts in a future legal challenge , and doing away with it through the democratic process in Parliament would be less messy , they said . <p> Also , the sheer existence of the law , even if it is not used , will continue to cause societal rift between those who oppose the law and those who support it , they added . <p> They were at a discussion with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on the implications of a February judgment by the Court of Appeal on the constitutionality of Section 377A . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had cited the case when he announced in August that the Government would repeal the law . <p> He had said that following this judgment , Mr Shanmugam and Attorney-General Lucien Wong advised the Government there was a significant risk of the law being struck down in future on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Equal Protection provision . He had also said repealing the law was the right step as attitudes have changed and many do not think sex between men in private should be a criminal offence . <p> On Monday , Mr Shanmugam said the apex court 's decision in February in the case Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General strongly suggested that Section 377A might be unconstitutional . In the decision , the court suggested that the law could violate Article 12 of the Constitution if a particular approach were taken to evaluate it , he added . <p> The court had also held that the three men who brought the case did not have the locus standi , or standing , to challenge the law , since there was no real risk of prosecution under Section 377A . <p> But Mr Shanmugam noted that the court in February had limited itself to considering the lack of standing with regard to prosecution and not investigations by the police . This means it was possible for the court to rule differently on the issue of standing in future , based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Law Society president Adrian Tan and Singapore University of Social Sciences law school dean Leslie Chew said the judgment had made it quite obvious that there was a risk the law could be found unconstitutional in future . <p> National University of Singapore associate professor of law Jaclyn Neo said the Court of Appeal had significantly changed the test that it uses to assess whether differential treatment of certain groups would violate the right to equal protection under the Constitution . <p> This has put Section 377A on more shaky ground , she added . <p> University of Hong Kong professor of law Michael Hor said that although the court had declared that the law can not be used , it was only " half dead " and there were still other " zombie bits " that were " not quite dead yet " . For instance , there may be other secondary offences such as abetment that may be predicated on the intention to commit offences under Section 377A , and it is not clear if these are bound by the current legal position . <p> Prof Hor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sheer existence of the law can not be ignored , and that it will continue to breed ill will against gay men and cause them to feel excluded and inferior . <p> Mr Tan said the broader question is how Singaporeans would prefer to effect change in society . When laws are changed through a litigious court process , it is messy and brutal with interconnected laws left hanging , but when they are changed through the democratic process in Parliament , related laws can be dealt with at the same time , he said . <p> Prof Chew said the court is also not the best forum to decide on the extra-legal issues thrown up by the constitutionality of Section 377A . <p> " In Singapore , we ... have not politicised many of our issues , and we should not because it really , properly belongs to the people , rather than the court , where at the end of the day , it 's adversarial , " he added . <p> In his remarks , Mr Shanmugam said the Government had four options to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent court challenges to Section 377A ; leave Section 377A alone and amend the Constitution to prevent court challenges to the definition of marriage ; or repeal Section 377A and amend the Constitution to prevent court challenges to definition of marriage . <p> He said the Government had chosen to repeal the law and protect the definition of marriage , as it was the principled and right thing to do . He added that if Section 377A is struck down , the definition of marriage would likely be challenged , and the Government had assessed that society was not ready for such a sea change overnight . <p> Prof Hor asked why Section 377A and the definition of marriage were being treated differently . " Section 377A might be struck down by the courts , so we repeal it first . Marriage definition might also be struck down by the courts , but we protect it ... Why the different treatment ? " he said . <p> Mr Shanmugam replied : " If Section 377A is a matter for Parliament , marriage is even more a matter for Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the definition of marriage , if that 's what Singaporeans want , somebody has got to organise themselves , put it on your manifesto , go into the general elections arguing that this is what you stand for , win the elections , change the law . That is how a democracy ought to work . " <p> At the end of the session , Singapore Management University professor of law Lee Pey Woan , who was the moderator , asked the audience of about 90 lawyers , law academics and students if anyone disagreed with the view that there was a real risk Section 377A could be struck down for being unconstitutional . No hand was raised .

When you are practising wellbeing , you are showing a sign of your own self-love , and how to make sense of your own wellbeing , " Nathan reminds us . <p> " In order to be a changemaker , what you need to do is build better inner strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How do adults learn ? Well , there are five conditions that Garima Kothari , Chief Executive , Leadership Trust Singapore , highlighted in her session : <p> A safe environment , <p> The reassurance of support , <p> The impetus of challenge , <p> Simultaneous integration of thinking and feeling , <p> Continued application <p> The team advocates a four-step leadership development process : <p> Clear , conscious , full and accurate awareness of one 's self <p> Awareness and sensitivity to other people <p> Ability to manage oneself -- feelings , responses , moods and reactions <p> Skilful management of one 's relationship with other people <p> Garima shared : " Leadership development is best served when it combines a powerful , real emotional experience of leading and being led with a clear and compelling explanation that makes sense of the experience for each individual . " <p> Three key priorities for L&amp;D teams to stay connected during a crisis <p> Staying connected during the pandemic ( how many of them do you agree with ? ) : <p> Applicability ( Experience ) - promoting a work-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 70:20:10 principle . <p> Lessons L&amp;D teams can learn from digital marketing <p> In the next session , Arthur Koo , AVP , Learning &amp; Development , IHH Healthcare , took on the challenge of sharing lessons from digital marketing with a room full of L&amp;D professionals -- and succeeded ! <p> " Data is omnipotent . Acting upon data is the only effective way to make informed marketing decisions . If you know and understand your data , you can adjust your marketing accordingly . " <p> Against that backdrop , he advised that AI in learning can support in a host of ways : <p> personalised and targeted learning recommendations <p> measuring training effectiveness <p> learning analytics and insights <p> Making learning impactful for a multigenerational workforce <p> Our last session of the conference was a micro-workshop on hosted by Lawrence Chan , Director ( FVP ) , Learning and Development Asia , Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation . <p> As Lawrence pointed out to the audience -- we 're L&amp;D folks , but we 're also salespersons , whether we 're selling an idea at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that perspective , he shared , should form the basis of our learning design . <p> He said : " The right thing is to approach it learning interventions like a sale -- you are selling L&amp;D solutions to your stakeholders . Why create a product and then chase the market , when you can involve them in the creation and delivery of the product ? " <p> Raising the bar on skills development &amp; employee engagement <p> Kickstarting day one of the conference was a fireside chat with Amazon Web Services ' Sandra Teh , Chief Culture Evangelist , who shared about the fundamentals that raise the bar on skills development &amp; employee engagement at AWS : <p> Listening to employees and teams , and keeping an open mind to every idea they share . The company 's SheBuilds programme , for instance , was born from an employee 's idea ! <p> It 's important to continuously motivate and encourage employees , and ensure upskilling and reskilling opportunities are always in abundance . <p> Keep the conversation going with the leadership team , and people managers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingredients and confidence , go ahead and do it . Do n't wait until you are 90% sure . <p> Teh also affirmed the importance of continuously motivating and encouraging employees , and ensuring upskilling and reskilling are always in abundance . Keep the conversation going with leaders and people managers too . <p> These , she shared , are the cornerstone of culture . <p> Enhancing leadership capability in developing future leaders <p> How do you ensure leadership buy-in when implementing a leadership development programme ? Here are some tips shared by the panellists in one of our panel discussions : <p> Make learning bite-sized , for the time-pressed leader . <p> Carry out learning consulting -- find out the skills leaders need and are looking for ; and the kind of learning they seek . This , one speaker said , is a great way to encourage buy-in . <p> Cultivate a culture of trust -- when it starts from the top , it sets the example for the rest of the organisation . <p> Additionally , when it comes to ROI , one key way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for observable change -- for instance , how they apply the skills acquired in real-life situations . <p> Another way , we learnt , is to measure their readiness for succession - if you have a strong succession pipeline and a strong leadership development programme , then look at how ready your leaders are for their next role after undergoing the programme . <p> Think about the last time you needed to figure out a new Excel formula at work or troubleshoot a plumbing problem at home ? You probably YouTubed it . Chances are , it was n't a polished training presentation , but a self-recorded DIY video . <p> " Video is the new standard for engaging and effective learning , " affirmed Christophe Randy , Vice President Asia Pacific , Panopto . <p> " What 's more , in this distributed environment , employees have also come to expect flexibility and choice in how they communicate and collaborate in the workplace . It comes as no surprise that video has undoubtedly become the foundation for working and learning in a hybrid world , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of L&amp;D professionals agree that most learning is not used after the programme is conducted . <p> Further research also showed that most L&amp;D teams ( 81% ) do n't have data to show that they are making a difference in their organisation . <p> And with virtual and hybrid work now all too common even as organisations are trying to return to some sense of normalcy , video and virtual learning have become all the more important as the new standard for engaging and effective training . <p> But it poses its own challenges -- resistance to self-directed learning , and making learning applicable across borders . <p> In tackling these , L&amp;D teams can leverage technology deeper , and encourage employees through sharings &amp; case studies of those who have benefitted from it . <p> Driving the shift to employee-centred , active learning <p> In today 's talent landscape , leaders are faced with two challenges that are at odds , but urgent to resolve : employees are struggling to make time for upskilling , yet lack of career development is a key reason they cite for leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> One way , Fitrah Muhammad , Regional Director , Asia , Coursera shared , is to allow learners to learn in the flow of their work . For instance , by making learning bite-sized so they can learn on the go and in between their tasks . <p> For the audience 's benefit , he highlighted the major digital disruptors in the industry and key talent trends : <p> A digital-first strategy for a digitally-enabled customer : 54% of people say they use digital banking services even more due to the pandemic and reported that it saves time and provides an easier way to manage their finances . <p> Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing : Operations-intensive sectors such as manufacturing have 1.3x the automation potential of many other sectors , using technology that has already been developed . <p> Business are paying heavily for tech skills : Singapore employers from the banking and finance sector are willing to entice potential new entrants with increments of up to 25% , especially if these candidates are also holding multiple concurrent offers . <p> Hybrid workplace model is here to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that they would retain their present hybrid work arrangements , while one said that its employees would continue with remote work completely . <p> The talent gap is only widening : There is a growing number of unfulfilled jobs due to a skill mismatch . Among nearly 700 professionals surveyed , almost a third ( 31% ) said they were thinking of leaving their job even though they did n't have another one lined up . <p> Overall , as we learnt from the session , workplace learning must drive business goals : <p> * It must involve measurable , role-based skills development* Virtual training and hybrid teams should be the new default* Companies must build diverse talent pipelines* Bring on L&amp;D as a talent partner <p> Creating opportunities for inclusive development <p> In today 's fragmented world , creating developing opportunities suited to the different needs of employees is challenging . L&amp;D professionals have to take great care in navigating a landmine of new biases and inequalities . <p> " What 's important to set sail ? Crew . A happy boat is a fast boat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preferences of employees , and developing the entire workforce through effective design and delivery of an inclusive learning programme . <p> This is done through : a purpose-driven culture , the right skills &amp; talents , leadership capability , and inclusive &amp; diverse teams . <p> The leaders drive a performance-based culture where everyone delivers today , whilst taking care of tomorrow , through a focus on actions such as : <p> Setting stretch objectives linked to the company strategy , <p> Rewarding performance by clearly differentiating between high-performers and others , <p> Leading with care , by being a role model of purpose , pride , and performance . <p> Placing greater focus on internal training expertise <p> One of our post-lunch sessions of the day was a mini-workshop hosted by Standard Chartered Bank 's Suman Sharma , Head of Non Mandatory Learning People Capability . In this engaging session , he led the discussion with the audience on how L&amp;D teams can raise the bar on internal training expertise , where the challenge admittedly is more about making the workforce understand the importance of building skills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , context is more important than content . " When you look at building any capability , traditionally we are very skewed towards picking up content in isolation . There are tons of great courses out there -- but what 's going to make the difference in the organisation if you really want to drive performance ? <p> In the second-last session of the day one , Sureish Nathan , Managing Director , LHH , took the stage to share how leaders can multiply the positive impact of a culture that enables internal mobility . <p> " When we think about the transition and flux in the market , and leaders not getting the right training to coach their people , it gives us pause for cause . There is no question that our talent is key to whether our organisations succeed or fail , " he pointed out . <p> " But that responsibility is a shared one , " he highlighted . <p> In that vein , he stressed that leaders , employees , and the organisation must all pull together in the same direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model falls apart . It 's a perfect triangle where each one plays a significant role in the outcome you 're trying to drive towards . " <p> The five steps ( and some sample action items ) to building a culture that supports internal mobility , as he shared , are : <p> Organisations must provide opportunities for leaders to develop their coaching skills <p> Use a structured and consistent approach for developing short / long-term goals <p> Formalise a strategic framework for internal mobility <p> The framework should organise activities and resources to drive career mobility actions <p> Forecast and Promote Career Mobility Opportunities <p> Build a career lattice for your people <p> Encourage employees to seek different opportunities <p> Non-linear career development grows readiness for future roles <p> Empower Your Employees <p> Ensure employees share the responsibility &amp; take accountability for their career development <p> Provide access to career coaching and mentors <p> Provide relevant " self-service " resources to promote career options and build a plan of action <p> Elevating the role of CLOs as business strategic partners <p> " Leaders can not be trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , they mature over time , " said our final speaker of day one , Richmond Kok , Corporate Director , Learning and Talent Development , Capella Hotels and Resorts . <p> He urged the audience to think about how learning practitioners can be business partners by looking at the P&amp;L , and consulting all our different stakeholders , making a case to sustain the training budget . <p> Human Resources Online would like to thank all speakers , panellists , and moderators for their immense time and mind space invested in leading the industry conversations .

@@94027236 <p> The new Kia Niro Hybrid is practical , stylish , and surprisingly quite posh , with a properly economical hybrid drivetrain . <p> CarBuyer <p> Crossover SUVs are a big thing everywhere right now , and while cars like the Honda HR-V and Hyundai Tucson are still riding on a bit of hype carried over from the success of the generation before , Kia has been steadily making inroads with its range as well and the new Kia Niro Hybrid is a car that seems tailor-made for Singapore . <p> It 's a model that was first revealed in early 2022 , and replaces the last one which dates back to 2019 , which at the time of its launch was the cheapest Category A COE hybrid car you could buy . <p> The basics of the Kia Niro is that it 's a small crossover SUV , front-wheel driven and powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine and electric motor combo . It 's got entirely new bodywork , features the new Kia logo and front ' face ' . It 's promoted as a car that 's comfortable for the family , and also a huge step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small Kia Stonic always seemed a bit underwhelming , the Niro Hybrid might very well be the total opposite . <h> Design and interior <p> The Kia Niro Hybrid is sold in Singapore in two trim variants , the basic EX and more premium SX version . Thankfully , the now outdated idea of stacking plastic bolt-ons to the product to make a car appear more expensive and ' aggressive ' than it really is , is now firmly in the rearview mirror . <p> The external differences between EX and SX , are not major , but a lot of the $15k price difference between the two is down to standard equipment fitted in the cabin . The car seen here is the Niro Hybrid SX , and externally it differs from the EX with its LED lights , roof rails , and sunroof . <p> The interior is where it 's all at , and the Niro Hybrid SX features a very contemporary flat panel , full-width video screen and a rotary drive mode selector . It 's not quite the gigantic hyperscreen of the Mercedes-AMG EQS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Niro shares some components with the Hyundai Avante , and despite the different window dressing the controls and touchscreens do operate very similarly to present-gen Hyundais . <p> The central control strip does the magic trick where it toggles between the climate control settings panel and the ' ' other features ' mode . A marked icon changes the touch surface between the two modes , and new users may find it mystifying to find no volume control in the car , until you discover that the temperature dial doubles as the volume dial as you flip modes . <p> It sounds a bit complicated , but it 's really quick to get used to . <p> All round space in the cabin is pretty good , and the width of the second row is much better than many of its direct rivals . The glossy black plastics scattered around the dashboard can be a problem in bright sunlight however , reflecting the glare of the sun around the cabin . <p> The knock-on result is that the Niro Hybrid does look like a very wide car from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially chunky . It does have decently good aerodynamic efficiency however , with a unique C-pillar fin channelling air smoothly over the rear window to reduce air turbulence in the car 's wake . It 's a clever bit of design , and this type of air channelling used to be strictly the domain of supercars and luxury cars . <p> The car 's front end and side view is n't exceptionally different from the rest of Kia 's present lineup like the big Sorento Hybrid , and that 's a good thing as there 's a strong family connection running across the brand 's crossover SUVs big and small . <h> Driving experience <p> Thanks to the archaic classification system with Singapore 's COE system , the Kia Niro Hybrid appears to have been slightly detuned for sale in Singapore , which is a pretty common practice by dealers circumventing the Category A and Category B classifications . The Australian-specification Niro Hybrid makes a total power output of 139 horsepower , while the Singapore-spec version is maxed out at 130 horsepower . <p> That 's because 130hp is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COE segment , supposedly meant only for small and basic cars . However local auto dealers have learnt how to game the system a long time ago . The BMW 216i Gran Coupe and Audi A3 are both ' Singapore luxury specials ' , detuned to slip into the Cat A COE here , and perversely , they fight for the same COE as a basic Mitsubishi Attrage . <p> As for the Niro Hybrid , losing nine horsepower over its Australian counterpart is n't much of a loss thankfully , as the full petrol-electric hybrid drive experience makes for a decently punchy drive . <p> The full digital dashboard switches between various displays as is pretty much standard these days , and the steering wheel 's paddle shifters are used to set the battery regeneration strength when in standard drive mode . There are three levels of regenerative braking , increased by pulling the ' - ' paddle on the left side . It feels like increased engine braking from the driver 's seat as the strength is increased , and there 's also an auto regenerative braking mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' paddle on the right side for more than one second . <p> In this mode , the car uses its sensors and cameras to detect if there is a car slowing down ahead of it , and automatically increases the ' engine braking ' seamlessly , and as necessary . It 's actually very smooth in this mode too and very driveable . <p> It 's not a sports car , but the ride is neither soft and wallowy , nor choppy , which was a characteristic of the Renault Captur . The academic 0 to 100km/h sprint time of 10.5 seconds does n't really tell the whole story as the car really does n't feel slow at all .

This one-bite appetiser , consisting of a spherified yogurt resting on a deep-fried puri ( puffy Indian bread ) and garnished with sev ( fried noodles bits ) and pomegranate seeds , is an unami bomb of sweet and savoury not to be missed . <p> As for the Cold Curry Ceviche ( $20 ) , Gaggan gets a little experimental by mixing things up . Going against the grain , the Indian chef reworks his classic Cold Curry Scallops dish in which Hokkaido scallops are given the Mexican treatment with the addition of Leche de Tigre ( citrus-based , spicy marinade ) , corn salsa and guachutney . <p> Moving on to mains , this is where Gaggan ups the stakes and flavours of his Indian-Mexican experience . <p> Showcasing one of his greatest hits , Gaggan 's Crab Curry ( $32 ) can be found on the menu . A favourite since 2016 , the fragrant crab meat is first stir-fried with pepper and curry leaves in this South Indian curry creation . The result , sweet chunks of crab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the real hit of the show is a wholly new creation -- Patrani Fish Tamal ( $30 ) . Derived from his classic Fish Paturi dish , Gaggan 's audacious attempt to bridge Indian and Mexican cooking sees him roast a barramundi fillet wrapped in a banana leaf with patrani masala . The dish is a surprising mix of smokey , earthen flavours that is so addictive that you just ca n't stop . <p> But like any good Indian or Mexican meal , it would be amiss not to have some carbs to complete the experience . While most will be tempted by the Truffle Quesadilla ( $28 ) , the better option in our opinion goes to the Morel Mushroom Biryani ( $28 ) . <p> The morel mushrooms are surprisingly plump and so flavour-filled , and combine that with the biryani spices , it hits all the right notes to make the truffle quesadilla seemed rather one-note despite the generous portion of black truffle paste and honey . Plus , the mushroom biryani complements the other mains such as the crab curry without overpowering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having showcased a mixture of greatest hits and new creations throughout his menu set-list , Gaggan continues the pattern in his desserts selection . <p> Presenting an original in the form of Avocado Falooda ( $16 ) , the Bangkok-based chef reimagines the classic Indian cold dessert with noodles . Packed with avocado mousse , coconut jelly , lemon foam and vanilla ice cream , it is not just a flavour , but also a textural delight . <p> But if you are one for the classics , then the Mango Yuzu Snowball ( $24 ) will surely be your pick . As seen on MasterChef Singapore , this Gaggan specialty makes use of alphonso mango , yuzu and white chocolate flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen . It is the fitting light and sweet end to such an explosive and dynamic meal that will leave you wanting more . Just like any good concert experience would .

The car is actually Skoda 's second electric RS model , and follows on from the swoopy Enyaq Coupe RS iV that was announced earlier this year . <p> Like the Coupe , the Enyaq RS iV features a dual-motor , all-wheel-drive setup , with an electric motor at each axle , and they combine to produce a total of 295hp and 460Nm of torque , allowing it to go from 0-100km/h in 6.5 seconds . <p> The high-performance variant of the Enyaq iV gets a high-voltage 82kWh battery , which Skoda claims gives the car a range of over 500km . <p> It also has a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 80 per cent of charge in just slightly over 30 minutes . <p> New on the Enyaq RS iV is the Plug &amp; Charge function , which streamlines the charging process via Skoda 's Powerpass app . <p> At a suitable and compatible charging point , customers can simply plug in the charging cable , and the charging point will identify the vehicle and begin the charging process and billing automatically . <p> Like all Skoda RS models , the Enyaq RS iV has been given a sporty makeover , and RS-specific design elements on the car include large 20-inch wheels , with 21-inch alloy rims available as an option . <p> It also gets a sports suspension setup that drops the car by 15mm over the regular Enyaq iV SUV , while other RS specific trimmings include the gloss black grille , door mirrors and rear diffuser , the sporty front apron and side skirts , and the lower rear reflector that runs across the width of the bumper . <p> There are also RS badges sprinkled liberally all over the car , while the Enyaq RS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamba Green . <p> Finally , the car comes with Skoda 's Crystal Face , which consists of 131 LEDs embedded into the grille , and is complemented by Matrix LED headlights as standard . <p> The interior also gets some sporty RS touches , including carbon-fibre look trim on the dashboard and door panels , as well as aluminium pedals . <p> The standard Suede microfibre sports seats also feature the RS logo embroidered in the headrest , while there is also a unique leather-wrapped sports steering wheel that 's exclusive to the RS model . <p> The Enyaq iV is Skoda 's first fully-electric vehicle , and it sits on the modular electric drive matrix ( MEB ) platform that also underpins similar-sized electric SUVs from the Volkswagen Group , including the Volkswagen ID.4 and Audi Q4 E-tron . <p> The car has been a major sales success in Europe since its launch in 2021 , and Skoda says that it will roll out the 100,000th unit from its production line " very soon " . 
@@94424235 <p> BMW 's electric scooter is n't cheap , but the CE 04 is a futuristic flag bearer that will help convert bikers to the zero emissions cause , even in Singapore . <p> CarBuyer <p> SINGAPORE - Scooters have always been prime candidates for electrification , and BMW 's first electric motorcycle/scooter for Singapore , the CE 04 , proves that premise right with an excess of technological style . <p> BMW is a pacemaker for EVs here , there 's little doubt of that . The German brand was the first to offer an EV for public sale here with the awesomely futuristic i3 city car back in 2014 , and while the CE 04 is n't Singapore 's first electric motorcycle , it 's the first electric scooter we 've tested here that can actually , feasibly , turn your two-wheeled commute zero emissions . <p> In fact , the CE 04 is actually BMW Motorrad 's second electric scooter , following the C Evolution from 2014 . Not that you could tell , because that looked like an ICE ( internal combustion engine ) bike with fancier plastics , but the CE 04 ditches convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Design : Flippin ' stark <p> In packaging , the CE 04 adopts classic EV tactics : A battery in the lowest part of the vehicle . Space is always tighter on bikes , so the motor and power electronics are close to the belt-driven rear wheel . To accommodate those bits , the bike has a long wheelbase , a single-sided swingarm , and a side-mounted shock . <p> The seat , unlike traditional maxi-scoots , is fixed , and that helps accentuate the whole low-slung look and emphasis on long , unbroken lines . But the CE-04 does n't just look different for the sake of it , it 's also shaped by aerodynamics . <p> The plastic front fender covers most of the brakes , and there are wings on each side of the front too . We 've made cyberpunk comparisons before , but given its zero emissions nature , the tech onboard , it 's more appropriate than ever and would look entirely at home on the streets of Night City . <p> The seating position 's spacious , and low to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel more massive than a normal maxi scoot ( 230kg wet , versus 203kg for a T-Max ) . <p> In any case , there 's the super convenient reverse gear . The last bike we tested with an electric motor reverse gear was the polar opposite , but also a BMW : the hulking tourer with a screaming inline six engine , the K 1600 . <h> Riding experience : Torquey mother <p> Starting the bike is easy -- hit the ' on ' button like any keyless bike , then hold the brake and hit the ' starter ' button . The EV ' start ' is anticlimactic of course , in that there is n't the expected response , no cough of the starter , no vibrations , nothing . <p> The bike display shifts to ' Ready ' to indicate it 's ready to roll . Like almost all EVs , it 's the low-speed work that really throws the contrast into starkness : If you 're in traffic , everything around you seems extra noisy , and you ca n't hear any aural feedback from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low hum is audible . <p> Given the engineering choices , it 's perhaps no surprise the bike rides just like an electric car drives . The instant electric torque is good for a chuckle-filled launch or two , but more useful for navigating traffic . Below 70km/h it 's punchy and almost unbeatable in a drag race , but runs out of puff early and tops out at a limited 130km/h . <p> At town speeds , it 's biddable and easy to steer , the low-slung weight gives it surprising agility and it handles quite well once you 're used to the slightly slow steering ( weight , again ) . <p> But you 'd never call this a super agile darty bike , like the Energica , the front end feeling is a bit vague , and you just have to trust it in the dry , then you 'll find some smiles in corners . In the wet , it becomes more remote , and you ride conservatively ( not that you should n't when it 's raining . <p> Another EV point -- the faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80km/h on the highway delivers excellent energy consumption ( low 5.0kWh/100km ) , but it bumps up to mid-5.0 if you hang at 90km/h or higher . <p> The tuning of the bike also seems to force a low cruising speed -- you need to turn the twist grip quite a bit to sit at 90km/h cruising . In Rain mode it 's even more obvious , and can get tiring because you need to rotate the twist grip so much . <p> The bike is speed limited to 130km/h for a good reason : High speed is where EVs suffer most in efficiency . But to its credit , it 's rock-solid and stable in high-speed handling , and the brakes are more than up to the task . Our only real dynamic complaint , wrist twisting aside , is the jiggly ride . But plenty of regular bikes do that too . <h> Practicality : Scale ' lectric <p> More importantly , can it hack it in daily life just like a petrol maxi scoot ? In energy management terms , yes , but with caveats . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a single charge , so the average 50km-a-day-Singaporean will need to charge days to be safe . <p> Luckily , it takes less than two hours , and does n't require a super-high AC wattage ( 6.9kW ) . For high mileage riders -- like delivery riders with an eye on quiet , cheaper per-km costs -- this probably wo n't work . <p> In practicality terms , yes . If you use bikes like the Honda X-ADV 750 or Yamaha T-Max as benchmarks , that is . There 's space for a full-face helmet in the compartment beneath the seat -- it 's at least as big as the compartment on a Honda NC 750X . BMW also sells an optional top box , so there 's a degree of practicality with the CE 04 . Plus , parking is very easy thanks to reverse gear . <p> If you 're waiting for the big but , it 's the price . Unlike cars , which have VES and the Early EV Adoption Rebate , electric bikes do n't get jack in terms of handouts or benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your MP if you want to see change . But in any case , the take home charge point is that at S$53,800 without a COE , you could take home any number of much more powerful , long-ranging , and dynamically capable petrol machines . <p> But , like it was with the BMW i3 , that 's obviously not the draw if you want to buy a CE 04 at this point ( and some already have ) . You 'd get the CE 04 if you want a super-cool bike that looks the way it is -- the way of the future -- but you can realise it today . <p> And like the i3 , which still has practicality and usable range even today , you wo n't need to worry about future-proofing if you keep your range expectations in check .

@@94424236 <h> 3 things to know about the latest Ulu Pandan BTO flats <p> Ulu Pandan is getting more residents and shedding its ulu reputation - 3000 BTO flats are slated to be built across three projects in Dover Forest , with the first to be launched in November . <p> Sitting in the eastern half of the forest , 1,330 flats of three- and four-room units will be built in a mix of low-rise and high-rise housing blocks , so future residents can enjoy the scenic views of the Ulu Pandan Canal ( which is scheduled to be updated and beautified ) and Holland Grove landed estate . Blocks facing the canal will be low-rise , while the blocks facing Commonwealth Avenue West will be high-rise . <p> The upcoming BTO project lies in the mature estate of Queenstown , with the last launch in the area is more than a decade ago , in November 2012 . We predict that the launch will be a hot one due to its location in a mature area , with a rich cluster of well-established amenities . <p> Young couples hoping to snag a flat in the area to live within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot on the ballot . <p> Currently , only landed properties and condos are up for sale in Ulu Pandan , so the BTO projects will be a budget-friendly welcome addition to the estate . <p> Here are three interesting facts about the latest Ulu Pandan BTO development . <h> 1 . Nature-conscious design <p> With Singapore looking to move the country towards a greener , more sustainable future over the next decade , the new housing estates are designed to minimise environmental impact as much as possible . <p> This is outlined in The Singapore Green Plan , where cycling paths are geared to expand to thrice their current length - from 460 km to 1,320 km - so people can commute via bicycle . To encourage the residents to adopt a healthy lifestyle , four trails in Ulu Pandan are in the works , including a 1.6 km trail that runs along the Ulu Pandan Canal and connects to the various precincts . <p> One of the five key pillars of the Green Plan is to develop over 130ha of new parks while enhancing around 170ha of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the five ha of verdant spaces found in Ulu Pandan 's housing estate and a 1.2ha park , where extra effort has been taken to maintain much of the original flora and fauna as well as an existing freshwater stream . <p> Blocks will also include sky terraces , communal garden spaces and roof gardens for residents to come together and cultivate their gardens with fellow green thumbs . <h> 2 . Co-existing with endangered critters <p> To establish a green linear corridor along Ulu Pandan , HDB said it was working closely with the national water agency PUB and the National Parks Board . <p> Wildlife , such as a vulnerable species of grey heron and endangered Asian softshell turtle passing by Sungei Ulu Pandan , can use this ecological corridor as a safe passage . <p> Biodiversity in the area is being carefully preserved by developing only the eastern half of the forest - an area spanning 11 ha out of the total 33 ha of the entire Dover Forest . <p> This was n't always the original plan - HDB had planned to convert the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presented scientific studies . They also collated 1,800 responses from the public to help determine the fate of the forest . <p> Conserving wildlife in land-scarce Singapore while balancing residential needs is a tricky front to navigate , but HDB is stepping up to the challenge by conserving the western half of the forest for at least the next decade . <p> Dover Forest is home to at least 158 animal species ( including critically endangered ones ) as well as 120 plant species . The western sector of the forest , marked out to be safeguarded as a nature park , has richer biodiversity compared to the eastern half , with large trees and threatened species . <p> This is the first time such measures have been put in place via a broad landscape approach to retain higher-quality vegetation on an existing site , so wildlife can access other nature areas such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges . <p> It 's heartening to see how the authorities involved Singaporeans in the decision as well as carried out multiple environmental studies instead of just bulldozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ditch your vehicles <p> Gazetted as the first car-lite HDB precinct ( one of four estates ) , visitors to Ulu Pandan can expect fewer parking spaces when they visit the residents . Instead , the spaces are prioritised for public facilities and greenery to encourage the local community to mingle in nature . <p> But fret not ; the infrastructure is planned to facilitate public transport , walking and cycling connections , so you wo n't miss your metal monster . Residents have prioritised parking for their first cars , with a higher charge ( $190 ) for their second car , subject to availability . <p> Fewer vehicles will also mean less pollution and better air quality . Those who commute via public transport can use the sheltered elevated link-ways to get to Dover MRT directly , where they can conveniently access various amenities at its commercial node . <h> Future Ulu Pandan BTO projects <p> The remainder of the BTO units in Ulu Pandan will most probably be constructed on the corner of Ghim Moh Link and Commonwealth Avenue , with the conserved water stream running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be found in future projects , as the allocated land area has an allowable gross plot ratio ( GPR ) of 3.9 , while the current site has a GPR of 3.3 .

Even if people were n't familiar with the flavours , they had an instant connection to it , so I knew there was something there . " <p> The product is made in small batches in Chengdu , using a combination of dried chilli peppers , fermented black beans , shallots , garlic , sesame oil , mushroom powder , seaweed , rapeseed oil and soybean oil . <p> " The chilli crisp is smoky , has a hint of sweetness and a delicate kick of tangy spice , and all the ingredients come together in such a wonderful way that leaves you craving more .

I find it 's not so strong in taste , whereas with ours , you really get the garlic and the onion coming through , " she says . <p> Mama Liu 's is not about the heat , Li adds , but about its garlicky-ness and smokiness , which pairs well with all kinds of foods including pizza , pasta , dumplings and fried eggs . <p> When they first started , Li and her mother were making 1kg ( 2.2 pounds ) of chilli oil a week .

How to do yours right , and the best hair extensions for you <p> There are two main misconceptions about hair extensions : They 're only meant for celebrities attending red-carpet events , and they can only be used to add length . <p> While it 's true that A-listers have , for decades , used them to make their hair appear longer , extensions can be used by almost anyone to add volume and depth to hair . <p> There are certain things to be aware of , however , to avoid the kinds of extension malfunctions more than a few celebrities have fallen foul to during their careers . <p> One such case that went viral involved Angelina Jolie during the premiere of The Eternals at the 2021 Rome Film Festival . While she looked ravishing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of attention . Not enough pieces were used , and the placement for them was too low , leaving her hair looking uneven and jagged . <p> Fashion designer Betsey Johnson similarly struggled with visible extensions atop her root line at the opening party of the Whitney Museum in New York in 2015 , and Britney Spears has been no stranger to poorly placed pieces throughout her career . <p> This type of thing can happen to any of us , so it pays to heed the following bits of advice for the best extension outcomes . <h> Different types of hair <p> The first thing you 'll need to figure out is what type of hair you want your extensions to be made of . <p> " There are different grades of hair that can be used for hair extension application , " says Shawnt ?

With this being said , try to avoid both fake and real hair extensions that use silicone . <p> There are various grades of real hair extensions , but two terms you 're likely to hear often are " remy " , meaning hair that is virgin and has never been chemically treated ; and " cuticle intact " , which refers to uber-healthy locks that still maintain a flat cuticle . <p> When sourcing remy hair extensions , manufacturers meticulously select each strand of hair to make sure the cuticle stays untouched and healthy , so all the hairs run in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look and feel smooth and polished . <h> Different types of extensions <p> Once you 're aware of the types of hair available , the next step is to select the extension type appropriate for the look you 're trying to achieve . There are an overwhelming amount of different options on the market today , which is why many hair stylists recommend consulting an expert to help with the decision . <p> Sew-in extensions -- also known as weaves -- are a go-to choice for long-term use . Weaves are sewn , glued , or wrapped around natural hair that 's been braided into cornrows . <p> They 're best for medium to thick hair , as they need to be securely attached . They are considered among the most durable extensions . <p> nid:599551 <p> Alternatively , clip-in extensions offer an easy , temporary style change -- adding a fringe , a bun , braids , a ponytail , or a few extra inches of hair . " You can wear them just for a day or special occasion and then remove them . If you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , " Johns says . <p> They come in strands connected at the base with either cloth or silicone , and small snap clips linked to them , so all you have to do is attach them to your natural hair and you 're ready to go . <p> Another option is tape-in extensions , which , as the name suggests , are pre-taped into hair bundles and then glued or taped into your hair . <p> In order for them to look natural , your stylist will align them to your hair roots to then apply the glue to attach them to your hair . <p> They employ flattened beads or metallic cylinders to latch onto your hair . They 're a popular choice for those looking to dodge the use of glues , tapes , or fusion methods . <p> Unlike weaves , I-tips do n't involve braiding , so your real hair is easier to handle and style , allowing for more flexibility , as you 'll be able to pull your hair into a ponytail or topknot without risking the extensions ' base being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those looking for low-maintenance , no-commitment hair extensions . Multiple hair strands are sewn together onto an almost invisible cord that lays flat on the crown , seamlessly blending with your natural mane . <h> Will extensions damage my hair ? <p> If applied by a properly trained stylist there should n't be significant damage to your hair , so make sure to check your stylist 's credentials before agreeing to anything . <p> Moreover , if you struggle with any kind of active hair loss or experience abnormally fine or scattered hair , hair extensions may not be a good idea , as they could worsen your hair condition .

Chee Kee <p> MANILA -- Thirty years have passed since the Organ Donation Act of 1991 was signed into law by then President Corazon Aquino , but it has yet to gain a foothold among Filipinos averse to the idea of allowing the removal of their deceased loved ones ' viable organs or tissues . Their reasons are few but often revolve around religion and culture . <p> They pray their sick , hospitalized relatives will miraculously get well so they hardly even consider organ donation . Many also find it off-putting when hospital staff broach the idea to them . Even when the patient has already signified prior intent to donate -- by signing and keeping the organ donation card in their wallet or by checking the pertinent box on their driver 's license -- it 's still a struggle to convince those they leave behind to honor the wishes of the deceased . <p> Dr. Romina Danguilan , chair of the department of adult nephrology at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute ( NKTI ) in Quezon City , has long been a huge proponent of organ donation in the country . While she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing how organ donation can help save many lives , she says lack of education on the topic is also a hindrance . <p> Scant knowledge " A lot of people still have scant knowledge about organ donation , " Danguilan told Lifestyle in a phone interview .

It has to be continuous education , exposure and awareness about organ donation . " <p> She pointed out that based on surveys conducted in hospitals , even some health-care workers are still not aware that transplants from deceased organ donors can be done . <p> Celebrities who are organ transplant recipients include singer Selena Gomez . <p> " As Christians , we always hope for a miracle and that the patient will wake up .

" <p> Unfortunately , this is hardly the case in the country as NKTI 's division chief of strategy management Nuel Polero II found out . Even before he joined the NKTI , he has long been a regular blood donor , but now he is also an advocate for organ donation . <p> " There are so many sick people so I often donate blood ; it 's my way of helping , " he told Lifestyle in a phone interview .

" My dad was a kidney recipient from the Hope program of NKTI . I promised God I would return the favor if He could give this gift to my dad , and He did . So my passion grew from there , " she said . <p> Tell your loved ones that you are an organ donor -- and keep this card in your wallet . <p> " They have a schedule and usually go to NKTI partner-hospitals to inform the health-care workers there .

The health-care workers should n't be the ones even considering whether this or that organ is viable because it wastes time and can be a hindrance , " she said . <p> Getting more people to consider organ donation is an uphill battle , but steps continue to be made . For example , you can download the I-Hope app on Google Play ( soon on iOS ) that will allow you to fill out the organ donor card electronically . You can then choose which of your organs you are willing to donate upon your death , including cornea , heart , lungs , kidney , liver , pancreas , intestines and bones . <p> While you can keep the filled out card in your phone , Danguilan suggests printing it out and keeping it in your wallet . " But always tell your loved ones that you are an organ donor and that you have an organ donation card in your wallet , " she reiterated . INQ

" she asked incredulously . <p> " Yes . The most romantic thing a guy can do here in Singapore is to ask , ' will you BTO with me ? ' , " I said with a laugh . <p> She seemed flummoxed , and I empathise . Growing up watching Hollywood movies , we all assumed the natural progression would be the proposal first , followed by house hunting . But alas , that is not the case on our sunny island . <p> To cite an example -- a 28-year-old would be 32 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement was four years earlier . <p> And of course , for the women , who needs the inevitable " when are you starting a family " query from well-meaning relatives ? <h> Stay updated with BT newsletters <p> " This is the dilemma I am facing , now that I am looking to settle down with my fiance , " griped a friend who has tried her hand at balloting for a BTO more than five times without success . <p> A home means many different things to people , not least independence and a dream come true . Hence , most would be willing to fork out a pretty penny for it . <p> But now , with resale and rental prices on the rise , and my friend 's BTO nowhere in sight , she was feeling quite beaten down . <p> " My wedding is kind of put on hold now ' cause of this . Can people stop selling HDB flats to make a profit " she sighed . When I raised the idea of living with her parents or in-laws , she vehemently insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's case is not unique . With the much talked about latest cooling measures , I have been hearing stories ranging from laments about living with the in-laws to cases of over-leveraging and borrowing money from the parents to buy a condominium or executive condo ( EC ) unit . <p> There is obviously no panacea as everyone 's situation is different but can anything be done to maybe alleviate the pain ? After all , although 95 per cent of the BTO flat supply in mature estates is set aside for first-timer families , there will always be some who fall through the cracks . <p> Christine Sun , OrangeTee &amp; Tie 's senior vice-president of research and analytics , suggests that young people perhaps consider buying flats in non-mature estates instead . <p> " In the past , many people bought flats in the mature estates for their investment value and convenience . However , in recent years , the narrative may be shifting as more people are willing to pay higher prices for resale flats in non-mature estates . Moreover , with more companies adopting work-from-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a viable option for some people . " <p> She adds that owing to BTO flats ' lower sale prices , some homeowners could even potentially make more profits eventually than those who bought flats in mature estates . <p> Personally , I do think that a smaller three or four-room resale flat , or an EC in the suburb , could also be an option . And Sun concurs . <p> " Sometimes , there could be merits to this strategy of buying a smaller unit first as they will incur less downpayment and smaller monthly mortgages for their first homes . In so doing , they can accumulate or save more cash/CPF funds to upgrade to a bigger home next time , " she says . <p> Property agent Lim Jia Hui points to opportunity cost . <p> " You are setting yourself back another three months every time you try for a BTO and fail . You might want to set yourself a target , and if you still do n't get it after xx attempts , it may be a sign that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , if not better , alternative for couples who had no luck with BTO applications and can afford it . They still get to enjoy CPF grants for first timers , and the track record for EC 's capital appreciation over the years is clear to all . " <p> But one of the pitfalls , of course , is possible over-leveraging . <p> OrangeTee &amp; Tie 's Sun says : " There are stringent rules in place such as the TDSR ( total debt servicing ratio ) and MSR ( mortgage servicing ratio ) . Therefore , most buyers should not be buying beyond their means if they are unable to pass the stress tests . " <p> For me , I thought it best to also seek advice from a banker or a realtor first , which was what I did before I bought a resale flat three years ago . <p> And of course , one can also consider renting in the interim , and perhaps the government can also look into offering more HDB flats for rental . <p> But is there really a magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is , will that cause prices to fall for current HDB flat owners , and how will that affect prices of flats in non-mature estates ? There are ramifications all around . <p> So at the end of the day , it really depends on your own views of the situation , and whether you are buying a home or an investment unit . High property prices are happening not just in Singapore -- it is a harsh reality faced by many people around the world , especially those living in other global financial centres . <p> So as I told my friend , as clich ? as it may sound , she may have to adjust her expectations and stop trying for BTOs in areas such as Bishan or Ang Mo Kio . And that , at the heart of it , it 's about building a life together with your life partner , going through the highs and lows . This journey may also help clarify things and strengthen the relationship . Sounding like an agent , I even offered her the contact info of someone she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thought , leaving me to only hope that I did somehow get through to her .

" <h> Role of GCs with the board and senior management <p> One question is often raised : How should GCs engage and interact with the company 's board and senior management ? <p> Apart from being the repository of the law and regulations that guide businesses , GCs are also asked to provide counsel on applying the law to the fast-evolving business environment , that best positions the company for success . <p> Ben Heineman , a former GC of General Electric , once said : " The General Counsel should ask not just whether something is legal , but whether it is right . " This shift in focus is particularly critical in today 's business landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they only perform the role of being just a legal backstop , simply opining whether a proposed board or management decision will comply with current law . <h> Stay updated with BT newsletters <p> A company 's integrity and business reputation are critical in today 's global business environment , and the GC is in the enviable position to assure that the board recognises this and acts accordingly . Playing a proactive role that encourages a culture of ethical behaviour and compliance is of paramount importance , even as companies operate in an environment where there are multiple shades of grey , far from clear black and white situations . <p> Instead of being avoided , this challenge offers GCs the opportunity to play a pivotal role in strategic counsel -- applying the knowledge of relevant regulatory and legal frameworks to decisions , and providing valuable counsel to the board and senior management on how these guidelines might be employed to maximise a company 's competitive advantage , much the same way like how issues of sustainability and ESG are best seen as opportunities that can be leveraged ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigated or regulations that are simply addressed as a compliance exercise . <p> Notable examples include the pivoting of fossil fuel behemoths like Shell from their traditional business to investments in nature-based solutions that provide natural carbon sinks and the creation of carbon credits that have a more sustainable future than oil production and trading . These exercises would no doubt have been guided by knowledgeable and savvy GCs working with their boards and senior management . <p> Often , boards and senior management may not fully appreciate the proactive ethical and strategic role that GCs can play , and it behooves the GC to educate and highlight the value they can bring . Such opportunities can be the result of a crisis -- such as the Covid pandemic over the past three years , where GCs had the unique opportunity to partner with the board and senior management to develop specific programmes to address crisis management protocol , workplace safety restrictions during the initial Covid lockdowns , supply chain disruptions , contractual repudiations and the like . <p> It is pertinent to note that GCs playing a greater business-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study conducted in January 2022 by US-based boutique executive search firm BarkerGilmore , of the 226 public company board members who participated in the study , 75 per cent want their GC to express views on business strategy and actively participate in strategic planning . This is in addition to carrying out the core responsibilities as legal counsellor and manager of legal risk . <p> To equip GCs with the requisite exposure to play the role , 86 per cent of the directors surveyed say their GC routinely attends nominating/governance committee meetings , while 79 per cent say the GC attends audit committee meetings , with 59 per cent attending compensation committee meetings . Being involved in board and senior management discussions provide GCs the needed perspective on key issues facing the company . <h> Influencer , Persuader , Counsellor <p> In recent years , more GCs have become members of the executive management team , thereby offering opportunities in interacting regularly and closely with the board . In this environment , GCs should assist the board in leveraging its authority to set the tone for the legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , it is also the GC 's duty to take an active role in counselling the board on how legal and regulatory environments can be used to a company 's strategic advantage . <p> Ethisphere , a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices , publishes an annual list of the world 's most ethical companies . In March this year , in its 16th edition , Ethisphere recognised 136 honorees representing 22 countries and 45 industries . <p> In a previous analysis by the American Corporate Counsel , it was observed that most corporations receiving this award of the " World 's Most Ethical Companies " have GCs who are well-positioned to influence the corporate culture of their companies . Notably , 91 per cent of these awardee-companies have GCs reporting to the CEO . In 83 per cent of the firms , the GCs served as secretary of the board with access to the top governing body of their companies . In short , GCs who have the opportunity to interact with their boards should recognise their ability to influence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understated as it allows GCs the opportunity to persuade , lobby and impact areas such as the company 's commitment to ethical business practices , programmes that positively impact employees , communities , and broader stakeholders , and more recently , topical areas like cybersecurity , ESG and sustainability . <p> Trusted Advisor <p> In today 's complex business world , GCs must make use of their deep knowledge of the company , their insight , and broad experience to engage actively with all parts of the business -- going beyond the stereotypical " gatekeeper " perception who only responds with the ' No ' word . Instead , GCs can and should embrace a new persona : Identifying and offering solutions to issues . <p> The challenge can come across as daunting : GCs need to help remove obstacles and foster business objectives in a proactive manner , while at the same time ensuring that the company maintains the highest standards of legal and ethical behaviour . They are to adroitly balance the dual imperatives of company performance and corporate integrity . <p> The enlightened GC will quickly recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the challenges confronting their CFO colleagues , many of whom embrace the challenge and thrive , notwithstanding the discipline and rigours of finance training . These CFOs have learned to be strategic , bringing commercial insights and judgement to the top table . GCs can do likewise . <p> The key to GCs achieving a modicum of success in this space probably comes down to building trust and becoming a confidante of the board and senior management . <p> Becoming a trusted advisor can not be formulaic but one would suggest that GCs with the right personality , the gift of persuasion , and a judicious maintenance of privacy will already have many of the traits that bode well for building trust . <p> Possibly one of the highest accolades that can be paid to a GC by the board or senior management is the statement that " there is nothing that can not be talked about with the GC " . Given the many highly confidential matters that GCs are already involved in -- from major M&amp;As to ethical breaches of the company -- they arguably already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that can be upgraded to being a confidante and trusted advisor . <p> Perhaps one big " hurdle " GCs will need to surmount is having the courage to step out of the usual " legal box " they are accustomed to being in . <p> In this regard , the encouragement of the late Robert F Kennedy provides a useful steer . As a former United States attorney general , who is the GC to the US government , his speech at the University of San Francisco Law School on 29 September 1962 is instructive : <p> " Courage is the most important attribute of a lawyer . It is more important than competence or vision . It can never be an elective in any law school . It can never be delimited , dated or outworn ...

@@94729231 <h> A surprising lack of bids for Bukit Timah and Hillview GLS sites : Are developers less confident ? <p> The bids for two land plots at Bukit Timah and Hillview were a surprise to market watchers this week . These mid-sized plots in proven areas were expected to draw substantial developer attention ; especially with new launches seeing continued demand and a low supply of new homes . However , developer interest was lacklustre ; and it may be a worry for anyone hoping for en-bloc deals this year . <h> Two GLS sites with notable locations <p> The Bukit Timah Link site ( 99-year lease ) has a land area of around 4,611 sqm. , and a GFA of 13,834 sqm . This is a small plot that would yield around 160 units . <p> The location of the Bukit Timah plot will be immediately recognisable to most market watchers : it 's located next to Linq @ Beauty World , one of the fastest-selling projects in 2021 . ( Linq @ Beauty World sold 115 of its 120 units over its launch weekend ) . <p> Like its under-construction counterpart , this site offers walking access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Beauty World Plaza . In addition , the Jalan Anak Bukit land plot , right across the road , will add a major retail component once completed ( see below ) . <p> The winning bid for this site was from Bukit Sembawang Estates , at $1,343.13 psf , or $200 million . This was a notable jump of over 15 per cent from the next highest bid ( Wing Tai ) at $1,161.05 psf . It 's a surprising price given that Jalan Anak Bukit GLS was sold at $989.4 psf , even if it was more than a year ago . <p> The second GLS site was Hillview Rise ( 99-year lease ) . This site area is around 10,395 sqm. , with a GFA of 29,107 sqm . This is sufficient for a small development of around 335 units . <p> This site is across the road from Midwood , which was launched in 2019 and is currently under construction . This site is within walking distance to Hillview MRT ( Downtown Line ) , and is notably close to HillV2 mall ( just across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a five-minute drive from here . <p> The winning bid for this site was from Far East Organization , at $1,023.85 psf , or $320.78 million . This only narrowly topped CDL 's bid , the second highest at $1,011.16 psf . <h> Locations drew fewer bids than expected <p> Market watchers noted that Hillview Rise drew just four bids , with a difference of just over 13.3 per cent between the lowest and highest bids . The Bukit Timah Link site also drew just five bids , despite the attractive city fringe location , and the proven success of Linq @ Beauty World . <p> Market watchers expected higher bids for these sites for two main reasons : <p> The first is that both sites are considered small , with fewer units to move . This is essential in the current market , where ABSD rates for developers are high , and developers must complete and sell every unit in five years . <p> The low number of bids suggests that small developments or not , developers are inclined to play it cautiously in 2022 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming normalised even for fringe region properties , and demand is rising on the back of shrinking housing supply . Both conditions were expected to raise developer confidence . <p> Nonetheless , realtors we spoke to said that despite the smaller number of bids , prices are broadly in line with expectations . They expect eventual prices to be upward of $1,800 psf for the Hillview Rise plot , and prices to be north of $2,200 psf for the Bukit Timah Link plot . <h> What 's dissuading developers from biting ? <p> Realtors pinpointed the September 2022 cooling measures as one of the possible reasons . One realtor said that the market takes time to adapt to cooling measures , and buyers may resort to a wait-and-see approach in the immediate aftermath of 2022 . <p> She feels the recent round of cooling measures are " especially impactful due to loan restrictions " such as the increased interest rate floor , which may disqualify more HDB upgraders from more expensive new launches . <p> Another realtor said that , for the Bukit Timah Link plot , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot that Far East Organization and Sino Group snapped up in 2021 . This is right across the road from Linq @ Beauty World and the Bukit Timah Link plot ; and it 's an integrated development that will include 700 residential units and 150 serviced apartments . <p> The realtor feels that developers want to avoid competing with such upcoming integrated developments , to which buyers have been better inclined from the recent few such projects . <p> Besides this , the general performance of the new launches here previously does give rise to some concern . Only The Linq @ Beauty World can be said to have sold well . Others like Midwood , Dairy Farm Residences , and Verdale definitely experienced slow sales in the early days , only to pick up once supply was constrained in other areas of Singapore . <h> Cautious developers may be bad news for those seeking en-bloc deals <p> A particular worry is rising interest rates -- these not only raise financing costs for developers , they impact the affordability of homes , and HDB upgraders ( the majority of buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates may also turn investors away from property assets , such as if the rates begin to eat significantly into returns and rental yields .

The collapse has shaken investor confidence in cryptocurrencies and led to calls from lawmakers and others for greater regulation of the industry .

Bankman -- Fried founded Alameda Research three years later , billing it as " a crypto quant trading firm . " <p> Rejected initially by venture investors , he cobbled together loans and assembled a team of young traders and programmers , many of them sleeping and working in a small walkup apartment in the San Francisco area , according to a profile that later appeared on the website of FTX investor Sequoia . <p> Alameda found early trading success by arbitraging cryptocurrency prices on international markets , with half of profits going to charity , according to the same profile . By 2019 , the company handled $55 million for clients , an Alameda company booklet said . Reuters could not independently confirm these details . <p> The booklet flagged the risks of crypto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " domino effect " that would lead to a " cascading set of liquidity failures .

His aim was to build an " FTX Superapp " that combined cryptocurrency trading , betting markets , stock trading , banking , and peer-to-peer and business payments , according to an FTX marketing document from earlier this year . <p> The company 's growth over the next two years was only surpassed by his vision . <p> FTX 's revenues grew from $10 million in 2019 to $1 billion in 2021 . From almost nothing in 2019 , FTX handled about 10% of global crypto trading this year , a September document shows . It spent roughly $2 billion buying companies , the document shows . <p> In an undated document , titled ' FTX Roadmap 2022 , ' the company laid out its goals for the next five to 10 years . It hoped to be " the largest global financial exchange , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. retail brokerage giant Fidelity Investments earned in revenues last year . <p> In October 2021 , Bankman -- Fried , then 29 years old , landed on the cover of Forbes , which pegged his net worth at $26.5 billion -- the 25th richest person in America . FTX said on its website that " FTX , its affiliates , and its employees have donated over $10m to help save lives , prevent suffering , and ensure a brighter future . " <p> Bankman -- Fried 's personal finances suggest he lived frugally for a billionaire . A financial statement reviewed by Reuters shows that for 2021 , he drew an annual salary of $200,000 , declared $1 million in real estate assets , and spent $50,000 on personal expenses . <p> But in the Bahamas , his lifestyle was more luxurious than his finances showed .

Bankman -- Fried became a regular presence in Washington , donating tens of millions of dollars to politicians and lobbying lawmakers on crypto markets . <p> FTX was also planning partnerships with some of the world 's largest companies . An FTX document from June 2022 , which has not been previously reported , shows a list of FTX 's " select partners " for business-to-business ( B2B ) services . Prospective partners included retail giant Walmart Inc , social media titan Meta Platforms Inc , payment-system provider Stripe , and financial website Yahoo !

" <p> A person with knowledge of the matter said Stripe has no contract with FTX to enable Stripe users to accept crypto payments . Walmart did n't respond to a request for comment about a proposed partnership with FTX for employee investing . Meta too did n't comment about discussions to make FTX a digital-wallet provider for Instagram users . <p> Investors loved Bankman -- Fried 's ambition . FTX had already received more than $2 billion from backers including Sequoia , SoftBank Group Corp , BlackRock Inc and Temasek . In January , FTX raised a further $400 million , valuing the business at $32 billion . <p> FTX expected to take its international and U.S. businesses public , an investor due-diligence document from this June said . The document is reported here for the first time . <p> At the peak of his powers , Bankman -- Fried urged the crypto industry to help governments shape laws to supervise it , saying FTX 's goal was to become " one of the most regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanest brand in crypto , " it proclaimed earlier this year . <p> Behind his rapid growth , there was a secret Bankman -- Fried kept from most other employees : he had dipped into customer funds to pay for some of his projects , according to company documents and people briefed on FTX 's finances . Doing so was explicitly barred in the exchange 's terms of use , which affirmed user deposits " shall at all times remain with you . " <p> FTX generated 2 cents in fees for every $100 traded , documents seen by Reuters show , reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue by 2021 . Nonetheless , FTX barely broke even during its first two years , 2019 and 2020 . It generated around $450 million in profit in 2021 , when crypto markets boomed , but it slumped to a $161 million loss in the second quarter of this year , according to financial records , which are reported here for the first time . <p> Some of the $10 billion in removed customers ' money went to cover losses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including in failed crypto lender Voyager Digital , according to the three FTX sources briefed on the company 's finances . <p> FTX also financed acquisitions such as the purchase in May of a $640 million stake in trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc . Robinhood did n't respond to a request for comment . <p> Bankman -- Fried told Reuters he did not believe that Alameda had substantial losses , including on Voyager , without providing further details . <p> Around $1 billion of the $10 billion sum is not accounted for among Alameda 's assets , Reuters reported on Friday . Reuters has not been able to trace these missing funds . <p> According to the three FTX sources , only Bankman -- Fried 's innermost circle of associates knew about his use of client deposits : his co-founder and chief technology officer , Gary Wang ; the head of engineering , Nishad Singh ; and Caroline Ellison , chief executive of Alameda . Wang and Singh both worked with Bankman -- Fried at Alameda previously . <p> Wang , Singh and Ellison did not return requests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Alameda , Wang , a former Google software developer , built a backdoor in FTX 's book-keeping software , the people said . <p> Bankman -- Fried often told employees tasked with monitoring the company 's financials that the book-keeping system was " the ultimate source of truth " about the company 's accounts , two of the people said . But the backdoor , known only to his most trusted lieutenants , allowed Alameda to withdraw crypto deposits without triggering internal red flags , they said . <p> FTX also had a vulnerability : its bespoke cryptocurrency . <p> Shortly after its launch , FTX introduced its own digital token , called FTT , described on its website as the exchange 's " backbone . " Staff could opt to receive pay and bonuses in the token , and many of them accumulated fortunes in FTT as its value exploded in 2021 , according to the three current and former executives . One executive invested all their savings in FTT , worth millions of dollars , the executive said , " because of loyalty to Sam . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Fried sent to a potential investor and the company 's financial records , FTX paid $400 million to an Alameda subsidiary since 2019 as " software royalty " payments for development work . The subsidiary used the funds to buy FTT and remove the digital tokens from supply , so supporting the price . <p> FTX disclosed on its website that it was using part of its trading fees to buy FTT . It did not reveal the arrangement with Alameda . <p> Over the years , Alameda accumulated a huge holding of FTT , valued at around $6 billion before last week , according to a balance sheet later sent to investors . It used the FTT reserves to secure corporate loans , people familiar with its finances said . This meant that Bankman -- Fried 's business empire was dependent on the token . <p> Bankman -- Fried retorted on Twitter that Zhao was spreading " false rumors . " In a since-deleted tweet , he wrote : " FTX has enough to cover all client holdings . We do n't invest client assets . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alameda to buy more of the tokens in an attempt to stabilize the price , a person with knowledge of the trades said . Customers panicked and rushed to withdraw deposits from FTX , with over $100 million flowing out of the firm each hour that Sunday , company documents reviewed by Reuters show . <p> In his email to Reuters , Bankman -- Fried said , " To my knowledge , Alameda did not buy very much FTT during the crash to stabilize it . " <p> Staff initially remained calm . The finance team could still see ample assets on the book-keeping portal as of last week . About $10 billion in client deposits remained , with a $1.5 billion surplus to cover any further withdrawals , according to a screenshot of the database seen by Reuters . <p> In reality , those funds were gone . <p> Several hours after Zhao 's Sunday tweet , Bankman -- Fried has told Reuters , he gathered his lieutenants Wang and Singh at his apartment to decide on a plan . It was a " rough weekend , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're chugging along . " <p> The following day , he summoned several other senior managers to his home to join Wang and Singh . He broke the news to them : FTX was almost out of money . <p> This account of the scramble that ensued is based on interviews with three current and former FTX executives briefed by top staff and documents that Reuters reviewed . <p> Bankman -- Fried showed the executives spreadsheets that revealed there was a $10 billion hole in FTX 's finances -- because customer deposits had been transferred to Alameda and mostly spent on other assets . The executives were shocked . One of them told Bankman -- Fried the spreadsheet presentation contradicted what FTX told regulators about its use of client funds . <p> To make up the shortfall , they calculated that Alameda could sell around $3 billion of the assets within hours , mainly money held in company trading accounts on other crypto exchanges . The rest would take days or weeks to offload because it was hard to trade those assets . And FTX urgently needed a further $7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Fried 's search for a savior . <p> While money continued to drain away from FTX , the three sources told Reuters , he and his aides worked through the night , contacting about a dozen potential investors . <p> He turned to the crypto community , too , ringing up the organization behind Tether , the world 's largest stablecoin , and asking for a loan . His father , Joseph Bankman , a Stanford Law professor , also arrived to advise his son . Bankman did not respond to a request for comment . In return for any funding , Bankman -- Fried pledged to investors most of Alameda 's assets , including its holding of FTT , along with his own 75% stake in FTX . But no one came through with an offer . <p> One of the investors who turned down Bankman -- Fried said his numbers were " very amateurish , " without elaborating . Another red flag was that the spreadsheets showed ties between FTX and Alameda , the investor said . <p> Around 3 a.m. , Bankman -- Fried resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known by the initials CZ , came to the phone . A few hours later , Zhao sent over a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX.com , which Bankman -- Fried signed . The pair tweeted a joint announcement later that morning . <p> For most FTX employees , this was the first they heard about the company 's dire situation . " Just complete disbelief and feelings of betrayal , " Zane Tackett , FTX 's head of institutional sales , wrote on Twitter the day after . He declined to comment . <p> Tackett and some others resigned . " I ca n't do it any more , " another FTX team member texted colleagues . <p> To worsen the pain , the price of the FTT token crashed 80% within three hours of the news , shrinking Alameda 's assets further and wiping out many employees ' net worth . The executive with millions of dollars in FTT said watching it collapse " was like seeing my world diminishing . " <p> Bankman -- Fried pleaded for employees ' forgiveness on Slack , saying he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " fight another day . " Less than 30 hours later , Binance pulled out , citing its due diligence . Sequoia then wrote off its $150 million investment in FTX . <p> Scrambling to find a savior , Bankman -- Fried expanded his search around the world . " I 'll keep fighting , " he messaged staff . <p> He sought to persuade officials at major financial institutions such as Saudi Arabia 's Public Investment Fund and Japanese investment bank Nomura Holdings Inc to invest , according to a message he sent on Thursday to advisors , along with two other people familiar with the talks . Those appeals are reported here for the first time . PIF and Nomura did not comment . <p> Bankman -- Fried also tried to get a group of crypto firms to each pitch in $1 billion .

They speculated that the PTI leader made this announcement because he had no other option left , after telling his followers that he would spring a surprise at the gathering in Rawalpindi -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garrison city . <p> Addressing a large gathering , the former PM declared that his party would not remain part of this " current corrupt political system any longer " where people accused of billions in corruption got away without punishment . <p> However , Mr Khan clarified that he would discuss the matter with the chief ministers and a final decision in this regard would be made after the PTI 's parliamentary party met . <p> Commenting on the fizzling out of the month-long ' Haqeeqi Azadi March ' , Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency ( Pildat ) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob was of the view that Mr Khan had no other option but to make such an announcement after creating a massive hype around the long march . <p> " If Imran really wanted to give a surprise , he should have sounded definitive as he had so much time for consultations with party leaders , " Mr Mehboob said . <p> He said that the PTI had not categorically stated that they would dissolve the assemblies and that mere resignations would not serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if PTI members simply opted to resign from the provincial assemblies of KP and Punjab , they would not be able to force elections .

" <p> When pressed for more clarity , he said that since there had been a change in the military leadership , it seems Mr Khan now wants to seriously engage with them . <p> In Mr Mehboob 's words , the message he is trying to send is something to the effect of : " Do not take me lightly . I am a very important person .

It is just a signal to the new military leadership that ' I want to operate within the system , but do ask the government to hold the elections ' .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling party would not be able to dissolve the assembly under the Constitution . <p> Time limit <p> According to constitutional experts , if Mr Khan is serious about this move , he will have to make a decision within the next couple of months . <p> He technically has until March to make up his mind , because under the Constitution , if the PTI takes such a decision in April , it will not be able to force elections . <p> Under Article 224(4) of the Constitution : " When , except by dissolution of the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly , a general seat in any such Assembly has become vacant not later than one hundred and twenty days before the term of that Assembly is due to expire , an election to fill the seat shall be held within sixty days from the occurrence of the vacancy .

Can you give us three to five reasons why you chose to enter APAC 's fintech space ? I would n't pretend I see pain points in APAC . I do n't see them . I 'm here also to learn . I do n't know APAC too well , but what I can see is what has gone fast , and what has gone slow . In Europe , what has gone fast , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you look at ESG issues , ESG for financial data , I think it has gotten faster in Europe , because of regulation in Europe . <p> For instance , some of these fintech companies can really be helpful here in the crypto area . I think it 's still very open and we have some very good companies in Europe , we have very good tech in the blockchain area . <p> It 's not about pain points . It 's just a land of opportunity . I think the regulation is softer here . So it 's good for these companies to develop in both Europe and in Asia , or Europe and the US , because you have different regulatory playgrounds and you do n't know what will be the end game , so you need to try different things . So it 's not really about pain points . <p> I think the big difference between Asia and Europe is the place of incumbent banking industry . In Europe , you have a very strong incumbent banking industry , and everyone is banked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . And at the same time , you have very good financial hubs like Singapore . So it 's a very interesting mix between very mature industries and very open markets . Whereas in Europe , it 's tougher to address . <p> Why do you think APAC is a market suited for the French fintechs to conquer ? No , I think it 's suited for some companies . Not for all . But I think it 's super easy , if you 're a data analytics provider , if you 're in the regulatory area , you 're a fit . And definitely if you 're in the environmental transition industry , the ESG part of the business , it is very suited too because we have a lot of constraints already in the EU , to which people have had to adapt . <p> How do you see France 's fintech market and how does it compare to APAC ? I think we have bigger companies that are much more dynamic in terms of market growth . We have very good technology in Europe too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the competition is intense , which includes banks . <p> One of the big differences I observed here in Singapore and from my previous trips is that the partnership between banks and fintechs are more efficient here in Asia . If you look at the relations between DBS and fintechs . In Singapore , it 's very intense . We have this in Europe , but the balance between FinTechs and banks are not the same . Banks are bigger and not as keen to partner . <p> A bit of the same thing for regulatory authorities . I think MAS here in Singapore has done a great job collaborating , even if it 's difficult and even if they are still trying to find the right balance . They have been very open to crypto , so they had some failures . But now moving forward , they are trying things , which is a very interesting approach . I like it . <p> How are you enjoying your experience in SFF ? So far , so good . It 's really huge . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a very good FinTech festival , it 's much more targeted .

PHOTOS : AFP , ST FILE , EPA-EFE , REUTERS <p> PARIS - A year of extraordinary upheaval , from the war in Ukraine to catastrophic natural disasters .

The demonstrations became known in some quarters as the " A4 " protests as protesters held up blank A4-sized sheets of white paper in a sign of solidarity and a nod to the lack of free speech in China . <h> Armageddon <p> With the war in Ukraine and increasingly strident threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin , the spectre of nuclear warfare is stalking the globe for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis " in 1962 , US President Joe Biden warned in October .

The Supreme Court ruled that individual states could restrict or ban the procedure -- a decision seized upon by several right-leaning states . Protests erupted instantly in Washington and elsewhere , showing how divisive the topic remains in the United States . The overturning of " Roe v.

The tabloid Daily Star leapt on the idea , launching a live web cam featuring said vegetable -- complete with googly eyes -- next to a picture of the hapless Truss .

At least two men died of injuries they sustained at the site in Langkat , North Sumatra , while being held captive . <p> As the victims toiled in the plantation and nearby factory without pay , the palm oil it produced was flowing into the supply chains of some of the world 's most famous brands . Public disclosures from firms including Unilever and Nestl ? - the manufacturers of Dove soap and KitKats respectively - show they sourced from the plantation . <p> This week , eight men were sentenced to prison sentences ranging between 19 months and three years , for human trafficking and causing the deaths of two men .

Those who attempted to escape were subjected to sadistic punishments : forced to eat a bag of MSG , or having their toenails crushed . <p> " Being beaten was mandatory , " said Putra . He and the other victim spoke to The Gecko Project on condition of anonymity ( their names have been changed for this article ) . <p> Unilever said in a statement that it had suspended purchases from the plantation after it became aware of the allegations .

Almost all of the 73 million tonnes of the edible oil produced each year comes from plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia , where labour is provided by migrant workers or local villagers . <p> A 2020 investigation by the Associated Press that examined the practices of two dozen palm oil companies found child labour , " outright slavery " and allegations of rape from female workers .

Reckitt did not confirm the identify of the supplier . <p> Reckitt also sourced palm oil from the plantation in Langkat , as recently as 2022 . It learned of the allegations in January 2022 , when they were reported by the environmental news site Mongabay , and subsequently suspended the company as a supplier . <p> Anis Hidayah , executive director of the Indonesian human rights organisation Migrant Care , which monitored the case in Langkat , said the remote location of palm oil plantations and a lack of government supervision make workers vulnerable to abuse . " If there were no researchers who went there , no one would know , " she said . <p> The Langkat case was only exposed when anti-corruption investigators raided the home of Terbit Rencana Perangin-angin , the elected head of Langkat district , in January this year .

The video has since been removed . <p> Terbit was not charged with any offences related to the use of forced labour or the deaths at his home . However , he was convicted of corruption in October , for accepting 572 million rupiah , about $35,000 , to decide a tender in favour of a contractor . He was sentenced to nine years in prison . <p> Terbit did not respond to a request for comment , sent via his spokesperson . <p> Sariandi Ginting attended the final hearing on November 30 with his wife , wearing a t-shirt and flip-flops .

In a letter released three days later , the company said it had made improvements to labour practices in the past 18 months . <p> It insisted that RSPO 's conclusion did not reflect the current state of its operations , noting that the assessment team had identified violations of standards , including the payment of unreported recruitment fees to agents , sub-agents or other parties , and the retention of passports .

The cattle grazer had been planning to sell some sheep this Dashain , a 15-day harvest festival that is celebrated across the country and held from September to October each year , so that he could pay off the interest on his purchase , and have some leftover money to spend . But a lightning incident on 1 July ruined his plans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some groceries , but now my entire shed is empty , " said Nepali , who has had sleepless nights since his loss . " How wilI I pay off the loan now ? " <p> When the lightning occurred , Nepali had taken refuge under a tent in the meadows along with other shepherds . He recalls that it had started to rain heavily around 1 pm on that fateful day , and after an hour of rain , thunderous lightning struck , lighting up the fields for a second . <p> Then came darkness . " We all fainted . When we came to our senses half an hour later , we saw that the sheep had fallen to the ground , " Nepali said . <p> For another cattle grazer Ram Bahadur Reule , 50 sheep were killed and over 100 went missing when that same lightning striked Patarasi , Jumla .

Total sheep numbers are at about 30,000 , according to an estimate by the chief of the Animal Husbandry department in the municality . However , due to lightning strikes that have become a more frequent occurence , residents like Ram Bahadur and Nepali have sufferred cattle losses , which in turn have affected their livelihoods . <p> Sheep rearing and agriculture form the source of income for the people of the rural municipality which has a wide expanse of land . The municipality has a population of 19,000 people and 3,300 households . <p> Grazing sheep on a meadow in Jumla , Nepal . Image : Mukesh Pokharel <p> According to Dhan Bahadur Budha , an officer at the District Veterinarian 's Office , a sheep usually sells for between Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 , but the price of sheep has also increased from last year . This makes the loss of the cattle grazers even dearer . <p> According to the official death toll calculated by the Patarasi rural municipality , 130 sheep were killed by the lightning strike in July , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 . The office has kept records since three years ago as farmers had asked for compensation for killed cattle . In August 2020 , 217 sheep had also been killed by a lightning strike in Patarasi 's Baghjale area , according to its record . <p> The following year in June , 81 sheep and goats were killed in Patarasi 's Bajeri Patan . <p> Informal estimates put the death toll since 2015 at 1,500 . <h> Why always Baghjale ? <p> Why do lightning strikes frequently occur in Baghjale ? A study has yet to be conducted on this issue , although climate experts say that the incidence of lightning strikes have increased due to global warming and climate change . <p> Shreeram Sharma , associate professor of physics at Nepal 's Amrit Science Campus says that the rate of effect due to lightning , which includes death by lightning , increases 10- to 20-fold with an increase of 1 degree Celsius in temperature . According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology , Jumla has witnessed a yearly temperature rise of 0.052 ? C on average . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? C in the past 20 years . <h> How does a lightning strike occur ? <p> A lightning strike is a high-voltage electric current produced due to friction within clouds . Globally , there are three lightning strike hotspots : the middle region of Africa , the region between South and North Americas , and East Asia . <p> East Asian countries such as Indonesia , Singapore , and Malaysia are epicentres of lightning strikes . The Bay of Bengal also has a small region that is susceptible to lightning strikes , and it is what leads to lightning strikes in Nepal . <p> In Nepal , the Terai and Chure regions witness maximum lightning strikes because of high temperatures . As the temperature rises , hot air ascends towards the atmosphere . When the vapourised air meets obstruction around the northern hills , there is a disturbance in the atmosphere , which leads to lightning strikes . <p> April , May , June and July record the highest lightning strikes . While most lightning strikes usually occur between 12 noon to 4 pm , monsoon and post-monsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr Indira Kandel , senior meteorologist at India 's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology , the temperature rise in Jumla is substantial and expected to " create havoc in its ecology " . <p> Experts say that a lightning strike can be foretold half an hour before the strike , which gives sufficient time for farmers to evacuate their cattle . " Censors detect clouds that are susceptible to lightning strikes , " Sharma said . " We can minimise the risks if censors are put up in risk areas and farmers are given early warning . " <p> According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority , there are plans to set up early warning systems in places where there are risks of lightning strikes . The authority says this minimises the risks as the farmers receive warnings in advance . <h> Insufficient compensation <p> The Karnali provincial government and the Patarasi rural municipality have been providing compensation to farmers who lose their sheep . However , farmers say that the compensation is insufficient compared to their losses . <p> According to Dan Bahadur Bista , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 allow for a compensation of Rs.2,000 ( US$15.40 ) per sheep . <p> The Karnali provincial government pays slightly more , at Rs.4,000 ( US$30.80 ) per sheep . Purna Singh Bohora , the chairperson of the rural municipality , agrees that the compensation is not enough . " We are trying to look for long-term solutions , " he said . <p> According to Bohara , installing an early warning system or ' earthing ' to reduce the lightning risks are technologies the rural municipality can not afford . The municipality is in talks with the United Kingdom Government 's Nepal Climate Support Program to see if they can help support the installation of an earthing system in the meadows , he said . <h> Political apathy <p> The issue , being quite technical and scientific , has also failed to attract the attention of political parties . Major parties might have included climate change as something they want to deal with in their manifestoes , but there is general apathy towards the impact of lightning strikes on farmers ' livelihoods , said local leaders . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress and the chief of the District Coordination Committee said : " We also can not stop lightning strikes by making it an electoral issue . We need to focus on the losses that people are bearing . " <p> There is a need to implement an effective sheep insurance program to support the farmers , experts say . <p> According to Anil Pokharel , chief executive officer of the National Disaster Risks Minimisation and Management Authority , an insurance programme in place now does not reach the targeted farmers . <p> Pokharel believes that in Nepal , it is impossible to deal with issues related to a natural disaster without the commitment and involvement of political parties . " It should become a political issue if we are to secure the achievements we have made in the past 20 years , " he said . <p> The government currently has no data on the financial loss due to lightning strikes , but there is proof that it is lethal , beyond killing cattle . According to a study by a team including academic Sri Ram Sharma , 930 individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and April 15 , 2020 . This means that almost 103 individuals die each year due to lightning strikes . In the same period , 2,454 individuals have been wounded in lightning incidents .

@@95496239 <h> Caf ? culture and sustainable development in Southeast Asia <h> The region has a specialty coffee industry that is booming . But profits from the highly-priced coffee drinks do not translate to increased incomes for growers . Government subsidies and better consumer awareness can help . <p> Coffee is one of the most important agricultural products traded globally . While coffee production is concentrated in developing countries , its consumption mainly takes place in developed countries and emerging economies . <p> Two Southeast Asian countries -- Vietnam and Indonesia -- are among the world 's top five largest coffee producers . Coffee is also an important source of agricultural export earnings for Laos , earning the country US$72.5 million in 2021 ( roughly 0.5 per cent of its gross domestic product ) . According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in 2020 , more than 20,000 small farming families in Laos relied on the sales of coffee beans for their livelihoods . Additionally , over 300,000 people ( about 6 per cent of the workforce ) worked in the coffee industry . <p> Most coffee growers in developing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coffee roasters and international traders , in contrast , dominate the global coffee commodity chain and capture significant shares of the profits , which do not trickle down to the farmers . There had been previous international collaborations to raise and stabilise coffee prices , perhaps most notably the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) , established in 1962 . However , after the ICA regime collapsed in 1989 , due to a lack of support from member countries , international coffee prices became much more volatile and market concentration also increased , tilting the market in favour of the bigger players . <p> In response to this price volatility , some non-governmental initiatives , which aim to support farmers ' livelihoods and environmental sustainability by setting socio-environmental production standards in exchange for higher prices , have sprung up . One example is Fairtrade International -- a transnational sustainability label programme that marks products with a Fairtrade symbol . Fairtrade products are often sold at higher prices because small-scale farmers are guaranteed a minimum price for their crop that will protect them from sudden price drops . Additionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment on top of the selling price to be spent on socially beneficial purposes -- paid to their groups or cooperatives . <p> Many Fairtrade coffee growers also have organic certifications that ensure environmentally sustainable production . In Indonesia , there are around 25 Fairtrade-certified coffee cooperatives and 98 per cent of them have organic certifications . Having organic and Fairtrade certifications increase market opportunities for coffee growers and enable them to fetch higher prices from consumers willing to pay a premium for sustainable coffee . <p> Coffee buyers can forge long-term trust and relationships with producer groups to eliminate the need for third-party certifications , which can be costly . Jhai Coffee Farmers Cooperative ( JCFC ) in Laos , for example , has been selling specialty coffee to a Japanese company -- Alter Trade Japan ( ATJ ) -- since 2010 . Instead of asking for organic and Fairtrade certifications , ATJ sent 35 personnel to work with farmers and inspect the production process . ATJ also gives extra payments , similar to Fairtrade premiums , to the village fund . <p> Governments and non-government organisations can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Fairtrade certification fees , until these farmer groups are financially self-reliant . <p> Reflecting global trends , many Southeast Asians enjoy high-quality specialty coffee and caf ? " ambience consumption " . The specialty coffee industry in Thailand , for example , started two decades ago and is still expected to grow rapidly in the next few years . Similar trends can be found in other Southeast Asian countries . In the cosmopolitan cities of Singapore , Jakarta , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , Ho Chi Minh City , and Manila , independent caf ? s and domestic coffee chains have flourished alongside international coffee chains . <p> Southeast Asian coffee chains sometimes distinguish themselves from international chains by selling ' traditional style ' coffee like Vietnam 's cafe sua da and coffee mixed with yogurt or egg yolks , kopitubruk in Indonesia , kafaeboran in Thailand , and barako in the Philippines . Many cafes have become popular hang-outs with decorations especially designed for younger , Instagram- or selfie-oriented customers . Cafes situated near rivers or in farmlands around Bangkok see huge influxes of weekend domestic and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pandemic restrictions have eased . Specialty drinks and such " ambience consumption " enable these caf ? s to charge relatively high prices , but unfortunately , the profits do not necessarily translate to increased incomes for coffee growers nor to production sustainability . <p> Despite the high growth potential for the organic and Fairtrade coffee sector in Southeast Asia , certification costs remain rather high for small-scale coffee grower groups . Many of them struggle with the paperwork and to meet higher production standards . Governments and non-government organisations can help newly formed producer groups , such as by subsidising costly organic or Fairtrade certification fees , until these farmer groups are financially self-reliant . Additionally , ASEAN could encourage more intra-regional trading of coffee that will benefit coffee-producing and consuming countries . <p> Since many Southeast Asian consumers are already willing to pay higher prices for specialty coffee and caf ? ambience , they might also consider supporting caf ? s that are committed to purchasing sustainably produced local and regional coffee , and to giving coffee growers fairer prices .

So we started thinking : ' Well , how do we solve that ? ' <p> " We 'd seen these things that you put around your neck that blew a little bit of air up . We realised very quickly they do not work . By the time any clean air gets to your nose and mouth it 's so mixed with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The realisation of the need for a bubble of clean air around the nose , and for the bubble to move as the head turns , convinced engineers that the wearable purifier had to be mounted on headgear such as a pair of headphones . <p> Headphones are an established category of products and would be less challenging than creating a new contraption for the head , Mr Knox added . <p> The initial concept for the wearable purifier comprised a backpack motor and filtration system connected to a snorkel-like mouthpiece . Compared with the initial unwieldy design , the final product -- after testing more than 500 prototypes over six years in its Malmesbury and Hullavington labs in Britain -- is smaller and more discreet . <p> The Zone pulls in air through each earpiece using a pair of low-noise motors , a miniaturised version of the company 's existing technology . The air is then cleaned by electrostatic filters mounted on the earcup and piped through the visor for the user to breathe in . <p> The visor sits in front of but does not touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnets , allowing it to be flipped down or easily removed . <p> Dyson said the pair of filters will last up to 12 months , depending on geographical location and usage levels , capturing most ultrafine particles -- which can be as small as 0.1 micron . City gas pollutants like nitrogen dioxide , sulphur dioxide and ozone as well as unpleasant smells from organic compounds will also be filtered . <p> Dyson makes no claims that the Zone is able to replace the surgical masks worn during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic . But scientists have reportedly said that the Covid-19 virus , around 0.1 micron in size , is always bonded to something larger , such as water droplets or mucus protein of more than one micron . <p> nid:570902 <p> The headphones , although a completely new market for the company , take a more traditional approach to sound reproduction by sticking to musicians ' original tracks .

Similarly , visor airflow automatically pauses when the visor dips . <p> Use of embedded accelerometers automates airflow for different levels of exertion . For example , if the user is climbing a flight of stairs or jogging , the airflow will be adjusted up . <p> The company 's global headquarters in Singapore -- staffed by 1,400 employees , of whom 560 are engineers and scientists -- is key to the software development that adds this automated " intelligence " to the product . <p> Ms Zhang Chunrui , Dyson 's head of embedded software for South-east Asia , said : " The algorithm we developed powers the auto mode , when software takes over the function of the Zone . " <p> Ms Zhang , who manages 150 software engineers in Singapore , Malaysia and the Philippines , said that only about 20 people were involved in the development of the Zone . Most of the heavy lifting happened during the lockdown phase of the pandemic in Singapore and Malaysia . <p> " It was a challenge as most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that we could go back to the office even in a limited way , " she said . " Software integration had to be done in the office because of the need to use the hardware prototype , which could not leave the premises for confidentiality reasons . " <p> An accompanying app , dubbed MyDyson , acts like a remote control for the Zone . Although the app was developed in Britain , the Singapore team is behind the cloud services pushed through the app . <p> These cloud services include user registration , hardware pairing with the app and new features to be downloaded to the headphones over the air . <p> Testing for the product was done in the company 's Malaysian development centre in Johor . User trials were conducted in the US , Britain , China and Singapore . <p> The market is expected to grow to more than US$184 billion by 2031 , according to Allied Market Research . <p> Dyson 's entry into the wearable market comes six years after it entered the beauty industry with the launch of its first hand-held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was positioned as a premium hair dryer , a first then .
