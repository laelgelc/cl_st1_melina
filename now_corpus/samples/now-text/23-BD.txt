A bill is being introduced in the Colorado Legislature to create a $2-million pilot program to use cameras likely equipped with artificial intelligence technology in high-risk areas to help identify fires before they can burn out of control . ( AP Photo/David Zalubowski , File ) <p> A year after the most destructive wildfire in the state 's history scorched nearly 1,100 homes , Colorado lawmakers are considering joining other Western states by adopting artificial intelligence in the hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control . <p> A Colorado Senate committee on Thursday unanimously voted to move forward a bill to create a $2 million pilot program that would station cameras on mountaintops , and use artificial intelligence to monitor the footage and help detect early signs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appropriations Committee next . <p> " It can detect just a wisp of smoke and it 's that type of situation in remote areas that could save forests and homes and properties and lives , " Democratic state Sen. Joann Ginal , one of the bill 's sponsors , said in the hearing . <p> The deployment of AI is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter about how they prepare and better position their resources . Fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced by cameras in remote areas , many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog . <p> There are hundreds of such cameras scattered across California , Nevada , Oregon and a handful already in Colorado that allow even casual viewers to remotely watch . <p> Vaughn Jones , who heads wildland fire management for Colorado 's fire prevention agency , said the technology " allows us to take very aggressive early action and keep the impact down ... not waiting until the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive . <p> Record-breaking storms that drenched California with more than 11 inches ( 27.94 centimeters ) of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the short-term , but the drought persists across many western states , according to a Tuesday report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . <p> The Colorado program would support 40 fixed camera stations and six more mobile stations that can be moved to monitor ongoing fires , Ben Miller , the director at the Center of Excellence , which researches technology for firefighting , said at Thursday 's hearing . <p> The AI algorithm behind the camera would try to detect a plume of smoke and alert first responders early , said Miller , who pointed to a structure fire caught by AI technology near the city of Boulder in December as an example . <p> Boulder County had partnered with an AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had alerted authorities of the fire around the time the first 911 call arrived , Miller said . One home was destroyed and another damaged before the fire was contained -- a far better outcome than a year before when the Marshal Fire , also near Boulder , burned over 1,000 structures . <p> " The more you train the model , the better and better it gets , " said Miller , who added that his agency is very interested in the technology but that it 's still burgeoning and that a pilot program is a good place to start . <p> Pano AI began working with cities , including the ski resort town of Aspen , Colorado , and has expanded to cities , counties and even Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in six states .

The 6th Dhaka Art Summit ( DAS ) stands as a testament to the growth of accessibility to art . One of the largest art exhibitions in South Asia , DAS began on February 3 and concludes today . <p> During these 8 days of celebration , the exhibition featured 160 artists , both local and foreign . Throngs of people flocked in , especially on holidays to take pictures , peruse and analyse art . Now the question is what draws such crowds to events like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , art exhibitions were confined to a particular social class even till the late 2000s . Lately with the in-stream of social media , the status quo and celebration of diverse perspectives . During my last visit , I had the chance to run into a lungi clad individual , a rare sight yet a welcoming one- in crowds of sarees and patchwork denims . Giving the chance of being able to interpret without the interruption of being divided based on money or even outlooks- everyone wants to learn . <p> There is also this in-seam of people in the art niche , who do raise the question/statement- " They 're only here to take pictures with the art " . I pose it as an underlying question rather than a pressing one , which indicates towards an intellectual elitism harboured within . Putting a distinction on whether we are allowed to take pictures , or rather who is the defining trait of such elitism . Even professional photographers take pictures of the artworks that you gaze at in newspapers , why is it any different that seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a parameter which defines who enjoys art ? A core theory of fine art is that it exists for enjoyment and consumption , no matter in whichever form it is transported in- in a feature writing or as someone 's profile picture background . <p> Whether it is context , knowledge or simply to take part in the dispersion of intellectual property , more people are now visiting art exhibitions . Last weekday 's visit to DAS showed exactly that , with the authority even having to almost prohibit taking pictures of artworks , so that everyone has the chance to gaze upon and immerse in the artworks displayed . <p> In essence , it is impossible to judge the merit of an event based on the crowd itself , however , if more people are inclined to check out what was previously considered an ' elite ' pastime , it is a win for both art and the artists . This is where Dhaka Art Summit was successful where so many exhibitions of similar stature failed .

It has this uncanny knack of producing moments of controversy just when the whole nation is looking towards it with great anticipation . <p> As the nation was celebrating the latest achievement of its indomitable girls in the form of the SAFF U-20 Women 's Championship triumph on Thursday night , a sorry episode was unraveling right in front of the media while the team was busy celebrating . One of the most important architects of the success was left in the lurch -- deprived of the winner 's medal -- for he had become one too many in that group dominated by privileged officials . <p> Masud Ahmed Ujjol , the goalkeeping coach of the team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name did not come up on the list of medal winners , instead there were names of two team leaders and two assistant team leaders on the list to receive medals from the podium . It is hard to find logic in deeming those four officials more fitting for a medal than the one whose protege had just received the best goalkeeper award . <p> No matter how humiliating this latest saga is for the coaching staff and the team members , it should not actually come as a surprise to them at all . They have had the taste of it before . <p> Remember what happened when Bangladesh won the SAFF Women 's Championship for the first time just five months ago ? The first pictures and footages you saw on media , with garlands around their necks after the plane touched down from Nepal , were of those club officials and BFF members who barely had any contribution to women 's football . And then when the much-anticipated press briefing took place at the BFF House , the front seats were all occupied by the same people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . <p> The BFF and its archaic members do not seem to learn from past mistakes and misdemeanours . The one thing that they are good at is hijacking someone 's success so that they could have their faces splashed across the newspapers and TV screens and have photographs of their ' achievements ' hung on the walls of their offices . And then use these ' achievements ' to further their agendas and wield their clout on the corridors of power . <p> You will not find these bandwagoners -- most of whom are associated with sporting clubs in Dhaka -- when you need them for forming teams for the women 's league . But you will find them as part of the delegation when the national team is playing in a SAFF Championship , because they know there is a high probability of success and , with that , their chance to be in the limelight . <p> In fact , women 's football has become a publicity tool for not just BFF members , but the federation itself . Devoid of any sort of success with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BFF is trying to use the regional success of women to make itself a bit more appealing to common people and sponsors . These uncouth incidents , however , are hardly helping its image or whatever is left of it . <p> One can rest assured that many of these people will not be found anywhere near the team when they are up against much stronger opponents outside of the South Asian region . They know the model of women 's football in Bangladesh is a short-sighted one , good enough to succeed at regional level for a time period , but destined for failure when it comes to sustainability against a bigger pool of competitors . <p> Moreover , short-sightedness is a systemic disease that eternally ails the country 's football governing body . The BFF was myopic when it handed former coach Jamie Day a two-year extension despite a downward spiral in results , and then it turned completely blind when it sacked the coach midway through the contract . Afterwards , they slept through an 86,000-dollar fine by the FIFA , so much so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a month-and-a-half after the deadline passed . <p> This is not the first time this sort of fines were imposed and , rest assured , it will not be the last because the BFF officials had claimed on becoming wiser from their previous experience . <p> And now that they are facing a bigger sanction from the world football 's governing body , the BFF officials helplessly claim that they do not have the money to pay the fine . At the same breath , however , they boast of inviting reigning men 's world champions for a friendly match for a jaw-dropping sum of money . <p> These contradictions in their statements and actions , the deprivation of the deserving and the penchant for going for the extravagant while overlooking the basic demands -- all of these point to a governing body which is morally decrepit , thoroughly unprofessional and full of people serving personal agendas rather than the national interest .

Under his patronage , Shah Muhammad Sagir authored his famous work , Yusuf-Zulekha . It is also believed that the Sultan commissioned Krttivasa to translate the epic tale of Ramayana into Bengali . <p> The very fact that a language identifies and defines a specific human group often leads to controversies and conflicts . Everyone knows that a group 's relation with another may vary from the concordant to the combative , so their respective languages may sometimes become bones of contention , apart from being one of its instruments . However , we will not deal here much with the instrumental aspect , but focus on it as an object or source of discord . Our time-span is also restricted to a single century , though we may have to refer back and forth to others , as these issues are somewhat persistent . <p> The presence and use of more than one language in a society often gives rise to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy for various administrative reasons , with one language being given a more important role than another . This brings them into a dominant-dominated relationship , from which various kinds of frictions result . <p> For us , the following are the notable controversies involving language that Bengal had to tackle in our chosen century , for better or worse . We will not follow a strict chronology but throw a date or two here and there so that a rough idea of their duration is available . <p> Bangla and Urdu : An old controversy , with several incarnations <p> This particular controversy dates back to much earlier times than the Pakistan period of Bangladesh , as one may not be too surprised to know . It concerned the literary language , which for some centuries was only poetic . As early as the fifteenth century , we find a sense of irresolution in most of the Muslim Bengali poets about writing in the Bangla script , which they ( wrongly ) believed came from Sanskrit , which they termed Hinduyani akshar . Syed Sultan , the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Islamic religious stricture was on the script . Without going deep into the story , we can briefly say that the controversy raged for decades , but Abdul Hakim ( 1620-1690 ) in the next century knocked the embargo finally down by writing his famous lines of Noor-Nama , whose angry arguments we give in our meek and passionless translation : " Those who hate the language and knowledge of the country should better leave it and go to a foreign land . " <p> It is interesting to note that , at about the same time , the Bengali Brahmins also had the same kind of aversion to the Bangla language and script , as they would not allow Sanskrit puranas to be translated into Bengali . " Do that and rot in the Raurava hell for eleven thousand years ! " they threatened . So Hindu Bengali authors , who were as keen to translate into or write in Bengali , took resort to two kinds of sly tricks . One , adopted by Maladhar Basu , the first translator of the Bhagabata , was to naively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanskrit , can read Bhagabata and get deliverance . The other dodge was to say that the gods or goddesses themselves had ordered them , appearing physically before them or in their dreams . It was difficult for the Brahmins to challenge such claims , so the authors and translators went on having their way . And Bengali literature continued to flourish in the hands of both Muslim and Hindu poets . <p> Published in Hoogly in 1778 , A Grammar of the Bengal Language by Nathaniel Brassey Halhead is widely recognized as the first grammar book of the Bengali language . <p> Literary historians have noted that it was the Muslim rulers of Bengal like Hossein Shah , who had primarily encouraged poets to write in Bangla , by supporting them with grants and rewards . They loved to hear the fantastic stories found in Hindu epics and puranas . This controversy was reborn in the middle of the Twentieth Century in East Pakistan , but it is beyond our scope , as well as unnecessary for us to go into that . The birth of Bangladesh has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and never forget . <p> As we said , this controversy had continued through the Nineteenth Century , with at least two side narratives . One was related to the haughty mindset of the so-called Ashraf Muslims , who boasted and believed themselves to be the descendants and associates of the earlier Afghan or Mughal rulers . They , as is well-known , preferred to declare Urdu as their mother tongue and believed Bangla to be an inferior , coarse , as well as effeminate language since it was the language of a subject race . This supercilious attitude of the so-called Ashrafs agitated the Bengali Muslim society even in the Nineteenth Century . Nawab Abdul Latif had made a representation to the Education Commission ( Hunter Commission ) of 1882 that the instructional language of the aristocratic Muslims of his class should be Urdu , while that of the ordinary Muslims should be Bengali with a profusion of Arabic and Persian words . This differential language deal spilled over to the next century . The advent of Muslim League in 1906 added extra fuel to the debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1925 that " Muhammedan gentry of Bengal wrote Persian and spoke Hindustani . " However , a Bengali-speaking and Bengali-writing Muslim Bengali elite arose in the same century to distance themselves from the die-hard Urdu speakers . The language of the so-called Punthi Literature was also brought into the fray , which complicated the issue . Scholars agree , however , that punthi-Bangla was not a natural language of any community but a pidginized form of Hindi , Urdu ( a carrier of Arabic and Persian words ) , and Bangla , specially created to entertain a mixed linguistic audience in urban locations . Although a few Bengali intellectuals proposed it as a model for a new Pakistani Bangla , their prescription received a rather cold response . <p> The last connected mini-narrative relates to some conservative Brahmin scholar 's objection to the use of Perso-Arabic words in written Bangla prose . Now that prose was introduced in the language , the very first attempts at writing it showed two divergent styles : one , the highly Sanskritized diction of Mrityunjay Vidyalankar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the saucy and popular style of Ram Ram Basu ( 1751-1813 ) that sporadically cropped up in works of Bhabani Charan Banerjee ( 1787-1848 ) , Pary Chand Mitra , Kaliprasanna etc. , particularly in the so-called naksha ( sketches ) literature . This probably led some to fear that the " pure " Bangla prose was being " contaminated " with Perso-Arabic elements , and Bangla should be rid of them . Haraprasad Shastri himself came forward to show the absurdity of the claim and predicted rightly that such an attempt was not going to succeed . <p> Kaliprasanna Singha , known for his famous satirical work Hutom Pyanchar Naksha ( 1862 ) , used the spoken language of Kolkata and its surrounding areas in his writing . His language is popularly known as Hutomi Bangla . <p> Bankim Chandra Chatterjee , then the reigning authority of Bengali literature , finally took up the role of the final arbitrator and , in his famous article Bangala Bhasha , ruled in 1878 that one 's subject and intention would determine one 's vocabulary and style . No word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected if it served the author 's purpose rightly . Bankim 's favourite word was saralata , ( simplicity ) . One 's style should communicate easily to the reader . Beauty comes next . In his Sahaj Rachana Siksha ( 1892 ? ) , he recommends ishtehar in preference to bijnapan . In his English article Bengali Literature , he decries the " dull , pompous array of high-sounding Sanskrit words " of Sanskrit College authors , not excluding that of Vidyasagar . Here one wishes that he should have taken into account other various styles of Bengali in which Vidyasagar wrote before dismissing him so glibly . <p> Standard Colloquial vs . Chaste or Sadhu Bengali <p> Continuing with the discussion of Bengali literature , we should also mention another micro-narrative that concerned Shyamacharan Ganguli ( 1838-1928 ) ' s prescription of using Standard Colloquial Bangla in children 's texts as well as in written literature , as outlined in his famous article ' Bengali , Spoken and Written , ' published in the Calcutta Review in October 1877 . Bankim , in the very same article noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ganguli had gone too far without specifying what he disagreed with . As we all know , the acceptance of Standard Colloquial Bangla as a literary vehicle would be delayed for several more decades . It first appeared in comical and children 's literature , and although Pramatha Chaudhuri ( 1868-1946 ) and Tagore paraded its power in Sabuj Patra from 1914 , it had to wait another half-century for widespread general acceptance until Anandabazar Patrika began using it on 22 March 1966 . <p> However , even in the 1840s , it became evident that highly Sanskritized prose was not the only face of Sadhu Bangla . As the century came to a close , this prose was also coming closer to the spoken standard , except for the verbs , pronouns , and some other word categories . <p> Khaibarer Janganama , an example of punthi literature that was written using a blend of Bangla , Arabic , Urdu , Persian , and Hindi vocabulary . <p> Bangla vs . English : Love , Servility , Caution and Dismay <p> In this century , the major conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of accommodation to the latter . The new imperialist rulers did not want to impose their language on the subjects right away , as Bengalis themselves were keen to learn the King 's language , as that was a gateway to government jobs and a means of business transactions , apart from the prestige that goes with its acquisition . Several English schools mushroomed in Calcutta and its vicinities , where middle-class ( mostly ) Hindu Bengalis thronged to learn the language . Many informal institutions for teaching English also cropped up , where just English vocabulary was drilled with their Bangla synonyms , in rhymed verses . An example of this was given by Raj Narain Bose ( 1826-1899 ) : <p> This gave rise to a kind of Bangla-English pidgin , examples of which abound in contemporary Bangla literature . If , however , a pidgin means an attempt at linguistic harmony , the honeymoon was threatened at another level . The emerging middle-class elites of Bengal , quite eager in embracing English and Western education , were not generally ready to sacrifice their own language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done . Many of the latter had no scripts or written literature and succumbed easily under colonizer 's languages ( attributed as ' killing languages ' ) like English , Spanish , French , etc . But most of the major South Asian languages like Bangla had a long and rich written literature of their own , with reasonable pride in them . So , their love for their mother tongue was reinforced with their learning of English , as they became more acutely conscious of their glorious past . <p> The support these native languages received from the Portuguese Catholic and English Protestant missionaries , as from some ruling and legal authorities like Warren Hastings , William Bentinck , and William Jones , was also notable . The last two had the first Bangla grammar in English published in 1778 , the one written by Nathaniel Brassy Halhed ( 1751-1830 ) . So , the earliest and foremost Bengali elite of the Century , Rammohan Ray ( 1772-1833 ) , published some Upanishads translated into Bangla , and , in its preface , instructed the readers how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its long and scrambled sentences . Rammohan himself published a Bangla grammar in English in 1826 , to translate it later ( 1833 ) in Bangla . <p> One assumes that a part of the Bengali elite began feeling that Bangla was under threat of extinction , as it was being neglected by the ' Young Bengal ' who were educated at Hindu College . Reputedly , their favoured motto was somewhat like ' Speak English , read English , write English , and , if possible , dream in English ! ' Bengalis began writing in English as well . This , of course , led to a neglect of their mother tongue , Bangla . The threat was more pronounced after 1835 when the English aristocrat Thomas Babington Macaulay ( 1800-1859 ) in his Minutes recommended English as the language of administration and education for the Indian empire . <p> So , the Bengali defense mechanism began working in several directions . Some members of the elite often asserted their Bengali-ness , although they were not averse to other languages . Rammohan was one . Debendranath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter written in English . Poets like Ishwar Chandra Gupta wrote cautioning against the neglect of Bengali in his poem " Matribhasha " . Bengalis began publishing newspapers , books , and periodicals in Bangla in profusion , and Bangla plays were written and staged . A huge and eventually glorious literature in the language was in the making with the jealous participation of men like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar ( 1820-1891 ) , Michael Madhusudan Dutta ( 1824-1873 ) , Pyari Chand Mitra , Bankim Chandra Chatterjee ( 1838-1894 ) , and more . Madhusudan and Bankimchandra represent two typical cultural models of that age : both began writing in English to begin with but reverted back to Bangla in good time to become icons of the literature of the century . One is tempted to translate not only Dutta 's candid confession , " In due time , I discovered the gem-filled mine of my mother tongue " , but also his hugely satirical dialogues from his Ekei ki bole Sabhyata ( 1859 ) in which a Bengali young man declares the imposing of English over that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bengali nouveau riche gather in a prostitute 's house , where one of them , Kali , tells Naba , the leader , that he was a liar . Naba gets furious and threatens that he 'll shoot Kali for the insult ( He had nothing to shoot with though ) . Others hold him from attacking Kali , saying that friends should not be at each other over such a ' trifling ' matter . Naba does not stop fulminating : ' Did you say calling one a liar is ' trifling ' ? Why did n't he call me mithyabadi in Bangla ? No son-of-a-bitch would have taken offense then ! ' <p> Of course , the problem ran deeper than being an object of mere bantering . Bankim Chandra wrote about it in his first editorial of Bangadarshan , his own journal : " The English-educated Babu does not feel for the unschooled Bengali . " There , in fact , arose a yawning divide between the two classes , the ( English ) -educated and that of those who were not . The dominance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the century restricted within four in a hundred . <p> Conclusion <p> As we can determine from history , apart from the ' genetic ' and ' environmental ' multilingualism that we find in South Asia and elsewhere , colonial situations of various kinds also impose multilingualism on a society . The features ' foreign ' , ' native ' etc. of a language often combine with other features like ' language of the ruler ' , ' language of the subject ' , ' developed ' , ' underdeveloped ' and several others . From such combinations , a power hierarchy arises , which ultimately leads to conflicts and controversies . Only in the last few decades has there been a keen awareness of the survival and other rights of a language , no matter how small or ' underdeveloped ' it may be , with UNESCO initiating a movement towards linguistic democracy .

( Bottom ) Meanwhile , after missing out on the first two matches due to injury , all-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz will be eager to get back to action . Photo : FIROZ AHMED <p> Bangladesh take on Ireland in a series-deciding third ODI at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today and the surfaces in Sylhet have fallen in line with the more aggressive approach that the hosts are looking for in series leading up to the World Cup in India . <p> That aggression , as pace-bowling coach Allan Donald relayed , has to be collective . Pack mentality , letting go of fear and the necessary skills of reverse swing were on his mind . <p> Donald had been a fearsome prospect in his playing days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all while deploying some of the most cunning gamesmanship to outmanoeuvre batters , left a mark . <p> " Since I was 16 or 17 , my mindset has n't changed .

While talking about Ireland , he identified the need for consistency heading into the World Cup . <p> " We got belief and consistency after beating India , beating England in T20Is and hopefully we can close the deal tomorrow out here against Ireland . What I am looking at is consistency and success . We 're slowly and surely getting there , but it 's a long road ahead .

Very fine margins in the World Cup ... I 'm talking about the skill of bowling at the death , " he said . <p> Flat surfaces , such as in Pakistan , are cues for reverse swing . It is also a skill that Bangladesh have had little clue of in the past . Donald divulged that lots of work has gone on with roughed-up balls . <p> " The ball will reverse in India , no question about it and it will reverse in Pakistan . That 's what we have been working on for so , so many hours in the nets , bowling at balls and tyres and whatnot .

He said that things began to change " once we started to offload the shackles of fear of failure and fear of disappointment " . <p> Donald felt he had a similar style to Chandika Hathurusingha and opined that the Tigers were able to unshackle themselves under the new head coach . " Hathu has been brilliant around the group and has expressed his freedom and I think they have sort of unshackled themselves to play aggressive cricket , " he said and as the culture changes take root . <p> But aggression alone will not be enough if not part of a pack mentality . <p> " There 's a sense of dovetailing .

Fury of the Gods : Fun but overwhelmingly average <p> Amidst the myriad of superhero movies released over the past decade , 2019 's Shazam ! was among the more underrated ones . It had a certain charm and wholesomeness that made it stand out from other superhero adventures . While the follow-up , Shazam ! Fury of the Gods retains some of that charm , a lot of what made the first film so compelling takes a back seat for a more action-oriented sequel . <p> The movie roughly starts two years after the first film showing Billy Batson and his foster siblings dealing with being superheroes while exploring their own personal interests . As the standard superhero fare goes , some supervillains show up as Greek gods who plan to destroy the world , and the Shazam family must put their conflicts aside to work together and save the day .

A lot of that potential emotional conflict and growth is diminished due to the focus shift to more typical superhero action . The story does introduce some emotional conflict with Billy coping with the fear of ageing out of the foster care system , but that aspect is not properly fleshed out . <p> One positive of the film is that it does not try to be overly comedic like other superhero films , particularly most Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) movies .

Submitted to the London School of Economics in 1950 , the paper delves into contemporary political realities and ideas that were tested in their own time . The writer posited that a sovereign state was essential for the political parties to function . He believed that India needed Westminster-style liberal politics where political parties would be equally invested , whether in government or in opposition . At that time , however , the environment in South Asian countries was not conducive to any Westminster-style politics . Power was concentrated in the hands of a few leaders , while dynasty politics was a dominant influence . Issues like this and much more were explored through the paper . <p> The belated publication in the form of a book of this now historic paper offers an opportunity to take a look at the man that Razzaq Sir would go on to become , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , peers , the academia and intelligentsia , but also anyone who would come into contact with him , like me . <p> Prof Abdur Razzaq was known as " Gyantapas " because , in the words of historian Prof Salahuddin , " he spent his entire life learning and pursuing knowledge .

He could be called a living encyclopaedia because of his extensive reading of history , social science , economics and so on . " <p> Prof Abdur Razzaq was known as " Gyantapas " because , in the words of historian Prof Salahuddin , " he spent his entire life learning and pursuing knowledge . " <p> He was a humanist and a progressive thinker . Although he did n't like politics , he was drawn to the separatist movement in his early life because he believed that a separatist agenda supporting the establishment of Pakistan was the only way out for the backward Muslim community . But those who subscribed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1947 Partition . Events of those days would profoundly shape the worldview of Abdur Razzaq , who tried to make politicians see the error of their thoughts . During the 1971 war , he did n't leave the country . He was hiding in his village home , and was tried in absentia by the Pakistan military court that sentenced him to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment . After independence , Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman designated him as a national professor . <p> I met Prof Razzaq for the first time at the Dhaka University teachers ' lounge , courtesy of my late friend ZM Obaidullah . He was playing chess then . In 1961 , I was appointed as a section officer at the finance ministry in East Pakistan . I remember that I went to visit him one day . He wanted to know about my work , so I told him , " Sir , it 's quite interesting , although , frankly , I do n't understand it much . " He said , " Why do n't you study economics then ?

He would say that we needed independence , but he was against having an active military force in an independent Bangladesh . In later life , I went to visit him every time I got the opportunity , sometimes with my friends , including Anisuzzaman , Nurul Huq and Justice Habibur Rahman . Meeting him was a chance to learn . He encouraged us to read . He talked about many things , but was also curious to know our thoughts . <p> Once , after Sir Fazle Hasan Abed decided to establish Brac University , he thought it would be better to get first-hand knowledge of the university system . So , the three of us visited different American universities to learn about their systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Razzaq was looking for me .

I still remember him saying , with a smile on his face , " Ask Abed to establish 100 good schools instead of one university . The country will be better served in this way . " Many may not know that Razzaq Sir himself wanted to establish a school in Dhaka . He even selected three scholars who would join the school : Badruddin Umar , Sardar Fazlul Karim , and Anisuzzaman . But it did n't pass the planning stage for some reason . <p> I have so many memories like this of Prof Razzaq . He was truly a gold mine of knowledge and resources . He would often share his insights about the history of the subcontinent , especially major political events and trends that shaped its future .

Infrastructure development and other changes befitting a capital were halted because of World War I. The capital remained in Calcutta , and was finally shifted to Delhi in 1931 , he said . <p> I also remember that Razzaq Sir once presented a written speech titled " State of the Nation " in 1980 . It was his only written speech , later published in 1981 . I had the good fortune of listening to his speech live .

" He also said , " The prosperity of Bengal was never dependent on its agriculture but its trade and commerce , and the products of handicrafts and small-sized industries . " To further explain this idea , he asked , " Why did traders from the Middle East come to Bangladesh ? " and then proceeded to answer : it was because of its trade and the economic benefits it offered to them . <p> Thus , in public interactions or private , Prof Razzaq spread his love of knowledge and passion for intellectual exercises , never hesitating to encourage us to read and think .

Most netizens and experts were vastly impressed . <p> Many believe that the third terminal megaproject will be a game changer for the country 's aviation sector . At a recent conference , the prime minister herself expressed her wish to turn Bangladesh into an aviation hub . On the other hand , Biman Bangladesh has reportedly been in discussion with Airbus to purchase new aircraft , admittedly a step in the right direction because only a shiny new terminal will not be enough to transform Bangladesh 's aviation sector . Biman , our national flag carrier , must grow , expand , and possibly revamp itself to complement the whole project . <p> The question remains as to whether Bangladesh can truly be an aviation hub in the region when there are already big players such as Singapore , Bangkok , Hong Kong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as high-speed taxiways and a large cargo village . But frankly speaking , there are several highly important elements that are still missing . It is quite surprising and disappointing that no one yet has pointed out these missing elements in the megaproject -- all of which are so crucial ! <p> The first and most important of these is the need for a new ATC ( Air Traffic Control ) tower . HSIA currently lacks not only a proper ATC tower , but also the right equipment and technology to control air traffic . A new airport would practically be useless without modern navigation and communication systems . So , one ca n't fathom why a new ATC tower and radar system have not been included as part of this megaproject . Radio communication between Dhaka 's air traffic controllers and pilots is easily listenable online and one can hear how unclear the communication seems to be due to the airport 's old and outdated equipment . One could be forgiven for wondering how foreign airlines still fly into the HSIA . <p> Secondly , there has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be feasible . Every major airport around the world has at least two operational runways . Therefore , it is only fitting that HSIA should also have another runway not only as backup but also to handle increasing passenger and aircraft movement , as the taxiways and the sole current runway get busier . However , the lack of space for a second runway might be an issue here . The authorities have allowed illegal constructions and settlements around the airport 's perimeter to such a degree that a significant threat is posed to flight safety while landing or taking off from Dhaka . This is an issue that needs urgent attention from relevant authorities . Once the safety concerns are duly addressed , a second runway would still be possible , with certain adjustments . <p> Then there is the matter of ground handling and the quality of airport services . As a major gateway to Bangladesh , the HSIA reflects the image of our country . No matter how shiny an airport is , if the passenger experience is still sub-par , our aviation sector can never progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger experiences and ground handling services for too long at the Dhaka airport .

But these offers were unfortunately denied due to Biman 's monopoly . And we have all witnessed and experienced what good this has done . <p> But no more . New changes are necessary for the benefit of all and it is time for a more competent entity to take over the day-to-day operation of the HSIA once the third terminal is fully operational . <p> Finally , branding is a vital tool to market almost anything these days . All major airports across the world have their own logo and branding , but none of the airports in Bangladesh practice any form of branding . This must not be overlooked . After the completion of the third terminal , the HSIA will need to brand itself with at least an appealing logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport on top of the present terminals just wo n't do .

And for that , this roadmap , with all the elements of a modern functioning airport , will be necessary for the Dhaka airport .

The government has continuously emphasised fuel diversification in the electricity generation fuel mix by ruling out mono-fuel dependency on natural gas and promoting alternative fuels . This has enabled the energy consumers to avail the most readily available and least-cost energy options to aid the economy to grow . <p> Having increased access and affordability , the government has now prioritised and realigned the policies to achieve applicability and acceptability . Improved access has been complimented by increased applicability of energy technologies , including technologies for the exploration and extraction of non-renewable energy , induction of renewable energy technologies , and technologies to improve energy efficiency in energy processing , transformation , and final consumption . Thus , the government wants to adopt state-of-the-art modern technology for the highest efficiency and lesser emissions . <p> On the other hand , increased acceptance of the environmental impacts of the chosen energy sources and technologies is necessary to ensure energy sustainability . Therefore , the government realised there may be better solutions than coal-based electricity production and discontinued some coal-fired mega power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bangladesh will start a green energy transition and generate 40 percent electricity from renewable sources . <p> Nevertheless , the recent global energy crisis due to geopolitical tensions , such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict , coupled with the wild swing in energy prices and currency devaluation , may affect energy security and hamper Bangladesh 's development process . For instance , prices of key energy sources , such as crude oil , increased by 42 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 . The average LNG price rose from $10.8 per MMBTU in 2021 to $18 per MMBTU in 2022 , and the average coal price increased from $117 per MT in 2021 to $267 per MT in 2022 . <p> Given the context , the policymakers may consider reshaping the existing energy policy framework or developing a few new short-term , medium-term , and long-term strategic policies to tackle the crisis to ensure future energy security and continue the government 's mission and vision . It is also worth noting that decisions need to be taken considering the overall scenario , not just the crisis situation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be designed keeping the future in mind . Moreover , if required , the government could also make a provision for regular revision of energy policies . The following recommendations may be worth considering for Bangladesh 's energy sector . <p> First , by strengthening demand side management , the government can promote social awareness among the general people for the efficient use of energy appliances to achieve lower energy consumption coupled with facilitating the implementation , execution , and dissemination of different energy efficiency programmes . An energy-responsible citizen is expected to refrain from using excess electricity , especially during an energy crisis . <p> Second , it is evident that Bangladesh 's natural gas sector still suffers from around 10 percent system loss . Thus , the government may identify and cut illegal lines , create meter upstream and downstream points , and implement strict regulations to ensure transparency . <p> Given the context , the policymakers may consider reshaping the existing energy policy framework or developing a few new short-term , medium-term , and long-term strategic policies to tackle the crisis to ensure future energy security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third , a recent labour force survey indicates that about 75 percent of the energy sector 's workforce falls under the low- and medium-skilled category , whereas only 25 percent falls under the high-skilled category . Therefore , developing a skilled energy sector labour force is required to ensure sectoral activities . <p> Fourth , it is worth noting that the share of imported liquefied fuel started rising in electricity generation to run the quick rental power plants since 2009 . If Heavy-Fuel Oil ( HFO ) and High-Speed Diesel ( HSD ) had not been introduced during the 2009 crisis , the situation could have been bad . However , recent hikes in the international oil price market have made it difficult for Bangladesh to run quick rental power plants . The Bangladesh government has already taken many initiatives to reduce the dependency on imported liquid fuels . Once nuclear power plants start production , as a move to promote clean energy , the government may also reconsider phasing out the quick rental power plants by discontinuing agreement renewals . <p> Fifth , the government could further enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy options and speeding up the development of renewable projects . For instance , it is imperative to reduce duties and taxes on power sector-related purchases such as solar inverters and panels , reduce price distortions , address the prevailing market barriers , and encourage investment by local and foreign private investors . It should be kept in mind that numerous studies reveal that marginalised people show a lower adaption likelihood for renewable energy devices like Solar Home System ( SHS ) due to high prices and maintenance costs . However , with the development of technology , solar energy has become cheaper , and higher investments should be made in these renewable sources . The government could also encourage microfinance institutions to develop a business model for poor people to expedite the use of solar energy , mainly in remote and off-grid areas . <p> Solar irrigation is also a feasible solution for quickly facilitating a renewable energy transition . Other solar development initiatives , like solar panels next to highways and riversides , may generate significant amounts of solar power . Besides , developing sound renewable energy storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be carried out to improve the overall grid reliability . The development of renewables would further open up the opportunity to replace fossil fuels like natural gas and oil with renewable energy sources to run Captive Power Plants ( CPPs ) . <p> Sixth , the government might consider welcoming public-private collaboration to reduce inefficiency in resource exploration and policy implementation . Additionally , there should be a focus on increasing onshore and offshore gas exploration by creating amenable Production Sharing Contracts ( PSC ) to attract International Oil Companies ( IOCs ) . Furthermore , given the international oil price volatility , big companies may be interested in investing abroad , and Bangladesh should explore this type of opportunity for offshore drilling and indigenous coal extraction . <p> Lastly , the government could also explore the possibility of Cross-Border Electricity Trading within the South Asian region to improve energy security . With a harmonised policy framework and regional solid energy cooperation , Bangladesh could access the hydropower generated in Nepal and Bhutan , channelling it through India . <p> Dr Sakib Bin Amin is an Associate Professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds a Ph.D . in Economics from Durham University ( UK ) . 
@@97784236 <p> The question that most people are asking these days is whether the upcoming general election is going to be free and fair . FILE PHOTO : REUTERS <p> As an activist , I interact with many people from all walks of life every day . They include young and old , women and men , ordinary villagers and urban elites . They also represent different shades of political opinions . However , one common trait among all of them is , they are preoccupied with our upcoming general election . <p> The common questions that I face in these interactions are : in which direction is Bangladesh as a nation heading ? Will there be an election at the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024 ? Will the election be free and fair ? Will it be participatory ? Will there be dialogues between the major political parties ? Will there be a caretaker government ? What will be the role of India , US , UK , Japan , and the EU ? Will Khaleda Zia be able to participate in the election ? Will Sheikh Rehana be in politics and contest the next election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence during the election ? And so on . <p> Through all these questions , these people invariably want to know the country 's political destination via the coming election . Many of them feel that as a commentator on political issues , I know or should know the answers to these questions . Many of them are disappointed that I do not . <p> Faced with such questions , I normally ask them about their own opinions and engage in conversations . Most of them do have opinions -- rather strong opinions -- about the future direction of the country . Many of them also do not hesitate to express them . Some even insist that their opinions are the correct ones , and I should wait to see their predicted future unfold . <p> Based on my conversations with hundreds of people over the past few weeks , I can see three possible scenarios unfolding in the coming months . The first and best scenario is of a free , fair and credible parliamentary election , which will be not only participatory , but also competitive and credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast their votes and our next government will be based on their consent . In other words , our democracy will be back on track through the next election . <p> The second scenario is of a violent election . To some of the people I spoke with , violence is inevitable as people are angry not only because they could not vote in the past , but also because of the price hike of essentials as well as corruption . Many of them think that if violence goes out of control , everyone will be at risk . However , no one wants to see violence ; they want peace and harmony . Some people feel that peace has become the new name of development -- development will neither take place nor sustain with violence . <p> Almost everyone I spoke with in the last few weeks are convinced that by whatever means , the ruling Awami League and its alliance partners are going to stay in power , the consequences of which , in their view , would lead us towards an uncertain future in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only legal , constitutional , and peaceful means of going forward . If that is thwarted , it would lead to violence . <p> The third scenario is of another controversial election like the previous two . However , most of the people I interacted with feel that different types of strategies will be used to manipulate the upcoming election . Many of them are convinced that the ruling party will come back to power one way or the other . They feel that the Election Commission and the ruling party 's friends and cronies are ready to do the betting for them . <p> Almost everyone I interacted with in the last few weeks are convinced that a free and fair election is a pipe dream . This is because the main stakeholders -- the Election Commission , bureaucracy , judiciary , and the law enforcement agencies -- are totally partisan , and they will make sure that the ruling party stays in power . Almost all of them have given up the hope for a free and fair election . <p> Most people I interacted with in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious violence , because the law enforcement agencies will be able to contain it . However , if the violence does escalate , many of the beneficiaries , in their view , will flee the country because they have already stashed away significant financial resources abroad .

In their opinion , free and fair elections are the only legal , constitutional , and peaceful means of going forward . If that is thwarted , it would lead to violence . Thus , manipulated elections will serve no purpose . <p> Some of the people , especially those who are sympathetic to the ruling party , are confident that the prime minister is a miracle maker who can use her magic wand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved many thorny problems in the past .

Scientists have even identified the possible time when the shrinkage started : Approximately 3,000 years ago , according to a BBC report . <p> The shrinkage , according to Jeremy DeSilva , an anthropologist at Dartmouth College in the US , would be roughly equivalent to that of " four ping pong balls " . <p> According to the National Geographic Society , agriculture emerged sometime between 5,000-10,000 years ago . Soon after the emergence of agriculture , civilizations , full of architecture and machinery started to emerge in various parts of the world . According to the BBC , the first writing also appeared at the same time . <p> However , one question that left the researchers scratching their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size while there were extraordinary technological advances going on at the same time ? <p> Apart from the reason behind this shrinkage , another question which hovers around is whether the size of the brain affects an animal 's cognitive ability and intelligence . <p> According to DeSilva and his colleagues , it is difficult to know what prompts brains to get bigger or smaller over time . In their study , the researchers note that human bodies have shrunk over time , but not sufficiently to account for our diminishing brain size . <p> To understand the phenomenon , DeSilva and his colleagues sought inspiration from a very unlikely source -- the humble ant , according to BBC . <p> At first glance , ant brains may appear insignificant compared to ours . They are approximately one tenth of a cubic millimeter in volume , or one-third the size of a grain of salt , and contain approximately 250,000 neurons . In comparison , the human brain has roughly 86 billion neurons . <p> However , some ant societies are strikingly identical to our own . Incredibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture in which they cultivate vast swaths of fungus within their colonies . <p> When DeSilva 's team compared the brain sizes of various ant species , they discovered that those with vast societies had sometimes evolved larger brains , unless they had also evolved a preference for fungus farming , BBC reports . <p> This finding suggests that for an ant , having a bigger brain is important for doing well in large society . <p> It also suggests that more complex social systems with great division of labor might prompt their brains to shrink . <p> DeSilva believes this could be the case for humans as well . <p> " What if , in humans , we reached a threshold of population size , a threshold in which individuals were sharing information and externalizing information in the brains of others ? " he told BBC . <p> One other reason which might prompt the shrinkage in human brains is writing , according to DeSilva . He questioned whether the emergence of writing could have influenced brain volume through " externalizing information in writing and being able to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Although these hypotheses are nowhere near conclusion , it could be a starting point to think about what might cause the " notable and relatively recent " reduction in human brain size , DeSilva says . <p> Another question which needs to be addressed is whether smaller brains mean humans became stupider . <p> A team of researchers in 2018 analyzed a vast amount of data collected from UK Biobank , a biomedical database that contains , among other things , brain scans and IQ test results for thousands of people . <p> Analysis of the data collected from 13,600 people found that a bigger brain was , on average , associated with doing slightly better on IQ tests but , crucially , the relationship was non-deterministic , according to BBC . <p> That means that there were some people who did very well on the tests despite having relatively small brains and vice versa.

We used to be more alive and our lives were more vivid . I could n't perceive when we began to lose this longstanding tradition , but as Eid cards faded into oblivion so did the culture of pop-up Eid card stalls . <p> These stalls were mostly run by local kids , who would open the shops after school hours with their friends . Some of the stalls were delightfully simple -- comprising of just a table and a few chairs ; others boasted a bamboo framework with striking fabrics .

When our father saw the spark in our eyes for putting up a stall , he bought us hundreds of cards with a variety of shapes and designs to sell . <p> Our stall was very basic : a tea table positioned in front of our house 's entrance gate and ropes affixed to two poles for card display . It was hardly an ideal location for a card stall , requiring us to wait for hours before catching a glimpse of a potential customer . Thankfully , the support of our family members and neighbours kept us from throwing in the towel . <p> One memory that sticks out vividly was the day when a particular card caught a customer 's eye . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stars . Although we had put it on display , we had no intention of parting with it . The customer offered to pay any price we demand but we were n't going to sell it . A heated argument ensued , with us explaining why we could n't sell that card even though it was on display . Eventually , we were able to persuade him to choose another card instead . <p> For us , the stall experience was more about adventure than business . We virtually had no costs so all the money we could make was ours to keep . Having a card stall was cool because it meant we could pick from hundreds of cards to gift our cousins and friends . <p> When I look back , I wonder how in the span of a decade and a half , artificiality swallowed up a tradition we held so dear to our hearts . <p> Samin Yasar Anabil pretends to be a philosopher .

@@98582231 <h> Is AI destroying the education system ? <p> While studying the prospects of a digital university , I met one of our finest vice-chancellors who have the vision to launch a true digital university . During our discussion , I was fascinated to hear him share the learning management system facilities and his master plan for a Tk 1,000-crore mega campus . <p> But I found myself scratching my head wondering how such a huge investment makes sense since the purpose of digital education is to take education home at the most affordable price . <p> Recently our regulatory authority has given the nod for blended learning , but not full-fledged digital learning . While the edtech business has revolutionised the education system globally , we are still talking about blended education and shying away from a full-fledged digital university . Those who feel proud of our education system are undoubtedly living in a fool 's paradise ! <p> While we are caught in the middle of traditional and digital education , the rest of the world is panicking over the death of education threatened by artificial intelligence ( AI ) . <p> The hypothesis is that AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose out on learning and undermine the system . The threat is unavoidable , and the concerns are well-founded . As a solution , we can first take steps to understand the threat and power of AI and use it to our advantage with mitigating actions that would lead to a positive transformation in learning and education . <p> AI can be a powerful tool for students to provide answers to questions , explain difficult concepts in simple terms , and suggest resources for further learning . <p> It can also provide personalised feedback and recommendations based on a student 's strengths and weaknesses . Furthermore , it can help educators to improve their teaching by providing innovative ways to deliver content and engage with students . <p> Sal Khan of Khan Academy said in a Ted Talk , " We are going to transform education positively by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor , and we are going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing artificially intelligent teaching assistant .

Despite similar concessions being granted between 2020 and 2022 , the level of non-performing loans ( NPLs ) in the country has not gone down . On the contrary , as per a World Bank report released in May , Bangladesh now has the second-highest ratio of NPLs in all of South Asia , which is not an achievement to be proud of .

While it is important to acknowledge the challenges faced by legitimate borrowers , it is equally crucial to ensure that such concessions are not extended to wilful defaulters -- who often exploit systemic loopholes to access loans and delay/forgo repayment -- as well as to resist the temptation of quick fixes . <p> Under the new rule , borrowers will be allowed to repay only 50 percent of their instalments payable for the April-June period of 2023 . This , according to experts , could exacerbate liquidity pressure in the banking sector , as lenders will not receive their funds during this period . Moreover , it might discourage good borrowers from fulfilling their repayment obligations . By going for temporary solutions rather than fixing longstanding problems of governance , the central bank risks creating a cycle of dependence that is detrimental to the sector 's overall health . But most importantly , such measures might further enable habitual loan defaulters . As a columnist of The Daily Starhas recently said , it is " the culture of favouring looters or not punishing any of them for financial turpitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The culture of default loans is indeed one of the biggest challenges facing our economy , aside from money laundering , and our policymakers must be careful that they do n't end up perpetuating these problems .

@@99581237 <h> Monetary policy has been set free on parole <p> While the government 's latest monetary policy for the first half of fiscal year 2023-24 shows an attempt to be rational for the market , it lacks vigour to solve inflation and the dollar crisis . It deserves credit for bailing the lending rate cap -- which prevailed for more than three years in defiance of economic reasonings -- out of jail . For the first time in years , the exchange rate will be allowed to float on the basis of market supply and demand . Apparently , the Bangladesh Bank has embarked on a journey towards a free market economy after earning a release order from the finance ministry . But the freedom is conditional and more complicated -- hence , the policy will be less effective in controlling inflation . <p> The apex business body in the country was strongly against removing the lending rate cap , and it said so incessantly . The reason is clear . Businesses can grab funds at zero real interest if the cap prevails . Technically , the real interest rate ( borrowing rate minus inflation ) was negative one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when inflation hovered over 10 percent . Effectively , banks were giving them an extra one percent bonus if they took any loans . What a golden age of profit bonanza business tycoons enjoyed for more than a year , emboldened by the stubborn endorsement of the finance ministry . <p> Apparently , the Bangladesh Bank has been more independent to influence the lending rate after removing the cap , but this move has essentially legitimised the finance ministry 's authority to influence the lending rate by incorporating the Treasury Bill ( T-Bill ) rate in determining the rates . Of course , this is an instance of financial innovation , and innovations are always welcome to help the nation escape from its poor performance in the global innovation index . But this is practically a trick to engage the ministry in Bangladesh Bank 's decision-making and indulgence to fiscal incapacity which does not see any light at the end of the tunnel . Why ? <p> By removing the lending rate cap , the central bank has introduced SMART -- the six-month moving average of the rates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government issues T-Bills -- short-term money market instruments with 182 days ' maturity -- to fill up its budget deficit . The central bank arranges the auction among big banks and primary dealers where banks will buy the bills at a competitive yield rate while the government will try to give a rate as low as possible to minimise its burden . Bangladesh Bank has set the maximum lending rate for banks with a 3 percent margin above the T-Bill rate , making it 10.1 percent for now , for example . Banks can now lend funds at or below 10 percent at a time when inflation is 10 percent , making the real cost of borrowing funds just zero . This is not a sincere step to combat inflation . <p> Bangladesh Bank has imposed a new lending rate cap under the masquerade of the so-called SMART -- a tricky innovation that is supposed to do more harm than good for central bank maneuverings and its image . <p> -- Birupaksha Paul <p> SMART is an unsmart move for indulging manipulation , political pressure , staggered decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banks . Bangladesh Bank will announce SMART monthly , and banks will allow their borrowers to ask for loans based on those ever-changing SMART , augmenting more bureaucracy and uncertainty in the domain of investment . This was unwarranted at a time when other central banks are simplifying lending rules and helping people understand how lending rates are dependent on the policy rate -- which is the fed funds rate for the US and repo rate for Bangladesh . <p> The biggest influence on T-Bill rates is exerted from the government side -- the finance ministry . The ministry can decide how much money it needs to collect from treasury bills and how much from treasury bonds . If its demand for cash is high , it must accept higher T-Bill rates and vice versa . If rates on selling long-term treasury bonds are comparatively profitable , the government will switch to selling more bonds and less bills . So , the ministry has the power of playing games with different rates .

Then lending rates would have been under the guardianship of the central bank , not the finance ministry . Bangladesh Bank could have declared a margin of , say , 6 percent above the repo rate of 6.5 percent , making the lending rate to be 12.5 percent maximum . Similarly , the deposit rate floor could have been 2 percent below the repo rate -- the same as the reverse repo rate . Then the whole spectrum of interest rates would go up and down based on the judicious movement of the main policy rate control by the central bank .

Central bank officials commented that the dollar 's value at Tk 108 is fairly a market price . If that is true , why does the rate fail to bring adequate remittances by discouraging the hundi business ? Why are the reserves dwindling without any sign of correction ? Why are some importers ready to offer even Tk 115 to bring their goods from overseas ?

FILE PHOTO : Star <p> Inflation is making people 's lives harder in many ways . This is making it increasingly important to find effective ways to help people save money . Better yet , though almost too good to be true , would be if we could help people save money while also tackling other major problems such as air pollution , noise pollution , road crashes , and the climate crisis . Fortunately for us , there is an amazing and surprisingly simple tool available : the bicycle . <p> When we start to enumerate the economic ( and other ) benefits of the bicycle , it is easy to keep going and going -- pedalling our way to a better and brighter future . High-density , cycle-friendly urban design is good for local economies . Bicycles create virtually no wear and tear for roads , thus resulting in dramatically reduced costs of maintenance . Neighbourhoods of this design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure ( such as water , electricity , sewage ) . <p> Cycle parking occupies very little space , and allows roughly five times as many people to access restaurants and shops than if the same space was occupied by cars . When people travel by bicycle , they become part of the surroundings , more able to notice what is around them , and getting off to enter any facility is simpler . This is why people on bicycles actually tend to spend more at local businesses . <p> When the main mode of transport is the bicycle rather than the car , neighbourhoods are quieter , more walkable , and have cleaner air , making them more desirable and increasing the local property value . In England , the value of residential property rises by one percent if motor vehicle traffic is reduced by 50 percent . Providing cycle parking at businesses , offices , and elsewhere is much less expensive than creating car parking areas . When children walk or cycle to school , they tend to be more attentive in general and achieve better results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also excludes the need to provide expensive school buses or for families to pay for their children 's transport . <p> When people can move about on bicycles , they are more physically active from childhood well into old age . They stay healthier , saving the government and taxpayers expenses for health care . <p> Cycling infrastructure is far less expensive to build than roads , flyovers , elevated expressways , and parking garages for cars . For all these reasons and more , the benefit-to-cost ratio for cycling schemes have been estimated to range from 5:1 to as high as 35.5:1 . That is , for every taka invested in cycling infrastructure , the savings can range from Tk 5 to more than Tk 35 . Cycle freight ( what we call " rickshaw vans " ) is cheaper than motorised freight for small payloads over short distances , with cost savings of 39 percent to 64 percent compared to a motorised service . <p> When people can walk and cycle in cities , they can more easily access public transport , too . Cycling in cities also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working to build cycles , pumping tires , repairing bicycles , or offering parking services . <p> With the world growing hotter , the idea of cycling may seem less and less feasible . But is the alternative any better ? To sit stuck in traffic in an air-conditioned car , polluting the air further , emitting carbon dioxide , and contributing directly to heat increase through the working of the engine and AC ? Yes , it 's harder to cycle when it 's really hot . But the way to cool down cities is to have plenty of trees ( and if car parking did not occupy so much urban space , there would be more scope for planting trees , too ) . More bicycles and fewer cars could mean more parks , canals , ponds , trees , and dirt -- all of which would cool a city . And bicycles generate virtually zero climate emissions anyway . <p> Why then does our government subsidise cars while maintaining high taxes on bicycles ? Unfortunately , the lobbying of car , fuel , and road-building corporations -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies is not . That is where our voice comes in : whether or not we ride bicycles , we need to demand something better from our politicians and policymakers . The benefits of cycling extend well beyond the individual cyclist and to the community and the greater society . We all need to advocate for better cycling infrastructure . <p> As we struggle to cope with inflation on top of all the problems we face in our cities , let 's remind ourselves , each other , and particularly our policymakers of the many benefits that would ensue to our economies , our cities , and our lives if we invested more in cycling . It is time to make bicycles affordable and cycling pleasant and safe in our cities . <p> Debra Efroymson is executive director at the Institute of Wellbeing . Watch her TEDx talk on the topic . 
@@99648230 <p> Last year , on this day Bangladesh made global news as the country ushered in a new era of communication .

The 6.1km megaproject was seen not only as a remarkable achievement of the current Awami League government but also regarded as a major landmark in the development history of Bangladesh . <p> But the journey to make Padma Bridge a reality did not start smooth , owing to fund-related issues .

After the inauguration of PMB , to what extent has this mega project changed or improved local people 's lives and livelihoods ? <p> Although the local people were given housing and other facilities as compensation , PMB has directly impacted their livelihoods , especially those who lost a huge amount of cultivable land due to displacement . Usable cultivable land has been an important resource in areas adjacent to PMB as local communities find land for cultivation to be scarce . There is also a lack of proper infrastructure ( such as mills , factories , and markets ) in Munshiganj , Shariatpur , and Madaripur that could have generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as economic growth and connectivity are concerned , PMB is dubbed as a strategic instrument for achieving the development visions ( e.g. , Vison 2041 ) of the government by creating an urban space , infrastructure development , and accelerating myriad channels of growth .

Another noteworthy aspect is with the removal of major physical barriers , PMB has set up a road connection between Dhaka and the southwestern part of the country . <p> Aside from the tangible benefits of a mega structure , local people also value non-monetised issues such as culture , good neighbourhoods , and other factors promoting inclusivity . Among the local communities , the general perception is that PMB has earned them a sense of pride , a distinct identity other than of course promoting connectivity . <p> PMB underpins the spread of urbanisation and development that is not only related to roads , railways , or telecommunication but also opening the doors to more public investment .

Ferry services were also unreliable as they would get suspended for a few days at a time due to inclement weather . The unsafe , overloaded , and unreliable ferry services contributed to the frequency of accidents as well . Now , passengers can save nearly two to three hours when travelling to southwestern districts via the Padma Bridge . <p> Data collected from resettlement and adjacent areas of PMB legitimises the argument that PMB is a role model among many mega projects in Bangladesh since it was developed through an inclusive participatory approach .

For example , some pressing issues are directly related to resource allocation and livelihood security which was a monumental task to take on in the early stages of the project . Although the local people were given housing and other facilities as compensation , PMB has directly impacted their livelihoods , especially those who lost a huge amount of cultivable land due to displacement . Usable cultivable land has been an important resource in areas adjacent to PMB as local communities find land for cultivation to be scarce .

Education facilities , an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PMB , are also scanty outside the camp areas in Mawa , Shibchar , and Jajira . <p> So , how can strategies of mega projects like PMB be better designed for addressing such concerns in the future ? To ensure dividends , investing in people is crucial . Some pertinent issues also need to be considered at a micro-level ( including investing in intangible human development components , especially health , and education and promoting river-centric tourism and eco-tourism to ensure livelihoods ) ; and macro-level planning ( developing appropriate communication , feeder road , investing in Mongla Port , and safeguarding the environment ) . Working on mega projects such as PMB with the country 's own funds is a comparatively new experience for Bangladesh . Thus , post-monitoring of mega projects is crucial to get leverage in this area by bridging plans from local to national level .

These incidents not only highlight the perils faced by journalists but also the urgent need for comprehensive measures to ensure that those responsible for silencing them are held accountable . <p> Unfortunately , far from remedying the situation , the authorities have repeatedly dismissed concerns raised by activists . One of the major concerns is the unsolved killings of journalists . As per a report by Prothom Alo , 30 journalists have been killed in the last 15 years , with the families of victims yet to see justice in most cases due to delayed investigations or trials . While the Sagar-Runi case is perhaps the most protracted one , there are other long-running cases lost equally in the judicial maze . Meanwhile , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awami League -- are out on bail . Imagine the plight of families who have been left without justice , or closure , or any state protection from the potential threat posed by the accused . One of them is the 80-year-old mother of slain journalist Julhas Uddin , who says she is unsure if she will see justice before her death . Many are not even convinced about the fairness of the investigative/trial processes . <p> All this paints a deeply troubling picture of the media landscape in Bangladesh , which emerged as the eleventh worst country for unsolved killings of journalists in the CPJ 's 2021 Global Impunity Index . It is largely because of this questionable legal response that the country is becoming a haven for anti-journalist criminal elements . According to the Ain o Salish Kendra ( ASK ) , from 2008 to May 2023 , there have been some 3,641 incidents of harassment and torture of journalists , with 682 of them recorded in the last three years . The extent of dangers facing journalists is truly alarming . And the addition of repressive tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made things worse . <p> We urge the authorities to take a long , hard look at this state of affairs . They must allow journalists to do their job with total freedom and without any threat of physical , psychological or reputational harm hanging over their heads . And they must ensure that the killers of journalists and their political backers are brought to justice . 
@@99648232 <h> Lessons from the five city corporation elections <p> The only positive of these polls was the voter turnout . PHOTO : AMRAN HOSSAIN <p> Elections in the five city corporations concluded recently without any major untoward incident . With the main opposition BNP choosing not to participate , election results were predictably in favour of the ruling Awami League except for in Gazipur . These elections were the biggest electoral exercise before the parliamentary elections scheduled between late December and early January . So , how should we view these elections in light of the upcoming national elections ? And what messages do they convey for the ruling Awami League ? <p> Before the city polls , political commentators were terming the elections as a test case for the Election Commission ( EC ) , which they were most certainly not . At least not in terms of managing a multiparty election . This time , the commission hardly faced any challenges , as there were scarcely any challengers . Moreover , as BNP was rather strict even about councillor candidates for the first time , the competition basically took place among ruling party contenders . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVM ) , but the national election will be held through ballot papers . The two are distinct voting mechanisms and require different types of management . So , from this point of view , too , they were not a test case . <p> The only positive of these five city polls was the voter turnout . Although the voter turnout in local government elections has traditionally remained high , these elections saw an average turnout of around 50 percent . Obviously , the councillor candidates always play a crucial role in raising the voter turnout . Despite that , it can be said that people will turn up at the polling centres if the atmosphere is good . In other words , a congenial atmosphere would be sufficient to get people to come . But the question remains largely about what would happen if the elections become competitive and are accompanied with the tensions and apprehensions typically surrounding a combative election . <p> If the commission thinks it has done a good job conducting the elections , it would be grossly underestimating the demands it will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no scope for complacency as the commission did not face any risks . Rather , these elections were carried out merely for the sake of formalities . <p> Many believed that the commission failed abysmally when a mayoral candidate in Barishal came under attack . The comment that the Chief Election Commissioner ( CEC ) Kazi Habibul Awal made after the attack drew huge criticisms . When Barishal city mayoral candidate Syed Faizul Karim was assaulted , journalists asked the election chief about the matter . He replied , " Did he die ? No . I did not see him bleeding . But we heard that someone punched him from behind . " If any ruling party 's mayoral candidate had come under attack , would the CEC have made the same remark ? <p> Apprehension of clashes is always high when the election is competitive . Attack on a mayoral candidate indicated a grave lapse on the part of the EC in fostering an appropriate voting environment . As a result , the Islami Andolon Bangladesh boycotted the elections for Rajshahi and Sylhet city polls . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came under attack before the polling day . <p> In the 2018 elections in the five-city corporations , the allegation against the then KM Nurul Huda-led commission was that it had failed to establish control over the police and administration . At that time , the BNP-backed mayoral candidates alleged that they were driven away from the field even before the voting started and the role of the EC was that of a mere spectator . As BNP boycotted the election , the commission did not face any such test this time . <p> So , if the commission thinks it has done a good job conducting the elections , it would be grossly underestimating the demands it will have to meet during a truly participatory and competitive election . There is no scope for complacency as the commission did not face any risks . Rather , these elections were carried out merely for the sake of formalities . <p> Although the ruling Awami League leaders have been saying that the election was free and fair , the one issue that surfaced was the intra-party feud . After failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gazipur Awami League leader Zahangir Alam 's mother Zaida Khatun contested the election and won .

In Barishal , the incumbent mayor Serniabat Sadiq Abdullah did not get the party nomination , but his uncle Abul Khair Abdullah did . The division was very much visible and the media reported that Sadiq did not even go to the polling centre to cast his vote . In Rajshahi and Khulna , the party did not face any challenge as there was no strong contender either from the opposition parties or from within the ranks of the Awami League . So , if we happen to have a competitive election , how the Awami League will tackle its intra-party feud should be of concern . <p> But the biggest loser of these elections is the Jatiya Party . In Gazipur , the Jatiya Party 's mayoral candidate lost his security money . In Barishal and Khulna , Jatiya Party mayoral candidates came in fourth , while in Sylhet , the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by about 70,000 votes , which is rather significant . So , the main opposition in the parliament should do some soul searching over its organisational strength . <p> While the five city corporations have managed to elect their mayors for the next five years through largely free and fair polls , there is little room for complacence . This applies particularly for the Election Commission , as well as the ruling Awami League . 
@@99648233 <p> The finance minister announced the budget earlier this month and has been taking a lot of heat on a number of issues -- the resource shortfall , the new tax proposals , and its impact on inflation , to name a few . The proposed budget for 2023-24 has a total outlay of Tk 7.62 trillion ( a 15 percent jump ) with development expenditures at Tk 2.59 trillion and non-development expenditures at Tk 4.11 trillion . The budget has been promoted as a " Smart Budget " with the upcoming elections in mind . A Ministry of Finance announcement proclaimed that the " Smart Bangladesh " concept is based on four main pillars which are smart citizens , smart government , smart society and smart economy . " The budget for the next fiscal year ( FY24 ) will be the first budget towards building ' Smart Bangladesh ' , " added the release . <p> I do not envy the FM because his job is tough even under normal circumstances , and these times are anything but .

" Pollyanna " is the name of the eleven-year-old orphan girl , the heroine in the novel by that name , and has become a byword for someone who , like the title character , has an unfailingly optimistic outlook . A nation , and I mean Bangladesh , facing gloomy days ahead can also collectively use the Pollyanna method to cope with the real difficulties and sorrows that , along with luck and joy , shape every life . <p> The FM is definitely a Pollyanna : he sounded like one when he declared , " The budget will be for the poor .

" But on close reading of the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic resource mobilisation , an uphill battle to increase the tax/GDP ratio , an out-of-control inflation hammering the poor and the middle class , and the IMF breathing down the government 's neck . <p> The government is fully aware of the headwinds it faces as it tries to push the GDP growth rate to 7.5 percent , as opposed to last year 's actualised rate which was 5.3 percent according to an Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) report and 6.03 percent according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics ( BBS ) . <p> Some sources apprehend that the proposed budget " continues the crowding out by envisaging a growth of 75 percent in domestic financing compared to two years ago . " It is needless to mention , this might keep up the pressure on prices . <p> The finance ministry has provided some supporting documents to back up the FM 's goals . We learned that the budgetary allocation aims to tame inflation alongside the higher GDP growth trajectory . While the inflation rate broadcast by BBS is currently in the neighbourhood of 10 percent , independent calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Centre for Policy Dialogue ( CPD ) put the effective rate at 15 percent . <p> Of major concern is the cost of living , particularly for the common person . The budget aims to bring down the inflation rate to 6.5 percent . Unfortunately , the budget will do nothing to ease the hardship and the budgetary crunch felt by the common man . " If a product 's price rises 10 percent in the international market , it increases 30 percent in the local market . We have shown it item by item in CPD 's analysis , " said the Executive Director of CPD at a post-budget review session . <p> The FM of Bangladesh is in a unique position among his fellow global finance ministers . The budget is presented to the parliament and gets automatic approval , because of the sheer size of the ruling party 's majority .

According to Fitch Ratings , the gap between budgeted spending and actual spending has oscillated between 20 percent and 30 percent of the projected spending target if we consider the last five years ' statistics . Obviously two of the major determinants of the expected shortfall is the GDP growth rate and the revenue projections . " The Bangladesh government 's projection that the budget deficit will remain broadly stable in the year to June 2024 ( FY24 ) could be vulnerable if growth undershoots the authorities ' relatively optimistic target , " says Fitch Ratings . The same could be said about spending .

The resulting high level of government borrowing has caused liquidity shortages and crowded out private activity . Some sources apprehend that the proposed budget " continues the crowding out by envisaging a growth of 75 percent in domestic financing compared to two years ago . " It is needless to mention , this might keep up the pressure on prices . <p> On a positive note , the budget document is presenting some initiatives to offer support for the vulnerable population , to renew the pledge to bring down inflation further , and to raise the tax to GDP ratio from 9 to 13 percent to reduce deficits .

Many determined professionals share this desire , but the path to success can be daunting and difficult to navigate . However , through my own experiences and reflections prompted by conversations with many young colleagues , I have identified six tactics that have consistently propelled my progress within organisations . <p> A sponsor is more important than a mentor : The first tactic is to secure sponsorship from someone within your workplace who recognises your potential and can significantly benefit your career . A sponsor is a critical relationship in your career . While seeking one out may not be a straightforward task , it is the sponsor who recognises your strength based on a combination of professional and personal factors . <p> Remember that authenticity is your competitive advantage , and therefore , you should stand out from your peers by showcasing your unique qualities and making yourself noticeable , increasing your chances of attracting a worthy sponsor 's attention to speak in your absence . I recommend listening to Carla Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultivation of mentorship is crucial : The second tactic is to cultivate mentorship , and I will recommend finding a mentor or sounding board outside of your immediate professional environment to gain fresh perspectives and impartial counsel . The mentor 's sole agenda should be to help you grow and succeed in your career from a broader perspective . <p> Right networking is the key : The third crucial strategy to embrace in advancing your career is networking . Building a strong professional network requires a long-term commitment , testing your patience and dedication . Although the returns may not materialise immediately , networking often leads to priceless rewards . By genuinely connecting with others and nurturing relationships , you create a strong support system capable of propelling your career to new heights . <p> Managing internal politics is important : The fourth strategy is to learn how to manage politics professionally . Politics exist within every organisation and learning how to navigate this landscape is crucial for career advancement . <p> Recognise that challenges are expected but your skilful maneuvering can make a difference . You need to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions . Wisely building alliances with key stakeholders can significantly influence your path . Advocating for yourself with integrity and confidence is crucial in successfully navigating an organisation 's political environment . <p> Maintaining positive connections will help : My fifth piece of advice will be to maintain positive connections with every person you come across during your career , regardless of their position within the organisation . Remember that karma is real and actions have a way of resurfacing , so you never know when or where you might encounter former colleagues , juniors , or superiors in the future . Building a reputation for professionalism , respect , and being cordial opens doors for potential opportunities and partnerships in the long run . <p> Maintaining a supportive ecosystem can ensure sustained results : Establishing a supportive ecosystem outside of work is the sixth strategy .

@@100569240 <p> Information and Broadcasting Minister Dr. Hasan Mahmud on Tuesday said the BNP has ' once again ' been proven as a ' terrorist organization ' on the international stage . <p> The I&amp;B minister was visiting the Bangladesh Television Center project site in Rangpur on Tuesday afternoon , when journalists asked him to comment on the recent verdict of a Canadian federal court denying political asylum to Md Jypsed Ibne Haque , a Bangladeshi national who was actively involved in BNP politics as an activist from 2011-15 . <p> " Canadian court 's verdict in previous cases involving BNP members seeking political asylum in Canada clearly labelled BNP as a terrorist organization , involved in trying to overthrow the democratically elected government by force and engaging in terrorist activities such as vehicle and people burning , " Hasan Mahmud said in response . <p> " A recent case of another BNP leader applying for political asylum in Canada resulted in a similar ruling from the Federal Court , categorizing BNP as a terrorist organization and rejecting the plea for asylum , " he added . <p> However , a perusal of the text of the verdict posted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality to the I&amp;B minister 's interpretation of the decision . Perhaps most pertinently , the verdict categorically states : " The ID ( Immigration Division of Canada ) did not find reasonable grounds to believe that the BNP was an organization that had engaged in terrorism . " <p> Rather , the verdict makes it clear that Haque 's original application for asylum was rejected by the ID on finding " reasonable grounds to believe the BNP was an organization that had engaged in or instigated the subversion by force of the Awami League government in Bangladesh . " <p> The wording is important here - note that it says " that had engaged in or instigated " . So whatever " subversion by force " the BNP was adjudged to have participated in or instigated is placed very much in the past , at a very specific time . Haque had been a member of the BNP from 2011-15 . In assessing his application for asylum , it is the BNP 's activities and programmes during that period that the ID would put under the scanner . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in subversion by force back then , is not meant to reflect the party 's nature or activities today . <p> Besides , the elements of ' subversion by force ' and what may constitute it , made for a very lively debate between the two sides . It also provided the grounds for Haque 's final application for judicial review of the ID 's decision . <p> Through his counsel , Haque argued that an essential element of ' subversion by force ' would have to be an intention to topple or overthrow the government of the day . But the BNP 's movement was not focused on toppling the government , but rather the reinstatement of the caretaker government system to oversee free and fair elections in the country - and thus , essentially democratic or pro-democracy . <p> The ID considered the meaning of " subversion by force " in the case law and in dictionary definitions . The ID found that subversion by force required a finding of intention and that the object of subversion is to overthrow a government . For subversion purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , during an attempt to overthrow a government . <p> After setting out its conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the BNP intended to use force , or the threat of force , in an attempt to overthrow the Awami League government , the ID found it clear that the requisite elements of subversion were satisfied in the BNP 's efforts " to step outside the democratic process " . <p> The ID did not agree that the definition of subversion necessarily required the actual ouster or overthrow of a government , but included the concepts of corrupting and destroying . <p> In the end , the judge sided with the ID and dismissed the application for judicial review . But this was not due to a finding that Haque , as a member of the BNP , had been a member of an organization for which there were reasonable grounds to believe it engaged in terrorism . <p> That did not stop Hasan Mahmud , also joint general secretary of AL , from saying that BNP should feel ' ashamed ' .

After a meeting with her , Tamim revealed that " he could n't say no to the head of the government " and changed his mind , deciding to continue playing for Bangladesh . <p> Tamim had initially made the retirement decision in response to the board president 's harsh criticism , which arose due to his decision to play the first Afghanistan ODI despite not being fully fit during the last home series . Prior to that match in Chattogram , Tamim had stated that he would play to assess the status of his injury . <p> The board president , in a conversation with a Bengali daily just a day later , asserted that a captain can not assess his fitness in an international match .

@@100630238 <p> In today 's interconnected world , access to reliable and high-speed internet has become an essential aspect of modern life . The internet serves as the backbone of communication , information sharing , education , business , and countless other activities that shape our daily routines . However , despite the significant advancements in internet technology over the past few decades , a considerable part of the global population remains underserved or even entirely disconnected from the digital world . This digital divide is particularly evident in rural and remote areas , where traditional internet infrastructure is often impractical or prohibitively expensive to deploy . <p> To address this pressing issue and fulfill the growing necessity for internet services worldwide , innovative solutions have emerged . One of the most ambitious and groundbreaking ventures is Starlink , a satellite internet constellation project spearheaded by SpaceX , the private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk . <h> What is StarLink ? <p> Starlink is a project created by SpaceX , a private company led by Elon Musk . They 're putting a bunch of satellites up in space to make the internet work better for everyone . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet to even the remotest places on earth . Officially launched in 2019 , the primary goal of Starlink is to provide global internet coverage by deploying a large number of small satellites into low earth orbit ( LEO ) . <p> As of May 2023 , Starlink 's operational network encompasses more than 4,000 mass-produced , compact satellites positioned in LEO . These satellites maintain communication with specific ground transceivers . The ambitious project aims to deploy a total of nearly 12,000 satellites , with potential future expansion of up to 42,000 satellites . Notably , SpaceX celebrated reaching a significant milestone by acquiring over 1 million subscribers in December 2022 , and within just a few months , that number surged to 1.5 million subscribers as of May 2023 . <h> The Starlink Constellation : Size and Ambition <p> The Starlink constellation consists of thousands of satellites orbiting at altitudes between 340 km ( 210 miles ) and 1,200 km ( 750 miles ) above earth 's surface . These satellites work in a cycle to create a network that beams high-speed internet signals down to earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly referred to as user terminals or satellite dishes . <p> Starlink 's internet is different from regular internet because it does n't use towers and cables on the ground . Instead , it has satellites that fly much closer to the earth . This closeness makes the internet faster because data does n't have to travel as far . It 's like having a shorter distance for messages to go back and forth between you and the satellite . This is really helpful in places that are far away from cities or places where getting good internet is hard . So , Starlink can provide better internet performance , especially in those remote and underserved areas . <h> Beta Testing and Expansion <p> Starlink has conducted multiple phases of beta testing , known as the " Better Than Nothing Beta " program , where users in select regions were invited to test the service and provide feedback . During the beta phase , the system underwent improvements and optimizations based on user experiences . <p> As the beta testing progresses , SpaceX has gradually expanded the coverage area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company has been seeking regulatory approvals from various countries to operate its satellite internet service globally . <h> User Terminals ( Satellite Dishes ) <p> To access the Starlink internet service , users receive a phased-array satellite dish , commonly known as a user terminal or satellite dish . These user terminals are designed to automatically track and connect to passing satellites overhead , making it easy for users to set up and use the service . <p> Starlink 's satellite constellation ( Image : Wikipedia ) <p> The idea behind Starlink is to offer internet connectivity to regions where laying terrestrial cables or setting up traditional communication infrastructure is impractical or economically unviable . These areas often include rural and remote locations that suffer from limited or no access to high-speed internet services . Starlink aims to bridge the global connectivity divide and bring reliable internet access to virtually every corner of the world . <h> The Future of Starlink <p> Elon Musk has expressed his ambitious vision for Starlink , emphasizing that the revenue generated from the project would be used to fund future space exploration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications for SpaceX 's broader goals , including funding the development of space technologies , like the Starship spacecraft , to facilitate missions to the Moon , Mars , and beyond . <p> In addition to serving individual users , Starlink has expressed interest in collaborating with enterprises , airlines , ships , and other entities that could benefit from reliable high-speed internet services in remote locations . <p> SpaceX continues to deploy new satellites regularly , gradually expanding the Starlink constellation to achieve its vision of providing global internet coverage . Starlink 's ambitious and innovative approach has garnered significant attention and interest , with potential implications for various industries and communities worldwide . As the project progresses , it holds the promise of revolutionizing internet connectivity and making a significant impact on the digital landscape on a global scale . <h> Launching Satellite Internet Service in Bangladesh <p> SpaceX has expressed its interest in launching its satellite internet service in Bangladesh . In pursuit of this initiative , representatives from the US-based company , led by Joel Meredith , the manager for global government affairs , and Parnil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held meetings with key officials from the Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited ( BSCL ) and the ICT Division . The discussions revolved around the potential collaboration and implementation of Starlink 's services in Bangladesh . <p> However , they will need to get approval from the government . During a demonstration , SpaceX officials showcased the internet and download speed of Starlink , which impressively reached approximately 500mbps when tested in the morning . The demonstration aimed to highlight the capabilities and performance of Starlink 's internet service , indicating its potential for high-speed connectivity . <p> Starlink provided two devices , and one of them will be used at the Sheikh Russel Digital Lab , situated in a remote area where access to high-speed internet is currently unavailable . By utilizing Starlink 's technology , the lab aims to bridge the digital divide and provide reliable and fast internet connectivity to remote locations , enhancing communication and opportunities for the community in the area . The second Starlink device will be utilized in a movable bus , specifically catering to women 's needs . <p> So , Bangladesh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's connection for people residing on islands and remote areas , including chars ( river islands ) , as well as for students attending marginalized schools . The ICT division will make a decision about approving Starlink after three months of the pilot program . The ICT department will see if Starlink 's internet is useful in education , research , and health . <h> Final Words <p> As we progress through the 21st century , the digital divide continues to present a major challenge . Bridging this gap and ensuring that everyone can access the transformative capabilities of the internet is not just a technological pursuit ; it is a crucial societal responsibility . <p> Starlink 's ambitious satellite constellation holds the promise of uniting the world , empowering communities , and propelling progress even in the most remote regions of the planet . As this revolutionary project continues to evolve , it offers hope for a more inclusive and connected future for all .

@@102349230 <h> Analysis of Bangladesh Squad for ICC World Cup 2023 <p> Some Players of the Bangladesh ODI Squad in the ICC World Cup 2023 ( UNB Digital Image ) <p> ICC World Cup starts today ( October 5 , 2023 ) , and Bangladesh announced the squad on September 26 . While other nations revealed their squads early , Bangladesh was the final team to make the announcement . <p> The day before the announcement of the World Cup team , a midnight meeting took place at the residence of the BCB president . Speculations regarding Tamim Iqbal 's fitness in the media , and decisions involving Hathurusingha and Shakib Al Hasan all unfolded in a dramatic manner . In this intense situation , the Bangladesh Cricket Board revealed the final Cricket World Cup team , notably without the experienced batsman Tamim . <h> Analysis of Bangladesh ODI Squad <p> Heading into the 2023 World Cup , Bangladesh is positioned as the underdog ; however , they possess the capability to challenge the tournament favourites . Throughout this year , their performance in ODIs has been respectable , securing eight victories out of 20 matches , and one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the captaincy responsibilities were handed over to Shakib Al Hasan , a decision prompted by Tamim Iqbal 's fitness concerns . <p> Now that Tamim Iqbal is left out of the World Cup , fans are not seeing the Tamim-Litton pair in the opening . However , the absence of Tamim may not hamper Bangladesh 's performance . This year , Tamim Iqbal played 11 ODIs for Bangladesh and scored 283 runs . He did not have a significant contribution in most of the matches . His highest score in 2023 was 69 runs against Ireland at Chelmsford on May 14 , 2023 . Since Bangladesh is starting the World Cup with a balanced team , Tigers can do well without Tamim . <p> The change in leadership could prove beneficial for the Bangladeshi team , considering Shakib 's standing as arguably the best player in the squad . Renowned for leading from the front with his exceptional all-rounder skills , the veteran is expected to bring a fighting spirit to the team in the upcoming competition . Under their stylish all-rounder , Bangladesh aims to show some power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India for the 2023 World Cup with a well-balanced squad . The team comprises a mix of experienced players and promising newcomers , a combination that holds potential advantages . The veterans like Shakib , Mushfiqur Rahim , and Mahmudullah take charge and motivate emerging talents such as Tanzid Hasan , Towhid Hridoy , Shoriful Islam , and Hasan Mahmud to deliver their best for the team . <h> Strengths <p> Bangladesh remains competitive in cricket due to its proficient spin-bowling attack . Shakib Al Hasan 's dual role as an all-rounder provides a crucial balance , particularly with his strategic bowling . Supported by Mehidy Hasan Miraz , the team benefits from a blend of off-break and left-arm spin . Shakib 's experience , especially in Indian conditions , and impressive World Cup track record make him pivotal for key matches in subcontinental settings . <h> Weakness <p> Heading to the ICC Men 's Cricket World Cup 2023 , several teams , including Bangladesh , are dealing with injuries . Ebadot Hossain , a key fast bowler for Bangladesh , has been sidelined due to a significant knee injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management expressing the desire to include Tamim Iqbal in the squad , a persistent back injury has ultimately prevented his inclusion in the final lineup . <p> The Tigers ' passionate displays are admirable , but their ability to control emotions during critical moments is crucial . Past controversies , like animated celebrations and verbal conflicts , raise concerns . <p> Also , Bangladesh occasionally lacks a winning mentality , exemplified by Shakib Al Hasan 's prior comment . Shifting towards a confident belief in winning , rather than a defensive approach , is vital for success in the upcoming games . <h> Key Players in Bangladesh ODI World Cup 2023 <h> Shakib Al Hasan <p> In the 2019 World Cup , Shakib Al Hasan emerged as a standout performer , picked by many people as the unofficial player of the Tournament . He consistently surpassed fifty in seven out of eight innings , achieving two centuries . Remarkably , he became the first cricketer to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single top-level ODI tournament . <p> Shakib also continued his performance in 2023 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored 549 runs with the highest runs of 93 and 5 fifties . He also took 14 wickets from 16 matches with 4/35 best bowling score . So , the Bangladesh team will greatly depend on Shakib 's performance as an all-rounder and a captain . <h> Mehidy Hasan Miraz <p> 25-year-old all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz is an important member of the Bangladesh team . He has shown that he has the ability to play big innings when given a chance by scoring a century to open the Afghanistan match in the Asia Cup . And he is a proven name with the ball . So far , he has played 82 ODI matches for Bangladesh and grabbed 91 wickets with 4/25 best bowling innings . So , Miraz has a good chance to do some magic . <h> Towhid Hridoy <p> Despite his recent debut , Hridoy is swiftly becoming a prominent figure in Bangladesh cricket . Across various series and tournaments , he consistently makes an indelible mark with his remarkable talent . As an under-19 World Cup winner in 2020 , he played a crucial role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Towhid Hridoy has been impressive in the latest matches . This year , he played 17 matches and scored 518 runs with an 86.33 strike rate . Hridoy came to the limelight after his 82 and 54 runs in the 2023 Asia Cup . However , he could not give his best in the New Zealand series in September 2023 . But , still , Towhid can change the game in top order . <h> Taskin Ahmed <p> This year , Taskin appeared in 10 innings and grabbed 21 wickets . His tremendous performance in the Asia Cup 2023 , taking 9 wickets from 4 matches , made him one of the players to watch in the 2023 World Cup . Notably , the 28-year-old fast bowler played a great role in Bangladesh 's triumph against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup 2023 , delivering an impressive performance with bowling figures of 4 for 44 in 8.3 overs . However , Taskin got 1 wicket in the World Cup match against Against se . <h> Final Words <p> The Bangladesh cricket squad possesses considerable talent and the potential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup . Nonetheless , there have been instances where the team appears to lack unity . If each player maximizes their individual talents , Bangladesh stands a chance of causing an upset in the tournament .

@@102349234 <p> The government of Bangladesh is hoping to return the economy to its pre-COVID growth momentum by the end of the current fiscal ( 2023-24 ) , although that presents a significant challenge in the face of a clutch of economic headwinds . <p> The government 's vision for economic recovery is outlined in the " Medium Term Macroeconomic Policy Statement 2023-24 to 2025-26 , " prepared by the Macroeconomy Wing of the Finance Division , under the Finance Ministry . <p> It maintains that with the onset of the pandemic in 2020 , the economy was knocked off its fast-paced growth trajectory for large parts of the last three years . The first confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Bangladesh were reported in March 2020 , less than three months after the outbreak in Wuhan . <p> Recently published quarterly GDP data ( in keeping with a condition set by the IMF ) bears this out . It reveals that the economy contracted by a massive 7.86 percent in the last quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal ( April to June 2020 ) , as the virus spread throughout the globe . <p> According to the quarterly data released retrospectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GDP had grown by between 6.5 to 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2019-20 . That reflects the extent to which the wind was knocked out of the economy by the negative growth ( contraction ) in the fourth quarter . <p> The slump induced by Covid would keep economic performance depressed through the first two quarters of the next fiscal ( 2020-21 ) . It was n't until the 3Q ( January to March , 2021 ) that the first signs of a recovery would become visible . <p> As the 2021-22 fiscal kicked in , Bangladesh looked ready to put Covid-19 behind it , having implemented a successful vaccination programme and lifted lockdown restrictions . The economy rallied robustly , and GDP growth touched 10 percent in the third quarter ( January to March 2022 ) . <p> Yet even as the recovery was underway , the seeds for it to stumble were sown halfway across the globe , with Russia going to war in Ukraine in February 2022 . The resulting volatility in international energy markets and supply chain disruptions would knock the momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although there was nothing like the contraction precipitated by Covid-19 , the economy did experience a severe slowdown in the last quarter of FY22 , slipping to just 2.6 percent from the previous quarter 's high of 10 percent . <p> " Bangladesh also braced for impacts on its economy . However , actual data shows that Bangladesh did impressively even during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak and is expected to return to pre-Covid growth trajectory by the end of FY 2023-24 , " the statement surmises . <p> If everything goes according to plan and ' assumptions hold ' , it says that 8 percent GDP growth rate can be attained again in 2025-26 . <p> " Therefore , the deviation of the actual from the planned growth envisaged in the 8th FYP ( Five Year Plan ) remained small , " it said . <p> The Macroeconomic Policy Statement mentions capital accumulation is key for development and hence the government aims to foster private investment along with public investment towards fulfilment of its goals .. <p> Total investment in FY 2021-22 stood at 32 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sectors were 24.5 and 7.5 percent , respectively . To achieve the long and medium-term growth targets , the level of investment will need to be increased further . <p> The statement points out that there is room to increase the implementation rate of public investment . If the pace of implementation of development projects can be increased , the required level of investment can be attained . <p> " Recognising this , the government has taken steps to bring about some structural changes in both project design and implementation levels , " it says in the statement . <p> The Finance Division document said that the Russia-Ukraine war has put global energy supplies at risk . Russia is a major global supplier of energy and hence when the war broke out , commodity prices spiked fast . <p> Bangladesh started to suffer from this like almost all other countries . By December 2022 , point-to-point inflation rose to 8.7 percent and then further rose to 9.3 percent by March 2023 . <p> However , global commodity prices are already falling , and central banks have raised policy rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down in the coming months . <p> The IMF has projected that the measures taken by the governments will help reduce inflation in the medium-term . The Finance Division has projected that average inflation will fall significantly to 6.0 percent in 2023-24 , although there has been no indication of it through the first quarter ( July to September ) . <p> In order to tame inflation and protect the incomes of the poor , the government has emphasised increasing the domestic production of essential items , while gradually tightening monetary policy . <p> The document says that food inflation hurts the poor the most . Keeping this in mind , the government through various measures , including subsidies and incentives , encouraged the growth of agricultural output . <p> To support the agriculture sector , disbursement of credit to the sector has been increased . <p> By the end of February 2023 , the disbursement of agricultural credit and non-farm rural credit amounted to Tk. 210.66 billion in the first 8 months of the last fiscal , which was almost 14 percent higher , year on year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the general index of industrial production ( medium and large-scale manufacturing ) has been on the rise , reflecting expanded industrial production . <p> Dr Masrur Reaz , a prominent economist and public policy analyst , believes it would be very challenging to regain the pre-Covid momentum within the current fiscal , since a number of macroeconomic indicators have become unstable . <p> Talking to UNB , he suggested the government focus on stabilising the macroeconomic situation first , which would make the economy more sustainable in the long run . <p> Dr Reaz pointed out that high inflation , severe foreign exchange/dollar crisis preventing , among other things , opening of LCs , and the fluctuating value of domestic currency taka , should be resolved first . <p> " To bring the economy back to its pre-Covid growth rate , these issues should be resolved first , which itself would be very challenging and difficult in a short time , " he opined . <p> Explaining further , Dr Reaz said : " The time is to stabilise the economy rather than focus on growth .
