It expects no foreseeable difficulties when seeking to integrate the truncation system in Tanzania , he declared . <p> Computech-ICS ( T ) Ltd has emerges as the local partner with Sybrin Systems Ltd after a two months search for a company with matching or adaptable business solutions that suit the country 's market needs for cheques truncation solutions , officials said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patil said in a recent interview at a show and seminar on the company 's business solutions that the company 's banking solutions were appropriate for the local environment . <p> The seminar which brought together bank operational officers commended the use of cheque truncation in their operations as part of efforts for healthier bank transactions and service uplift for customers as well .

Press freedom in Tanzania is at the crossroads . <p> Behind this fear , doubt and shuttered hope , there 's a misleading lie that press freedom in Tanzania is a gift from our rulers . There are those who claim that the freedom of the press we have seen in this country is a reward from our rulers , which is a pure lie and , above all , cheap propaganda . Press freedom is a fundamental human right , which is not granted by any ruler and should be protected by the constitution . <p> If we believe that Press freedom is a reward from our rulers , then we should n't be surprised if the very same rulers take that freedom back once we have angered them for reporting what they call ' bad stories .

" <p> But when the very same newspapers wrote what he disliked , the same Jefferson later on said , " The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers . " <p> That 's why today we call upon all journalists and all well-wishers to understand that press freedom is not a gift given on a golden plate by our rulers ; it 's our fundamental right as human beings , which can only be granted and protected by the constitution . <p> Tanzanian journalists and media owners should n't be fooled at all that press freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a total lie .

There would be a variation of 1 or 1.5 tonnes , and this convinced the minister to give the excess five tonnes cargo allowance , " noted Lukumay . <p> The TATOA official explained that the boycott supposed to take effect beginning today " is not about protesting the government 's decision but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel corruption " . <p> " What the boycott effectively means is that all our trucks will remain parked at whatever point they will be by Monday until further notice , " he said , without hinting on the inconveniences the move could cause in the event of some trucks hindering the general flow of traffic . <p> This paper has recently noticed an unusually big number of trucks lined up at some weighbridges in different parts of the country , sometimes the queues up to two kilometres long , apparently because of snail 's pace at which they are cleared .
