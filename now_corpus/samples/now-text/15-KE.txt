We need to move away from that and address it as a major order of business . We must provide the necessary facilities that will ensure cancer patients do not die prematurely , and this is the responsibility of both the public and private sector . <p> It is time we took action because cancer is spreading like bush fire and killing indiscriminately . <p> Our public health facilities where most cancer patients seek care and treatment must be equipped to a high standard to deal with these rising cases . <p> We must have a data system that is current so that we can understand as a country the magnitude of the problem we are dealing with . <p> Let us also choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all and maximise quality of life for cancer patients . <p> As the business community , we need to realise that we also have a role in this .

@@1933231 <h> Who will speak up for the boy child ? <h> share <p> I am neither a misogynist nor an anti-woman campaigner , but I am now beginning to be cold and repulsive to all these ubiquitous campaigns about the girl-child . The girl-child was once vulnerable -- may be still is -- and this led to intense campaigns and other feminine and masculine outlets to save and protect her . <p> However , the trend is changing and from my intuition that often leads me to the true north , I believe the boy-child is now the one facing imminent extinction , literally . <p> We have all shifted our concerns to the fairer sex , completely ignoring the misfortunes of the boy-child . I have seen him in the streets , breaking his back on dump sites , sniffing from his acrid bottle , carrying a greasy sack and many a time being whisked away by city county askaris . <p> Though the girl-child may too be in this , I can bet my right arm they are a handful .

No one speaks about him anymore yet he is the one now facing the possibility of being out-faced by the girl-child . <p> I may receive a fierce hit-back from the womenfolk but I will now speak for the boy-child . How do you speak of gender parity when you have all aligned the predicaments of one gender ? It 's true that the challenges of both genders is at a parallel but we ca n't really afford to immerse ourselves so much into issues with only one discourse that will in the end pull over a lining over the concerns of the other . <p> I believe that it 's good to empower a woman , after all , POTUS said we should , to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it sometimes gets to a point when the women themselves feel like they are weaklings for being spoon-fed without having to put forward their strive into whatever is their pursuit . <p> A lot stands to be corrected regarding the same though this should also not take us back to the conservativeness we once had of underestimating the strength of a woman . However , I hold on to the perception that the girl-child should also be allowed to start off from the same point with the boy- child , at least intermittently . We may be having our disadvantages but this should not be overrated . <p> They say -- and yes it 's true -- that sometimes the best man for the job is a woman and did n't I just hear you say that what a man can do a woman can do better ?
