@@4525239 <h> Bangladesh brands <p> A night-time view of an Aarong billboard in Dhaka . Aarong has graduated into one of the country 's most popular fashion brands . Photo : Palash KhanMamun Rashid <p> Consumer perception of the word " brand " is usually associated with quality . In the western world , with the variety and options available , it is the concept of brands that help consumers decipher and match their needs to that of the products available in the market . <p> Asian countries , particularly our own Bangladesh , use other sensibilities rather than simply resorting to quality . The inclination of most Asian nations to their culture is inherent to their way of life and it is no different when it comes to our own version of " retail therapy . " <p> In most Asian countries , we see culture is a phenomenon that is adapted by the residents . Such forms the basis of our " cultural branding " in Bangladesh . The Bangladeshi brands are representative of our culture , our preferences and most importantly , our identities . In Bangladesh , whether it is ? Bogra 's doi ? , ? Comilla 's rashmalai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kachchi or ? Tangail 's cham cham ? , " we can immediately relate to each product and relate it with our culture and our roots as memories from yesteryear to the present day all come flooding back . <p> Innovation is the key to the global marketing world . The more you invent new ways of doing things and the more technology savvy the product is , the more is its demand in the market . This is a clear distinction from most of our local brands . Every district of Bangladesh has its specialty , be it in sweetmeat , handicrafts , agricultural produce , or even fish , and this is what the common man finds himself relating to . These are interests and beliefs that have been passed on from generation to generation . <p> For instance , when it comes to handicrafts , Aarong ' has made its mark in the Bangladeshi market and even those visiting from abroad know that it is the landmark for getting traditional artwork and crafts . The " nakhshikantha " and ? jamdani saree ? is a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of intricate artwork . Such handiwork is said to be rare , as the world has moved onto efficiency and most processes are automated , there are still brands that are labour-intensive and require a lot of creative attention . Inspired by Aarong ' , we today have new brands like Jatra ' ' Shada Kalo ' and Deshal ' ; although they may not be as big as Aarong . <p> One example of the use of technology would be the initiation of Grameenphone . In true Bangladeshi tradition , that too has a rich history unlike any other seen abroad -- the first mobile phone for rural women -- whereby women empowerment took on a whole new meaning . Grameenphones were first distributed to women entrepreneurs who partook in the micro-finance scheme developed by Grameen Bank . They would use the phones of getting in touch with markets and operate as sellers themselves or as middle-women .

Similar with the case of esteemed vernacular daily The Prothom Alo ' or most-circulated English daily , The Daily Star . <p> Brands were originally developed as labels of ownership . However , today it is what they do for people that matters much more , how they reflect and engage them , how they define their aspirations , represent their personality and protect them from greed or misdeeds . Powerful brands can drive success in competitive and financial markets , and indeed become an organisation 's most valuable assets . Aromatic soap entered the market with strong brand positioning as a halal soap ' ; however , it lasted for a very short period of time . On the other hand , Unilever 's Lux soap has been occupying the mind space of their target market for a long time , and is still has strong market share with continuous investment in branding . <p> Another example of local brand is Otobi ' . Who could have imagined that furniture making can turn a small company into the producer of world class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes may prove to be a disqualifying factor when it comes to making that final purchase . One must properly comprehend that the use and understanding of brands differ from country to country . Hence , it is essential that if comparisons must be made , then it should be done on a platform taking into account differences in perceptions . <p> In the final analysis , it is based on perception that people purchase and consume what they do and that is something that marketers must be in tune with in order to meet demand with supply . From the Bangladesh perspective , it can be seen that the choice is based on not only what is of popular demand but items which are passed down traditionally from generation to generation . <p> The process of sustaining the brand image is an ongoing process which marketers have to take into consideration . This may pose to be a similarity between nations all over the world when it comes to the brand that they refer to in the local and international context , whereby the continued popularity of a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be sustained .
