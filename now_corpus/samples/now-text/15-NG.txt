The legislators threw decency to the dogs as they tackled one another on the constitutionality or otherwise of the plan to deploy troops <p> The motion on the matter was raised last week by the Minority Leader , Hon Femi Gbajabiamila , but was assigned to a Joint Committee on Rules and Busi ? ness , Justice and Judiciary , headed by Hon. Albert Sam Tsokwa ( PDP , Taraba ) to investigate . Yesterday 's drama started when the Deputy Speaker , Hon. Emeka Ihedioha , ( PDP , Imo ) , who presided over the plenary , raised the issue . <p> He asked the Chairman , Joint Com ? mittees on Rules and Business , Justice and Judiciary , Hon. Tsokwa to advise the House if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on an earlier Point of Order raised by Hon. Sunday Karimi that the issue regard ? ing the legality or otherwise of military deployment is in court and therefore , should not be debated by the chamber . <p> Presenting the report of his commit ? tee , Tsokwa said , " neither Karimi nor Gbajabiamila provided any evidence that the case is in court or otherwise " . <p> But he submitted that " the motion can ? not be heard by the House based on con ? stitutional grounds , on issues bordering on presidential powers in the determina ? tion of operational use of the military " . <p> His submission was not taken kindly by APC lawmakers . The atmosphere became charged when Ihedioha , having listened to the report , attempted to rule without giving any right of reply to the mover of the motion . <p> Hon. Gbajabiamila , sensing the di ? mension of the proceeding , challenged Tsokwa , saying the report went beyond its terms of reference . He said the report failed to address the concern of the Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a prolonged shouting , finger pointing , accusations and counter-ac ? cusations by lawmakers from the two parties , Ihedioha ruled on the matter . He sustained the Point of Order raised by Hon. Karimi . <p> The decision provoked another Point of Order by Hon. Gbajabiamila . When he noted that the report read by Hon. Tsokwa never stated whether the matter was in the court as alleged by Karimi in his Point of Order , and as such , argued that the order had no basis to be sus ? tained . <p> The Deputy Speaker , in trying to en ? sure the sanctity of the gavel , told Hon. Gbajabiamila that he had already ruled on the matter and can not revisit it , argu ? ing that such move would be unconven ? tional . <p> He said , " the matter had been ruled upon , and the House must move for ? ward .

Leo Ogor , defended Hon , Ihedioha , not ? ing that " the authority of the Speaker must be respected irrespective of who sits on the chair . He said : " Mr. Speaker , my dear colleagues , when matters are discussed in this House , it is important that members respect the sanctity of the office of the Speaker who is the presid ? ing officer " . <p> But despite the intervention of Ogor and Bawa , APC lawmakers led by Gba ? jabiamila walked out of the chamber . However , they returned to their seats after briefing the media on the develop ? ment . <p> At the briefing , Gbajabiamila stated that the House had once again witnessed a lopsided and highly partisan conduct of Hon. Ihedioha , who would allow Tsokwa to debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of report . <p> He said : " Today , we see another sub ? version of parliamentary procedures giv ? en the kind of Deputy Speaker that we have in this country by allowing another person to debate my motion for me . <p> " Yesterday ( Tuesday ) , we also saw how he allowed a member to present a motion that was actually sponsored by another member who was not on the floor . He would have allowed it pass if not for our steadfastness on that matter . <p> " This is the first time in the history of this democracy that we will have a partisan Deputy Speaker as a presid ? ing officer , who sees himself more as a Deputy Speaker of a political party when we have a Speaker , who sees himself as Speaker of the Federal Republic of Ni ? geria . <p> " For him to try to sustain a Point of Order which was not justified due to lack of evidence just because he wants the motion to die is highly preposterous . <p> " Respect begets respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not respect himself in matters of national importance . And I 'm assuring all of you that -- that motion will not die " , he said . <p> Osagie said his anger was due to the alleged Deputy Speaker 's refusal to ac ? knowledge his desire to raise a Point of Order not only as a matter of right as a member of the House , but also as a mat ? ter of privilege and as a principal officer . <p> The PDP caucus however , through its leader , Hon. Mulikat Akande-Adeola ( PDP , Oyo ) , told newsmen that " in the parliament , decisions may not always go your way . But as legislators , we must learn to respect the rules at all times " . She noted that lawmakers must always observe decorum in their conduct during proceedings on the floor of the House . <p> Hon. Ihedioha also stressed the need for members of the opposition to respect the office of the Deputy Speaker as a pre ? siding officer . <p> " He is not sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as a symbol of authority of the House , and that authority must be respected . It is the lack of that respect shown by the Minority Leader by refusing to approach the chair as de ? manded by the presiding officer that got me upset " , he said . 
@@1908234 <h> Gradually , Calabar Port comes alive again <p> On November 17 , 2014 , when President Goodluck Jonathan flagged off the operations of the Calabar Channel Management ( CCM ) , a joint venture company between Nigeria Ports Authority ( NPA ) and Messrs Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited , for the dredging of the Calabar Port , many did not give the project a chance . <p> This was because the Federal Government had in the past , made several investments in the dredging of the Calabar Port so as to ensure safe navigation , but such efforts had failed to work despite the huge sum that had been invested in them . <p> But barely four months after the flag-off , which was performed by the Minister of Transport , Senator Idris Umar on behalf of the President , the port has come to life again with vessels of between 7.5 and 7.8 metres sailing into it . <p> The contractors are presently carrying out capital and maintenance dredging of the water channel well known for its shallow draught that has hampered bigger vessels from coming into the port in the last decades . <p> So far , CCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck removal cranes and other ancillary marine crafts to the water channel for its operation . <p> For maritime watchers , it is a strong indication that robust business activities would , in the next couple of months , begin to take place in Calabar and would , no doubt , change the face of the state , hitherto regarded as sleepy . It would also change the entire South-South states that would benefit from efficient service delivery at the port . <p> This effort , stakeholders insist , is coming at a period of renewed global interest in trade and investment in the Nigeria maritime sector . <p> The product of the investment , according to industry watchers , would certainly address the quest by ship owners to have more dedicated ports that will play host to larger and deep draught vessels , which is now the trend in international shipping business . <p> Rather than contract the project , as was the case in the past , the Nigerian Ports Authority ( NPA ) decided to outsource it to its joint venture company so as to ensure timely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . The agency said outsourcing such project was informed by the success recorded with Lagos and Bonny Channel Managements . <p> " It is expected that the dredging of the water channel will increase the volume of vessel traffic and cargo throughput in the port , decongest Lagos ports and reduce cost of doing business for Calabar-based businessmen who spend additional transport cost to take delivery of their consignments in Lagos and Onne ports , " said President Goodluck Jonathan during the official flag-off of CCM operations in Calabar . <p> He said deepening of the long-abandoned Calabar channel would not only help in reviving the port , which was developed in the 1970s to service the South-South , South-East and North-Eastern states , but help in opening the state for more businesses to thrive . <p> Conducting journalists on a facility tour of the project in Calabar recently , the Managing Director of CCM , Mr. Bart Van Eenoo , said that several milestones had been achieved since it began operations . He said CCM was concentrating on spots in the channel critical to navigation and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometres high spots had been dredged . <p> He said that with the deepening of the channel to 6.5 metres datum , vessels between 7.5 and 7.8 metres could now conveniently sail into the Port , a feat that had never been achieved in the last 20 years in the channel . <p> The chief executive stated that the target of CCM is to ensure that " even at low tide , the port will not go down below 5.5 metres " and that dredging and buoyage maintenance would be intensified in 2015 . <p> Eenoo explained that the difference between Calabar Port and Lagos Port is that while the former is a river which must be deepened , Lagos is an ocean which is naturally deep . He added that the low areas at the Calabar Port are KP 74 and KP 75 , which means that attention would be focused on attaining the current 6.3 kilometres depth and the envisaged 10 metres datum . <p> On the advantages of the port , he said apart from decongesting the Lagos and Port Harcourt ports , economic activities would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port would not go back empty but have cargo to transport back to their destinations . <p> He said the dredging covers over 80 kilometres and that CCM would manage the port for an initial period of 15 years as per the contract . <p> Eenoo allayed fears that dredging endangers aquatic life . He explained : " What dredging does is to temporarily dislocate aquatic life but it does not in any way endanger it . " He also said the dredged sand would be taken away to about 15-20 kilometres and dumped into NPA 's approved dumpsites . <p> The Project Manager of Westminster Dredging and Marine Limited , Engr . Okwara Arua Udensi , informed the journalists that with what was currently achieved , vessels of 7.8 metres could now sail into the port unhindered .

" <p> During the tour , the journalists were taken aboard the vessels dredging the channel where the workers said they operate on a 24- hour basis and run shifts . <p> It is believed that with the milestone achieved so far , many investors , including Calabar Free Trade Zone , ECM Terminals , Tinapa , agric , cement and pipeline construction companies will now make use of the channel for the growth of their businesses . <p> However , despite the landmark achievements by CCM in the dredging as alluded to by all the stakeholders , including the NPA , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPA since inception of the project .

" <p> He appealed to President Goodluck Jonathan to intervene in the matter and direct the NPA to pay CCM immediately , noting that the people of Cross River State and other neighbouring states who would benefit tremendously from the Calabar Port , would not want the dredging to be abandoned again . <p> Umoh said the non-release of funds for the project might be a deliberate attempt by the NPA management to eclipse a landmark achievement of the Jonathan 's administration for some selfish and political reasons . <p> Earlier , the contracts for the management of the four channels in Nigeria namely Lagos , Bonny , Calabar and Warri were advertised .

I told them that we are in a secular world and I would n't interfere with anybody 's religion , but focus on my job and nobody should interfere in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw anything at ? tractive in my religion , they could join me and if I saw anything attractive in theirs , I could also join them . <p> I said so because I was confident that there was nothing special in their religion that could attract me . Instead , my own religion would attract them , based on its decency and truth . Some of my chiefs were ardent idol worshippers . But I thank God that most of them repented because of the confidence they repose in me as an ardent Christian and the fact that I have been able to live a successful Christian life . <p> I was a choirmaster in the Methodist Church . I joined the choir in 1964 and became choirmaster in 1978 . Since then , I was in the choir until I became the vice chairman of Boripe Local Government Area when my wife , the Olori , took over from me . Leader ? ship at the traditional level is not by power nor might . It is the grace of God . It is that grace that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on the throne . <p> Historical background <p> Aagba is in Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State , with the headquarters in Iragbiji . It is an ancient town . It was founded by migrants from Oyo Alaafin . The first Oba was Ajunwan . Although there is no formal record , our forefathers told us that he was the first migrant that came from Oyo Alaafin due to the problem of Abiku ( frequent loss of children ) . That was during the reign of Oba Abiodun Alaafin of Oyo . Also , there were a lot of Fulani wars in Oyo in those days . So , some people had to migrate from Oyo Alaafin to save their lives . That was over 400 years ago . <p> Before the migration , Ajuwan had to contact the oracle on where to go . The oracle divined that he should move out of Alaafin Oyo and keep on going and that if he got to a place where there were a lot of aagba ropes spread on the ground in the forest , he should stop there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is what palm wine tappers com ? monly use . <p> The oracle also told Ajuwan that an Ag ? bigbo bird would make a sound at the place , adding that if he got to that place , he should settle there . So , when he got there and saw the aagba ropes and also heard the voice of Agbig ? bo bird , he decided to settle there . But before then , some people had settled in a place called Ahoro ( empty place ) . They were migrants from Ife in Old Oyo State . During their hunt ? ing expedition , they met the migrants from Alaafin Oyo in the forest and they interacted . They agreed to come together to form a formi ? dable community known today as Aagba . <p> In other words , there are three different settlers that make up Aagba . They include the people from Alaafin Oyo , the people that earlier settled in Ahoro and another group that later came from Ife . These three ancient groups also formed the three-fold dynasty and agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food <p> Our basic food is pap ( eko ) . We eat it with efo ( vegetable soup ) . That does not mean that we do n't eat any other type of food . We also eat pounded yam , amala , eba , fufu , etc . <p> But our basic food is eko . The reason is that Aagba is noted for production of corn . In the evening time , you would see my people taking it to neighbouring towns such as Iragbiji , Iki ? run , Iresi for sale because no town around here can prepare it like the Aagba people . <p> For instance , if anybody wants to buy it , he would first of all confirm if the seller is from Aagba . If the seller says that she is from Iragbiji or any other town other than Aagba , he wo n't buy it . People prefer the original one from Aagba . But because of civilization , we entertain visitors with pounded yam , amala , eba especially at ceremonies . <p> Aagba is replete with immense topography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ val ? leys and forests . We have Osun River , differ ? ent from the popular Osun River in Osogbo , the state capital . We also have Iriwo River and Olongbo Stream . The Iriwo River has tributar ? ies , which , join the Osun River in Osogbo . Our basic source of drinking water is the Osun River . The water is as clean as spring water . Very , very pure . It is within Aagba . Other communities , especially Ada people , come to Aagba to fetch the water because it 's close to them . We do n't have water scarcity in Aagba . <p> The forests are so big and tick and have a lot of tourism attractions . For instance , the Gulder Ultimate Search took advantage in 2009 when it held one of its camping programmes in one of the forests popularly known as Omode Forest . <p> During the event , so many visitors were in Aagba . It was more of a carnival because foreign tourists from the US were also around . The Gulder Ultimate Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The visit really boosted the economic fortunes of not only Aagba but also the entire state . <p> Food sellers , transporters , petty traders , the hospitality industry among others benefitted a great deal from the visit , following huge patronage by the tourists and the Gulder Ulti ? mate Search people . <p> Also , the visit gave Aagba a global recogni ? tion because people who watched the pro ? gramme on the screen all over the world got to know about the topography of the town and its tourism splendour . Gulder Ultimate Search compensated the families that own the forest and everybody was happy . <p> The big forests also serve as game reserves . Till today , hunters from different communities go there to hunt . A lot of bush meat that you see around today is gotten from the forests . History also has it that during communal wars , the first settlers used to take advantage of the mountains and hills , with some people hiding in the cave . <p> Culture <p> Aagba is noted for its very rich culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foun ? dation of our culture . In greeting , the females kneel down to greet their parents and elders , while the males prostrate . In the olden days , we used to sit round to eat together from the same plate . Our dressing is agbada , aso oke and buba on top of dansiki , while the female wear buba and tie gele . <p> Politics <p> Aagba people are politically conscious . They are sensitive to the political develop ? ments in Nigeria as well as the state . In Aagba , we have three groups of people that play politics in the community 's affairs . In the Christendom , we have the Catholic and Methodist . We also have the Muslim Group . There is a lot of politicking within this circle . When it comes to sharing of positions , they play active politics to attain the position . Even in chieftaincy , they play politics . <p> At the state level , it is interesting to note that Aagba has had its fair share of political appointments . I am one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career as Assistant Local Government Chairman . Later , I was elected as a member of the state House of Assembly for four years . Later , I was ap ? pointed as a special adviser to former governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola until the throne became vacant . It was after I had ascended the throne that I resigned my appointment in 2009 . Among several others , we had Asiwaju of Aagba who was a member of Local Govern ? ment Commission in the state . He was also secretary of Osun Independent Electoral Com ? mission ( OIEC ) . <p> Unions and associations <p> We have Aagba Descendants Union , Os ? ogbo Branch , Federation of Aagba Clubs and Societies , Asiriabu Club and many more . All the clubs , unions and associations are pivotal to the socio-economic and political develop ? ments of the town because they are actively involved in developmental programmes . Some of them have sunk boreholes for the town , others instituted scholarship boards and give scholarship to our children to study not only in Nigeria but also abroad . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opment . We also have a women group called Charity Sisters . Their duty is to serve guests at community festivals and other important occasions . <p> Institutions <p> The state Polytechnic in Iree is on Aagba land because about 50 per cent of the land they are occupying belongs to Aagba . We have a branch of Osun State Polytechnic Micro Finance Bank in Aagba . We also have small-scale industries , palm kernel and oil process ? ing companies , gari processing companies among others . <p> Source of livelihood <p> Our major source of livelihood is farming . About 80 per cent of our people are farmers . Salary workers are few . Our major cash crops are cocoa , kola nut and palm oil . We also have cocoa stores where we preserve the produce until it 's ready for sale . We also produce plan ? tains in large quantities . People come from Ilorin to buy from us . Occasionally , we take our farm produce to Ikirun , Oja Alamisi , Oja Monday among others . Customers also come from neighbouring towns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocoa . There are merchants that buy on wholesale basis and take them to Lagos and the North to sell to retailers . <p> Roles of a monarch <p> It is the duty of the monarch to settle land disputes between families or other people in the town . But if the case is not reported and the monarch discovers that the dispute is threatening the peace of the town , he could send for the two feuding parties to come to the palace and settle the dispute to restore peace . The monarch also settles marriage issues . <p> Achievements <p> When I was in government , I helped not less than 48 people from my town to get state government jobs . In fact , about 75 per cent of the responsibility of the community is on my head . Little wonders , the late novelist , Chinua Achebe said : <p> " Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown . " There was an age-long land dispute between Ororuwo and Aagba communities in 2003 . But I was able to resolve it peacefully in 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace was restored between the two par ? ties . <p> Challenges <p> One of the challenges facing us now is lack of cooperation by some people to the extent that some of them went to the High Court to remove me , but I won the case . But they ap ? pealed . On the same day that I was celebrating my fifth year on the throne , the Appeal Court ruled in my favour . <p> But we are getting over it gradually . Such opposition is a common thing in Yoruba land . When I was the chairman of Aagba Development Council , I ensured provision of infrastructure such as roads , primary health care and electricity . <p> Now , I am drawing government 's attention to complete the road from Ikirun and Iragbiji to the town , especially because we need good access roads to transport our farm produce to other towns and states . 
@@1910235 <h> Transparency International 's verdict on corruption in Nigeria <p> I was surprised , very sur ? prised indeed , when I read some analyses of the Trans ? parency International 's re ? cent verdict on corruption in Nigeria . I have met many peo ? ple who were as surprised as myself , indeed , deeply shocked , by the TI 's comparative data on Nigeria . <p> The surprise and shock stem from a deep realization , once again , of the big difference between per ? ception and reality in public affairs -- and the immense power of the media in shaping both . <p> According to Transparency In ? ternational 's data from 1979 till date , the tenures of both General Muhammadu Buhari and former President Olusegun Obasanjo were more corrupt than the tenure of President Goodluck Jonathan . The details are trending online . <p> The data also showed that un ? der the administration of President Jonathan , Nigeria has recorded its best score in the Corruption Per ? ception Index ( CPI ) since 1979 . This is in complete contrast to the sordid picture of rampant corrup ? tion being painted by the opposi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the media in the last few years -- espe ? cially in the build up to the general elections . <p> One is certainly not saying that the dragon of corruption has been slain in Nigeria . No , far from it . There is still so much to do in Ni ? geria in the war against corruption . Indeed , no country in history has yet been able to wipe out corrup ? tion completely . Corruption , like terrorism , is a global menace . <p> As Transparency International , the global anti-corruption or ? ganisation , is quick to point out , " Corruption is a problem for all countries ... Not one single coun ? try gets a perfect score and more than two-thirds score below 50 , on a scale from 0 ( highly corrupt ) to 100 ( very clean ) . A poor score is likely a sign of widespread bribery , lack of punishment for corruption and public institutions that do n't respond to citizens ' needs " . <p> But the point that the figures from Transparency International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , Nigeria is actually much less corrupt today , and per ? ceived globally to be much less corrupt today , than it has been in the last 35 years -- including under the regimes of General Buhari and President Obasanjo , both of who wear the toga and chant the man ? tra of anti-corruption . Shockingly , according to the TI data , President Obasanjo 's first tenure had the worst scale of corruption during the 35 years period between 1979 and 2015 . <p> The TI Corruption Perception Index is a rating of countries from 1 to 100 showing their corruption scale . A rating of 1 is the worst and rating of 100 means a country is completely free of corruption . The pass mark is 50 and any country scoring below 50 is considered a corrupt country . <p> In the year 2000 , Nigeria was ranked the most corrupt country in the world -- and improved mar ? ginally in 2001 and 2003 when it was rated the second most corrupt nation in the world in the TI 's Cor ? ruption Perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Jonathan . <p> Since 2012 , Nigeria has made steady improvements in the CPI . Indeed , under President Jonathan , for the first time in decades , Nige ? ria is not in the list of 1-10 most corrupt countries in the world . <p> In the 2014 Transparency In ? ternational 's Corruption Percep ? tion Index , issued in December , Nigeria was ranked 136 out of 175 countries surveyed in the re ? port . This ranking placed Nigeria , alongside five other countries , as the 39th most corrupt country in the world . This is Nigeria 's best ranking in the last four years . <p> With this ranking , Nigeria leap ? frogged eight countries within a space of one year -- from the 31st most corrupt nation in 2013 to the 39th in 2014 . This may be regard ? ed by cynics as a small achieve ? ment : but it represents a big step in the right direction . <p> Indeed , the administration of President Jonathan deserves some commendation for the positive steps it has taken , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war against corruption -- rather than the vengeful knocks it is re ? ceiving from various quarters . <p> This apparent demonization of a particular government in power , while sweeping under the carpet every positive attribute of it , does a great disservice not only to the government in question but also to Nigeria as a nation and to Nigeri ? ans as a people . Such conspirato ? rial cynicism maligns and under ? mines not only the government in power but the nation itself . <p> As a respected eminent Nigerian observed , " the only way to hold a meaningful debate on any issue is to provide data and evidence . The TI data is respected globally . So , no one can attempt to tell us not to mind them . Some people only accept a data or evidence when it favours them or supports their po ? sition ; but when it does not , they discredit the source " . <p> In practical terms , the adminis ? tration of President Jonathan has taken various measures to combat corruption , especially by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used successfully in the developed economies . Part of Transparency International 's work is to develop and promote practical tools that reduce the opportunities for cor ? ruption and enhance the ability of people and organisations to resist corruption . <p> With the international calibre and personal integrity of some of those managing the Nigerian economy , led by Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , it is not surprising that the Federal Government has been using some of the practical tools of interna ? tional best practices , designed and promoted by Transparency Interna ? tional and other global agencies , to curb public sector corruption . <p> These tools include a rigorous monitoring of public procurement processes , concrete guidance for companies on avoiding extortion and curtailing bribery , reliable di ? agnostics for measuring and map ? ping corruption , as well as the en ? dorsement of integrity pacts to shun financial improprieties in public contracting . The Bureau of Public Procurements ( BPP ) has already saved hundreds of billions of Naira for the nation by a rigorous applica ? tion of the rules of monitoring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ria 's anti corruption agencies have reportedly had unprecedented non-interference from the executive which has led to recent successes in the trial of subsidy scammers , pensions fund racketeers and vari ? ous politicians accused of money laundering and the embezzlement of public funds . <p> Another of the positive steps taken by the present administration in the war against corruption was the endorsement of the long await ? ed Freedom of Information Act by President Jonathan . A rigorous ap ? plication of the Freedom of Infor ? mation Act would go a long way in holding public offices accountable -- by keeping them on the straight and narrow path of financial pro ? bity and moral rectitude through the fear of exposure and sanctions . <p> Surprisingly , up till today , sever ? al years after its enactment , many state governments , including some of those whose chief executives are in the vanguard of the anti-corruption crusade , have report ? edly refused to domesticate the Freedom of Information Act . Talk about hunting with the hounds -- and running with the hare . <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name specific cases of corruption attributed to him -- rather than hide under nebulous generalisations of corruption in the country , in spite of the remarkable progress made so far in the war against graft . <p> nOnyemaobi , a journalist and international development com ? munications specialist , writes from Abuja.

Yet in Chibok , North Eastern Nigeria is our eerie reminder : the scarred debris of Chibok Secondary School where the dreams of great womanhood lay burnt and littered from the fiery-furnace-touch of a meaningless extremism . <p> More than 330 days after their abduction , the Chibok Girls are not home and who knows if we will ever get to celebrate them as grown , great women . And , what was their fault ? They wanted , against all odds , to become women the world would reckon with , women the world would celebrate . On the way to the path of greatness was the rustic four-walled learning centre called the Chibok Secondary School in the sleepy , forgotten Chibok Town where they would acquire life-enhancing and greatness-inducing formal education . Their dreams became their albatross . <p> Eleven months after the mindless abduction of more than 200 Chikok school girls , most Nigerians seem to have moved on . After all , shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many have unashamedly and callously called it a ruse . Amazons like Dr. Oby Ezekwesili who have continued to scream for their return have been vilified and out rightly demonized . When recently the abduction clocked 300 days , it took the 17 year-old Malala to awaken the conscience of the world ( after having awakened our president as to the need to see her parents earlier ) . I have read many say we should move on , after all , the world has moved on since the mysterious disappearance of victims of MH370 , the Malaysian airliner which dived to the bottom of theINdian Ocean and is yet to be seen . <p> But how could the world forget ? Or , more pointedly , how would History forgive ? Forgive for the security that was not provided as constitutionally provided ? Forgive the security officials who allegedly put hurdles on the way of their rescue for their own selfish gains ? Forgive the mules in the Army who fed information and arms to our enemies ? Forgive , again , the President who , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other things ) , rebuffed an offer by former President Olusegun Obasanjo who reportedly was to have facilitated the release of about 100 of the girls in order to avoid appearing as not ' being in charge ' ? How could History forgive this gross injustice against the daughters of peasants who would , who knows , have brought glory to the fatherland , if their dreams were left untampered by the mad extremists , rag-tag extinguishers of destinies ? <p> And so we see , recently , the government trying to bribe History in advance . They sent Finance Minister Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iwuala to Chibok to lay the foundation for the rebuilding of the damaged school and to meet with parents of the kidnapped girls . Methinks that was nothing but a political exigency at the eve of election which I think means nothing , inspires nothing and leads to nothing other than the need to #BringBackJonathan . No , it has nothing to do with the globally echoed #BringBackOurGirls , and the elders of Chibok have rightly spoken : bring back our girls and not the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Jonathan never bothered to mention them in his New Year broadcast , went to Maiduguri but did not bother with mentioning them among other mind-bugling indifference on their matter ?

@@1914233 <h> The reduction of electricity tariff <p> In a rare display of responsiveness to complaints by industrial electricity users over the astronomical hike in tariff , the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ( NERC ) recently announced a 50 percent reduction in the tariff regime across board . This is a good demonstration of the Commission 's consumer protection responsibility . It is our hope that the reduction is not politically-motivated and will be sustained for as long as it is possible . We had , in a March 16 editorial , called for an immediate downward review of the new tariff which came into effect on January 1 . The high tariff was the outcome of the special review under the Multi- Year Order ( MYTO 2.1 ) . The hike had dampened the euphoria that greeted the unbundling of the inefficient behemoth , Power Holding Company of Nigeria ( PHCN ) , which was privatised in November 2013 . It is heartwarming that the government , through NERC which is the regulatory agency for the power sector , responded promptly and positively to complaints by electricity consumers . Under the tariff regime that has now been slashed , manufacturers saw their bills under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to N250,0000 , in some instances . This was simply outrageous because power supply had not improved significantly nationwide since the privatization of the sector in 2013 . However , in announcing the 50 percent cut , Chairman of NERC , Dr. Sam Amadi , acknowledged that the development followed a flurry of petitions from consumers , in particular , industrialists under the aegis of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria ( MAN ) . The association had , in its petition , warned of the far-reaching consequences of high electricity tariff such as massive job losses and the possible collapse of businesses . It is good that NERC has said it consulted widely , including with the Bureau for Public Enterprises , before it reduced the tariff . The new order will , in effect , amend the existing MYTO 2.1 , thereby reducing the tariff to be paid by all categories of consumers . Before the slash , the fixed charges for most residential consumers was between N650 and N750 while energy charge was an average of about N4 for every kilowatt hour ( kwh ) . With the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tariff paid by customers when computed by electricity Distribution Companies ( Discos ) will be reduced by half . It is heartening that Nigeria is gradually following the footsteps of countries which take the complaints and concerns of consumers seriously . It is good that NERC has now stopped the transfer of collection losses from those who do not pay their bills to those who do , which led to the astronomical increase in tariff in the first place . It is inappropriate to transfer the collection losses that ought to be controlled by discos to consumers . We agree with the regulatory commission that it is the responsibility of the discos to collect their revenue from all their customers . Their failure to do so should not lead to higher tariff for certain categories of consumers . To reassure Nigerians that the 50 percent slash has no political motive , the government should amend the Electric Power Sector Reforms Act , 2015 , which obligates the NERC to ensure that every " efficient " operator recovers " prudent costs " of producing and supplying electricity . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tariff reduction , claiming , among other things , that it would lead to the tightening of their revenue sources , having anticipated recouping their Aggregate Technical , Commercial and Collection losses from consumers based on the MYTO 2.1 . We also hope that the discos will not devise other means of issuing higher bills than approved by NERC . The discos should be made to understand the far-reaching consequences of high tariffs on economic development , since electricity is an irreducible factor for economic and social change . In recent weeks , small and medium-scale industry owners have organised protests in the three commercial centres of Aba , Nnewi and Onitsha in the South-East , against the tariff hike . By slashing the rates , the government has shown that it is sensitive to public opinion . This should be sustained . If the government had not reviewed the rates , many firms could be forced to close shop , especially the big time consumers of electricity such as the cement , paint and steel industries that are currently expanding their investments under the much-desired backward integration scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsist for at least the next two years . We also do not see any reason for the increase in the fixed charge otherwise known as estimated billing as against actual consumption . All in all , government should be reminded that the challenge of power supply is one big national problem that must be solved by addressing the key drivers of costs in the power sector . These are inflation and foreign exchange rates , as well as the cost and availability of gas in sufficient quantities . We enjoin NERC to do all it can to manage its costs to ensure affordable tariff and reduce the financial burden on its customers .

He insisted that there should be no disparity in government funding of both public and private universities .

During the recent event , where 153 students were formally admitted into various faculties , the Vice Chancellor , Prof. Chima Boniface Iwuchukwu noted that the university had not for once gone on strike since its inception .

Nseobong Okon-Ekong reports <p> Things are not always what they seem . Yomi Olaniwun , Head , Diageo-Guinness account at one of Nigeria 's leading advertising companies , SO&amp;U understands the truth of this statement . <p> As a relationship manager , his job involves getting what his client wants done at the right time . Feeling the pain of his client comes with the job . And he can only be happy when the client is satisfied . This was an understanding that was clearly spelt out when he was hired . Client service at SO&amp;U is about making the client happy . <p> In his work place , client service is a continuous relationship ; one that can make the client vouch for you even when you are not there . This consciousness is driven by the fact that a client will always refer to the agency that managed their brand very well . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO&amp;U success story since it began 25 years when three friends with very little income came together . <p> His two-year service at SO&amp;U has been the most rewarding season since he ventured into advertising . He was worked with several big brands and handled big projects ; some with budget of between N150m and N200m . Being assigned these kind of demanding tasks says a lot about his capability , particularly when he is also given the liberty to choose his team . <p> Before it became his lot to take on the Guinness brand , he had the privilege of working on several brands in his previous engagement at other advertising agencies . It has been a sweet journey so far for Yomi who started his advertising career in the traffic department - a section that studies , monitors and designates the inflow of jobs . He later moved to research and planning department . The cumulative experience has given him a strong foundation in advertising . <p> Incidentally , his course of study at the University of Ibadan was not anywhere near the social sciences . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering , it was not for lack of work that made him veer into advertising ; rather his marketing communication skill was something he knew he always had and could fall back on . <p> He began to take more than a passing interest when he succeeded where others failed . " From my first year in the university , I noticed that I had the ability to convince people to come for events from different departments . I also had the ability of turning something everyone would consider dysfunctional into a commercial asset . Since I started seeing those results , I thought there is a side of me that is interested in marketing . I began to research into marketing . I was curious about advertising . Every time I looked for a job , I would ask if I could be a part of the marketing unit . " <p> Added to his marketing skill , Yomi has a flair for writing , as well . He is quick to spot a bad copy or headline that could have been presented better . But he has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to do , he buried himself in tonnes of books and materials that told the success stories of giants like Ogilvy and the rest in advertising . <p> But Yomi is happy that he has a background in advertising and it has served him well . He has been able to find a nexus between the two professions . " Engineering is about designing and that requires thinking . I think very deeply before I talk when I am with clients . I end up becoming friends with clients . Most of the time , my clients are also my friends . For some people , when a job comes , it can stay for two to three days on the system but I ca n't do that . I just work and sometimes my colleagues complain that we are rushing too much but my aim is to keep my client happy by doing the job on time . " <p> Lately , Yomi has agonised over the future of client service in the advertising milieu . While he is willing to impart knowledge , he knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s . <p> For this reason , he thinks " client service should be a course in higher institutions . A lot of people in the business do not know what to do . When you are managing human beings , there are emotions that are attached to it . Account management is a lot more professional , we need to compare and analyse people . The way you treat A does not necessarily mean that it is the same way you will treat B. Account management takes a lot of discretion , affinity and discipline to make sure that the client is happy . " <p> In a job where he is constantly put on a task , the demand to go the extra mile is a frequent request . For instance , it is his lot to get approval from APCON and NAFDAC . Within his organisation , it requires an ability to communicate quickly and effectively so that materials can fly . <p> He explained how this works . " Time is also a factor . When you work on a material and you need to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send it there before 4:00pm when most transactions close . You may not bother about APCON . Your chief concern is to create something magical for the client . However , if is not done in time for APCON 's approval , then it is a waste of time . " This is where the ability to relate with colleagues in other departments and external publics of the agency come in . " We relate with the media too . We have to communicate what the client likes to the other departments . Client service is right there in the middle . The only time you do n't need NAFDAC is when you are doing public service announcement . You need to be able to multitask . At no time do you work alone . " <p> Yomi agrees that the client service executive in an advertising agency is not often celebrated . Most times the copy writer gets all the accolades , along with the design team . He understands why the critical acclaim goes to these two professionals in the advertising chain . " Headlines are very catchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline ? Sometimes , it is the design that arouses people 's interest . " However , long before it gets to the point where the services of the copy writer and the designer are demanded , the client service personnel has the task of convincing the client . His service is as important as this : " If your client-service person is not a persuasive person , the client will not give you regard . " <p> It is not always a case of the paymaster dictating the tune . Rather , Yomi paints a picture of mutual reward and mutual respect . " You may have an idea in your head and sometimes your idea may not be right . If you share it with your client service person you can make your decision . If the idea that the client brings is very bad , you will be a very bad client service person if you do n't point it out to your client when and where he is wrong . It is your job to say even though this sounds beautiful but if it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have failed as a client service person . Clients are normal persons like you and I ; the agencies are the experts . And there is nothing wrong with client service agreeing with a client .

Both comments and pings are currently closed . <p> Come June 4 , Nigerians will witness the inauguration of the 8th National Assembly which will pilot the country 's legislative affairs for the next 4 years after the expiration of the current 7th National Assembly . <p> Observers are quick to note that the 8th National Assembly will be dominated by All Progressive Congress ( APC ) members ; as opposed to the 7th National Assembly , which is under the control of Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) . <p> As the new National Assembly starts work on June 4 , concerned citizens have been expressing some reservations about some leadership tussles that could crop up in the bicameral legislature . <p> Such fears are quite logical because of the high expectations of Nigerians regarding the incoming government of retired Maj.-Gen . Muhammadu Buhari , which is expected to work in concert with the legislature in all nation-building processes . <p> Observers note that the envisaged leadership tussles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make its members to lock horns on who get what in the incoming National Assembly . <p> The APC is naturally expected to produce the leaders of the National Assembly due to the numerical strength of its members in the legislature , as stated by the House Rules , but the party appears to be in a dilemma as to where to zone each of the leadership positions . <p> The posts that are to be occupied in the National Assembly include the Senate President , Deputy Senate President , Senate Leader , Deputy Senate leader , Chief Whip and the Deputy Chief whip . <p> On the other hand , elections in the House of Representatives have to be made to fill the offices of the Speaker , Deputy Speaker , House Leader , Deputy House leader , Chief Whip and Deputy Chief Whip . <p> Observers note that the composition of the principal offices in the upper and lower chambers of the legislature , in compliance with the zoning formula , has been a thorny issue facing the APC . <p> However , the Publicity Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting that there was not iota of truth in the hearsay that the party was having problems with how to allocate positions and offices via the zoning formula . <p> He stressed that all issues of public interest would be handled in a transparent way and conveyed to Nigerians via the usual communication channels . <p> Nevertheless , the existing tradition requires that six principal offices in the Senate and House of Representatives should be filled on the basis of a zoning principle that accommodates all six geo-political zones of the country . <p> Analysts note that since President-elect Buhari and his deputy , Prof Yemi Osinbajo , are from the North-West and South-West geo-political zones respectively , the remaining four zones will be considered when other political posts are to be filled . <p> In a nutshell , the North-East , North-Central , South-East and South-South geo-political zones are expected to receive primary consideration in the nascent power-sharing procedures . <p> A political analyst , Mr Samuel Akanbi , said that ordinarily , the South-East zone ought to produce the next Senate President but because of the overwhelming support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zone might have lost out . <p> He said that the situation could be quite problematic for the APC , while striving to abide by the tradition , because the South-East and South-South zones are not represented in its membership of the 8th Senate . <p> The National Chairman of the APC , Chief John Oyegun , while reacting to the emerging situation in the National Assembly , described the dilemma facing the party , in terms of ensuring equal representation of all geo-political zones in the legislature 's leadership , as sad . <p> He conceded that the near absence of APC members from the South-East and South-South zones in the 8th National Assembly was not too good for the party . <p> Oyegun said that even Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo , who shared similar sentiments , had also expressed the same fears . <p> " But we thank God we won and the same God will teach us how to go about it at both chambers in our efforts to carry along the two zones , particularly the South-East which has no single APC senator-elect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Akanbi said that even though potential contenders to the offices were already showing interest , while lobbying other incoming members of the National Assembly , the APC should , nonetheless , strive to be fair . <p> Some of the contenders to the Office of the Senate President include Sen. Bukola Saraki ( Kwara , North-Central ) , Sen. George Akume ( Benue , North-Central ) and Sen. Ahmed Lawan ( Yobe , North-East ) . <p> On the other hand , contenders to the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives include Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila ( Lagos , South-West ) and Rep. Yakubu Dogara ( Borno , North East ) , among others . <p> Nevertheless , an APC chieftain and Coordinator of Muhammadu Buhari Legacy Foundation in North-Central zone , Mr Bode Towoju , said that his party would abide by the zoning principle while considering persons for offices . <p> He stressed that since both chambers of the National Assembly had the tradition of electing experienced members as their leaders , the APC would strictly adhere to the existing practice . <p> He underscored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would aid efforts to stabilise the polity , as no geo-political zone of the country would be alienated from governance . <p> An APC senator-elect from Kaduna Central Senatorial District , Mr Sheu Sanni , however , kicked against the notion that experience should always be the primary factor while considering lawmakers for leadership positions in the National Assembly . <p> " If I have my way , all ' experienced ' legislators should not hold any leadership position in the 8th National Assembly because they are part of the rot in the country , ' ' he said . <p> A political analyst , Mr Zailani Bappa , said that although the factor of experience could not be jettisoned while considering lawmakers for posts , tangible efforts should , nonetheless , be made to choose candidates with integrity , irrespective of their experience . <p> He , however , said that the positive inclination of the legislators to make laws that would facilitate national development would play out and set the country on " the path of truth ' ' . <p> The Director-General/Chief Convener of Forum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , warned that the APC must not toy with the idea of jettisoning the zoning formula <p> He emphasised that the geographical design Nigeria was embedded in zoning , adding that all that the APC needed to do was look for a man of integrity from a particular zone that was expected to occupy a specific post in the National Assembly . <p> " The APC should look for a man or woman of integrity to pilot the affairs of the National Assembly ; no zone has a monopoly of integrity , the party should apply the zoning principle when selecting the Assembly 's leaders , ' ' he said . <p> He , however , underscored the need for the presentation of a credible candidate , who would be acceptable to all party members , by the particular geo-political zone where a position was ceded to . <p> Thomas said that a situation where one geopolitical zone was allowed to amass immense political power , to the detriment of others , would not augur well with efforts to promote the country 's unity and stability . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of equity and fairness in all the country 's governance processes . <p> He , however , said that from his personal observation and judgment , all those jostling for leadership positions in the National Assembly were men of integrity , adding that certain allegations being levelled against them still remained in the realm of speculation . <p> All in all , analysts underscore the need to sustain the zoning principle while selecting leaders for the 8th National Assembly , saying that it will aid the fulfilment of Nigeria 's democracy .

The controversial actress who took time off to have a baby is back and smoking hot ! In this chat with Entertainer , the thespian opens up on motherhood , career and her break up with her lover . Excerpts : <p> What have you been up to lately ? Hmmm ... same old things . I have been working , schooling and of course , settling into motherhood . I am also trying to finish my degree programme because I dropped out of school ; I am currently studying Banking &amp; Finance . So how did you start the journey into the movie industry ? I would say it was since I was born . Acting is a talent I discovered as a little girl . I realized I had that talent when I was in nursery school . Even when I got to secondary school I still loved acting and I started organizing stuffs myself . I started directing plays and dramas and I was writing scripts also . I am very passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have faced a lot of challenges ranging from misunderstanding , impersonation , intimidation and harassment . It is not easy to be great . There are certain things that great people have to deal with or go through before they get to where they want to be . I do n't think it is a new or a unique experience because I think many other people who are great or successful today faced challenges at some point . They have their own stories to tell and if you listen to them , you will realize it is similar to what you are going through . How do you cope with pressure from the male folk ? I am not under any pressure from the male folk . I am a woman and a beautiful one at that . A man must appreciate me . I do n't think that is pressure . I think it is something natural that I have to deal with . Even you as a woman go through that . You do n't need to be a star to experience pressure from the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and want to harass me so it is normal . What inspires or motivates you ? A lot of things do . Human beings motivate me and I am a very passionate person . When I work , I like to take my time to go into the life of the character I am interpreting . I am me and that means I am critically different from the roles I try to interpret . Motivation for me comes from the experiences of these characters I interpret . I do not judge people and I am a receptive person ; I welcome everybody no matter what because I believe that I am not in your shoes so I do n't know what it takes to be you . So , if I judge you I am selfish and wicked . Even if I see a person condemned by everybody , I will still relate with that person . Maybe , that is why I have made certain mistakes in my life . I am too open so people come in and want to take advantage and destroy me but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't . I rarely regret anything that happens to me because I believe it makes me stronger . I believe so much in strength and as a woman , I want to be one of the most powerful women to contend with some day . Every experience that I go through is building me up for the things ahead of me so I do not regret anything . Are you an emotional person ? Yes , I am very emotional and passionate . Is that why you find it easy to cry in movies ? That is acting though . I can achieve that because I am able to go into the lives of the roles I am playing . Who are your role models ? I admire strength in women . Some people will say this or that person is my role model because of the way she or he dresses , or because she is beautiful or whatever but as for me , I admire strength in women . A hawker on the street can be a role model to me . I see strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that an icon somewhere is my role model . I have many role models . I can even learn from a little child . We have not been seeing you in movies of recent , is anything the matter ? No , there is no problem . I am back to work now after having my baby . I took a break because I was outside the country for a long time . Then I went out and came back again but now I am back to work so very soon , you are going to see my movies again . How true is the rumour about breaking up with the father of your baby due to ill health on his part ? Well , we have broken up but when I saw it in the news it made me laugh a lot because it shows how fake and wicked people can be . That I have not come out to say anything about my relationship and my baby daddy or whatever does not make the story which is one sided true . It is a one angled story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and I am not saying anything about it because I have a child ; there is a child between me and this guy . I am not going to tarnish somebody 's image because we are not together anymore . I have a child , Chinagorom , for him so if I do anything stupid , I will be hurting my baby as well . Before I do anything I think about my child because she means the world to me . I would n't want to regret anything tomorrow . I told you , I do n't regret anything because I think through before I say anything . It is not true that I left him because he was sick . I am not that kind of a woman . Anybody who knows me would know that I can not and I will never leave a dying man . In fact , that is the time that I will be by his side . It is just a rumour like you said . Is there another man in your life now ? Well , not for now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new right now . If someone comes by would you be willing to move on ? If someone comes at that right moment when my mind is receptive towards that person , then yes . I am not in a hurry . I am just good being me for now . I am taking my time being single . Could you marry someone in the industry ? There are no barricades whatsoever . Nothing can hold me back from marrying someone in the industry because actors are also human beings . We should understand that it is just their career and business . I can marry an actor , an entertainer , a musician or anybody ; career has nothing to do with who rules my heart . Do you still have feelings for your ex-husband ? ( Laughter ) He was not my husband so he is not my ex-husband ; he is just my ex . Every positive feeling I had for my ex has been transferred to my daughter and the negative feelings that I had for him have been trashed so I am good . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No ! How is life with you now that you are a mother ? Well , life has been good and I am happy . My child makes me happy ; she makes me laugh every day . That emptiness inside of me she has filled up . I am very happy . Motherhood is very interesting and demanding but I am coping just fine . So how do you juggle between your career as an actress , and your primary role as a mother ? Like I said it is not easy . Especially now that my daughter is still very little but very soon she will be a grown woman and I will be free again . It is a sacrifice I have to make . What advice do you have for up-and-coming actors and actresses ? Just keep your head up , know who you are and what you want to achieve and work towards it and the sky will be just a starting point for you . Dream big and if you fail , try again . Do not dream small but big and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

His impact has been clear , it has been prominent and it has been amazing . <p> While the injuries still happen , as they will continue to seeing as how injuries are tricky little buggers , the process after the injury has been absolutely revolutionized by Forsythe .

Arsenal had made a mistake , he 'd never adjust , he was weak . Then , against Chelsea , he got hurt .

He 's played 20 matches since returning and his average is up an entire half a point . Not only that , but in the five games directly following his injury , Ozil put up three goals and two assists . <p> Not let 's look at Olivier Giroud . Giroud broke his foot bizarrely against Everton very early in the year . He had two goals in those four games and continued his regular scoring mark of a goal every other game or so .

Since returning from injury , Jack Wilshere looks absolutely renewed . <p> It 's impossible to deny Shad Forsythe 's contributions .

In this interview , he tells CHIZOBA IKENWA how he was able to achieve the feat . Excerpts : <p> How does it feel being a first class graduate from the Univer ? sity of Lagos ? <p> I feel great . Though , one is tempted by so ? ciety to feel proud of this achievement , but there is more to achieve in life than bragging about it because there were others who had it before me . <p> Can you tell us how you were able to achieve this feat ? <p> Well , I came in through a diploma foun ? dation programme . In my second year , both first and second semesters , I had straight As . Just after my second year , I was on a CGPA of 5.0 . I guess that was how it started and somehow , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third year , I had my first series of Bs while in my fourth and fifth years , I had straight As again which I believe fetched me the first class . So , overall , it 's been tough and challenging but tougher maintaining the first class than even attaining it . My first year was quite easy because I had a strong academic foundation from my secondary school . It was just like revising those things I knew . It was the fourth and final year at the university that I experienced my challenge . I was trying to balance my innate desire to read and excel and then balancing it with the expectation that people set for me or expect me to achieve . <p> You said you had a strong ed ? ucatuional background . How was your secondary school ed ? ucation like ? <p> Well , I finished from the University of La ? gos secondary school . I finished as the best graduating student . I had 8 As in WASCE . I was not that vibrant in JSS 1 to 3 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented my school in many competitions . I participated in Cow ? bell mathematics , MAN mathematics compe ? titions . I also won the NNPC national science quiz competition which had its final in Abuja . I went through the various levels from state to national level . I was given a tertiary schol ? arship which I enjoyed here at Unilag . I also won the Jet competition where I represented Lagos state , the final was held in Yobe State . I participated in quite a number of competi ? tions . I won a silver medal in physics Olym ? piad NNPC competition which was held in Abeokuta and so on . <p> Will you say you 're just a ge ? nius or you achieved all these as a result of hard work ? <p> I would say it 's a combination of two things : God 's favour and a very strong paren ? tal upbringing . As a child , I was introduced to reading novels . My father , though late now was someone who placed so much premium on education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for a shoe or shirt , he negotiates with you but when it comes to buying of textbooks or anything academics , he does not negotiate or thinks about it . So coming from such background made me give academics a top priority in my life plus God 's favour . I think these are the two things that worked for me . <p> How did you cope with the distractions in the University ? <p> Funny enough , I feel more comfortable around my female friends , and so as regards that , it was not much a distraction but an advantage to me . I am not exactly an excep ? tional social person and I am not an introvert either . Yes , there were many distractions but I was able to cope with them . I believe every student has to be focused , it 's not all about books as one is expected to get some level of social interaction . You must be able to strike that balance at every point in time . Using my ? self as an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of my social life . I did not go for parties so I was more of a fellowship guy . Right from my second year , I was a worker in the Redeemed Christian fellowship and I became an execu ? tive in that same fellowship . Most of my so ? cial engagements were with more of family and friends within the fellowship . <p> What course did you find challenging in your years of study ? <p> Well , in Chemical Engineering , almost every course is challenging . In fact , there is no course that is not challenging as every course has its own peculiarities . It 's not all about the course as there are factors that come into play like the lecturer taking the course , the course itself and the situations around the course . So for me , I think the courses I took towards my final year were more challenging than the ones I took from the beginning . Towards the ending part of my course , I had more respon ? sibilities and less time to read . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my final year , I had less time to read because of certain responsibilities . Perhaps , the final courses had more application and even new terms were even introduced <p> How often do you use the li ? brary to read ? <p> I love to read in confined places and the library was no exception . I mostly used the hostel reading room . I loved reading early in the morning and late at night because the day was full of activities so I used the library a lot . <p> When was your happiest mo ? ment ? <p> Well , my happiest moment was when I got admitted into this University , I felt elated be ? cause it was the University that I wanted to attend right from the onset <p> Where would you like to work ? <p> Right now , I am at a crossroad because there are two options for me . On one side , I want to practice my profession as a chemical engineer and I want to practice it in the oil and gas sector not because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had my I. T experience at Chevron Nigeria limited and I had a very wonderful experience and that gave me the interest I currently have in the oil and gas sector and my final year project was along that line , so I would like to practice the various things I have learnt and witnessed but on the other side , I would like to further my education by pursuing a masters and PhD programme in chemical engineering . I am looking at top U. S universities . I am already processing both and I am also looking out for possible placement in the oil and gas sector . Although , I am going for service , I just hope on God who knows tomorrow . <p> What attracted you to Chemi ? cal Engineering ? <p> Well , nothing really attracted me to Chem ? ical Engineering . I love Engineering as a whole . I think the choice of Chemical Engi ? neering was made by my mum and my aca ? demic mentor , my physics teacher back then <p> What are your aspirations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and in as much as one has to have a long term goal , I prefer to look at things in the shortest possible way and exercise my efforts towards the short term goals . Right know what I am sure of is that I would like to give back to the society what it gave to me by teaching and impacting lives but how these would be , I can not tell if I would come back and be a lecturer . As regards marriage , yes , but God knows best . I am just acting accord ? ing to His plans for my life . <p> When was your worst mo ? ment in school ? <p> The beginning of my final year first semes ? ter when I lost my dad . It was a tough and trying period . Expectations were high and I could n't afford to make any contribution . The emotional trauma I faced at that period because my dad was my source of inspiration and motivation toward my academic suc ? cess . Well , that was my trying moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were supportive . Actually , I thank God because even with the sad moment , I still had straight As that semester . <p> What is your advice to stu ? dents and youths in general ? <p> Well , for students , I know we do n't like reading . I say we because somewhere , I share such passions as well but it is good to endure . It is good to appreciate the efforts of our guardians and parents by way of paying our school fees and taking care of us . The onus is on us , students to make them proud always by taking our education serious because we are the future they and society would look up to one day .

The fact remains that Nigerians have never really been democrats . From the 1st republic , almost as soon as democratic elections were introduced by the colonial administration , harassment , intimidation and much later outright rigging became the stuff of Nigerian elections . The call for the scrapping of the then " Native Authorities Police " was engendered by the use of the police to intimidate and harass supporters of opposition parties in the Northern and Western regions , some of which led to sustained periods of violence in Tivland in 1960 . <p> At the end of the 1959 parliamentary elections , it became obvious that a coalition between Dr Nnamidi Azikiwe 's NCNC and Chief Obafemi Awolowo 's AG could form a majority government with their combined seats of 89 for NCNC and 75 for AG totalling 164 seats in a federal parliament with 312 seats of which Tafawa Balewa 's NPC had won 148 seats . For reasons of nation building Dr Nnamidi Azikiwe chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Balewa emerged prime minister was formed . But by the time the next elections became due in 1964 , relations between Dr Nnamidi Azikiwe and Tafawa Balewa had collapsed irreconcilably . The lingering crisis brought Dr Nnamidi Azikiwe 's NCNC and Chief Awolowo 's AG together who for the first time merged their parties and registered a new party then known as UPGA . A merger between the NCNC and AG was sure to lead to electoral defeat for Tafawa Balewa . To forestall that he entered a coalition with Ladoke Akintola and they both orchestrated a massive electoral heist primarily in the Western region and parts of the North . The heist gave both Tafawa Balewa and Akintola a rigged victory in an election they surely would have lost had it been free and fair . The sham elections subsequently set off a wave of violence ( wetie ) in the Western region that eventually truncated the 1st republic . <p> The 2nd republic did n't fare much better as Shehu Shagari 's NPN rigged elections all the way . By 1983 the art of rigging had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave him total victory . The crisis emanating from the rigged elections led to the military coup that ousted him in December 1983 . Again like the 1st republic , if free and fair elections had been held Shehu Shagari would probably not have been re-elected . With the annulations of the still born June 12 1993 elections , Nigeria commenced another democratic experiment in 1999 . Like all previous republics , the 4th republic under the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo who in his own words determined elections to be a " do-or-die " affair was notorious for election rigging , godfatherism , thuggery and lawlessness . Obasanjo aided by his electoral umpire singlehandedly picked and rigged in anointed candidates . It was in the Obasanjo era that a notorious godfather Lamidi Adedibu used thugs to remove an elected governor , Rashid Ladoja in Oyo state . Earlier attempts to remove Chris Ngige in Anambra state with thugs had failed . <p> Rigging , lawlessness and recklessness in Obasanjo 's era was so brazen that the 2007 elections was described by international observers as the worst they had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yar'Adua administration continued with the Obasanjo rigging system until his demise . It was only when President Goodluck Jonathan came to power in 2010 with clear promises of electoral reforms that Nigeria 's electoral landscape radically began to change . For the first time incumbent governors and individuals lost in free and fair elections to popular candidates . Professor Atahiru Jega widely reputed to be credible was appointed INEC chairman . In 2011 , President Goodluck Jonathan stood for and won elections adjudged by international and local observers to be one of the freest and fairest elections ever conducted in Nigeria . As the 2015 elections approached the apostles of " do or die " democracy and election rigging that dot the landscape , sensing his disadvantage put all kinds of pressure on him to manipulate the elections but he refused . <p> Even as the clouds of defeat became increasingly ominous , he still refused to interfere or manipulate the electoral process declaring as he always did that his personal ambition was not worth the life of any Nigerian . In the end , in spite of every possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opted for a free and fair election and congratulated the winner even before the final results had been announced . For a country where all preceding leaders since the 1st republic had rigged elections and for a continent where leaders most often rig elections and remain as president for life , Goodluck Jonathan is the first Nigerian and one of Africa 's very few democratic presidents . <p> He achieved a rare feat , defying monumental pressure from the rigging hawks in a country whose people are fundamentally undemocratic . Anyone who still harbours any doubt about the undemocratic nature of the Nigerian society should closely review the 2015 elections and witness the intimidations , bigotry , abuse , violence and even threats of genocide that went along with the elections . The Oba of Lagos who threatened to mystically drown some residents of Lagos if they did n't vote for his preferred candidate is another example of Nigeria 's do-or-die " jagaban " democratic system . Even with a Buhari victory and in spite of the change slogan , the post-election period continued to be clouded with recriminations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphalism , hate speech and smear campaigns against those who did n't vote for Buhari/APC . It is in this kind of patently undemocratic Nigerian environment and the added hailstorms of Nigeria 's ethno-religious contradictions that Goodluck Jonathan an incumbent president with immense powers , stood against the buffeting winds and organised free elections leaving an indelible legacy as Nigeria 's first democratic president in the country 's chequered history . <p> Many do not yet appreciate the full scale of this selfless sacrifice , but when all the heated emotions have died down , the myths/lies laid bare and the dust have cleared from our eyes , Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan would indeed have his place in history as Nigeria 's first democratic and consequently the greatest president to date .

@@1922234 <h> June 12 and illusion of hope <p> The June 12 , 1993 presidential election was free and fair . Twenty two years after , those who annulled the historic poll won by the defunct Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) candidate , the late Chief Moshood Abiola , have not shown remorse . In recent past , the Jonathan Administration acknowledged him as the President-elect . But , the effort by the Federal Government to immortalise the symbol by naming the University of Lagos , Akoka after him was rejected because some stakeholders said it was a wrong move . Will the Buhari Administration immortalise Abiola according to popular wishes ? Group Political Editor EMMANUEL OLADESU revisits the June 12 saga and its lessons for the polity . <p> For the first time , Nigerians were united by the resolve to make the country a nation , contrary to its inherent contradiction as a plural social formation forcefully amalgamated in 1914 to serve the interest of the British . That moment of decision was June 12 , 1993 , when people trooped out to vote for the late Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola , the presidential candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibadan and Aare Ona Kankanfo of Yorubaland , was a Yoruba from Ogun State . But , he was endowed with an irrepressible national outlook . Thus , he was endorsed at the poll by millions of people across the over 250 ethnic groups . The mandate given to him was to liberate the country from the yoke of militocracy . Unlike the elections before and after it , June 12 , 1993 elections was not shaped by tribalism , religious animosity and ethnic suspicion . It was a big achievement for the military that was trying to midwife democracy . But , it was mismanaged because the military President , Gen. Ibrahim Babangida , was reluctant to leave when the ovation was loud . <p> However , the mandate became Abiola 's undoing . He was arrested and hounded into detention like a criminal . He never returned alive . The death of his wife , Kudirat , who sustained the struggle when he was in detention , was also gruesome . The Amazon was killed along Seven-Up Junction , Toll Gate , Oregun , Lagos when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never betrayed the import of his Oyo title : the Generalisimo . He was a man of valour ; a great warrior and fighter . He was harassed , abused and blackmailed . But , he refused to desert the battle field , That would have meant abandoning the people in their hour of great thirst for popular rule . To the progressives who rallied round him , it was a titanic battle for reshaping the country . <p> In detention , there was no hope that he would ever return . The circumstances surrounding his death has been in the realm of conjecture . What killed him ? Who killed him ? The answer has been elusive . Abiola 's slogan was the abolition of poverty . He was the hero of the masses who suffer from want and misery . The military dangled carrots at him . But , the billionaire businessman refused to trade the people 's mandate for big contracts and mundane economic gains . His life was a lesson in determination , consistency and dedication to principles . <p> Abiola outlived his tormentor , Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , was not fulfilled . Thus , he lacked self-actualisation . He died a martyr . His death marked the end of an era . His ghost is still hunting his alleged killers . His memory has endured . So were his grace , act of giving , meetle of speech , force of character , and love for the common man , which made him a reference point in history . <p> Abiola was mourned by the beneficiaries of his philanthropic activities , the universities where he instituted endowment funds , the churches and mosques he assisted , the indigent students he sponsored , the workers in his various industries and companies , the poor and the needy he courted , his political associates and the masses that voted for him to liberate them from poverty . <p> Besides , Abiola had another pastime . He led the fight for reparations in Africa . He said the descendants of the poorest of the poor ; the hewers of wood and fetchers of water deserved compensation for slavery in Europe and America . <p> Twenty one years the annulment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the results were cancelled , there were confusion , outrage and condemnation of the barbaric act . But , the military was adamant . Democracy , according to lb servers , was subjugated by the barrel of gun . The hope of a peaceful transfer of power to the democratically elected President was dashed . The rest is history . <p> Successive elections have been tainted with fraud . Pro-democracy groups believe that , if the historic poll had been affirmed , Nigeria would have laid a solid foundation for the sanctity of the ballot box . In 1999 , the presidential election was resolved at the Supreme Court . In 2003 , 2007 and 2007 , it followed the same pattern . The major opposition candidate , Gen. Muhammadu Buhari , challenged the flawed processes in the court . Although the recent presidential election was perceived to be largely free and fair , it can not be on the same pedestal like the June 12 , 1993 election . The recent election was shaped by ethnicity and religion . <p> On June 12 , 1993 , when Abiola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Alhaji Othman Bashir , the poll was peaceful nationwide . There were no malpractices , thuggery and violence . To domestic and foreign observers , Nigeria was coming of age . Also , voters issued a red card to the soldiers of fortune . But , the sit tight military rulers resisted the change , caged the symbol and consequently , the victor became the villain . <p> Babangida took the credit for the colossal assault on democracy . In the process , he dribbled himself into the dark corner of history , thereby missing a glorious opportunity to imprint his name in gold . Every year , he is remembered in connection the history of treachery and betrayal , which will be narrated from generation to generation . Posing as a populist leader , the former military leader elicited the support of the people for the longest transition process that was programmed to fail . <p> When Babangida unfolded his transition programme , the late sage , Chief Obafemi Awolowo , cautioned against the illusion of hope . Weary of the prevailing political situation , he warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would be terribly disappointed . Awo also urged his followers to learn to eat and wine with the devil with a long spoon . <p> Babangida started to gamble with the transition timetable very early . He shifted the poll twice . The third attempt was resisted by the human rights community . On poll day , voters were determined . According to the National Electoral Commission ( NEC ) chaired by Prof. Humphrey Nwosu , 14 million voters participated in the exercise . The contest showcased the potency of the Option A4 , the open ballot system and the symbolic importance of the two party system . According to the poll results , Abiola scored 8,341 , 309 votes , representing 58.36 percent of the total votes cast . Tofa , sources said , was ready to concede victory . In fact , the NRC National Publicity Secretary , Dr. Doyin Okupe , declared that the poll was free and fair , affirming that Abiola won a popular mandate . However , the game of deception by the military had reached the peak . <p> Former military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraboh offered a feeble and spurious explanation for the annulment . He said : " In view of the litigation pending in the various courts , the Federal Government is compelled to take appropriate steps to rescue the judiciary . These steps are taken to protect our legal system and the judiciary from being ridiculed and politicised , both nationally and internationally . <p> " In an attempt to end this ridiculous charade , which may culminate in judicial anarchy , the Federal Military Government has decided to : stop forthwith all court proceedings pending or to be instituted and appeals thereon in respect of any matter touching , relating or concerning the presidential election held on June 12 , 1993 , the Transition to Civil Rule Political Programme ( Amendment No 3 , Decree No 52 of 1992 and the presidential election . <p> Irabor added : " Basic Constitutional and Transitional Provision Decree No 13 of 1993 is hereby repealed . all acts or omissions done or purportedly to have been done , or to be done by any person , authority etc , under the above named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hereby suspended . All acts or omission done or purported to have been done by itself , its officers or agents under the repealed Decree No 13 , 1993 , are hereby nullified . " <p> Later , Babangida said the process of authentication and clearance of the presidential candidates was not thorough . Intoxicated by power , he declared that although he knew those who would not succeed him , he did not know those who would succeed him . Nigerians were taken aback when the military President boasted that " we are not only in government , we are in power . " <p> With the cancellation of the results , Abiola 's vision for Nigeria died . The businessman-turned politician had fought many personal battles , but the ' June 12 ' battle was the fiercest battle of his life . Rejecting the annulment , Abiola declared himself as the custodian of a sacred mandate . He said , having voted for him , the people of Nigerian expected him to assume the reins on August 27 , 1993 . " I intend to keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the ability of his friend , Abiola . He could not underrate his gut . Courage and the resolve to succeed were the hallmarks of Abiola 's life . In a birthday message to him in 1992 , Babangida acknowledge the rare virtue , stressing that " a major feature of your life , so far , is the doggedness and determination with which you pursue any venture embarked upon " . <p> Abiola fought gallantly as an inexperienced politician . His strength was his mass following . When the military turned the heat on him , hje jetted out to seek international support . By the time he returned home , his party had split . The SDP leaders started to speak from the two sides of the mouth . Also , empire was subjected to torture . Former Information Minister Comrade Uche Chukwumerije mounted propaganda against the just cause . He said , by travelling abroad , MKO had gone down in history as the first Aare Ona Kankanfo of Yoruba to have deserted the battle field . As June 12 divided the polity , associates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) led by Senator Arthur Nzeribe , engaged in infamous deformation of the struggle , collating imaginary signatures of people against the election . The late Admiral Aikhomu also said that Abiola was not fit to rule , explaining that the rich are not necessarily philosophical kings . <p> For Abiola , history merely repeated itself on June 12 , 1993 . On June 12 1982 , he could not even collect the presidential nomination form from the National Party of Nigeria ( NPN ) National Secretariat . The gate of the party secretariat was shot against him . The former Transport Minister , the late Dr. Umaru Dikko , told Abiola that " the Presidency is not for the highest bidder " . Two years before , he had also aspired to lead the NPN . But , he was defeated by the more experienced Chief Adisa Akinloye . <p> However , in the aborted Third Republic , the stumbling block , President Babangida , was too formidable , assumed full executive powers , without the accompanying checks and balances . But , Abiola was ready to lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Epe Declaration , the President-elect said : " Never before has there been such a cynical and contemptuous abrogation of solemn commitment and fixed programme . " <p> However , the collective resistance by pro-democracy groups failed . When Babangida stepped aside , he did not hand over to Abiola , but an interim government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan . Rationalising the option , Obasanjo said it was regrettable , but understandable . The interim contraption was short-lived . On November 10 , 1993 , Justice Dolapo Akinsanya of the Lagos High Court dismantled the interim apparatus , saying that it was illegal , unconstitutional , null and void . On November 18 , 1993 , the interim government was shoved aside by Gen. Sani Abacha , who proclaimed himself as the Head of State . <p> To the consternation of pro-democracy crusaders , Abacha abolished all democratic structures at the state and federal levels , disbanded the National Electoral Commission ( NEC ) , banned the two political parties and set up the Provisional Ruling Council ( PRC ) . Then , he promised to hand over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cajoled to serve under the administration as ministers , thereby mocking their antecedents as June 12 travelers . The military Head of State later initiated a self-succession plan , which collapsed when he mysteriously passed on . <p> Few days after Abacha died , Abiola also died in detention in controversial circumstance . His death in detention provoked outrage and condemnation . Human rights activists alleged that he was killed in detention . The autopsy is still in the realm of conjecture . <p> As Nigerians celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the most credible election , there are some unresolved issues : Who killed Abiola ? How did he died ? Also , since the Federal Government has acknowledged him as the President-elect , who was unjustifiably denied the popular mandate conferred on him , how should he be immortalised ? <p> " Since the Federal Government has acknowledged him as the President-elect , who was unjustifiably denied the popular mandate conferred on him , how should he be immortalised " @

@@1924231 <h> Endless Agony Of Nigeria 's Senior Citizens <p> Senior citizens all over the world are men and women who have attained a retirement age in their work life . In normal climes , they are well looked after by their home government under a robust social security system , but not quite so in Nigeria . segun adeleye and george okojie writes on the experiences of elderly pensioners in Nigeria and how their condition can be improved <p> The plight of Nigeria 's club of pensioners otherwise known as senior citizens , have always been a pathetic one . Many of them , men and women , were either retired or retrenched from the federal and state civil service . Almost every year , their ranks swell , as many more retire from service without any hope of their gratuities or pensions being paid by the government . <p> Their conditions became public knowledge in the late 90 's but became a major blight on the nation 's morality at the dawn of our present democratic dispensation in early 2000 , during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo . Most of them were victims of bad governance of the military era and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless elderly citizens gave the best of their youths and productive years to the service of their fatherland , with little or nothing to show for it . Their frustrations , hopelessness and despondency are evident on their aging faces . They are a common sight on the streets of the major cities in the land , truly reflecting the indigent and penurious life they seem to have been condemned to due to the non-payment of their pensions and other retirement entitlements . <p> Many of the pensioners have actually died in their frustration , while a good number of others are presently nursing life-threatening ailments . Although some of these pensioners have been lucky to be paid by their debtor governments , many others may never be opportune to get their payments in their lifetime . There are others whose families have been collecting their payments on their behalf due to their physical incapacitation . <p> For these pensioners , there is also a problem of accessing their contributions and monies deducted under the pension Act . Indeed , there is the urgent need to help these senior citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an effort to address the plight of their members , made an 18-point appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari , on the need to create the Ministry of Pensions and Senior Citizens Affairs , topping their shop-list . <p> Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend , the president of NUP , Dr Abel Afolayan , said creating a ministry for them would lessen the burden of pensioners . <p> They also canvassed for the strengthening and retention of the PenCom and the pension transitional arrangement directorate to function as parastatals under the ministry , to tame the rising cases of avoidable deaths their members are exposed to because of lack of access to their pension funds in good time . <p> Afolayan also stated that sections 173 ( 3 ) and 210 of the 1999 Constitution , which provide for review of pension every five years or whenever salaries are reviewed , whichever comes first , should be dusted up to work for retired workers . <p> The NUP president is particularly disturbed by the non-payment of the 25 years pay-off for Nigerian-retirees of the Nigeria Airways , whereas their expatriates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra-Leone , Ghana and Togo were duly paid . <p> He expressed dissatisfaction over the practice and pleaded with the new government to ensure justice by paying the balance of 20 per cent due to retired Nigerians from the airways , maintaining that only five per cent lay-off had been paid them . <p> Dr Afolayan described as arbitrary and wrong , the pegging of the 53.4 per cent increase in pension at 33 per cent , wondering why NHF , tax and contributory pension should be deducted from pensioners increment . He also frowned at the stoppage of the remission of federal government 's five per cent counterpart funding into the local government pension fund , just as it canvassed for the harmonisation of the old and new pension rates . <p> In recognising the citizens ' right to pension , Section 16(2) ( d ) of the 1999 Constitution stipulates that , " The state shall direct its policy towards ensuring : that suitable and adequate shelter , food , reasonable national minimum living wage , old age care and pensions , unemployment and sick benefits and welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sections 173 and 210 of the Constitution are more pronounced on this . Section 173 of the Constitution provides that : <p> ( 1 ) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution , the right of a person in the public service of the federation to receive pension or gratuity shall be regulated by law . <p> ( 2 ) Any benefit to which a person is entitled to in accordance with or under such law as is referred to in subsection ( 1 ) of this section shall not be withheld or altered to his disadvantage except to such extent as is permissible under any law , including the Code of Conduct . <p> ( 3 ) Pensions shall be reviewed every five years or together with any federal civil service salary reviews , whichever is earlier . <p> ( 4 ) Pensions in respect of service in the public service of the federation shall not be taxed . <p> Again , Section 210 of the Constitution restates that : <p> ( 1 ) Subject to the provisions of subsection ( 2 ) of this section , the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive pension or gratuity shall be regulated by law . <p> ( 2 ) Any benefit to which a person is entitled in accordance with or under such law as is referred to in subsection ( 1 ) of this section shall not be withheld or altered to his disadvantage except to such extent as is permissible under any law , including the Code of Conduct . <p> ( 3 ) Pensions shall be reviewed every five years or together with any state civil service salary reviews , whichever is earlier . <p> ( 4 ) Pensions in respect of service in the service of a state shall not be taxed . <p> Pensioners under the new pension scheme <p> Unlike what obtains in the past , the National Pension Commission ( PenCom ) stated that a total of 92 , 576 workers have retired under the Contributory Pension Scheme ( CPS ) in Nigeria within the last six years , and these retirees have been collecting their monthly pension seamlessly . <p> The head , Benefit and Insurance Department at PenCom , Olulana Loyinmi , has been quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension through programmed withdrawal from Pension Fund Administrators ( PFAs ) stood at 84,097 as at February 2014 , while retirees who chose life annuity offered by life insurance companies stood at 8,479 . <p> These 92,576 retirees have so far received a total lump sum of N230 billion in line with the provisions of the Pension Act . <p> He also informed that total monthly pension being collected under programmed withdrawal was N24.6 billion , while in the case of annuity , it was N425.533 million . <p> This is in line with section 4(1) of the Pension Reform Act 2004 which stipulates that " A holder of a retirement savings account , upon retirement or attaining the age of 50 years , whichever is later , shall utilise the balance standing to the credit of his retirement savings account for the following benefits : <p> ( a ) Programmed monthly or quarterly withdrawals calculated on the basis of an expected life span ; <p> ( b ) Annuity for life purchased from a life insurance company licensed by the National Insurance Commission with monthly or quarterly payments ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance standing to the credit of his retirement savings account ; provided that the amount left after that lump sum withdrawal shall be sufficient to procure an annuity or fund programmed withdrawals that will produce an amount not less than 50 per cent of his annual remuneration as at the date of his retirement . " <p> The commission has also promised that it would continue to sensitise retirees and potential retirees to understand the different retirement benefit options and exercise their rights of choice for the options . <p> In order to serve the existing and potential retirees better , PenCom 's acting director general , Mrs Chinelo Anohu-Amazu , said that the commission had , a few months ago , organised workshops in the six geo political zones of the country to enable the commission receive feedbacks on challenges current beneficiaries of the scheme are faced with . She added that the information gathered at the forum would guide the commission and be used for future planning and operations . <p> Besides , she said PenCom was striving to bridge the knowledge gap on retirement requirements among intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation on the administration of retirement and terminal benefits and guidelines on annuity . <p> She maintained that the pre-retirement workshops was designed to sensitise prospective retirees on the process of the benefits administration under the CPS . <p> The workshop is also intended to discover areas of possible change or review in the commission 's regulation in future that can improve the lives of retirees , correct some misinformation in the pension industry and provide opportunities for stakeholders to relate on common issues in the industry . <p> States across the country and indeed some private companies , like the media sub-sector , are culpable of this constitutional infraction . <p> According to the Lagos chapter secretary , Joint Action Funds , Abiodun Aremu , to alleviate the plight of the retirees , the Lagos State government must immediately pay all entitlements of retirees and stoppage of attempt by government to reverse retirement age from 65 to 60 years for some category of staff . <p> He lamented that the workers of the institution have not been able to access their retirement benefit in the past three years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's commissioner for Establishment , Training and Pensions , Mrs Florence Oguntuase , said the state government 's template of retiree welfare was a model for other state governments and federal government to emulate . <p> She said the state government had since given priority attention to the welfare of retirees . <p> To this end , she said the government has paid over N32.2 billion into the Retirement Savings Accounts ( RSA ) of 6,145 workers who retired from the state public service between 2010 and 2015 and issued N8 billion as Retirement Bond Certificate . <p> Oguntuase said the move was to ensure that retirees get their entitlement as at when due . He explained that the monthly deduction of 7.5 per cent from employee salaries and 7.5 counterpart funding is now over N16 billion , while the employee joint contributions have cumulatively risen to over N57 billion since the inception of the scheme in 2007 . <p> According to her , the Lagos State Pension Commission ( LASPEC ) , in collaboration with the state 's approved six Pension Fund Administration ( PFAs ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pre-retirement plan in order to prepare them adequately for life after retirement . <p> She said the ministry had also organised seminars for workers scheduled to retire from the state civil service between January and June this year . <p> To ensure that all the pensioners are captured in the scheme , she said the government has conducted verification exercise for over seven thousand pensioners in 16 local governments in the state in January this year . <p> In his own contribution , the director general of LASPEC , Mr Adekunle Hussain , said the present administration is set to review the state pension law and increase the monthly pension payment by the state government and staff in the ratio 10 per cent and 8 per cent respectively , as against the current 7.5 per cent . <p> He stated that in appreciation of the effective management of the pension scheme , Lagos State has received various awards , adding that the contributory pension fund between 2007 and 2014 has hit N55.5bn , assuring serving public servants and retirees in the state of a better welfare at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagos retirees to sensitise and prepare the retiring civil servants on the workability of the contributory pension scheme . <p> " The seminar is aimed at assisting the prospective retirees to adequately prepare them for physical , emotional and financial well-being in retirement as well as afford them the benefit of being in better position and frame of mind to build a comfortable and rewarding life in retirement . " <p> A retiree of the Lagos State government , Mrs Aina Akinjobi , said she is currently enjoying her retirement , saying the government prepared them for the challenges before they eventually retired . <p> " The money I got I invested in my Kerosene business . I was privileged to attend a seminar organised by the state government where we were admonished not to use our money for the business we knew nothing about . As a retiree , I have learnt to limit the rate at which I buy things that I do n't really need . <p> " Of course , you do n't expect me to buy ' Aso ebi ' regularly like I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time in one 's life to be extravagant and distribute gifts at relatives ' ceremonies .

@@1924234 <h> The Role of Nigerian Media in Nation-Building ( II ) <p> Hate speech employs discriminatory epithets to insult and stigmatize others on the basis of their race , ethnicity , gender , sexual orientation or other forms of group membership . <p> It is any speech , gesture , conduct , writing or display which could incite people to violence or prejudicial action . The problem is that hate speech is often the gateway to discrimination , harassment and violence as well as a precursor to serious harmful criminal acts . It is doubtful if there will be hate-motivated violent attacks on any group without hate speech and the hatred it purveys.Though hate speech is often condemned -- and rightly so- there is an inherent problem in trying to contain it in an environment in which the protection , defence and sustenance of the country 's democracy rests mainly on free speech - including speeches that offend , shock and awe - being protected.Do the above mean that the Nigerian media , in the performance of their roles , are fated to undermine the country 's nation-building processes ? Not at all . There are several restraining factors:Countervailing functions For instance the NTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as the megaphones of the party that controls the federal government . This means that states governed by parties that are in opposition to the federal government often have a need to have their own TV and radio stations for ' adequate ' coverage of their own activities . It could be argued that various broadcast media , by articulating local concerns or giving certain slants to their story play countervailing functions by cancelling out one another and ensuring that no one partisan narrative dominates the public space . In other words , the proliferation of media ensures that even if some media present slanted views of events , such will be countervailing since there will always be avenues to present contrarian views.CompetitionOne of the impacts of media in Nigeria is the competition it generates among the federating units . Though units in a federation are supposed to be cooperative in striving towards the attainment of socio-economic goals , it could be argued that a certain level of competition is healthy in improving efficiency . For instance regional pride and politics interfaced to explain the emergence of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Chief Obafemi Awolowo , who was the leader of the Western Region and his party men had walked out of parliament in protest against a constitutional debate on the eve of independence . The federal government used the all-Nigeria Radio Broadcasting Service to condemn their action but denied them access to the medium to reply to the allegations against them . In response Awolowo established a television station , ( which actually became the first operational television station in Africa ) the Western Nigeria Television ( WNTV ) on 31 October 1959 , with the slogan , ' First in Africa ' . Goaded by the success of Awolowo 's WNTV , the former Eastern region established its own Eastern Nigeria Television Service ( ENTV ) in 1960 . This was followed by Radio- Television Kaduna established by the former Northern Nigerian government as an arm of the Broadcasting Company of Northern Nigeria ( BCNN ) in March 1962 . A month later the federal government joined the race and established the Nigerian Television Service ( NTS ) in LagosIn essence both the federal government and the three regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations.With the creation of more states , starting from 1967 , virtually every state government created its own radio and television station , partly to help broadcast the activities of the government and partly because they have become part of the paraphernalia of statehood in Nigeria.CommercialismThe process of acquiring a licence to start a television or radio does not favour community radio and TV stations which are designed to propagate only regional or community values . A prospective applicant for licence must for instance have a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission and such a company will have to purchase a set of application forms for N50,000 and if the application is successful the company will then pay licence fee for an initial period of five years , which is again renewable every five years with huge sums of money . This means that apart from state governments , there will be commercial pressures for individuals in the media to break even or to respect the sensitivity of advertisers and potential advertisers.The above shows that just because the country is polarized and the media houses often dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their reportages will be antithetical to the nation-building process . Party loyaltyIf , as we argued the media owners influence the contents , then given that the political party affiliation or loyalty of the owners may not be coterminous with state boundaries , then the political party affiliation of the owners could be one of the centralising tendencies in the country among the media.Media RegulatorsThe media regulators -- the Nigerian Press Council ( set up in 1992 in the Ministry of Information ) and the National Broadcasting Commission ( NBC ) , which was also set up in 1992 are parastatals of the federal government . Their ability to sanction local media , especially when done fairly , can moderate the centrifugal pulls of those local media with irredentist inclinations.Conclusions and RecommendationsFrom our discussions , we can see that just because our media practitioners operate in a highly polarized environment ( where the various owners with their own agenda control content ) , does not necessarily mean that in going about their work , they will necessarily undermine the nation-building process because of other centralizing or countervailing tendencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they currently do towards the nation-building process . A precedent step for this however will be the resolution of the current crisis in the nation-building process . Certainly resolving this crisis will make Nigerian journalists feel like stakeholders in the Nigeria project , forcing them to report with sensitivity , especially in times of conflicts.Better training and better and timely payments of journalists ' salaries will also moderate the tendency to be driven by the imperatives of ' stomach infrastructure ' as they ply their trade.With respect to the ubiquity of hate and offensive speeches , in the media , I will recommend the following:There is an urgent need to develop , in conjunction with critical organs of the society such as media owners and practitioners , a taxonomy of what constitutes hate speech . Media houses through their unions should incorporate these as part of good journalism practice and impose sanctions on erring members who publish or broadcast hate speech-laden materials.The National Orientation Agency , in concert with civil society groups and community leaders , should also embark on a campaign against the use of hate speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to bring down blogs and websites they host which publish , promote or give unfettered space for the expression of hate speech . Above all it should be impressed upon the political leadership at all levels that a deep distrust of the government is at the heart of the sort of free speech jurisprudence they have in the United States and that Nigerians have the same level of distrust of their governments.Perhaps one of the most effective ways of combating hate speech is to ensure that purveyors of such speeches are marginalized . For instance in the UK , while the racist British National Party and the ideas it purveys are not banned , it will be political suicide for any politician to be seen to associate with the party 's members . In Nigeria hate speech mongers are adopted as regional and ethnic heroes.Media owners , in conjunction with media regulators and relevant civil societies can develop a taxonomy of what constitutes hate speech and the type of sanctions to be imposed on any journalist found to have violated such . Self regulation and self censorship are better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outlaw it.More importantly Nigerians should learn to laugh at themselves . This is already happening in some ways with our comedians who dish out jokes based on ethnic and regional profiling . In fact it could be argued that since every region and ethnic group in the country is both a victim and a victimizer when it comes to hate speech , they countervail and cancel out one another .

@@1926237 <h> Delicate art of ' balancing ' <p> As last week ended , inter-regional bickering threatened to creep back into national politics with hordes of social media warriors leading the cavalry charge against what they said were President Muhammadu Buhari 's regionally lopsided appointments . <p> Buhari has made preciously few appointments since his inauguration more than a month ago and , if the " sources " that spoke to several media houses last weekend are correct , he is not about to make any major appointments for another two months . Which is why it is doubly troubling that the few that he made should sail into an e-ocean of controversy.A page 3 story in Saturday Punch summarised the bone of contention . Punch 's story was titled Appointments : Uproar as Buhari favours Northerners . According to the story , President Buhari has so far made nine appointments and all of them except Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina are northerners . They include Director General of the Department of State Services Lawal Musa Daura , Acting Chairman of INEC Hajiya Amina Bala Zakari , Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources Mordechai Dantani Baba Ladan , Accountant General of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Mohamed Lawal Abubakar and Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity , Garba Shehu.Many other things were said by the e-warriors to further muddle up matters . They mentioned the slightly untidy transfer of power at INEC , where the Presidency failed to designate an acting chairman in time until the outgoing chairman handed over to one of the national commissioners , only for the presidency to designate another acting chairman later that evening . Social media regional warriors also made much of the fact that the new DSS boss is from the president 's hometown ; to boot he retired from DSS two years ago , only to be brought back as DG . The Punch threw a few more petrol canisters into the flame by pretending to observe in passing that the president , Senate President , House Speaker and the Chief Justice of Nigeria are all northerners . It would have been fair to add that Buhari did not appoint the other Big Three . In fact , he was visibly displeased by the emergence of two of them.Anyway , inter-regional controversy regarding appointments is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unresolved leadership crisis in the National Assembly , which has created a credibility problem for the All Progressives Congress APC and its Change agenda . Nor was the administration helped very much by the army of youthful Northern social media warriors that rushed to its defence . Their main line of counter attack was that former president Jonathan did the same thing . Some e-warriors compiled a selective list of what they called Jonathan 's regionally lopsided appointments including key ones such as Central Bank , NIMASA , Accountant General , Federal Inland Revenue and Army Chief . The list nicely omitted all Jonathan appointments of Northerners , which was a desperate way to make a point.I am not by any means holding up Jonathan-era appointments as a model of inter-regional balancing . But if they were skewed as the Northern social media warriors argue , do they wish to place President Buhari on the same moral pedestal ? Are they saying in effect that Southerners had their turn in marginalising Northerners , therefore it is our turn to marginalise Southerners in key appointments ? If that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are we saying this philosophy of turn-by-turn marginalisation should become the accepted ethic in all future public service appointments ? Now , not all the social media commentators leapt before they looked at the consequences of what they were saying . At least a few said , common sensically , that the president should not be judged from only a few appointments since he is due to make hundreds of appointments during his four year tenure . At least that sounds better . In statistics , a result is not reliably declared if the sample is too small . While the chances of a fair sided coin landing heads or tails is exactly fifty-fifty , this ratio may not be achieved if you toss the coin only a few times . You must toss it hundreds or even thousands of times before you achieve a full fifty-fifty ratio . It is up to the Buhari regime to prove in subsequent appointments that it is a statistical fair-sided coin.Still , I was wondering why the Buhari presidency failed to take into consideration likely public perceptions before making these appointments or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many reasons why President Buhari should be very sensitive to matters of inter-regional and inter-religious balancing . In 1983 when the Supreme Military Council announced that Buhari was the new Head of State and Brigadier Tunde Idiagbon was the Chief of Staff , Supreme Headquarters some commentators in the Lagos newspapers rushed to say that the ticket was not balanced because both men were Northerners and both were Muslims . While most Nigerians , I think , later came to see the Buhari-Idiagbon combination as a patriotic national salvage team , some of the things they did were seized upon by critics and attributed to their regional origins . It was said , for example , that they kept President Shehu Shagari in comfortable house detention but sent Vice President Alex Ekwueme to Ikoyi Prisons for regional reasons . The NSO 's invasion of Chief Awolowo 's home in 1984 to cart away files and newspaper cuttings was also alleged by some to be sinister Northern agenda , while the 53 suitcases scandal was also given a regional colouration.Some of the problems of misperception that dogged Buhari since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as some subsequent events . During three failed tries for the presidency he was dogged by allegations that he was a Northern and Muslim parochialist . It was only in 2015 that this misperception underwent a tectonic shift . Too many Jonathan/PDP foibles assisted that , as did the adroit politics of Bola Tinubu and Rotimi Amaechi , among others . Clever APC strategists also silenced those Northern groups agitating for power shift back to the North . They instead sold the Buhari project as a national enterprise . The worst thing that can ever happen is a return to the old perception of parochialism . While I have personally reached a stage in life where I do not care a hoot about the regional , ethnic and religious origins of anyone , regrettably most of our countrymen have not yet arrived there . A ruler must worry about perceptions , not just hanker after the ideal . I recall one episode of Dr. Tony Iredia 's Point Blank television interview with Dr. Chuba Okadigbo in 2002 where he was asked why senators speak in terms of juicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only senators . Nigerians generally think in such terms . A Nigerian will look at the portfolio assigned to a minister from his state and say , ' Oh , is that the only one they gave us ? ' " It could be that the lack of a full complement of staff in Aso Rock is responsible for this problem . I mean , if there is a very strong Chief of Staff and the president sends down a paper saying " appoint this man as so-and-so , " he could say , " Mr. President , given the last two appointments you made , if we announce this one it could make some people to say you are appointing only Northerners . Therefore , I will hold this one for a few days and I suggest that you approve some more appointments to so-and-so organisations so that we can announce them together . " The old ploy used by Nigerian rulers over the years to give the appearance of inter-regional balancing is to group certain Federal Government agencies together and to ensure that if a Northerner heads one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not ideal , but it saves the ruler from political trouble . The compatible agencies here are DSS and NIA , NTA and FRCN , NPA and NIMASA , NYSC and FRSC , Customs and Immigration , Central Bank and NNPC , WAEC and NECO , NUC and JAMB , BPE and BPP , Army and Police etc . The Chief of Staff or the SGF should be the custodian of this intricate balancing act but so far Buhari has neither . <p> ( 0 Likes ) <p> What do you think about this story <p> Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a Daily Trust journalist .

@@1928236 <h> Government And The Challenge Of Drug Abuse In The Country <p> In this piece , VICTOR OKEKE writes on the problem of drug abuse and how it can be tackled . <p> Recently , the Federal Government launched a five-year National Drug Control Master Plan ( NDCMP ) to provide an integrated and comprehensive roadmap for multi-sectoral interventions to address a wide array of drug related issues . The NDCMP , which will be implemented between 2015 and 2019 , aims to strengthen responses to drugs in order for it to contribute to the enhanced health , security and well-being of Nigerians . <p> The menace of illicit drug abuse is an age-long challenge in the country . Budgets have increased dramatically over the last two decades and drug-related prosecutions and incarcerations continue to make news , yet drug problems worsen : adolescent drug abuse is increasing , overdose deaths are at record levels , cannabis are grown in neighborhoods like flowers and are more accessible than before . Of particular note is the health problems related to drugs , especially the spread of HIV/AIDS , cancers , cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and other drug-induced antisocial behaviours . <p> Observers say drug problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopt strategies that work . According to former President Goodluck Jonathan who signed the new NDCMP master plan , the guidelines will be a national road map to ensure that the harm caused by drug trafficking and use by Nigerians is reduced to the barest minimum . " The impact of illicit drug cultivation , trafficking and abuse on Nigerians is profound and manifests itself in many ways some of which may not be ordinarily visible because of the clandestine manner in which drugs find their way into society , " he said . <p> The formulation of the master plan was led by an inter-ministerial drug control committee in Nigeria with support from the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime ( UNODC ) under the framework of the European-Union funded project , ' Response to Drugs and Related Organized Crime in Nigeria ' . <p> At the launch of the drug master plan , the chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ( NDLEA ) , Ahmadu Giade said " drugs do not make heroes but drug addicts . Drug trafficking does not make people successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NDLEA , Mrs Roli Bode George said the beauty of the plan was that its formulation and implementation was based on the principle of collective participation . She listed some objectives of the plan to include , prioritizing issues identified through inclusive and participatory consultation , addressing disparity between law enforcement and drug demand reduction . <p> Others are to provide strategic direction and capacity , enhance operational coordination and implementation as well as promote systematic policy oversight and evaluation . Beyond the master plan , there are numerous issues that should be urgently addressed . For example , Nigeria lacks reliable and comprehensive data on the prevalence of drug use , substance-use and the number of people with drug disorder . There are also insufficient sensitization and drug prevention programmes and those that exist are constrained by low political and financial support . <p> Again , the issue of notorious illicit joints in the country that seems not to catch the attention of drug enforcement officers must be checked . Some of these open joints have rendered young men and women useless to themselves and a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of nefarious activities . <p> Despite evidence that HIV is growing in Nigeria , the link between HIV/AIDS and drug use has not received adequate attention . In a recent report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2015 , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) said too few governments levy appropriate levels of tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products . <p> " These countries therefore miss out on a proven , low-cost measure to curb demand for tobacco ; save lives and generate funds for stronger health services , " it said . The report focuses on raising taxes on tobacco . Although 33 countries impose taxes that represent more than 75 percent of the retail price of a packet of cigarette , many countries have extremely low tax rates . Some have no special tax on tobacco products at all . <p> " Raising taxes on tobacco products is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to reduce consumption of products that kill , while also generating substantial revenue , " says Dr Margaret Chan , WHO director-general . " I encourage all governments to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopt one of the best win-win policy options available for health , " he advises . <p> The main findings of the report , funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies , include the fact that raising taxes is the least implemented MPOWER measure in terms of population coverage , and the one that has seen the least improvement in terms of government action since 2008 . However , by 2014 , 11 countries had raised taxes so that they represent more than 75 percent of the retail price of a packet of cigarette , joining the 22 countries that had similar high taxes in place in 2008 . <p> The director of WHO 's Department for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases ( NCDs ) , Dr Douglas Bettcher said higher tobacco taxes and prices are proven methods to reduce consumption and promote quitting the use of tobacco products . " Evidence from countries such as China and France shows that higher tobacco product prices linked to increased taxes lead to declines in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related harm , such as lung cancer deaths , " said Bettcher . <p> The executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CESER ) , Frank Tietie , said Nigeria 's drug control strategy had been approached primarily as a law enforcement issue . <p> He said : " The police have done their jobs with record arrests , drug seizures and record incarceration of drug offenders yet drug problems continue to worsen . Expensive eradication and interdiction campaigns abroad have brought few results and many costs . Government 's efforts on drug control continue to go to incarceration , and law enforcement programs while treatment , prevention , research and education receives less attention . " <p> He stressed the need for government to accept that the law enforcement paradigm would not work completely and shift to treating drug abuse as a health problem with social and economic implications . " The solutions are in public health approaches which focus on addicts and abusers -- not all users -- as well as social services to reduce many of the root causes of abuse , economic strategies to develop alternative markets and also control drug markets . The federal drug budget should recognize this by shifting resources to prevention , treatment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Abuja , George Ejeh , said the most effective way to prevent adolescent drug abuse would be to invest in the youth and keep them interested and involved in life . He said , " Government should increase funding for after school programs , mentor programs , skills building and job training programs . " <p> Experts say HIV/AIDS , Hepatitis-C and other blood borne diseases are rapidly spread through the sharing of contaminated syringes . Needle exchange and syringe deregulation have been shown to be effective ways to reduce the spread of diseases without increasing drug abuse . Also these services often lead to reductions in drug abuse by getting hard-core users into treatment . <p> The Federal Government should work with states as some state-initiated reforms have included treatment instead of prison , medical use of marijuana , and rehabilitation . The states are laboratories for new approaches that should be tried and if effective duplicated in other parts of the country . <p> United Nations Secretary-General , Ban Ki-moon , insists " unless we reduce demand for illicit drugs , we can never fully tackle cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract both drug trafficking and drug abuse , but communities can also make a major contribution .

But , rumour has it that President Muhammadu Buhari has allegedly ordered the suspension of the new status of the institutions ; a development that is generating tension between workers and their managements . Our reporters LEKE AKEREDOLU ( Akure ) KOLADE ADEYEMI ( Kano ) OKODILI NDIDI ( Owerri ) and ABDULGAFAR ALABELEWEW ( Kaduna ) report . <p> *Workers accuse provosts , elements in government of sabotage *Four provosts can not be greater than the people , says managment *Govt urged to conduct national debate before verdict <p> Last May , the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan took some last-minute decisions , among which was the upgrading of four colleges of education to university status . <p> The institutions are : Adeyemi College of Education , Ondo ( now Adeyemi University of Education , Ondo ) ; Federal College of Education , Zaria ( now Federal University of Education , Zaria ) ; Federal College of Education , Kano ( now Federal University of Education , Kano ) ; and Alvan Ikoku College of Education , Owerri ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , reports in some social mediums had it that the Federal Government , last week suspended the new status of the institutions , fuelling fresh protests and stiff resistance by workers . Many of them are pointing accusing fingers at provosts of the institutions , saying they connived with certain elements in the government to bring about the reversal . <p> Genesis <p> The new government of President Muhammadu Buhari had hardly settled down for business when reactions from various quarters on whether to retain the new status of the institutions or revert them to their old status began to pour in . Those opposed to their new status felt the upgrade was politically motivated , and that the four institutions were better off as colleges of education . Some also wondered why the sudden move in less than two months to Jonathan 's exit from office . Others , particularly workers , who were favourably disposed to the university idea , held the view that aside being the oldest colleges of education nationwide , the institutions have the infrastructure and faculty staff to transform to universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their upgrade , were running degree programmes and Post-Graduate Diplomas ( PGD ) in affiliation with some universities . To the host communities of the institutions , who had long craved for the new status , it was a welcome development and they were a lot happier . <p> Protest rocks Adeyemi University of Education , Ondo <p> But there were mixed feelings about the new status . While some members of staff were happy with the host communities , others were not . And those not favourably disposed to the new status allegedly worked against it . <p> Although their identities are not known and some workers have refused to disclose those allegedly behind the move , investigations revealed that some lecturers , who had spent many years in the system , worked with some prominent people in the society to reverse the schools ' status . <p> It was further learnt that the alleged sponsors have refused to improve themselves , especially in attaining their Ph.D degrees , and were afraid the new status of their institutions might either choke them , or make them inferior . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly formed a group in the four affected colleges of education , using the platform to push their demands . <p> The group was alleged to have been in touch with some highly connected people in government to get their message to the Presidency . <p> Their agitation was anchored on the fact that majority of the teachers in the four institutions have no Ph.D degrees , raising the fear that they might be sent back to the labour market that is replete with unemployed . <p> However , their argument was at variance with that of the non-teaching staff of the institutions . <p> The non-teaching staff , through their unions -- Non-Academic Staff Union ( NASU ) , Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities ( SSANU ) , and National Association of Academic Technologists ( NAAT ) , also formed a joint union called ' Joint Non-Teaching Staff Action Committee ' ( JNTSAC ) to work against the planned reversal . <p> The President of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities ( SSANU ) , Comrade Femi Lademikan , was made their chairman at an emergency congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ondo State . <p> Some of the aggrieved workers , who stormed the congress venue , were armed with canes , ostensibly to go straight to the offices of those pushing for the reversal to flog them . Nonetheless , they were prevailed upon by leaders of the unions , who admonished them not to be violent in pressing for their demands . <p> Addressing the workers at the congress , Lademikan said union leaders had not gone to bed , adding that they had been seeking assistance , particularly from prominent indigenes of the Ondo kingdom . <p> " Immediately we heard about this ( reversal to old status ) , we rushed to Osemawe of Ondo , Oba Victor Kiladejo , but , unfortunately , the monarch was not in the country . That took us to his second in command ; the Lisa of Ondo , Chief , Simeon Oguntimehin . <p> " He expressed sadness on the issue and immediately called the Vice President , Prof. Yemi Osinbajo , his wife , Dolapo and President Muhammadu Buhari 's media aide , Mr. Femi Adesina on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there was no such plan in the Presidency . <p> " We told him of our plan to stage a protest to the Osemawe 's palace and also the Governor 's Office , but Chief Oguntimehin appealed against the idea , fearing that some unscrupulous elements might hijack the process , " he said . <p> But the aggrieved workers insisted that , despite Oguntimehin 's appeal , they must march to the gate of their institution on Ondo-Ore-Lagos Expressway . <p> They displayed placards with various inscriptions , such as " Mr President take away corruption , not our university " ; " University status , no going back " ; " Forward ever , backward never " . <p> Their action caused a gridlock on the route for about an hour . <p> Addressing reporters , Lademikan said : " We want our university to remain , and we are appealing to the government through this peaceful demonstration . <p> " We are telling President Muhammadu Buhari that we have everything- manpower , people , structures and resources that it will take to maintain the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We know them and we are waiting for them . " <p> Teachers in the institution , under the umbrella of Lecturers ' Union of Adeyemi University , had quickly aligned with JNTSAC , describing the upgrade to university as a step in the right direction . <p> A statement signed by its Public Relations Officer ( PRO ) , Mr. Olaolu Olaniyan , said : " The union notes with utter dismay and outright displeasure , the rumour making the rounds about the purported reversal of the hard-earned university status of Adeyemi Federal University of Education and three other newly upgraded universities of education . <p> " We want to emphatically express our rejection of such a reversal which is only capable of creating avoidable tension in the new university community and the host community by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full fledged university was premised on several factors , chiefly , the high quality of academic staff , who have worked assiduously over the years to produce an array of trained teachers for the primary and secondary school components .

It is an ill wind that blows nobody no good , and capable of precipitating crisis in the immediate university community and the host community . " <p> " We have celebrated this and that is how it should be . Nobody should reverse our status .

How come some few people will now be planning to scuttle what a large number of people had laboured for ? <p> " The former Provost gave room for lecturers to develop themselves and through that many of them got their Ph.D , and I do n't know why some people will now complain that we have fewer Ph.D holders ? <p> It 's one week warning strike at the Federal University of Education , Kano <p> Members of the Academic Staff of the Federal College of Education , Kano , on Monday , shut down the institution paralysing academic activities . The development followed their one week warning strike made known to members last week . <p> The workers ' aim was to ask the government to clarify issues on the alleged controversial reversal , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers alleged that the Provost , Dr Rabi Jubirila , doctored the memo signed by the Acting Permanent Secretary , Federal Ministry of Education , Hajia Hindatu Umar Abdullahai , for her selfish interest . <p> The Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of the institution , Dr Abubakar Sadeeq Haruna , accused Jubirila of saying that the said memo directed the institution to revert to the status quo , which , according to him , was contrary to the contents of the memo . <p> Haruna said government only directed that the institution put everything on hold pending further instructions , and not to immediately revert to the former status . <p> " The memo received from the Federal Government specifically cited two major issues , saying that by the copy of this memo , you are directed to revert the school to its original status , " she said , quoting a part of the memo . <p> She continued : " In addition , you are directed to continue to administer the college as Federal College of Education and as the Provost of the college with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations that provosts of the four affected colleges were the architect of the reversal . " Four provosts can not be too powerful to influence the Federal Government 's decision , " she protested . <p> However , Haruna described the reversal as ' too hasty ' , and failed to comply with due process . <p> He lamented that , despite an earlier memo sent to the government , highlighting the advantages of the upgrade to university , and the negative consequences its reversal may generate , the latter still stuck to its guns . <p> The union urged the government to toe the line of due process , and subject the planned reversal to a national debate before jumping to conclusion . <p> Another strike at Alvan Ikoku Federal University of Education <p> On Tuesday , joint academic bodies of Alvan Ikoku Federal University of Education , comprising the Academic Staff Union of Universities ( ASUU ) , Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities ( SSANU ) , the Students ' Union Government ( SUG ) and National Association of Technologists ( NAT ) began a one-week warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placards with various inscriptions such as : " Welcome to Alvan Ikoku University of Education , Owerri ; farewell to Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education , Owerri ' ; ' We want a Vice Chancellor .

" <p> The workers alleged that Dr Ijeoma , whom they said lost out in a bid to clinch the position of the Vice Chancellor , in conjunction with some lecturers , who were relieved of their duties because they lacked the requisite qualifications , were behind the move .

In Abuja , houses are sold for a minimum of N500 million within the city centre . Some even go for between N800 million and N1.3 billion .

@@1939235 <h> Controversy trails construction of Calabar to Benue highway <p> Cross River is one of the states in Nigeria where federal roads are in very bad state , so that motorists and other road users travail before arriving at their destinations . Travelers have had to sleep on both roads while many must see their doctors once they are able to make it through . Such terrible roads include federal link roads to South-South and South-eastern parts , the Odukpani/Uyo federal highway . The other is the link between northern states , i.e. Ikom/Ogoja/Benue road . There have been countless efforts to get these roads fixed to no avail . Key lawmakers representing these federal districts have often returned to tell unpalatable stories which have rather aggravated the people 's anger . The Federal Road Safety Corps FRSC has had to work doubly hard to evacuate casualties on both roads . FERMA officials in Calabar have said that since December 2013 they have not received funds and materials to enable them fix roads in the state . But Governor Ben Ayade is determined to change all that with readiness to construct a brand new 240km superhighway from the southern to the northern part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many rocks that inundate the state in order to ensure he stands out with this road . On his inauguration three months ago , he listed two key projects which he prays God will help him to accomplish in his first term . This superhighway is one . Brand new Deep seaport is another . He said he is ready to infuse all his energies to ensure their completion but are presently eliciting both criticisms and sincere praises beyond the state . Ayade has said the two are his signature projects , and President Muhammadu Buhari has given him backing . Ayade said the president has also indicated strongly to flag them off come September 21 . The 240km superhighway will stretch from end of Calabar to Bekwarra local government council near Benue State . The deep seaport which construction is about to begin is at Ikang near Bakassi . Few persons have began to think that the superhighway to be constructed by a frontline German engineering firm can hardly be achievable given the mounting debts and very little federal allocation coming to the state . But Ayade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no funds belonging to the state would be used to complete the two projects , which President Buhari has instructed that they be completed in two years . The governor had inspected a section of the superhighway at Oban near Calabar with the team of experts . The superhighway will otherwise be an evacuation road from the proposed deep seaport expected to be at the Ikang end of the Bakassi sea , and is to terminate at the boundaries between the state and Benue State To concretise the proposed road project , a Germany firm , Broad Spectrum Industrial Services Ltd , has released ? 500 ( Five Hundred million Euros ) being eighty per cent funding for the road construction . Ayade confirmed that " Already the markings of the super highway have been done , the clearing has been done , earth work has commenced . " But environmentalists and forestry experts have challenged Ayade over impending destruction of large part of their vast forests . Sir Effiom Ekpenyong , a friend of the environment , said the government should be ready to compensate for such massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep seaport , he disclosed that design work and other equipment required for the construction have since been ready , and that technical experts were also on hand . According to Ayade 's Chief Press Secretary , Mr Christian Ita , who spoke for the governor , the seaport which is conceived to serve the entire land-lock north-eastern and south-eastern flanks of the country would be self-funding , thereby revving up the state income . He estimated that the port shall be raking in not less than thirty million dollars per year from patronage at the port going by the Memorandum of Understanding they are to sign with Chad and Niger , which are also land-locked . Chief Executive Officer of the German firm , Michael Havre , assured that they would work to specification and duration , assuring that their partnership with Cross River State would be beneficial . Ita stated that another Chinese firm has since arrived as principal partners for the seaport construction . They are from " Juanguin " in China , and are described as the best in the development of the deep sea port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5000 houses are also to be built by Ayade 's government throughout the18 local government councils of the state to further ease the burden of the low income earners . To this end , Daily Trust learnt that an Irish company called Affordable Homes Concepts Ltd has signed Memorandum of understanding with the state government to build the houses . In a recent twist , however , the Nigerian government has been inundated with complaints from relevant stakeholders and some international organisations including the British Government through their High Commission in Nigeria over the proposed super highway connecting Calabar and Obudu traversing the Cross River National Park . Uncomfortable with the proposed super highway project being undertaken by the Cross River State Government , a number of international bodies including the Britain have raised the alarm over the project , saying it constitutes threat to livelihood . A German firm , which plans to invest over 500m Euro on the project many have suspended work .

This is coming to fore just as unconfirmed sources says President Mohammadu Buhari , who was billed for the ground breaking of the project has suspended the occasion based on environmental issues raised by international organisations and the Federal Ministry of Environment . Both the German and Chinese firms , and others involved in the project and seaport may have stopped work pending the resolution of all issues raised by the international organisations . But , reacting to the letter from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the Chief Press Secretary to the State Governor , Mr. Christian Ita , in a press statement said that " the proposed road would not traverse the Cross River National Park , as the superhighway is several kilometres far removed from the National Park .

@@1941233 <h> Workers ' strikes : The annoying posture of Ondo State <p> Many of Nigeria 's 36 states are still in turmoil over unpaid workers ' salaries . Although the fall in oil revenue which drastically reduced government income accounts for the present situation , those who are unable to appreciate the dilemma of the states can not be blamed , considering the pattern of recklessness of some governors in the nation . If the affected states had made salaries their priority as soon as they observed falling incomes , the situation would not have been this bad . <p> Labour Party candidate , Mimiko <p> Several issues can easily dry up any form of pity for the affected states . The first is the argument by the immediate past minister of finance , Ngozi Iweala that such states are blame worthy because they were warned through the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee to make the issue of wages a priority but they chose not to do so , hence their present predicament . <p> The second issue is that after the states managed to secure bail-out loans from the federal <p> Government , they did not again make salaries the priority . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NUT ) , some states allegedly did not defray unpaid teachers ' salaries from the bailout fund because they had diverted the fund to areas they can easily have quick returns . The NUT President , Michael Ologba , who made the allegation at a press briefing to mark this year 's World Teachers ' day , appealed to the Federal Government to call the affected states to order to avoid a consequential industrial dispute . <p> The solution appears far because when state governors claimed to be seeking lasting solutions to the worsening macroeconomic challenges confronting the nation by getting a presidential bailout , this column warned that what must change is their lack of prudent spending . Luckily , the governors found at the July meeting of the National Economic Council ( NEC ) that to cut the cost of governance in their respective states was an imperative . <p> If truly the bailout was diverted , then we are into a season of strikes . Ondo started it . last Wednesday followed by Cross River two days later . Briefing newsmen in Akure during the week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sunday Adeleye , stated that the strike was inevitable because meetings between his council and representatives of the state government yielded no fruits . <p> Adeleye noted that non-payment of all deductions in the salaries of workers after collecting N14b bailout from the federal government showed the government 's insensitivity to the plight of civil servants in the state . In Cross River State , the situation was the same . Bulletins circulated by the Organised Labour Action Committee in Calabar showed the demands of the workers to include salaries of local government workers and teachers , as well as salaries and allowances of staff of the Cross River University of Technology , weigh-in allowances . The State Chairman of the Trade Union Congress , Mr. Clarkson Otu , said the workers were piqued over the claim of the state government that the bailout fund was to offset loans acquired . <p> If to owe workers their salaries is worrisome , it is worse to seek to play smart games with such deprived citizens as the Ondo State Government sought to do last week through its top officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " labour leaders were unfair to the government because they had agreed during the meeting that things would be sorted out amicably " , information Commissioner Kayode Akinmade described the strike as an embarrassment and an unpatriotic act on the part of the workers since they had started receiving the July salary last Tuesday . <p> Akinmade then threw the bombshell that the strike was politically motivated -- a clearly infuriating posture . How can a strike be described as politically motivated when the aggrieved have been economically driven to the wall ? First , would non-payment of the salaries pave the way for issues to be sorted amicably ? Put differently , while waiting for an amicable settlement , how do workers sustain their livelihood ? Second , all that the workers did was to embarrass the state government while the latter attempted to economically kill the workers . <p> If the Ondo state government thought it was smart , it failed to realize it is hard to be smarter than workers about salaries . For instance , while the government employed circumlocution , the workers effectively mobilized public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the government was into divide and rule by paying net salary for the month of July to core civil servants and secondary school teachers whereas it paid nothing to workers in the local government , primary school teachers and other categories of workers : b ) the state government breached the agreement it reached with labour leaders that gross salaries of July and August and deductions for June would be paid : c ) the action of the government was contrary to what was been aired on the State Radio vision Corporation that government had commenced payment of salaries of July and August to all workers and d ) workers are aware that the government had placed the bailout fund in a fixed deposit account to yield interests . To me , the workers beat government hands down on the subject . <p> Consequently , the Ondo State government should be careful next time not to use officials who do not know what to say or how to speak during crises .

@@1941234 <h> Osinbajo Opens up on Public Sector Reforms , Rationalisation of MDAs <p> * Says ministers ' retreat to take place after swearing-in * MDAs given two weeks to submit procurement records <p> Tobi Soniyi and James Emejo in Abuja <p> More insight was provided into the policies of the Muhammadu Buhari administration on Wednesday when Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo announced that the government had embarked on a process to retool public institutions to make them more proactive and effective in service delivery to Nigerians . <p> In this regard , he said public sector reforms had become critical for accountable and transparent use of national resources . <p> He said the main objective was to enhance the capacity of the institution to deliver public goods effectively in response to citizens ' needs and demands . <p> Speaking in Abuja at the ongoing 21st Nigerian Economic Summit ( NES ) , he also said there would be no sacred cow in the reforms that would be undertaken , adding the same rules would apply to " all of us " . <p> He specifically argued that change was needed among the elite , which often works to subvert laid down rules . <p> Speaking during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accountability , he said government also hopes to create an environment for the respect of human rights and the rule of law in order to enhance competitiveness in the private sector . <p> He further foreclosed that government would review its tax regime to raise its non-oil revenue base , stressing that revenue collection would only have to be more efficient to improve collections . <p> He said federal agencies currently had overlapping functions and responsibilities without a positive working relationship among them , which he added made several ministeries , departments and agencies ( MDAs ) work at cross-purposes without harmony in project execution . <p> " At the moment , the MDAs are accused of unhealthy competition and this claim has led to the silly mindset that MDAs do not talk to each other enough . <p> " We found out that many MDAs are executing the same projects and programmes and sometimes achieving similar results without necessarily talking to each other at all . That we believe is a waste of resources . <p> " We must streamline the work of the ministries and be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clear part in line with the policy direction of government . <p> " One of the basis of our zero budgeting process is that it takes into account this particular issue because everyone will be working towards a particular policy direction and we will also be very conscious of how much the institutions are doing in complying with the policy . <p> " Also in the civil service , we are putting mechanisms in place to enhance service delivery ; we are engaging the agencies into an atmosphere where everyone can make an input on what they think should and should not be done . <p> " This is one of the ways we want to increase participation and we have asked the permanent secretaries to do same for the robust process of reforming the public institutions , " he explained . <p> Continuing , Osinbajo said government was trying to address fiscal indiscipline through the introduction of the zero budgeting system from 2016 . <p> " The zero-based budget is a system that requires every agency to justify what its actual costs are . So every agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget , rather than the incremental budgetary system -- you start at zero and justify your new budget . <p> " That way we believe we will be able to cut costs and easily align policies with the budget . People are working round the clock to make sure we are able to present the budget in good time ; it 's a rigorous process , but we think that the process is necessary if we are going to be able to rationalise costs , " he said . <p> The vice-president pointed out that creating an atmosphere where corruption is stemmed would require the whole process of strict observance of the code of ethics and elimination of conflicts of interest , adding : " These are some of the discussions that we will be having with the ministers at a retreat once the ministers have been sworn in . <p> " The issues will revolve around issues on the code of ethics , around transparency , accountability and what the government intends to do in ensuring that each public official is held to account and transparent in their conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of these issues are being developed daily and we are working very closely with the institutions in order to not only access their current needs , but get a sense of how the reforms will go . " <p> Also speaking on the enforcement of the TSA , the vice-president said : " This is not a new policy , but the difference is that it is being implemented by the current administration . <p> " The whole point of the TSA policy does not mean that all revenue must always remain with the CBN . But what happened in the past was that many revenue-generating agencies kept their own accounts and kept many accounts unknown to government . <p> " For instance , an agency like the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) was running several accounts many of them not even known to the government , so as it were , there were two parallel systems of revenue and expenditure : one which is the budget appropriated properly . <p> " And so you will find situations where NNPC was spending and in many cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . <p> " That essentially gave rise to huge discussions . So it was possible for those managing the economy not to quite understand what was going on , on the one hand , which is what gave rise to the TSA policy and under this policy all government revenues must come through the central bank . <p> " After that any agency that needs to spend money would do so after proper appropriation . Every expenditure must be based on a budget duly presented to the National Assembly . " <p> In her contribution during the round-table discussion , a former Minister of Education , Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili , suggested a carrot-and-stick approach , stating that reforming the public sector to be competitive would require a system of incentives and sanctions where applicable , as well as increasing productivity levels . <p> She said the pressure for change had assumed a universal dimension , which required the leadership of government pushing everybody in the direction of reform . <p> In a related development , the Secretary to the Government of the Federation ( SGF ) , Mr. Babachir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submit their procurement records for 2014 to the Bureau of Public Procurement ( BPP ) within two weeks or risk being sanctioned . <p> The SGF gave the directive in Abuja while declaring a one-day interactive session on public procurement with directorate cadre procurement officers of federal ministries organised by BPP . <p> Represented by the Director , Economic Policy Analysis , Office of the SGF , Dr. Ijeoma Unaogu , Lawal said punitive measures for non-compliance with the directive would include suspension of officers responsible for procurement or disposal proceeding in issue ; replacement of the head or any of the members of the procuring or disposal unit of any entity or the chairperson of the tenders ' board as the case may be ; and disciplining the accounting officer of any procuring entity and temporary transfer of the procuring and disposal function of a procuring and disposing entity to a third party procurement agency or consultant . <p> The SGF stated that Nigeria was one of the few countries whose procurement regulatory frameworks and legislation is patterned after the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption ( UNCAC ) , the country 's fight against corruption was statutorily expected to shift from corrective to preventive measures . <p> " This will involve ensuring strict compliance with extant regulations and guidelines on public procurement . <p> " For avoidance of doubt , this administration strictly upholds the rule of law and as such , submission of procurement records and all other statutory requirements of the Procurement Act shall be enforced by this government . <p> " To this end , I hereby direct all MDAs to collate and submit their procurement records for 2014 to the BPP on or before Monday , the 26th of October , 2015 , " he said . <p> In a statement by the BPP spokesperson , Odemwingie Thomas , the SGF further directed the procurement agency to submit the list of ministries which fail to comply with the directive to his office " for appropriate sanctions " . <p> The SGF welcomed efforts of the BPP to collaborate with state governments in order to domesticate the Procurement Act in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the federal level transcend to the sub-national level . <p> He said : " Government will take more than a passing interest in the National Public Procurement Forum in which the bureau is already taking the lead .

@@1941238 <h> Gamaliel Onosode , One of Life 's Finest Men <p> Mudiaga Ofuoku Please close your eyes and try conjuring an image of Gamaliel Onosode . Now open them and flesh out what you just saw . Most likely , here 's the vision that comes to mind when Onosode , who died last week at the age of 82 , darts across the mind . The neat , exquisite parting in the center of his crew cut . The mingy moustache . The thin lips . The glinting eyes from behind those plain prescription glasses . And then that mellifluous voice along which came those sweet-sounding words like an ever-flowing stream . Onosode was a conscientious grammarian and a man of great learning . At the University College , Ibadan , where he studied classics , he topped his class in Latin and Greek . But it was economics , not classical learning , that drew Onosode deep into its domain . And there he remained and wrought wonders , leaving his footprints on the sands of time as he took his bow and exited the stage . <p> Perhaps , the most remarkable description of Onosode I ever heard while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the Rev. P.E . Ofuoku , my uncle and one of the greatest orators and thinkers that ever walked the earth and who would later give his daughter to Onosode 's nephew in marriage . Of Onosode , my late uncle said : " A company in death throes suddenly springs to its feet , dusts itself , and thrives with life again almost as soon as Onosode arrives . " <p> The deluge of condolences and tributes that greeted Onosode 's death echoed those telling words . Reading the newspapers , you saw reporters and sympathizers repeatedly applying such words as " technocratic guru " , " boardroom wizard " , " corporate czar " , et cetera , et cetera . From President Muhammadu Buhari , the current Nigerian president , to Goodluck Jonathan , his predecessor , to just about every member of the Nigerian political and corporate elite , the sense of loss was heart-felt and deep . " An Iroko in the corporate world has fallen , " said Chief Emeka Anyaoku , former Commonwealth secretary-general . Akinwunmi Ambode , the Lagos State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master in his field . He will be remembered for the dexterity he brought to bear when he served as chairman and board member of several multinational companies . " <p> Now all of that was fitting and necessary , and Onosode would have been humbled by it all . However , I am also very certain that he would have been infinitely more gratified to learn , were it possible for the dead to know what 's happening after they have departed from among us , of what the world is now saying about his virtuous character and his enduring moral imagination . In truth , I have been impressed by the glowing homage which sympathizers have paid to his rare sense of probity and integrity . <p> Onosode 's vision of life which was deeply rooted in his impeccably great character was what actually defined his life 's goals and created his astonishing achievements for which we mourn him almost inconsolably today . The next question we ought to ask is , how did Onosode manage to be such a unique figure in our society ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find an answer to that question . The son of a Baptist minister , the young Onosode was raised by parents who were strict disciplinarians . " My father was tough , my mother was tough . We were brought up to render service cheerfully as part of our contribution to the well-being of the family , " he told The Guardian newspaper in 2003 . But that was not all . " Discipline and the fear of God , as expressed through faith in Christ " , he said , laid the foundation for , and sustained , his work . " When I professed the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and savior , I did it on my prompting . My father did not say to me , now you have grown up and next Sunday you have to go forward and profess , neither did my mum , " Onosode further said . <p> Despite his gifts and his great learning , and despite everything else for which he became such a huge object of national admiration while alive , Onosode was the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great wealth but he maintained a modest lifestyle and lived all his life in the same home in Adelabu Street , Surulere , a middle-class community in Lagos . And although he had been awarded many honorary doctorate degrees by reputable universities , he insisted on the simple title of " Mr " coming before his name . Blessed with so much wealth still , Onosode could have acquired all the chieftaincy titles in the world had he so desired , yet he disdained such garish titular appurtenances . <p> Growing up , some of us back in Eku wanted badly to be Onosode , in style especially . Big Onos , a childhood friend , and I had each a parting in the center of our low haircuts we called " Onosode Report . " Onosode hailed from Ekiugbo , Ughelli , in Delta State . But he had maternal roots in Eku in the same state . His late father was the first chaplain of Eku Baptist Hospital , and Onosode said so to a large gathering of guests sometime in 1983 at a Development Funds event held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him after reading so much about him in the newspapers . On that occasion , Onosode demonstrated his gift of the garb and had almost everyone fawning on him with adulation afterwards . A couple of days later , my father called me and said he just wanted to inform me that Onosode was once a stammerer . He knew why he had to tell me that . I stared at him wordlessly for minutes on end . My father never lied and he resented lies from his children , so I believed him . <p> The story of Onosode is a parable , a metaphor for Nigeria to learn abundantly from . He overcame whatever obstacles fate and the world threw his way to become not only one of the most gifted public speakers we ever knew , but also one of the most successful public figures in all of Nigerian history . If there was ever one thing he did not succeed in accomplishing , it was becoming the president of the country . He tried twice , and vainly so . <p> It is permissible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamaliel Oforitsenere Onosode , in so far as it relates to Nigeria , is both an honor to , and an indictment of , the country . An honor because rarely , if ever , do countries get blessed with such exemplary men of honor and character as this man . Onosode was a beacon of celestial light that shone brilliantly to banish the pall of darkness enveloping our nation . An indictment because how many Onosodes do we have in our midst today ? How does it happen that men like him ca n't even successfully aspire to lead this nation ? The simple and candid answer is that they can not because the system is rigged in favor of charlatans and knaves . It is a sad day . Yet , we thank God for bringing Onosode our way . And much as we 're grief-stricken by his departure , we celebrate him still . Onosode deserves nothing less .

Instead of protecting me , the survivor , who escaped death by a whisker , and by the very special grace of God , he is sadly and disgracefully trying to rewrite the script to make me , as he said , his " principal suspect " . <p> His " principal suspect " should be Halilu Akilu , who called Dele 's house about three times consecutively Saturday before the Sunday bombing and spoke to Funmilayo , Dele 's wife , to ask for description of and direction to Dele 's house in Ikeja . <p> On the Sunday of the bomb blast Dele had spoken to Akilu from his upstairs bedroom before coming down to have breakfast with me to tell him that he heard he had called him on Saturday and asked why . The letter bomb was delivered to the house within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Akilu . So who should be Omeben 's " principal suspect " then ? Should it be me who was bombed with Dele ? Or Akilu ? <p> Omeben , said , and I quote : " Soyinka knew what was coming and he left the room to hide behind the wall . " What a blatant lie ? This man , who I understand is now a pastor , has no fear of God in him at all , making such bold erroneous statement like that on an issue of such sensitivity and accusing me , an innocent man -- a victim and survivor of the bomb blast . He should ask God for forgiveness ! In this interview he granted the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN ) to coincide with this year 's anniversary of the bomb blast , it is " behind the wall " that Omeben said I hid myself . In his interview with The Sun Newspaper in 2012 he said I ran to the toilet before the bomb exploded . You can see the inconsistency in his wild allegations . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew and should still know the facts of what happened on that day gave Omeben powerful platform in mainstream media outlets in Nigerian to voice out this falsehood -- and without calling me ( a member of the Nigerian media family ) to at least hear my own story . Only The Nation newspaper did , and I doff my hat for them and their professionalism . I am so disappointed particularly with the News Agency of Nigeria , the original vehicle of Omeben 's allegations , that it allowed itself -- such an important national institution -- to be used by Omeben to peddle such falsehood . As a veteran journalist myself , I am ashamed of NAN and those other newspapers who published that story without doing the professional thing of calling me to cross check the veracity of Omeben 's claims and allegations . <p> So let me let Omeben know again -- if he does not know already , and so that he does not keep repeating these erroneous allegations again when the anniversary comes up again next year , that Dele and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Billy delivered the letter bomb to his father . It is very important here to remember that some unidentified people , who gave it to the security man at the gate , delivered the parcel bomb to Dele 's house . The security man , while coming inside the compound with the parcel saw Billy ( Dele 's son ) on the way and gave it to him . When Billy came to the study and delivered the parcel to his father , Dele looked at it and handed it over to me . I looked at it and was able to vividly see the inscription on the padded envelop and handed it back to him . He received it back from me , moved his recycling chair back slightly to face the window on his left , he held the envelope with both hands , and tried to tear it through the top left-hand corner . He had not really opened it up , if he did it was only very slightly . And boom ! ! The bomb exploded ! A big ball of fire occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the envelope facing the iron-barred window blew up that window . The side facing Dele exploded on his chest and stomach . And the force that came out from the bottom of the envelope blew up his upper legs and badly affected lower part of his body . He did not die immediately . He died in the hospital . <p> Now , you see the vivid description I have just given you -- 29 years after the gory incident . If I ran into the toilet or hid myself behind the wall before the bomb exploded like our Mr Omeben will like the world , and particularly Nigerians , to believe , and as he is trying hard , very hard , to label me as the suspect , how would I have been able to know all this , and give this graphic description . That partly was what the Oputa Panel missed when it investigated this matter because they did not see it necessary at that time to invite me to give evidence and I was not invited . <p> So , Mr Omeben should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not -- run away to toilet or hid behind a wall . I sat on my own chair right in front of Dele . Only the strong mahogany L-shaped desk on which we were eating our breakfast divided us . So I was literarily inches away from him . The huge desk must have mobbed the force of the blast that would have done the damage on me up . But the force was so powerful and so powerful enough to still lift me off my chair . The chair itself collapsed . I was thrown on the floor by the exit door . I was momentarily unconscious . But regained consciousness , flung my spectacles off my face , and staggered out of the room . Yes , I received no cut on my body , but my nightgown was spattered with blood -- Dele 's blood -- and I had burns on my forehead . And I smelt of burns . <p> I thank God for spearing my life . I could have been killed on that day . My survival was a Biblical Miracle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What of if I was the one that opened it ? And I could easily have opened it myself . But I gave it back to Dele . That 's why I believe my survival was the work of God . My own time was not up yet . <p> What other allegation did Omeben level against me ? He said , " Up till today Soyinka never appeared before the police . " Again , how can he be that ignorant ? This is a blatant lie . And as a senior police officer , especially one who claims to be investigating this important incident , he should have known that I gave statements not once but twice to the same Nigerian Police he represents before I eventually left Nigeria . The first one was at the hospital where I was admitted -- Dele 's body was next door to me . That interrogation by a senior police officer whose name I can not recall took place on the spot when the incident was still fresh . It was inside the hospital . Dele Olojede was beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dele Olojede will recall that as questions were asked I could not hear anything . My both ears were solidly blocked . That was a serious effect of the blast . Then it was confirmed there at the hospital by the ear specialists that my ears were perforated . And this was also confirmed when I got back to the UK after the incident . For about five years after the bomb blast I had to endure continuous noise , humming , nonstop in my both ears . It was very irritating , but there was nothing I could do about it until it improved over the years and stopped . And even up till today , 29 years after , I still carry the effect of the bomb blast in my ears because I can hear better on the right ear while my left ear , which was nearer to the blast is still weak . But who am I to complain about not hearing well , when it could have been worse and I could have lost everything completely , including my life . <p> The second statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was made at the premises of Newswatch in Oregun Road in Lagos in the presence of the eminent lawyer Chief Gani Fawehinmi . I do n't know why Omeben did not know about this and he is accusing me wrongly . The statement I made , and the ones made by Funmilayo ( Dele 's wife ) and Billy , I believe , is now in public domain . Chief Gani Fawehinmi must have published them in the series of books he published on this subject before he died . So I do n't understand why Omeben should tell Nigerians such a blatant lies . That is wickedness . He does not fear God at all . Thank God I am alive and I can respond to him . Can you imagine if I had died with Dele , Omeben and cohorts would have succeeded in putting cotton wool on the faces of Nigerians and sold a different story completely to them to exonerate those who did it . He said again " I have enough evidence to quiz Soyinka now " . Well , Nigerians should help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough evidence " he should do us a big favour in Nigeria by releasing them to the public so that Nigerians can truly know who bombed us , Dele and I , on that day . <p> Again , Omeben said : " They started to insinuate that the assassination was masterminded by Babangida , Akilu etc . They said that Akilu ought to have been investigated . " Who else could have had the expertise to assemble a letter bomb in 1986 Nigeria if not the military ? He did not want to investigate Akilu who was calling Dele 's house frantically on Saturday and who was the last person Dele spoke to on telephone on that Sunday and the bomb was delivered into the house minutes after . He does n't want to investigate Akilu but it is convenient to want to investigate Soyinka the victim and survivor of the bomb blast . Oh , what an investigator ? <p> Lastly , I did not run away from Nigeria as he also claimed . I was in Nigeria throughout the controversies . My family was in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our home in London and handed them airline tickets to come immediately to Nigeria and join me . We were all in Nigeria throughout . My wife attended Dele 's burial with me at his village near Auchi in Edo State . My pictures with my wife beside me were spread on the pages on national newspapers the following morning after the burial -- with my ears still covered with cotton wool . Mr Omeben his pretending he did not know all this and still saying " Soyinka ran away to London " . I eventually left Nigeria shortly after Dele 's burial , which , if my memory services me right , was about two months after the bombing . And we did not have to leave or " ran away " through the famous " Nadeco Route " . My wife and I , with our two little children , left through the Murtala Mohammed airport in Lagos and no one stopped us from taking the British Caledonian flight to London . Members of our family , Newswatch editors and friends escorted us to the airport . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope with these comments I have made Nigerian people will come to know Chris Omeben for who he truly is -- certainly not an investigator as he claims to be but an errand boy and mischief maker , representing the interests of his " Ogas at the Top " , the real culprits who sent us the letter bomb . He knows who the real suspects are . Nigerians know who the real suspects are . Certainly not me -- Soyinka ! He should beam his searchlight on Akilu and Togun and Babangida.

@@1946230 Law of Holes <p> As usual , Olusegun Adeniyi 's piece titled " Sanusi and The First Law of Holes " is an interesting read . But I disagree with him on naira devaluation . The fundamental question I would like to ask Segun is : what exactly is the true market value of the naira in view of our depleted reserve ? Will another downward adjustment by the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) suffice considering that the naira has been devalued by almost 20 per cent within the last 12 months ? And importantly , will devaluation , without administrative control of foreign exchange market by the CBN , automatically replenish our foreign reserve ? Or do we think that foreign portfolio investment can fill that void ? <p> Truth is , whichever path the CBN decides to take , there are undesirable economic and social outcomes . But I am of the opinion that the option of propping up the value of the naira ( though a short term solution ) will accelerate the misery index less than devaluation . Just imagine the social consequences should a loaf of bread begin to exchange for N5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained foreign exchange market will likely result . <p> It is a difficult situation that we are in , irrespective of the policy choice and the current economic malady is as a result of sub-optimal policies over the years , our attitude of consumerism and share-the-money mentality . I have listened carefully to the arguments and perspectives from proponents and opponents of naira devaluation and foreign exchange control sequel to the CBN 's policy measures to stabilise the naira , partly as a result of low price regime in the global oil trade and dwindling foreign reserves . CBN 's action has sometimes drawn scathing criticism , undeservedly , from some stakeholders . Though , in all fairness , one can not but empathise with genuine dollar users especially those in the real sector of the economy , much so that as an import dependent economy , dollar illiquidity is a key binding constraint to firms that rely on raw material inputs from abroad in the production process . On the other side of the divide are those who are equally convinced the CBN is on the right path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge in oil price in order to prevent the " Zimbabwean currency experience " from replicating itself here in Nigeria . <p> Truth is , there is no easy way out of the prevailing crisis and the policy options available to the CBN to manage the current naira dilemma is only as effective as the level of complementary fiscal policy support it can get . The CBN can either adopt demand management tool , as is presently the case , to curtail foreign exchange demand for non-essential items and administratively prop up naira value or simply beckon on unrestrained market forces to determine naira value . Clearly , whichever option the CBN pursues , there are undesirable outcomes -- threats to going concern status of and low capacity utilisation by local industries , growth deceleration , inflation , unemployment , price and social instability . Crucially though , the fundamental difference(s) between the two policy choices can be situated in their time-relevance , severity of impact and relative capacity to accelerate misery index or worsen social indicators within a short period of time . <p> As an import dependent economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital required to catalyse investment ( key growth challenges facing the economy ) , it makes economic sense , ordinarily , to apply less restriction to foreign exchange demand because of the impact on real sector capacity utilisation and economic growth . The concerns raised by pro-devaluation commentators are real - at present , prices are trending up , the real sector is bleeding , firms are defaulting on and deferring their obligations to foreign suppliers and future outlook is uncertain . But liberalising foreign exchange market would not be the right path to thread , as a short term measure , against the backdrop of declining oil prices , shrinking dollar revenue and depleted reserves . The economic and social consequences of a liberalised foreign exchange regime at this inauspicious time are very hard to imagine - the severity is likely to be much higher . <p> We are often made to understand by proponents of further devaluation that the naira will find its true market value if left for market forces . My concern is , what exactly is the true market value , an indeterminate exchange rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free fall in naira value , imported inflationary pressure , heightened credit risk environment , usurious cost of borrowing , reduced output with adverse effect on our already ailing and inefficient local industries . Pray that a loaf of bread does not exchange for N5,000 ( even a Louis Vuitton or Prada bread should not cost as much ) should the naira be devalued , those clamouring for devaluation will , in equal measure , hold the CBN accountable -- this time around for wrongful implementation of their much vaunted policy . <p> There are also suggestions that if the price of the naira is right , then there would be no shortage of dollars in the market as some analysts are wont to propagate -- this line of thought is flawed and reveals an understanding anchored on an oversimplified market economics . First of all , at the aggregate level , price has minimal role to play in foreign exchange supply in the Nigerian market . The main and less unsustainable source of foreign exchange supply in Nigeria is crude oil revenue - itself a function of international oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pro-devaluation camp is a discernable vocal voice whose argument appear to be driven largely by ideological prejudice and narrow interests . Economics is certainly not an abstraction that is divorced from people -markets must be made to serve people , not the other way round and should not be conceived as an " ethics-free zone " . Market should ring around the common good . A dogmatic ethics-of-the-market or " devalue-we-must " narrative is inimical to the overall interest given the current circumstances , it is an alienating standpoint which Paulo Freire refers to eloquently in his book - Pedagogy of the Oppressed : " we need to say no to neoliberal fatalism that we are witnessing at the end of this century , informed by the ethics of the market , an ethics in which a minority makes most profit against the lives of the majority , a market perspective that believes those who can not compete should die . This is a perverse ethics that , in fact , lacks ethics " . <p> Before I am misconstrued , let me state clearly that the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied -- I am a market adherent . However , that dialectical perspective is not etched in immutability and should always be reconciled with socio-economic space and time . <p> In sum , the current foreign exchange dilemma is a clear case of market failure defined in terms of social sub-optimality which therefore requires some form of administrative guidance . To advocate otherwise is to deny government 's role in maintaining macro-stability . A critical interrogation of the suggested solutions would reveal , arguably , that whilst the impact of a completely liberalised foreign exchange market will be felt almost instantaneously with more severe consequences in the face of depleted reserves , a combination of a responsive foreign exchange control ( a short term shock absorber though ) with fiscal policy support is likely to be more effective in shepherding the economy out of its present morass . Again , it must be said that this is only a short term palliative . <p> In the final analysis , drawing from the wisdom of Friedrich Hegel , " the truth is found neither in the thesis nor the antithesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Therefore , the ongoing discourse should be seen beyond the narrow text of devaluation or otherwise but largely from a broader context of the fierce urgency for structural re-balancing of the economy , a shift away from consumerism and import dependence . The current crisis is an opportunity for us to rethink our overall economic strategy . In the interim , government should urgently curtail frivolous expenditure , identify and block revenue leakages , improve tax compliance environment , reassess subsidy policy in combination with stimulus package for targeted key sectors and the sooner the better we realise that crude oil is not the engine of any competitive economy , oil is only a lubricant . <p> I pretty much doubt if Professor Charles Soludo and Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi II , both pragmatic economists , former governors of the CBN and architects of major banking reforms in Nigeria , would have acted differently if faced with the same situation as CBN governors , not in their private capacities . Therefore , the scathing attack on the CBN can hardly be justified . <p> Please leave your comment below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll also keep you updated by email whenever someone else comments on this page .

@@1949231 <h> Diezani : No longer a country of merciful people <p> An indisputable attribute of Nigeria as a nation is its highly religious nature . The country ranks easily as one of the most religious nations in the world , if not outright the most religious . Every community from Lagos to Maiduguri and Sokoto to Port Harcourt boasts religious centres that brim with enthusiastic worshippers , particularly on Fridays and Sundays , the two days of the week set aside by the Muslim and Christian faithful for spiritual edification . <p> In a survey tagged ' What the World Thinks of God ' , conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) in 2004 , Nigeria stood out as the only country where 100 per cent of the participants said they believe in God . The result of the survey held in 10 countries ( US , UK , Israel , India , South Korea , Indonesia , Nigeria , Mexico and Lebanon ) also showed a country like South Korea with just about 7 per cent of its population declaring that they believe in God . Nigeria , according to the said survey which involved about 1,000 participants in each country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 90 per cent of her populations are willing to die for their religious convictions . More than 91 per cent of the people interviewed said they regularly attend religious services while 95 per cent of them said they pray regularly . <p> It therefore came as no surprise thatNigeria was rated in a 2010 Gallup global poll as having the " happiest people on earth " . The poll of 64,000 people from 53 countries around the world found Nigerians to be the most optimistic in the world in their outlook for 2011 . Earlier in 2003 , a study of more than 65 countries published in the UK 's New Scientist magazine had also suggested that the happiest people in the world live in Nigeria . Of course , there is no denying the fact that an organic relationship exists between faith and happiness . Both Islam and Christianity , Nigeria 's two most popular religions , preach love , tolerance , forgiveness and the will to accept fortune and misfortune with equanimity . The people stick stoically to the scriptural injunction that they should rejoice in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are ripping them off . <p> But all that seems to be changing if the result of a recent survey conducted by Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( SDSN ) , an initiative under the United Nations is anything to go by . According to the report , from its first position about a decade ago , Nigeria now ranks a distant 78th on the list of world 's happiest nations . The new list was topped by Switzerland , closely followed by Iceland , Denmark , Norway and Canada . Even in Africa , Nigeria ranks second behind Algeria , which ranks 68th in the world . The import of this is that in the last decade or so , Nigerians have transformed significantly from happy people to a sad and cynical ones . <p> There is no better way to appreciate the foregoing than the way Nigerians have reacted to the reported sickness of the immediate past Minister of Petroleum Resources , Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke . Since the news of her battle with breast cancer in a London hospital broke sometime in June , majority of the comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ways of a people that turn the other cheek in the face of fragrant assault . It is no longer a nation of people who are so quick to hand matters over to God in obvious or perceived cases of rip-off . Before now , the reaction of the average Nigerian to the pictures of grossly emaciated Diezani posted on the social media was that of empathy . Seeing the horrible pictures , they would erase her real or perceived misdeeds from their memories and launch into prayers for her quick recovery . That , surprisingly , has not been the case . <p> As one of the closest ministers to former President Goodluck Jonathan , Alison-Madueke was at the centre of a controversy over more than $20 billion oil revenues the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) allegedly failed to deposit at the Central Bank of Nigeria . Although the ex-minister has refuted the allegation , not many Nigerians appear convinced that she is as clean as a hound 's tooth like she would want the world to believe in an interview she recently granted The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , many Nigerian commentators on the social media claimed that the frail and near-bald pictures that accompanied the interview were forged or doctored to engender public sympathy for the once powerful minister . <p> Most of the comments on Diezani 's purported sickness reveal how much our sense of sympathy as a people has waned on account of the suspicious acts of many of our leaders . So much so that we would now not spare a thought for them if they find themselves in the same condition as the former Minister of Petroleum . " When the going was good , she was proud , arrogant and unaccountable to anyone except Jonathan , " said one commentator . " She thought too much of herself and accorded royal treatment to her flesh . Even first class flying was beneath her so she had to fly in chartered aircraft . Now that she is down , she has all the time to reflect on her misdeeds , make peace with God and prepare for eternity . Dizzy babe , you had it all at the expense of your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " <p> Another commentator said : " If she likes , let her lose all her teeth and toe nails . She should come and account for our money . Chikena ! After all , given her age , she may well look like she does in the picture without makeup and Brazilian hair . " <p> Another wrote : " For a patient undergoing breast cancer treatment , Diezani was looking quite good . I have seen such patients before . After chemotherapy and radiotherapy , the hair falls off . So do finger nails and toe nails . But within a year , they all grow back and the patient makes a marvelous recovery . " <p> Yet another said : " Please tell that to the marines ... We all pray that Diezani gets well very soon so that she can return all the looted funds . Cancer or no cancer , Nigerians want their money back . Only God knows how many Nigerians die from preventable illnesses due to leeches that siphoned our billions overseas .
