@@2980237 <h> Preview : Evolve <p> In the time since I first played Evolve -- nearly a year ago -- to today , there have been some big changes . First of all , there were only four hunters and one monster when I played . Back in my day we never had no fancy Krakens , Wraiths or Behemoths . We had Goliath and that 's all we needed . You kids and your new fandangled monsters and hunters ! Get off my lawn ! <p> But seriously , that 's all I needed . My initial impressions still stand ; I remember playing forfive or six hours with only one map and 5 characters to choose from and not once losing interest of suffering from boredom . Recently , I had the opportunity to spend another five hours with Evolve , only this time there were twelve hunters and three monsters . While three monsters ( or four if you include Behemoth ) may not sound like many , no two games of Evolve I 've played have ever been alike . Of course , the systems , gameplay mechanics and general atmosphere remain the same , but nothing ever happens the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's pure , unadulterated chaos . <p> This seems to be a strength for developer Turtle Rock . Just take a look at Left 4 Dead . With only four playable characters and 16 maps , they were able to wring out an almost unlimited number of scenarios , moments and pure fun . Evolve runs with this notion and goes one step further . It 's much more free-form , more improvisational , far less structured and in turn ( potentially ) a hell of a lot more chaotic . Whereas in L4D , players knew they had to get from point to point , survive intermittent waves of infected and the occasional special infected , the objectives in Evolve are less restrictive . <p> Standard Hunt matches see the hunters trying to kill the monster and vice versa . Upon staging up to level 3 the monster is given an objective , but can still emerge victorious by simply eating all of the hunters . As the monster stages up the game slowly reverses itself , becoming a case of the hunter(s) becoming the hunted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to immediately go on the offensive in their ( relatively ) weak Stage 1 form or choose to bide their time , eating , growing and evolving before making their move . Or they can do a combination of both , or something else entirely . That 's the beauty of Evolve ; it lets players play however they see fit . <p> While playing at the recent preview event a representative from 2K ( who has no doubt spent a huge number of hours with Evolve ) boasted that they were undefeated as the Kraken . Ten seconds into our first match against them and we ( the hunters ) understood why . This Kraken did not run and hide and try to stage up . It was on us the second we hit the ground . We were pummelled from above by electricity , lightning and wave after wave of damage . It was the hunters who had to flee rather than the small Stage 1 monster . Its gameplay opportunities like this that truly demonstrates the emergent nature of Evolve . Anything can and will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . <p> New modes , hunters and monsters were available to play ; those who played the beta on Xbox One had the chance to see those in action in Evolve 's campaign-esque Evacuation mode . Evacuation 's basic premise is that the colonists of Shear are being murdered and eaten in droves by some strange mega fauna and it 's up to the hunters to rescue as many as they can . Evacuation always begins with Hunt mode and finishes with Defend . It also includes Nest and Rescue on a map by map basis . After the first Hunt match , players are given two maps options to vote for and they will be either Hunt , Nest or Rescue . <p> Nest populates the map with monster eggs . The hunters win by destroying all of the eggs while the monster wins by killing the hunters . Simple enough , however if the monster finds an egg it can hatch it and unleash a Stage 1 Goliath that goes straight for the hunters . The monster can only hatch one Goliath at a time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do some serious damage to the hunters rather quickly . Rescue is almost the reverse of Nest . Downed colonists are scattered across the map and the hunters need to revive them and rescue them by getting them to a drop zone uneaten . The monster has to kill the colonists . Whoever saves or kills the most wins the match . <p> After playing through four maps and matches the game shifts to Defend . Here the monster player starts at Stage 3 and must destroy three power generators in sequence to win while the hunters simply have to survive a countdown . The monster is accompanied by two regularly respawning Stage 1 Goliaths and while the hunters can put up a brave fight every match I played saw the monster getting through to the final generator . It becomes the ultimate showdown as the hunters also have unlimited respawns and the monster can only win by destroying the generator . Evolve is never more tense than in the final stages of Defend . What ups the ante even further are the huge number of variables that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one match of Rescue the opening cinematic showed a captured Wraith . Upon winning the match as the monster the Wraith was set free and in the next match the hunters had to contend with a player controlled monster and a marauding Wraith . This is but one of 800,000 potential variables , furthering the principle that in Evolve , nothing is certain . <p> Way back in February 2014 when I first played Evolve and spoke to the team at Turtle Rock , balance was a big thing and very important to the team , but most of all importantly , required for the game to play properly and fairly . They told me that balance was the " Turtle Rock ' X factor ' . We 've been working on the game now for three years and it took that long to get the balance right . It is balanced at any stage . " In February last year Evolve felt " balanced on a knife edge " as I described it at the time . A year later , the addition of the new hunters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem as perfect as it once did . Nest and Rescue modes both feel unfairly weighted towards a win for the hunters . In the matches I played , the monster never even came close to a win . The inverse is true of Defend . Even though the hunters can infinitely respawn , it was always the monster who emerged victorious in the end . <p> Maggie the Trapper is a prime example of this new imbalance . I personally love Daisy as a concept and a character , but functionally she 's a nightmare for monster players . It becomes far too easy for the hunters to quickly locate the monster by following Daisy , who will always know where it is . Having Maggie as the default Trapper is a mistake and could potentially put newbie monster players off with the ease they 're able to be located and killed . On the flipside , while the Wraith is undeniably well designed , visually arresting and mechanically interesting she is -- to use an internet term -- OP AS FUCK . While I was n't able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very powerful and very hard to defeat , so let 's hope some serious testing is carried out before it 's added to the game . I 'm confident Turtle Rock will continue to nail down the balance with tweaks and updates once the game is released , but it 's a shame that what was once perfect is now not so . <p> That brings me to my largest overall concern with Evolve . Whenever I have played ( aside from the beta ) I 've been in a room with four other players . It 's fantastic . The old school LAN party vibe totally works in Evolve 's favour . Being able to stick it to your mates after a win as the monster or mock the monster player after you 've destroyed them as a team is a huge part of Evolve 's appeal . Playing online just does n't have the same flavour . It 's still the same game , but part of what makes playing it so much fun is dead when you 're in a room on your own . Playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'd had when I was playing " couch co-op " style . I 'm sure many players wo n't have a problem with playing solely online , but as someone who 's not really into MP at the best of times I know that unless I 'm playing locally , Evolve 's appeal ( for me ) is limited . <p> Turtle Rock undeniably has a hit on their hand with Evolve . It 's a brilliant premise , dressed up inside a gritty sci-fi suit ( the best kind of sci-fi ) and it 's exclusive to current-gen . That in and of itself is a win in my book . It 's obvious from spending time with the guys from Turtle Rock that Evolve is a labour of love and they truly believe in what they 've created . They 're going to support the hell out of this thing and the hardcore who keep playing long after launch are going to be well rewarded for their dedication . <p> Evolve will be available for PC , PS4 and Xbox One 10 February . <p> Stevivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Evolve . Opinions are the writer 's own . <h> Leo Stevenson <p> I 've been playing games for the past 25 years and have been writing for almost as long .

@@2983230 <h> How to grow chillies <p> This is the time of year for vegetables that like it hot and when it comes to heat , chillies love to both give and take , says Mat Pember . <p> The final throes of the warm season bring out the true lovers of heat , and the chilli is a summer pro . Chillies derive their spice from capsaicinoids and the intensity is measured by Scoville heat units ( SHU ) , but no one pays too much attention to the specific ratings . There are mild ones , hot ones , those that tingle the back of your eyeballs , and those that seem to threaten your survival and could send you to an asylum . <p> Chillies demand a hot , sun-drenched space , preferably up against a north-facing wall to capture extra warmth . But do n't let their infatuation with heat lead you to neglect their basic needs ; like any other plant they require free-draining soil and adequate watering to cope with the baking . <p> Enrich the soil with compost and chook-manure pellets before planting and space the seedlings 20 to 30 centimetres apart . Given the time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily if conditions are hot ( see below ) . It also pays to mulch immediately after planting , so apply sugar cane , pea straw or lucerne hay to a depth of two to five centimetres to help reduce evaporation by locking in moisture . Ensure you keep the mulch away from the stem of the seedlings as they are prone to stem rot . <p> If your patch is exposed to the hot summer winds , strong gusts can throw the plants about and play havoc with their root systems . It 's therefore worthwhile staking the plants or installing a windbreak . This could be as complicated as building a small structure or as simple as leaving the double-pram parked wind side of the plants . <p> Once the chillies are settled - three to four weeks after planting - thin out the seedlings to a spacing of 40 to 60 centimetres and cut back the frequency of the water , but increase the volume . <p> A deeper soaking of the patch will send the roots in search of these reserves and form a stronger plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep - by applying water directly to the root zone and penetrating deep into the soil . And when you 're on holiday , they 're much more reliable than your teenagers or busy neighbours . <p> After a couple of months , your plants should be sprouting little flowers that develop into little bullets of spice . Those well versed in chilli production believe the hot ones shoot skyward in search of sun to intensify their heat , but do n't be fooled by those that hang . The birdseye , for example , chases the sun , but according to Scoville rates only 100,000 to 250,000 SHU . The bhut jolokia , meanwhile , comes in at 1,041,427 . This chilli does not point skywards . <p> As the first flowers appear , apply liquid potash to help promote the forming of the fruit and production of more flowers . Green chillies form quickly , but ripening may take another month or more . Earlier in the season , ripening occurs relatively quickly and then begins to slow down as the weather cools into autumn . <p> Pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you the number of times I 've hastily gone to harvest them but dislodged an entire branch with multiple flowers hanging onto it . Sadly , these guys will never realise their potential . <p> In the right position a chilli plant can survive the cooler months and still hold fruit - but they 'll take an eternity to ripen . Rather than let the plant suffer like this , cut it back to a bare skeleton to hibernate over winter . When warmer temperatures return , the plant will shoot new growth and away we go again . <p> One-minute skills : hot-day watering February is a month for heatwaves , so how should you handle watering your plants when they 're wilting and barely surviving ? Well , the first thing to do is to keep a cool head . As much as it might seems like the logical thing to do , refrain from submerging your patch in a torrent of water .

Leaving the plant 's leaf matter wet and sitting under direct sunlight is akin to giving it a drink and then setting it on fire .

This is where it 's best used and where plants need water most . To avoid any catastrophes , you could wait until the sun has subsided , however , this should not change you strategy .

Photo : Michele Mossop <p> The positives of pet ownership have been extensively chronicled . People who live with a dog or cat , multiple studies have confirmed , are generally happier and less stressed than those who do not . <p> Less well publicised , however , although just as well established , are the myriad ways in which Fido or Tiddles can kill you . <p> This January , newspapers in the American city of Cleveland ran prominent stories warning local deer hunters to ensure they thoroughly cooked their kills before enjoying a dinner of wild-caught venison . <p> The deer , according to an Ohio State University study , came into frequent contact with suburban cats , and as a result were carrying high levels of a parasite that could also infect humans with rather unpleasant results . <p> Advertisement <p> Meanwhile , on January 19 , further south in Santa Fe , New Mexico 's Department of Health issued a warning to residents in certain suburbs . The warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a handful of wandering dogs and cats infected with plague . <p> Just as serious -- if not quite as medieval -- was a warning to dog owners issued by the NSW Department of Primary Industries last winter after four cases of mutts coming down with a nasty condition called brucellosis . Originally a pig disease , brucellosis can easily transmit from dogs to people , causing fever , headache and occasionally death . <p> " The benefits of pet ownership come with obligations , " wrote Dutch veterinary scientist Dr Frans van Knapen this month , in a major new book that surveys expert opinion on human diseases caused by animals . <p> In its chapters on domestic pets , the book -- Zoonosis : Infections Affecting Humans and Animals -- lists a chilling selection of unpleasant illnesses people can pick up from cats and dogs . These include a wide range of gut-nasties , staphylococcus , cryptosporidium , leptospirosis , various types of worm and a newly discovered bug closely related to diphtheria . <p> All of which may well give pet owners pause for thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year seek medical attention for cat bites , it is by no means necessary to be attacked by an animal in order to catch a nasty disease from them . Overwhelmingly , common pet-derived diseases -- such as the similar sounding , but quite different , toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis -- arise as a result of simply patting , stroking or cuddling the family pet . <p> Toxocariasis is a disease caused by roundworm . The worms are very common in both dogs and cats . Humans pick them up by inhaling or swallowing their tiny eggs , which abound in pet fur and poo . <p> The results of roundworm infection in humans vary widely , ranging from mild tummy troubles to organ failure and brain damage . The route by which this happens is stuff of pure nightmare , and will ensure that you never look at your faithful companion in quite the same way ever again . <p> Roundworm larvae , animal disease specialist Dr Andreas Sing writes in the new book , " may migrate through the human body and finally get encysted for months or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue they happen to reach . " <p> A 2014 review of the disease , by Monash University epidemiologist Associate Professor Karin Leder , concluded that " Human toxocariasis is one of the most widespread and economically important animal diseases worldwide , yet there is a relative scarcity of public awareness worldwide of this important infection . " <p> Other studies have estimated that as many as two billion people carry the parasite -- which means poodles and persians have a lot to answer for . Professor Leder 's review concluded that the overwhelming burden of the disease fell on people in poorer societies . Contacted by The Age , Fairfax Media , she said there were only " a few " cases diagnosed in Australia . <p> The similarly named toxoplasmosis , however , is a very different story . Caused by a type of single-celled organism called a protozoan , " toxo " , as it 's often nicknamed , infects up to 50 per cent of the world 's population -- including an estimated eight million Australians . While the bug can be picked up through eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia the main route of infection is , overwhelmingly , through cats . <p> In most instances , infection is harmless and unnoticed . Sometimes , however , it can produce significant organ damage -- and even behavioral change . Pioneering work a few years ago by Sydney-based infectious disease expert Dr Nicky Boulter found that in a percentage of cases toxo infection in human brains induces moroseness in men and promiscuity in women . <p> Boulter is no longer in the field , and today Australia 's leading researcher is Tasmanian scientist Bronwyn Fancourt . Last year Ms Fancourt published a startling piece of work that tied population decline in some Tasmanian marsupial populations to the fact that they were fatally infected with toxoplasmosis picked up from the island 's cats . <p> Speaking to Fairfax Media she said toxoplasmosis remained a significant health threat to both native wildlife and Tasmanian householders . <p> " If a domestic cat goes outside and hunts mice or rats , it 's very likely to pick up the parasite , " she said . " It will then spread it through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't own a cat . You probably wo n't know if a neighbourhood cat is using your vegetable patch -- or your child 's sandpit -- as a toilet . " <p> People can reduce their risks of infection from most pet diseases through simple measures such as hand-washing and not kissing the dog . For toxo , however , the long-term solution lies squarely in reducing and confining the cat population . <p> " The toxo parasite is one of the most resilient , amazing species that has ever evolved -- it survives in a wide variety of mammals and birds , " said Ms Fancourt . " The cats make for a much easier target . " <p> All of this , of course , perhaps explains why the disease-causing hazards of pet ownership are less widely acknowledged than the stress-relieving benefits . Becoming aware of the former , after all , tends to end the latter .

@@2986230 <h> The truth is , a dog deserves to be on our coat of arms <h> Paul Sheehan <p> It is part of the national narrative that Australia was built on the sheep 's back . But not a single grazing property in this country would have been viable for the first 100 years without the productivity of working dogs . It would be closer to the truth of this nation if it were not an emu on the coat of arms , holding up the shield with a kangaroo , but a border collie or kelpie . <p> Even today , more than 80,000 working dogs are out in Australia 's farmlands , getting the mustering done at remarkably low cost . They will be ready for work today . They do n't need penalty rates . <p> Dogs are so integral to our cultural DNA that they seem to be inserted into every second advertisement on TV . So many households have dogs -- about 40 per cent -- that they appear in ads for products that have nothing to with them . Cars , toilet paper and insurance immediately spring to mind . The list is endless . <p> Advertisers follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal ownership in the world , with two-thirds of Australian households having at least one animal . <p> Advertisement <p> There are more animals in households , 25 million , than there are people , 23.7 million , according to a 2013 survey by the Animal Health Alliance . Average household expenditure on animals is higher than the amount spent on electricity , restaurants , alcohol and public transport . <p> Dogs are king of this category , and to encapsulate why we have not just a bond with them but a debt to the dogs that helped build this country , I offer a passage from a book entitled Eminent Dogs , Dangerous Men ( 1991 ) , by an American writer , Donald McCaig , who is also a sheepdog trainer : <p> " Before I got in the car , I spoke to the judge . She said , ' Yesterday , when that dog of yours seemed to be stopping short on the outrun , he was n't short . He was correct . The sheep were facing him , and if you had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy ' . <p> " Oh . <p> " It was raining pretty hard by the time we hit the interstate . Rain drummed on the roof of the car , and Pip lay on the front seat , his head turned to the door . " <p> " Better luck next time , " I said . <p> " Pip was so mad he would n't look at me . He would n't meet my eyes for three days . " <p> If you 're going to have a dog , you have to be all in . Not neurotically so , not obsessively , but seriously . A dog is a member of the family . It sees itself as an integral part of the unit . <p> When you pack your bags , a dog never knows if you 're ever coming back . When you go out the front door , dogs can only guess if and when you will return . They do guess , and at a certain hour they are usually positioned , waiting , expectant . <p> I would vote for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog I ever met was Clyde , a border collie , like Pip . He won multiple sheep dog trial championships , one of the finest working dogs this country has produced . Clyde was raised and trained by Greg Prince , Australia 's most successful working dog trainer and breeder . <p> Greg and Clyde won their first national championship as a team in 1995 , in dramatic style , when the sheep charged the dog on the bridge obstacle . Clyde did not flinch . He chested the first merino , then " snouted " her -- bit the big ewe on the nose . He lost no points for that . <p> At British trials dogs are not allowed to bite , but in Australia merinos are bigger than European sheep and may not see a dog for weeks . So tougher measures are needed , and allowed , at trials . <p> " An Australian dog is allowed to stand up for itself , " Prince told me . In 1998 , at the national trials , I saw Clyde become the first and only dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queensland and National Championships . I wrote at the time : <p> " Clyde was the most wolf-like of the final eight dogs , but also the most relaxed . Greg likes what he calls " kind dogs " and Clyde was a mixture of kindness and presence . His great strength is his eye , which allows him to keep his distance from the sheep but lift them with his gaze ... " <p> " With the championship on the line , and the sheep immobile outside the final obstacle , Clyde sat down and waited ... Then he pushed them back by simply raising his body . " <p> After Clyde won the championship I walked back to Greg 's camp with him . Clyde was still panting from the effort . He gulped water from his bowl , then boarded the truck for the long drive home to Dubbo . The next morning , the national champion would be ready to work . <p> It is not all rainbows , as every dog owner knows . The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has published data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms , but their productivity is partly offset by a 2008-09 study by the Queensland government in 2008 which estimated that wild dogs cost the state 's grazing industries about $67 million a year . <p> This indicates that , nationwide , wild dogs are causing economic damage in excess of a $1 billion a decade . <p> Feral cats are even worse . They have a devastating effect on the ecology , decimating birdlife and small marsupials . <p> It is not all rainbows because animals are not merely " pets " . They are not just loveable accessories . My wife and I love dogs but do n't have a dog because we travel a lot and work long hours . We take dogs too seriously to be part-time about them .

His second business , the software company Softkey , became successful enough to acquire The Learning Company in 1995 and subsequently adopted its name . Four years later , O'Leary and his business partner Michael Perik sold the company to Mattel for $US4.2 billion . <p> Newly rich O'Leary became a venture capitalist , mutual fund manager , and television personality , serving as one of the original investors on " Dragon 's Den , " the Canadian series that inspired " Shark Tank .

It was the end of the day of my second day of work , and the woman who owned the ice cream parlor said to me , " Listen , before you go , scrape all the gum up between the tiles .

I 'll never forget it . <p> BI : Who were some mentors who inspired you ? <p> KO : My biological father died when he was 36 years old , and my stepfather became a big mentor for me in my early years . I suffered from dyslexia and had a really hard time with reading and maths early on and he helped me through that . <p> And then when I graduated from undergrad with a bachelor 's in psychology and environmental studies he looked at me and said , " You know you do n't have the skillset to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I sold the company and then started a software firm -- a classic out-of-the-basement situation -- which turned into The Learning Company . We sold it for $US4.2 billion . I 've never been able to recreate a deal of that size again , but I 've had many other various successes since in different sectors . <p> I 've never worked for anybody in my life , and I 'm pretty happy with that . <p> BI : Who taught you about money ? <p> KO : My mother .

For 50 years all she had invested in was corporate bonds and given it to large cap stocks , and she beat every index in the world and every portfolio manager . <p> I do n't know how she knew that , or why she felt that way , but her strategy of investing has built a billion dollar mutual fund company -- that 's O'Leary Funds -- because basically what I did is I created a bunch of funds around that philosophy .

You want to salt the earth that your competitor is lurking on . You want to steal their market share .

If you look at the common thread in all of the companies that got financed , regardless of the outcome , you find three common attributes : <p> 1 . They 're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less . <p> 2 . They 're able to explain why they are the right people to execute the business plan . <p> 3 . They know their numbers . <p> I 've seen so many deals fall apart after the first two have been achieved , and then you ask questions about anything to do with the numbers side and if they do n't know the answer , they just evaporate . You lose confidence immediately when someone does n't understand the numbers . <p> BI : What are some of the worst pitches you 've seen ? <p> KO : The worst are ones where they either do n't have confidence or they do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a horrible thing to see happen . <p> It frustrates me miserably because they have just wasted my time and they wasted the opportunity in the " Shark Tank " that somebody else would have begged to have had .

Now , it 's a powerful thing to want to do that , but it 's not a business . <p> There we were in the Tank drawn to the story of this man whose father had died inventing this and who then went on to commercialize it . Yet he just would n't raise the price even though it was obvious you could triple the price . He could 've created so much value . <p> It 's the difference between a charity and a business . But it was a particularly powerful moment in " Shark Tank , " and no one 's going to forget it . Every Shark had a tear in their eye , including me . He is a great soul , that man . I 'm not sure he is a great businessman . <p> BI : What is your best negotiation advice to entrepreneurs who have the chance to come onto the show ? <p> KO : Do n't be greedy . The biggest mistake that people make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm tremendously valuable to an entrepreneur , not just for the experience or advice I can give them , but it 's infinitely valuable to get a deal on " Shark Tank " and get covered on primetime television year after year . <p> It gives you a competitive edge that others do n't have , and the only way you 're going to get that is to get me as an investor . If you want me , you 're going to have to make it really interesting because I 've got lots of opportunities to invest in and lots of deals , and people now have figured that out . I 've got lots of successes under my belt , and you 're going to pay for that if you want to use me as an investor .

@@3016235 <h> A second look at Obama 's India visit <p> Ian Hall is right to doubt that President Obama 's recent trip to India did much to build a really substantial US-India strategic partnership . But there is bit to learn from it anyway about how Obama and Prime Minister Modi are approaching the big strategic questions in Asia today -- and that makes the visit worth a second look . <p> The first thing to see is Modi 's attempt to revive a proposal for strategic consultations between America , India , Japan and Australia . This ' Quad ' idea first emerged almost decade ago from the trilateral US-Japan-Australia strategic consultations but it was scuppered by Kevin Rudd soon after he won office . He worried that it would look like the beginnings of a coalition to contain China , which of course it was . <p> One would expect Mr Abbott to be much more enthusiastic about it . The Quad seems to fit perfectly his ideas for Australia to build closer strategic links with each of the other parties to defend the existing regional order against China 's challenge . Indeed it is noteworthy that Canberra has not yet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement welcoming Mr Modi 's proposal . Perhaps following President Xi 's visit last November , Mr Abbott is starting to think more carefully about whether this kind of coalition-building is the best way respond to China 's growing power and ambition . Or perhaps he just has other things on his mind . <p> Second , Mr Modi 's willingness to refloat the Quad idea reinforces a lot of other evidence that he is keenly looking for partners to help balance China 's rise . He is keen for closer links with Japan ( he 's even considering buying Japanese submarines ) , and seems willing to take the strategic relationship with America into new territory . The joint statement issued with Obama during last week 's visit was low on specifics , but it did explicitly align US and Indian strategic aims in the Western Pacific , which is an important symbol of India 's willingness to identify itself with US efforts to counter China 's rise . That was certainly how it was read , and welcomed , in both the US and Indian press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare that Mr Modi is now a fully committed supporter of America 's efforts to resist China 's challenge in Asia . Like Abbott , Modi tends to send mixed messages . Just this week , as Brendan Thomas-Noone has mentioned , India 's foreign minister joined his Chinese and Russian counterparts in what seemed a very pally meeting in which they declared their shared commitment on a new international order based on multipolarity . Not quite what Washington has in mind . <p> Like other new and relatively inexperienced leaders , Mr Modi might think that walking both sides of the street with America and China is smart diplomacy . Alas , it is not that easy . India has wide range of interests at stake in its relationship with China , and India can not afford to subordinate those interests to the concerns of America or Japan , or Australia . <p> Third , and perhaps most interestingly , Mr Obama 's visit to India tells us something about the evolution of his policies towards Asia . Whether or not he gets India 's unflinching support against China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visit was designed to deliver . The scale of the visit itself shows how serious he is about this . <p> It was planned as a visit to India alone , not just a stop on a regional tour . The program -- including long hours watching India 's Republic Day parade -- sent strong messages about Obama 's commitment to building a substantive strategic relationship with India , directed against China . The US press was clearly briefed to read the whole visit this way , as they did . <p> We can draw three conclusions from this . The first is that , despite dramas in the Middle East and Europe , Obama still sees China as America 's major strategic challenge , and he sees that challenge growing sharply . This reinforces the message on China in his Brisbane speech last November , which received much less attention than it deserved . He described the dangers posed by China , and the choices faced by Asia in response to it , in far starker terms than he had ever done before . <p> The second is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far -- the pivot/rebalance -- has not worked . His trip to India was his big effort to re-boot the pivot and re-energise America 's efforts to resist China 's assault on US primacy in Asia . <p> Third , despite the hugs , it did n't work , because India is not willing to make the preservation of US primacy its principal strategic aim in Asia . 
@@3016236 <h> ALBERT EDWARDS : If the US measured inflation like Europe , then they 'd be freaking out about deflation too <p> Divergence between the US economy and the eurozone is one of the biggest economic stories of 2015 . <p> Among other diverging economic measures , the eurozone has been sinking into deflation , while this concern is far less in the US . <p> That 's only because they measure inflation differently , according to Societe Generale 's Albert Edwards . The US Bureau of Labour Statistics excludes components with volatile price fluctuations like food and energy to get the " core " consumer price index reading . In the eurozone , core CPI also excludes shelter . <p> " The next shoe to drop will be the realisation that the US recovery is stalling and outright deflation is as big a threat there as it is in the eurozone , " Edwards wrote . " Indeed my former esteemed colleagues Marchel Alexandrovich and David Owen pointed out to me that if US core CPI is measured in a similar way to the eurozone ( i.e. ex shelter ) , then US core CPI is already pari pass with the eurozone -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... The biggest surprise will be when investors realise that , despite the US having recently been the single engine of global growth , the US deflation threat is every bit as immediate as that in the eurozone .

In the eurozone , consumer prices fell 0.6% in January , the second straight monthly decline , while core CPI increased 0.5% , down from 0.7% in December . <p> As Edwards explains , the shelter component of US core CPI is made up of two things : rent , and the implied amount of rent that homeowners would pay if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent of primary residence ( OER ) . Edwards says OER is " a totally made-up number which no homeowner actually pays . " Also , it tends to mirror real rents , which lags the now-dropping house price inflation rate . <p> So as it stands , there is a " deflationary threat " from the housing component . Despite this , US inflation looks a lot like Europe 's if they are measured the same way . 
@@3016237 <p> The seed for this growth in Australia can be traced back to H20 Architect 's RMIT University Textile Facility , which re-examined attitudes to the use of timber for larger scale institutional and commercial applications . <p> According to Tim Hurburgh , Director of H20 , the key benefits of using timber are : <p> Flexibility in use , as it can be made into various forms and profiles <p> Adaptability , as it can be equally adapted to offsite or factory construction <p> Technically simple , as it utilises simple , tried and proven construction and erection technologies <p> Low carbon footprint . As a plantation material it is inexpensive to grow , harvest and prepare for commercial applications <h> Sustainability of timber extends to thermal performance <p> As the industry grows increasingly concerned about carbon footprints and the environmental impact of buildings , the sustainable properties of timber has become one of its key selling points . The Meditationand Indigenous Cultural Centre at Bentleigh Secondary College by dwpsuters is one project which used wood because of its low embodied energy and carbon sequestration principles . <p> Meditation and Indigenous Cultural Centre at Bentleigh Secondary College by dwpsuters <p> However , timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon storage advantages . It is also a material with natural thermal properties that can maximise the efficiency of insulation materials , says Clinton Skeoch , national market development manager at Boral Timber . <p> " Timber is a natural insulating material , featuring air pockets within its cellular structure to create a natural barrier to heat and cold , " he explains . <p> " Of the timber options available for construction , lightweight timber has the lowest thermal conductivity . Construction design with a focus on energy efficiency through lightweight timber can minimise non-renewable energy use and maximise comfort . " <p> This leads to operational sustainability -- as wood will not become cold or dissipate heat , less energy is required to regulate temperatures throughout a building . <p> The selection of a timber clad fa ? ade at the Australian Grains Genebank ( pictured ) was informed by the desire to specify a thermally efficient material that was at the same time sensitive to the local context and also an unexpected choice for an industrial facility , H20 Architect 's Tim Hurburgh says . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermally neutral buffer to the insulated freezers . This alleviates the high solar loads characteristic of the semi-arid climate that could be otherwise only achieved with engineered composite products . " <h> Industry regulations and material <p> The main regulations governing the use of timber in facades on non-residential applications are those that relate to the required fire hazard properties and weatherproofing . Currently , the National Construction Code ( NCC ) Volume One provides no restrictions on cladding for Type C buildings , and includes a concession for external walls of Class 2 and 3 buildings , such as multi-residential units , apartments , and hotel and motel buildings . <p> The concession removes the restriction on combustible cladding for buildings that are three storeys or less ( NCC Vol 1 , Specification C1.1 Clause 3.10 ) , while timber cladding used for buildings of more than three storeys must meet the performance criteria laid out by the NCC . <p> The complete external facade of Williamstown High School in Victoria is covered in vertical cladding stained to protect the timber and enhance the building 's warmth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridors both have Material Group Number 3 and were achieved through the use of an alternative solution . According to WoodSolutions , the Fire Engineering Brief argued that the wall linings did not contribute significantly to the fire performance required in the performance requirement <p> He adds that the NCC Volumes One and Two will be updated in 2015 to include a new verification method for all external walls for the weatherproofing performance requirements : <p> " The NCC will include a risk score method for deciding which external wall systems can be used in higher exposed areas . As for all external wall systems , timber cladding systems will be eventually required to verify their performance using the new method . " <h> Tips for architects <p> Western Red Cedar used for the facade of RMIT 's Textile Facility by H20 Architects <p> Apart from taking into account weatherproofing and fire safety considerations , with most Australian hardwoods having a natural bushfire resistance which varies per species , the most important properties when choosing a product or system for exterior cladding are durability and stability . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all commonly used timbers have been rated for durability , and we would recommend Above Ground Durability Class 1 or 2 for best results , " says Mitchell . <p> " As a guide , western red cedar is rated Class 2 outdoors above ground , while Australian hardwoods such as blackbutt , spotted gum and ironbark are Class 1 . A timber cladding supplier may suggest other types of timber -- confirm their durability with them before specification . " <p> Stability is generally ensured by kiln drying , although some timbers are more stable in service than others . Mitchell points again to western red cedar , which has low swelling and shrinkage properties in response to moisture change . <p> Understanding the impact of moisture on timber , and its performance over an extended period of weather exposure , is another important tip . Timber naturally contains a small percentage of water , and is a hygroscopic material . This means that it releases or absorbs water to equalise with the moisture levels in the air where it is installed . <p> Boral Timber cladding used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in width in response to changes , and some movement is considered normal , " explains Boral Timber 's Clinton Skeoch , adding that although Boral 's hardwood cladding is kiln dried to a moisture level which suits installation in most areas of Australia , allowance for some movement must be considered during design and installation <p> " By far the most movement occurs across the width of cladding boards , not the length . " <p> Other tips he has for architects and specifiers include viewing timber species in a display showroom before a decision on colour is made , as one species often has variations in colour , and photographs are only indications of a colour range . <p> To manage the politics of client risk management , the end client should also always be counselled by architects or building designers around the colour spectrum within the one species to ensure they understand the natural variations . <p> Finishes <p> Regarding finishes , this is largely a question of the type of look a specifier and their client is after as well as what maintenance expectations clients have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some manufacturers now offering guarantees of ten years or more . Pigmented stain is next best for lasting properties , while clear finishes need the most frequent attention , " says Mitchell . <p> " Some new water based finishes have excellent durability as well as easier reapplication . If the timber cladding is shielded from the weather by verandas , wide overhangs , maintenance is dramatically reduced . " <p> The types of finish selected and degree of weather exposure will dictate the frequency of maintenance and re-finishing required . Clear finishes provide minimal UV protection , and if used on their own , should be reapplied every six months .

This has placed intense strain on Jordan 's resources and social fabric . In addition , divisions over the Syrian civil war have polarised Jordanian politics , split opposition movements , and increased the risk of instability . <p> This results in a ' culture of stability ' in which activists know what they want their country to look like but are , understandably , wary of the potential volatility .

In fact , that shift happened in part right here in Australia when President Obama last November gave a blistering speech on climate change in Brisbane which rocked the Abbott Government with its thinly veiled criticism of the Government 's climate-change stance . Obama was on a roll after signing a major emissions agreement with China just before he arrived in Brisbane .

Of course , in the long term , we need to reduce our dependence on oil , whether it is produced at home or aboard . The plunge in the oil price provides an opportunity to do just that .

Indonesia is not alone in this -- its neighbours in Southeast Asia hold a similar position on the severity of drug smuggling as a crime . This approach is filling up Indonesia 's jails with young people convicted for as little as possession of a single joint , contributing to overcrowding and strain on resources . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis is breaking down .

There is now more criticism of Abe for his opposition to ISIS and his funding initiative for neighbouring states during his recent Middle East trip .

Just over a year ago , detectives discovered her hiding in a dark and airless secret cavity in a brothel in outer suburban Melbourne . The room was designed to ensure authorities could n't find foreign women suspected of working in the brothel without visas and of living on premises : all tell-tale signs of human trafficking . <p> The owners of Paradise Playmates in Seaford almost got away with hiding their women . Earlier raids by authorities had failed to discover the tiny wall cavity carefully built behind a set of shelves . <p> But a dogged sergeant from Victoria Police 's sex industry co-ordination unit , Richard Farrelly , would not give up .

The tribunal will soon decide what punishment is appropriate .

But , given the secret room , exploitation of workers can not be ruled out . <p> A barrister for the brothel owners told VCAT they denied any allegations of impropriety . <p> Anna , who served as many as 185 clients during her two months at the brothel , has been voluntarily deported .

But unlike in classical physics , where a complete specification of a state determines all of its properties ( for example , a particle 's position and velocity ) , the quantum state in general only gives probabilistic predictions . <p> In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems existing simultaneously in multiple states , such as different positions or velocities . It gives very precise probabilities for the possible outcomes of laboratory experiments , but it defies an intuitive interpretation . <p> Some of the founders of the theory , such as physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg , suggested that until an observation of one or another property is made , questions like " where is this particle , really ? " simply do n't make sense . <p> Under this view , it 's not that the particle is really here or there ( and we just do n't know until we look ) . Rather , for Bohr the very meaning of " position " depends on the existence of a measurement that detects it . <p> Physicist Erwin Schr ? dinger 's famous thought experiment was designed to show how , if quantum mechanics is taken literally and to its ultimate implications , even macroscopic systems , like cats , would be in such " superpositions " of states -- such as the cat being both dead and alive -- which is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head <p> An indeterminate reality was unacceptable for Albert Einstein , who famously said : " Do you really believe the moon exists only when you look at it ? " Einstein believed instead that the wave function should be understood as representing our limited information about the actual state of physical systems . <p> A first blow to Einstein 's view came in 1964 , when John S Bell showed that any model that describes an objective reality underlying quantum mechanics must include some sort of non-local connection between distant systems , in an apparent violation of Einstein 's own theory of relativity . <p> In 2007 , however , Robert Spekkens from the Perimeter Institute published a seminal work showing that it was possible to reproduce many of the counter-intuitive aspects of quantum theory with a model where the wave function plays the " epistemic " role Einstein longed for . <p> Other fragments of quantum theory were later shown to fit similar models , but the question was open whether or not this was possible for all of quantum theory . Could Einstein 's dream be revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imagine I hold two decks of cards : one contains only red cards , the other only aces , and I ask you to pick a card from one , without knowing which is which . <p> In an epistemic interpretation , the wave function would play the role of the deck you pick the card from . It gives you some information about the card -- like if you pick from the aces deck , you 're sure to pick an ace of some sort -- but this information is not itself a property of the card . In fact , it is possible that you have picked an ace of hearts , which is compatible with both decks . <p> A wake-up call came in 2012 , when Matthew Pusey , Jonathan Barrett and Terry Rudolph showed that in any objective model of quantum theory , the wave function must be a real property of individual systems , unlike the deck of cards . But , their theorem had an extra assumption that has called the implications of the theorem into question . <h> Reality check <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , starting with work from myself and colleagues , puts strong bounds on the viability of epistemic models , even without those extra assumptions . <p> These theorems consider the fact that some pairs of quantum states can not be distinguished on a single experiment . This is analogous to not always being able to tell whether a randomly picked card came from the red deck or the ace deck . If you pick a non-ace card , you can be sure it came from the red deck . If you pick a black ace , you can be sure it came from the ace deck . <p> But if it 's an ace of hearts or an ace of diamonds , it could have come from either . Counting the cards in the decks , we can determine how often this is supposed to happen . <p> In an epistemic interpretation , the fact we ca n't distinguish quantum states should be at least partially accounted for in this way . But the theorems show that this explanation simply can not work . For some specially constructed quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have anywhere near the right amount of cards in common , so to speak . <p> These predictions were partially confirmed by the experiment I was involved with , performed by Martin Ringbauer and the Brisbane team led by Alessandro Fedrizzi . They followed an improved version of our theorem due to Cyril Branciard , a co-author in the study . <p> The experiment involved preparing single photons ( particles of light ) in those specially designed states and subjecting them to a number of alternative measurements . The results give bounds on how well a model like the one outlined above can describe the statistics they observe . <p> This represents the first large class of quantum models to be ruled out since Bell 's theorem started being tested in the 1980s . <p> If further experiments confirm the implications of the theorems , viable epistemic models of quantum mechanics will be essentially ruled out . If we want an objective reality , ? la Einstein , the wave function must be real , dead and alive cats and all . <p> But there are alternatives . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive the theorems , perhaps by introducing backwards-in-time causality or parallel universes . However , no approaches of this form have yet managed to produce an epistemic interpretation .

Photo : Supplied <p> It 's the theme of so many dystopian sci-fi books and movies : a super intelligent machine in charge of lethal military hardware becomes self-aware and decides to wreak havoc . But could it actually happen ? <p> At the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence 's annual conference in Texas last month , a workshop was held on the ethics of AI development and a panel discussed whether or not so-called ' lethal autonomous weapons ' should be banned . <p> " There are many arguments , legal , ethical , political and technical for a ban , " Toby Walsh , head of the Optimisation Research Group at Australia 's research body NICTA and chair of the proceedings , told Fairfax Media . <p> " One that particularly appeals to me is that autonomous weapons will lower the barrier to war . If one side can launch an attack , without fear of bodies coming home , then it is much easier to slip into battle , " Professor Walsh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have the bar falling , those in favour of a ban would look to stop a potential arms race in " killer robots " before it begins . One the other hand , there are plenty of voices against a ban . <p> " Machines are not inherently dangerous " , said Francesca Rossi , president of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and a participant in the AAAI panel , who points out the huge difference between super-intelligence and sentience . <p> " We should build autonomous weapons by specifying all the relevant context for the desired goal to be achieved by the machine . Otherwise , a goal could be reached by violating some basic assumptions on how we want a machine to behave . Since machines are not sentient , their behaviour depends on how a human built them , " Professor Rossi said . <p> The specification of " all " relevant context could prove a troublesome task , however , since as Professor Walsh points out , " many ethical principles that we hold as universal are not " , and ethics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts argue automated fighters would be much more principled in applying the laws and guidelines of war ; that a ban would be impossible to police and that our enemies will surely develop autonomous weapons even if we do not . <p> " There 's an argument that ' fire and forget ' weapon systems already in the field are lethal autonomous weapons " , Professor Walsh said . <p> " If a ban is put in place , the diplomats tell me that they 'll worry about defining precisely what is a ' lethal autonomous weapon ' right before the treaty is signed " . <p> Hollywood view of AI <p> Microsoft 's Eric Horvitz , who recently predicted humanity would never lose control of AI contradicting Stephen Hawking , told Fairfax Media Hollywood has given many people an inflated idea of how close we are to developing a truly sentient system . <p> " We 've made advances on very , very narrow wedges of intelligence , such as building predictive models from data , performing face recognition , and understanding speech " , he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary movies have overcharged expectations and fears , and thus , have stimulated concerns about AI .

" <p> Horvitz has conceived of a 100-year effort , currently being undertaken at Stanford University , to study and anticipate how AI development will ripple through human life . <p> Already , he said , the positive benefits of AI development can be seen in healthcare , education , transportation , and science . He expects major scientific breakthroughs will soon be attributed to machine scientists , and hundreds of AI vehicles will make up a " public microtransit network " in CBDs that are closed off to human-driven vehicles . <p> Professor Walsh is also sceptical about Hollywood-style AI systems become reality soon . <p> " If you ask most AI researchers today , they 'll say 30 or 40 years . But then they 've been saying this for the last 30 or 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there is now a real scent of success , and people are recognising it could actually be in their lifetime " . <p> Further afield <p> Lethal weapons or no , the application of ethics to AI is still vitally important , Professor Walsh said . <p> " If AI systems are given autonomy -- and there are good economical , social and other reasons why this is sure to be the case -- then they will inevitably have to make life and death decisions , " he says . <p> " An autonomous car will have to decide between crashing into the person crossing the road with a pram , surely killing the person and the baby but probably not the occupant of the car , or into a wall , surely killing the occupant of the car . These are not easy decisions to make and require ethics to make well .

@@3041230 <p> Prime Minister Tony Abbott looks set to make a case for further sweeping national security changes in the wake of recent terrorist attacks and arrests . <p> Speaking in advance of a statement to parliament early next week , Abbott argued that , for too long , Australia 's approach to border controls , citizenship and even welfare had given dangerous characters the " benefit of the doubt " . <p> We are a free and fair nation . But that does n't mean we should let bad people play us for mugs , and all too often they have . Well , that 's going to stop . <p> Abbott went on to suggest that the government was determined to take " remedial action " in response to a review of the Martin Place siege in Sydney in late 2014 . <h> The spectre of threat and the politics of fear <p> Concerns about terrorism in Western states are clearly on the rise .

Abbott is reeling from a series of poor " captain 's calls " , serious and unresolved questions about his leadership and disastrous opinion polling . In this context , the return to the safe conservative ground of national security suggests itself as an obvious diversionary tactic . <p> While a way of refocusing domestic attention , there is also a basis for suggesting that emphasising national security threats and responses serves the government 's political agenda more directly . <p> A range of security analysts have argued that stoking security concerns can serve to justify extreme measures and drive support for the governments promoting them .

This is a trope particularly favoured by conservative political leaders . <p> Ronald Reagan 's famous " Bear in the Woods " campaign advertisement in the lead-up to the 1984 US presidential election was one such example . Reagan linked fear of the Soviet Union to the need for his re-election and continued military spending . <p> In Australia , the Howard government 's " Be Alert , But Not Alarmed " campaign , which began after the 2002 Bali bombings , also largely followed this script . <p> For many , this relationship between fear , security and political legitimacy has also been at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lens of " border security " .

Research tells us that a hardline approach to " suspect " communities will further ingrain their sense of marginalisation and make radicalisation more likely . In this sense , effective responses to the terrorist " threat within " might require us to be more open and engaged , finding new opportunities for drawing such communities into the national community .

@@3041233 <h> Denmark must not succumb to polarisation in the wake of Copenhagen attacks <h> Author <h> Disclosure statement <p> Vincent F Hendricks does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Copenhagen has been left reeling from a series of violent attacks on February 14 and 15 . A young man armed with an automatic weapon and other guns killed two civilians and injured five police officers on two separate occasions only hours apart in downtown Copenhagen . <p> One shooting took place at a free speech debate hosted by a controversial Swedish cartoonist and the other in front of synagogue . Within 13 hours the police had tracked down the Danish-born 22-year-old male of Arabic descent . When they moved to arrest him he opened fire and was subsequently shot dead by the police . <p> The attacks come just weeks after the shootings in Paris that have left so many people questioning how we move forward . Life has certainly changed for many over the past few weeks . <h> Profiles <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head when I travel these days . Against a soundtrack of news of elevated terror alerts , I hit speed bumps -- at the check-in and through security in Copenhagen , at immigration when I arrive in Brussels , at armed police checkpoints near potential terror targets . <p> There are so many people and so many speed bumps . But I ca n't get rid of this nagging idea that travelling around is just a bit more difficult for some than others right now . <p> It 's an involuntarily feeling and I 'm annoyed even having it at all . I want to see individuals first and then gender , religion , political or sexual orientation as secondary qualities -- not as profiling parameters . It 's by fulfilling the criteria of one such profile that I often get stopped in my car . <p> Sometimes I have been greeted with a rather intransigent tone of voice and appertaining suspicion by police officers . I have been forced to explain myself at length and seen the suspicion only abating once I have revealed my ID , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same profile that got my son -- who in passing may look like everything in the " middle " -- Middle Eastern , Middle European , Middle American -- kicked out of a beach resort in Jordan , the lifeguards convinced he was a member of the indigenous population and thus unwelcome amongst the guests . My ethnic Danish wife has travelled the continents with her ethnic Danish kids and never been stopped . But since she married me she has had to start factoring in speed bumps , whether the trip is to Sharm Al Sheikh , Abu Dhabi , Norway , New Orleans or returning home to Copenhagen . <p> As we recover from these attacks and those in Paris and look on while far-right groups demonstrate in Germany about the " Islamification " of Europe , profiling can easily creep in . Nuances have a tough time in times of polarisation but it is exactly now that nuances have to be observed in concert with reflection , enlightenment , carefully considered action and mutual respect between individuals . <p> Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein caught on CCTV.EPA <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to be careful not to make the same profiling mistake when I meet strangers . I have to be careful not to get " racially annoyed " when having my luggage examined at customs or not feeling wronged again when pulled over by the police . <p> I may be encouraged to catalogue some people in a certain way , especially if I feel unfairly or iniquitously treated . I may start to develop fixed ideas about the people who stop me and question me . I might use race , gender , culture or politics as both an explanation and a frontline defence . That 's the first step to prejudice . And I should probably consider that the people I profile do the same . We are not that different as humans . <p> My father came as a black American to Denmark in 1963 . He left with segregation and seats at the back of the bus fresh in his mind . He experienced Denmark and Europe as places where the individual comes first , not the colour of their skin . Yet a Somali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , while growing up , friends from the entire ethnic and religious spectrum . Now he was just considered a Muslim . <h> Where do we go from here ? <p> In 2015 we should not return to the religious feuds of the days of old . Much blood has been spilt over religion and the same goes for the other parameters of profiling from race over gender to culture . Recently a Danish newspaper explained eloquently and poetically why certain " young men without much to lose " take to terror with reference to the recent attacks in France but which also seem befitting of the young man responsible for the horrifying Copenhagen shootings : <p> They all came from the same place between two worlds , and two religions , two ethnic groups and two cultures , and instead of feeling blessed twice they felt cursed for two . <p> One world is less than two by a measure of quantity , but two is not better than one by a measure of quality . They are just different things . One may indeed get wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nationalities but it requires both worlds wanting to meet . <p> There is a fine line between not sounding like the victim , not sounding like the aggressor , not sounding like the prosecutor , not sounding like counsel , not provoking further polarisation but at the same time pointing to differences without classifying , being informative without lecturing , being hopeful without sounding naive . <p> One thing is for certain : a sense of belonging is always what hits you when you come home from somewhere . You are awaited and welcome . We do n't want to get to a place where you are awaited but unwelcome .

Theres also a smart powered tailgate ( which opens as you approach with the key ) and Smart Parking Assist with parallel and bay parking function . <p> Hyundai claims the all-new satellite navigation system is more than three times faster than the previous version and comes with a seven-year free subscription to TomTom Live services . <p> The new Tucson will not only replace the ix35 , but it will also step into the Medium SUV category instead of the ix35 's current status as a Small SUV in Australia , based on the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries ' VFACTs data . <p> The dimensions of the new Tucson show the reason for the move : it is 4475 millimetres long , 1850mm wide and 1645mm tall , and rides on a 2670mm wheelbase . That makes the Tucson 65mm longer , 30mm wider and 15mm lower than the ix35 it replaces , and the wheelbase is also 30mm longer than the outgoing ix35 . <p> It 's no surprise then , that there 's plenty of space on offer -- a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the second row in place , there 's an impressive 513 litres of luggage space . <p> With such rabid competition , the Medium SUV sector is often segmented by buyers on price and inclusions equally , so the Tucson will need to be equipped well in terms of safety to take the fight up to the established stars .

I guess the size creep marches on , only the Peugeot 308 seems to defy the trend . <p> Jerrycan <p> Hyundai Australia were quick to issue a ' there is no product overlap ' statement on the Sonata and now the Tucson and Santa Fe are closer than ever .

A crowd of up to 40,000 people gathered just around the corner from the scene of the first shootings , at which documentary film director Finn N ? rgaard was killed . He had been attending a debate meeting on art , blasphemy and freedom of speech featuring the controversial Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks , who had once depicted the Prophet Muhammad as a dog . <p> Copenhageners paid a unforgettable tribute to the two victims at the memorial service . The programme included a number of guest speakers , including prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt , and the French ambassador , Fran ? ois Zimeray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The memorial was being organised on behalf of all the political parties represented at Copenhagen Municipality , who announced they are standing together across political boundaries to protect freedom of expression , democracy and free speech in the wake of the attacks . <p> There has been concern that the suspected perpetrator , Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein , a 22-year-old man born and raised in Denmark , may have been inspired by the Islamist attacks in Paris a month ago , and decided to carry out similar murders at the debate and at a synagogue . He was known to the police and national intelligence agencies . He has been involved in weapons violations and violence and had ties to gangs in Copenhagen . He was released from prison just a few weeks ago . <p> When young Muslim men , born and raised in Western cultures , turn to radical interpretations of Islam and lash out at the society in which they live , talk quickly turns to the spectre of the " home-grown terrorist " .

This is not a conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims . This is a conflict between the core values of our society and violent extremists . " <p> And in fact , surprisingly few politicians have used the attack as an opportunity to articulate resentment toward Islam and the Muslim population in Denmark . The prime minister 's interpretation of the event as a " politically motivated attack " has been widely accepted with only a few exceptions . <p> Denmark is considered an open , free and peaceful democracy . According to political leaders from the government and the opposition , this will not change as a result of these incidents . Debate about freedom of speech is inevitable -- especially when it comes to Islam and blasphemy -- and there will now probably be more debate about the freedom of assembly too after the attack on a open and free debate meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this attack . <p> But there is another issue that will need to be addressed after this tragedy . El-Hussein grew up in the social housing complex of Mj ? lnerparken in Copenhagen . His social background is comparable to the three men who carried out the attacks in Paris in January . Following the horrors of Paris , many asked if the homegrown amateur terrorist is the new face of extremism and the events in Copenhagen over the weekend would appear to confirm that development . <p> However , given that it is extremely difficult to predict who will carry out a lone-wolf attack or track everyone who has been in contact with the security agencies , a broader approach is needed . We need better anti-radicalisation programmes in public institutions , including prisons , and more focused integration projects in the social housing complexes in which radicalisation can breed . We also , of course , need better gun control laws . <p> The ability of home-grown terrorists to attain meaningful goals through individual attacks is limited , but as an agent for division , the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to destabilise social unity and compound radicalisation . <p> The former does not appear to have happened in Denmark as a result of this attack .

The government seems to have given little attention to the effect this policy would have on the long-term health of the nation . <p> Australians buying medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ( PBS ) have been required to make a contribution to their cost since the 1960s . Currently , many of us pay the first A$37.70 . Pensioners , the unemployed and those receiving a range of disability benefits have access to a health-care concession card , which reduces this co-payment to A$6.10 . <p> Our research suggests that , if implemented , this rise may lead to an increase in the rates of discontinuation for some medications . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the use of medications have been surprisingly rare . Research published in 2008 , which used Australia-wide PBS prescribing information , showed that co-payment increases a decade ago resulted in a " significant decrease in dispensing volumes " for many types of medications . <p> But there has n't been much direct research on the impact of the higher out-of-pocket costs on long-term use of common medicines by people who do n't have a concession card . This may be because this research requires data-linkage to track individual usage of medications over time . <p> In a study to be published in the international journal Health Policy , we focused on the impact of non-concessional co-payments on drug use using information collected for the Australian Hypertension and Absolute Risk Study ( AusHEART ) .

For instance , a 2010 study comparing the cost of Simvastatin in different places found Australia paid more than four times more for this drug than in England . <p> To address this discrepancy , the Rudd government introduced a policy of accelerated price disclosure in 2010 . The policy bases future drug prices on actual cost to pharmacists . As these are often much lower than official prices , the cost of many generic drugs has been falling . <p> While the cost of statins in Australia is still higher than in other countries such as England and New Zealand , many of these medications now cost less than the non-concessional level of co-payment ; 40mg Simvastatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls in prices like this reduce the out-of-pocket costs for general users , which is likely to improve adherence to medications . Drugs like statins generally require long-term use to effectively reduce cardiovascular disease and prevent premature death . Our study shows increases in drug prices are likely to have the opposite effect . And the 2008 study mentioned above shows this may hold true for other medications as well . <p> Such findings have implications for future government policies regarding co-payments . Clearly , when considering a policy that will increase drug costs , the government needs to consider more than just direct financial impact . Potential downstream costs , such as changes in number of hospitalisations , and health impacts , such as the policy 's effect on the risk of premature mortality , should also be considered . <p> Our results suggest that reducing the cost of statin medications may not only save taxpayers money , it may also save their lives .

@@3053233 <h> Senior music writer <p> Can we have a few minutes to talk about beauty ? Not in this case ( at least not immediately ) in the melodies of the Go-Betweens ' Robert Forster and Grant McLennan , or in the elegance of the Brisbane-formed outfit 's best lyrics . Beauty , too , that 's separate from the well-formed pop songs of their approximate contemporaries , Perth 's Eurogliders , who rose up even further away from the Sydney/Melbourne axis of power in 1981 . <p> Both bands had a pivotal couple relationship within the group -- songwriter Bernie Lynch and singer Grace Knight in Eurogliders ; Forster and Lindy Morrison , then McLennan and Amanda Brown later on in the Go-Betweens . The Eurogliders would be the obverse Go-Betweens ; they sold vastly more than the Queenslanders but , in the main , never marked themselves distinctively as individuals or as Australians , away from these shores . <p> The young Go-Betweens , from left , Robert Vickers , Robert Forster , Grant McLennan and Lindy Morrison . Photo : Bernard Zuel <p> Eurogliders ' songs such as We Will Together ( which was a mix of the Eurythmics and Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gated drums and post-Chic guitars ) , and Ca n't Wait to See You ( the Simple Minds template of compressed but big-sounding drums/guitars pushing quasi-anthemic choruses ) , caught the ear faster and easier in full shiny mode in the 1980s . Not just more than the songs of Forster and McLennan but more than the stripped back , slower and theoretically more " meaningful " versions on this new album of old and new songs that serves to highlight the relatively common base material . <p> Advertisement <p> The Go-Betweens never had the Eurogliders ' marketability , but elegance and grace were as much a part of their appeal as their wit or angularity and simplicity . That could be seen in the elevated adolescence of early singles Lee Remick and People Say ( " people say I 'm mad to want you " ) ; through the shadows of doubt and regret in Cattle and Cane and One Thing Can Hold Us ( " We stand , tongue-tied with our lies " ) ; and in the anything-but-hidden romanticism of Bachelor Kisses and Man O'Sand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I write a song about us breaking up " ) . You have to admit those lyrics are in another league to Eurogliders ' " heaven must be there , you know it 's got to be there " . <p> The beauty I have in mind is not the seemingly fractured but actually constructed and essential patterns of both Lindy Morrison 's drums and her intellectual input to the hot-housed fervour of two boys from Brisbane . There is never enough written about how important Morrison was to the Go-Betweens ; she was n't their first person on drums , but she was the drummer who made them this band . And , at least right now , I am not looking to discuss the fluidity and style of both Robert Vickers ' suits and bass playing , though you can start at the all-over-wonderful Part Company while you wait . <p> Attractive and , yes , beautiful as all those things were in the Go-Betweens -- as covered in this box set , which stretches from their earliest recordings to their third album , Spring Hill Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Successive governments have argued that tougher policies such as boat turn-backs and offshore detention will " stop the boats " and thereby reduce the number of people drowning . <p> Several newspaper columnists have said that more than 1200 refugees died under Labor . That time period covers six years , from the swearing in of Kevin Rudd on December 3 , 2007 , to the swearing in of Tony Abbott on September 18 , 2013 . <p> So , how many refugees drowned under Labor ?

Any " accurate " statistics are also unrealistic given the clandestine nature of people smuggling and irregular movement of people by sea .

The spokesperson also directed The Conversation to Monash University 's Australian Border Deaths Database . <p> The number of asylum seekers dying at sea has been the subject of a previous FactCheck , which drew on figures from the Australian Border Deaths Database to estimate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 . <p> In August 2012 , the Expert Panel Report on Asylum Seekers received information from the Department of Immigration and the Australian Border Services that , since 2000 , an estimated 946 people had died while attempting to reach Australia by boat . Of this , 609 deaths had occurred since October 2009 , the report said . ( Labor took power in late 2007 . ) <p> After this report , it is difficult to find any official statistics from government sources . There appear to be two other sources of information whose figures are broadly consistent with those given to the Expert Panel . Both rely upon collating data from a range of official , media and non-government organisation sources : <p> The Australian Border Deaths Database is maintained by the Border Crossing Observatory , a research network based at Monash University .

UNHCR estimated that last year 540 people died during these journeys , due to starvation , dehydration and beatings by crew members . UNHCR reports that those who do make it to Thailand , Malaysia or Indonesia face detention , exploitation and violence . <p> The UN High Commissioner for Refugees , Ant ? nio Guterres , has pointed out that maritime movements are a growing phenomenon , which requires a range of responses including : effective search and rescue , proper systems to deal with arrivals and identifying those with protection needs .

It is the duty of any government to ensure security and to manage immigration , but these policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage ... One can not stop a person who is fleeing for life by deterrence , without escalating the dangers even more . Any effective response must also address the root causes of this phenomenon . <h> Verdict <p> The figure of 1200 deaths of asylum seekers at sea under Labor regularly cited by politicians and the media is broadly correct . The best available data appears to put those estimates at closer to 1100 . Globally and in our region , however , more asylum seekers than ever are leaving their country by boat . <h> Review <p> This is a sound analysis of the evidence available to document asylum seeker deaths at sea . It is correct to note that the tragedy near and in Australian shores is being replicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australians have witnessed over the last decade . The rising number of deaths at sea is taking place in a global environment where humanitarian crises are becoming protracted .

She 'd applied for a job in the disability sector , and I was interviewing -- one of the questions related to the ' how ' of making systemic change in the sector . <p> ' I would find people and get them to tell their stories , ' she said earnestly , and I made a mental note -- she was the third in as many interviews who had spoken about the importance of using people 's stories to create systemic change . <p> She 's not the only one . Bolstered by the success of Twenty Years : Twenty Stories , former Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes has long been a proponent of the use of the stories of people with disability to transform the system . We all know it works -- telling a personal story adds that extra , authentic , undeniably effective element . The BSWAT decision , the result of a concerted wage justice campaign , would not have been made if Messrs Nojin and Prior had not been prepared to tell their stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WA would not have been built if men and women like Marlon Noble , imprisoned unfairly and without charge under the Mentally Impaired Accused Act , had not been profiled in the newspapers . People react to tragedy and unfairness , and it is often the only ammunition left in our arsenal -- the NDIS was launched after a massive campaign by people with disability and their families , shouting about only being able to afford two showers a week or not being able to afford a wheelchair . <p> But is anyone asking the question ; ' is this just another form of inspiration porn ? ' <p> In feminist culture , there 's a current discussion going on about tokenising rape survivors . It argues that we live in a rape culture , which makes survivors feel ashamed about their trauma . For this reason , many anti rape campaigns encourage survivors not only to say that they were sexually violated , but also to give accounts of their experience of sexual violence . <p> But , they argue , the strong focus on story-telling has an unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , survivors ' stories are treated as ' inspiration porn ' . And that is an argument that is transplanted across sectors -- is it possible to keep re-telling our stories of discrimination and abuse and violence without being reduced to eternal victimhood ? <p> I see many parallels . Rape is a denial of someone 's personhood -- a victim 's body is used for the gain of another . Discrimination and other abuses , including ableism , deny the rights of a person with a disability to be a person with the same rights as any other citizen . We 're constantly perpetuating the ' perfect victim ' narrative -- it is a simple thing to tell a story about someone who is unable to be ' victim-blamed ' , because it conforms to the perfect victim scenario .

We want to hear how the individual overcame their circumstances , not how society needs to change in order to eradicate those circumstances . <p> We want to hear that everyone can overcome suffering . We do n't want to take responsibility for creating a culture that perpetuates that suffering . <p> Last year , I told a group of startled bureaucrats that I had to leave my job because they refused to put in an accessible toilet . I had become accustomed to telling that story -- not just to my employer , but to my lawyer , to a whole cast of men and women in suits and people on the ends of telephones and email addresses . I think of the men and women I know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about toilets , yes , but also other forms of unfairness and discrimination and abuse and brutality . It takes an enormous amount of courage to disclose those personal details and your private hell to a group of strangers , who will invariably tut tut and tell you that it is dreadful , that terrible thing that happened . <p> There 's evidence that we 're reduced to our stories , we people with disability . Last year , a man at a workshop asked a colleague ' if I could do a standing transfer ' . I was horrified -- but is this not an unintended consequence of being reduced to a story , or a cohort ? Is the perception that our individual personhood is ' less ' now the collateral damage of a mechanism calculated to create change ? <p> I 'm not here to inspire you , said disability advocate and journalist Stella Young .

If the player disobeys and explores , they can walk into a room full of animatronic parts , like suits and endoskeletons . Curiously , there is also a human skull lying between all these parts -- but who does it belong to ? <p> 9 ) The Missing Kid <p> In one of the secret mini-games , there are nine identical rooms with three children each ... except for one . In one of these rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who knows ! <p> 10 ) The Newspaper <p> Here is something you can only see if you get a certain ending in FNAF 3 . Two things make this clipping notable . One , Scott Cawthon , the creator of FNAF , has written all sorts of cool factoids about the franchise on this . It 's a bit hard to make out , but the panels say the following : <p> Looking back on many of my old games , I 've found that there is almost always a broken-down robot in them . I 'm not sure why this seems to be such a recurring theme in my games , but it 's obvious that it 's something haunting me . <p> Before I began work on FNaF , I had to choose what game to make out of three potential games , knowing it might be my last try before having to start a new career .

I raised exactly zero dollars . <p> Fun fact : The names Freddy , Bonnie , Chica and Foxy were just nicknames while I worked on the characters .

This was changed before release . <p> In real life I tend to have waking-nightmares , meaning that I walk in my sleep , etc . One night I dreamt that Bonnie was in the hall outside my door , so I jumped out of bed and rushed to hold the door shut . I discovered that the door was locked and it filled me with dread .

Maybe this is why Foxy looks so torn up ! <p> While we were there visiting , my kids got to experience Foxy 's jumpscare for the first time ! <p> And two , there 's actually something hidden in the picture of the newspaper . Turns out , Springtrap is standing behind Freddy -- but you can only see him if you brighten up the image , like so : <p> From what I can tell in that Bad Ending screen , the fifth head kinda uses Bonnie 's lamp head texture .

The Zelda games are some of the best games out there And part of the reason why it 's so successful is because they 're willing to mix up and change the formula . Over the years we 've seen the iconic fields of Hyrule replaced with sailing the ocean in Wind Waker , and soaring through the clouds in Skyward Sword . But the biggest shake-up of all had to be the time-bending madness of Majora 's Mask . <p> HEXThe Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask was released back in 2000 near the end of the Nintendo 64 's era . It never received the same iconic status Ocarina of Time but it remained a fan favourite for many and now it 's been remastered for the 3DS . <p> DARRENThe young sword-wielding Link remains the hero in this adventure but it takes a decidedly bizarre twist early on . Link is pulled into the strange world of Termina by a mask-wearing prankster . Then Link finds himself transformed into a Deku creature . But the worst news of all is that the moon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BAJOYes it 's safe to say , it was not a good day for Link . After the fantastic 3DS version of Ocarina of Time I was really looking forward to this you guys . And the updated graphics , wow , they 're nice on the eyes . <p> HEXAbsolutely . It 's a lot easier to lose yourself in big worlds like this when they take the time to paint everything with crisp new textures . But we should talk about the gameplay though , because there 's a lot to get your head around . <p> DARRENAffirmative . The series ' normal formula has Link exploring dungeons , solving puzzles , and battling monsters . And that core gameplay is still there in Majora 's Mask , but they 've also added in a big focus on travelling through time - and magical masks that can change Link 's form . <p> BAJOAt any point Link can pop a different mask on and gain new abilities . The first is the Deku mask - which turns him into a kind of living plant . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glide along on little flower-copters . <p> HEXI love flower-copters , there should be more of them in games . Plus , I also liked the little details like how he 's shorter in his Deku form so he has to jump up to reach door handles . <p> DARRENNaturally Link gathers extra masks throughout the game . Some like the bomb mask simply give him extra abilities . While others let Link pass himself off as different races , like Gorons , gaining their skills in the process . <p> BAJOI was impressed at how much extra variety these masks added to the gameplay . I often needed to switch them out . Floating over large gaps as a Deku . Then switching back to regular Link to shoot arrows . <p> HEXAh yes the classic burning arrow shot . So good . Even more than the masks though , the way it messes with time really makes the game unique . That three day countdown to the end of the world is always ticking away . And the game regularly reminds you that you 're running out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky taunting you . <p> BAJOYeah talk about freaky . The way he just grins at you .

Playing the Song of Time will transport Link back to start of the first day . However , doing this also robs Link of all his money and many of the item 's he 's collected . <p> HEXWatching everything disappear was so painful . <p> BAJOTotally .

They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliving the days I 'd get to know each person 's routine . <p> DARREN Like all good Zelda games , solving some puzzles will require serious legwork as you tease clues from conversations , and try out various items .

There was one point where I got to the end of a dungeon with only 5 minutes left before the world ended . But I still had to beat the boss before I could rewind time . Most stressful boss fight ever ! <p> BAJOSmarter boss fights like that one are one of the small changes that have been made to balance the gameplay , but there have been a couple of big changes as well . This 3DS version adds a very handy ability to save the game at any of these statues . <p> DARRENPurists like myself would argue these additions make the game easier than it was originally intended . But on a portable system it 's a logical addition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I 'd be happy if I ran out of battery without a way to save . Link 's notebook has also been upgraded , with more detail on each quest and the times they occur . <p> BAJOWe played this mostly on an older 3DS and it worked totally fine , but we also had a go with the newer 3DS which has the nub stick which helps with camera control . <p> HEXI am just so glad they remade Majora 's Mask . It may not be as lengthy as some of the other Zelda games but instead it 's a more unique and personal journey and it still feels fresh today .

Are you happy Riot is reworking him , or do you think he 's fine in his current post-nerf state ? I 've seen a lot of talk about Urgot , most not very nice . Since he 's free right now , I 'm hoping to get a better sense of him . Thanks ! <h> Tags <h> Discuss <p> His kit is very out-dated , in a meta where mobility is everything he is extremely lackluster . His damage can be pretty decent , however his ultimate is counter productive to ADC positioning , placing him in the thick of the enemy team in most cases . All in all he is nowhere near on par with champions of the same role . <p> There is never the vision in solo queue to use it up to its full potential . It just ends us costing you a flash . And with the ' common ' build path on him most of the time you would ult into a full team if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urgot is fine , people just need to stop playing him as an ADC and play him more as a ranged bruiser . He 's much like Quinn , if you take her bot she tends to be countered heavily , in top lane hardly anyone counters her , due to her range and poke . As for Urgot , he needs to be built tank with damage , so essentially a bruiser . In top lane he outpokes everyone , even those pesky Lissandra tops , his early game damage is insane ! Grabbing a tear should be your first purchase and then Tri-Force* and then tank items ( Sunfire cape and Randuin 's Omen ) If you 're doing good , grab another damage item , if not go for Guardian Angel . <p> Yes he 's bad . But not horrible . He 's a sub par adc mainly because he builds dmg without critical hit , and also because he has an extremely short range . However , in top lane he is a very strong poke style champ that can do pretty well up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really made it to the current meta . As an ADC the only thing he has going for him is zone control , however in order to zone people out he has to itemize into mana which is generally a poor direction to go into for ADCs . <p> He has a short AA range , he lacks steroids , he lacks abilities that do damage OTHER than his Q and to a lesser extent his E. His ultimate is situational at best and while his shield is helpful , it is n't particularly redemptive considering his other abilities and his role . While the shield can be used to help escape ( as you can also slow enemies with it ) , it 's not as good as an actual escape or CC . <p> He 's also ugly and not in a cool way . Just like ugly ugly . <p> Building him as a bruiser/tankier as an alternative build generally means strong zone control again but lack of an escape hurts him . He wo n't do amazing damage like Riven and he can not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other toplaners . <p> Overall Urgot needs the rework . He needs to be made less binary than simply landing E so you can get a million Q 's off . <p> He 's designed like a Tanky ADC ( attack damage carry ) , because of this , he does is not very tanky and can not keep up with other ADC damage . <p> Most ADCs have an ability to boost damage or have a mobility option.Most tanks make of for their lack of damage with crowd control effects like stuns or area of effect attacks . <p> Urgot is sort of in between and does n't really benefit from either side of the equation , instead falls mediocre in all situations . He 's there to help when he can but is n't ever really a game changer like the roles he 's a combination of .

@@3107235 <h> Studies Reveal Red Wine Is The Best Alcohol For Great Sex <p> A little alcohol , in moderation , is helpful as a social lubricant . A couple of studies have revealed that if you 're looking for a specific drink that actually does boost the sex drive in both men and women , red wine should be your drink of choice -- not a pint , or a fancy cocktail with an eyeroll-worthy name . Here 's why . <p> The folks at Vinepair went looking for the ideal alcoholic drink -- based on at least some actual science -- for a " good night " . Turns out good old-fashioned red wine has the most actual evidence to support its claims of libido enhancement . They explain : <p> And while all alcohol in moderation helps a bit when it comes to sexual pleasure and desire , none has more benefits than red wine , both for males and females . For the ladies , red wine causes the sex drive to be even more pronounced than with other drinks , at least according to a group of Italian researchers who discovered that the compounds in the wine actually enhance levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers uncovered was that the red wine specifically increased blood flow to women 's erogenous areas , which in turn led to increased levels of desire .

Moderation , it seems , is key . <p> The news is equally bright for gentlemen : <p> For men , not only does a drink or two loosen things up and increase blood flow to essential areas , but red wine also seems to increase levels of testosterone in the blood , a necessary hormone when it comes to male sexual arousal and " appetite .

Cabinet will have a very low tolerance for failure . <p> The minister left little wiggle room : the Australian Public Service will meet ambitious new targets to employ and do business with more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people . <p> That is the message cabinet has delivered to federal mandarins ahead of Close the Gap Day , and any failure will be noted , says Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion . <p> The new targets , announced today , are to have 3% of the Commonwealth government 's procurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its workforce indigenous by 2018 . Speaking at a lunch event at Parliament House hosted by indigenous business council Supply Nation , Scullion did not mince words as he explained how public servants would be held to meeting them , and what would happen if they do n't . <p> " I will be watching , " the minister said of the employment target . " This is a KPI to secretaries . This is a KPI for department heads . If it 's something you fail in , we will note that failure , and movement up and down the political scale within the public service will no doubt take place . " The remarks could be interpreted as a threat that failure could result in a loss of ministerial confidence . <p> According to Finance Minister Mathias Cormann 's calculations , the procurement target would equal about 1,500 contracts annually by 2020 , worth about $135 million in total based on an average contract value of $90,000 . That would be more than 20 times the current spending with indigenous businesses , which the ministers put at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 's something you fail in , we will note that failure , and movement up and down the political scale within the public service will no doubt take place . " <p> Department of Human Services national procurement manager Phil Lindenmayer said public servants working in procurement had rarely used the exemption -- which allows them to bypass an open tender and go straight to a majority indigenous-owned business -- because they were used to going through a well-established , standardised process , and were often very busy . Momentum has been building however , with successful indigenous-owned companies trying to raise awareness of the mechanism within the APS . <p> Agencies will be expected to meet interim targets every quarter and if they are n't on track to meet them , the question from the minister will be : " Why not ? " <p> " And it 's going to be tough , " said Scullion . " It 's going to be tough in an employment environment where the Commonwealth public service is not in expanding mode , but certainly in the area of procurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we will need to award , within each government portfolio , around about half a per cent of their contracts to indigenous businesses in 2015-16 , with this increasing each year until 2020 . " <p> If progress towards the interim targets is going better than expected , " that number will change and it will only change going upwards " . <p> " This is not an aspirational target ; this is something that will be achieved . " <p> In a significant shift , the tough new policy also requires agencies to check if they can go to an indigenous supplier first before looking to the wider market . <p> Scullion said the rule applied to " anything from a box of pencils to a hundred million dollar contract ... and only after you 've exhausted those enquiries , will you then go to the open market " . He also made clear that the policy had the prime minister 's imprimatur and said progress towards the targets would be made public : <p> " In terms of public accountability and transparency , the prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each agency head will be accountable for meeting their share of both of these targets . Again , for the first time , KPIs for the secretaries and the heads of departments . <p> " We will be transparent about this ; the Commonwealth performance as a whole will be reported and published every year and for those department heads who are not doing so well , they 'll probably see more of me than they like . So we will know , as a nation , what each portfolio target is , the number and value of contracts that every Commonwealth government portfolio secures with indigenous business . " <p> Scullion spoke of a belief that workplace diversity is good for any organisation 's workforce , and challenged corporate Australia to follow the government 's lead . Currently , about 2.6% of federal public servants are First Australians . " That 's obviously not enough , " he said , explaining the new employment target aimed to have the same proportion of indigenous people in the APS as in the general population . <p> " This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved , " he said bluntly . " ... I 'm very , very confident that the secretaries of the departments , and the individuals in the departments who already enjoy the input of Aboriginal and Islander people across the service , will be working extremely hard to ensure that we meet those lines . " <p> " ... This is something that I 'm declaring is just simply going to happen , and I will be , as will be every one of our heads of our ministry , in a political sense , all of our ministers will also be keeping a very careful eye on this and ensuring that we 're working with people . If there are particular difficulties , we want to know why that is , and how else government can move to ensure that this happens . " <h> Supply Nation joins the dots <p> One way for government agencies to connect with indigenous-owned suppliers is through Supply Nation , which certifies that a business is 51% or more owned by people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent , and charges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To aid the new policy , the list of certified businesses will be made public from July 1 and expanded as well as having a search engine and more detailed information added about each supplier 's capabilities . It will also be faster for indigenous-owned businesses to register . <p> " Currently we have a register that consists of Supply Nation certified suppliers , and we make that available to our member organisations , " board member George Mifsud told The Mandarin . " What we 'll be doing is working with government and other indigenous organisations to add to the register , make it bigger , and then make that publicly available . " <p> Mifsud said paying members of Supply Nation would still receive " additional benefits " and " sophisticated matching services " even after the list becomes public , and that a new category was being added for companies that are half indigenous-owned in order to bring partnerships and joint ventures into the fold . <p> " We 'll have two categories , " he explained . " One is our indigenous certified groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more indigenous owned -- and the other group are what we call recognised , not certified , but recognised indigenous businesses , and they 'll be 50-50 indigenous-owned businesses . " <p> As well as supporting financial independence for more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by supporting businesses they own , Scullion said the new procurement target would also increase indigenous employment . <p> " We know that an indigenous-owned business is around a hundred times more likely to employ an indigenous person than otherwise ; it 's just a fact , " he said . " And part of that , in my observations , has been Aboriginal people prefer to work in a place , unsurprisingly , where they 're not the only Aboriginal person there . " <p> But indigenous business owner Leigh Harris says that 's not always the case , and questions why the definition of indigenous-owned -- both under the Commonwealth Procurement Rules exemption and Supply Nation certification -- refers only to ownership , not the number or proportion of indigenous employees . Harris says his Cairns-based graphic design company Ingeous Studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified by Supply Nation but after initial enthusiasm , he decided not to support the organisation because he felt it was " not walking the talk " . <p> " It 's always been my argument that they need to have some sort of certification level in Supply Nation of indigenous employment , " he told The Mandarin . " I know for a fact that -- even though Supply Nation will rebut this -- I know there 's a number of businesses certified by Supply Nation that have a majority non-indigenous staff . " <p> Mifsud says that while employment is important , Supply Nation is focused on fostering indigenous financial independence and getting more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into leadership positions in the corporate and government sectors . <p> " Whilst we very much support organisations who employ indigenous Australians , and employment 's a very important part , that 's not the area that we play in , " he told The Mandarin .

Thus , Israel is governed through coalitions , with traditionally the largest party selected by the President to form the government . <p> Because no party has ever won a majority of seats ( or 61 ) in Knesset since the state was established in 1948 , governments are always formed as a result of intense coalition bargaining , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling them to sign deals with larger ones in return for cabinet positions and prioritizing their policies on the national agenda . <p> No fewer than 26 parties are running lists of candidates in this election . What 's more , polls show that between 10 and 11 parties will pass the election threshold of 3.25% ( recently raised from 2% ) to sit in parliament . Given a newly restructured Israeli political map , what are the most likely coalitions that could form after Tuesday ? What would these coalitions offer for Israeli domestic policy and the long-stalled peace process with the Palestinians ? <h> A rare opportunity ? A Unity-Centrist Government <p> Although unity governments , composed of blocks of left-wing parties led by Labor and those led by right-wing Likud have occurred only four times in Israel 's history , the creation of two new centrist parties ( which together poll around 20 seats ) presents a unique opportunity for a new kind of unity government . <p> In such a government , Labor ( in its current reformulation as the " Zionist Camp " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would coalesce with " Yesh Atid " ( " There is a Future " ) and " Kulanu " ( " All of Us " ) , both centrist parties . <p> Yesh Atid and Kulanu focus on domestic economic issues such as lowering the cost of living and redistribution , and appeal for support to the disgruntled Israeli middle class which turned out on mass to the 2011 summer protests . With Likud and Labor in the coalition , such a government could feasibly include 66 to 70 of the 120 Knesset members . <p> Such a government , composed of left and right with secular centrist parties , could advance major changes in Israeli domestic politics , including promoting a stronger separation of religion and state , providing economic benefits for families in which all adults are working , enticing ultra-orthodox and Arab-Israeli youths to take part in Israel 's military or national service , and possibly advancing the formation of a constitution ( a process which has seen only incremental advances since Israel 's foundation . ) <p> However , given that this coalition would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atid leaning more to the left and Kulanu more to the right ) , it is likely only to lead Israel further into a stalemate regarding possible resolutions of the Palestinian conflict . Deadlock has for too long been the status quo . Given the importance of security and international diplomacy in Israel , such a government , while stable in principle , may be very short lived . <h> The usual suspects : Another right-wing government <p> Since the start of the Second Intifada in 2000 and the departure of the last Labor government , the Israeli political map has shifted to the right of the Likud . <p> In response to Ariel Sharon 's Disengagement from Gaza and Netanyahu 's failure to deepen Israel 's hold of the West Bank fast enough , young leaders have left in frustration to form their own small parties . Accordingly , Likud could still remain the leader of the largest right-wing block in the Knesset , despite having lost both MKs and constituents , and possibly not even being the largest party to emerge from the elections . <p> To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Jewish Home " ) , a party polling between 11-14 seats led by Naftali Bennet ( a Netanyahu prot ? g ? ) which champions the development of West Bank settlements and the promotion of religiously oriented policies . With Moshe Kahalon 's Kulanu party ( Kahalon is himself another former Likud minister ) , other smaller , extreme-right parties sure to support a ring-wing government are : ( former Netanyahu confidant ) Avigdor Lieberman 's " Yisrael Beyteynu " ( " Israel Our Home " ) party , and Eli Yishai 's " Yahad " ( " Together " ) . Both espouse different forms of racial separation between Jews and Arabs . From the ultra-religious block , the " Shas " and " Yahadut ha-Torah " ( " The Jewish Torah " ) parties , which routinely swap allegiances for budgetary allocations for their constituents , could likely be persuaded to join such a union as well . <p> Such a right-wing coalition , with the Likud ironically as the most left-leaning party in the mix , could create a dangerous situation of rising extremism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its original right-wing expansionist agenda in the Palestinian Territories . <p> If such a right-wing coalition wins a majority , it is likely that little would change on the security-diplomatic front . <p> Lip-service would be devoted to advancing a settlement with the Palestinians while simultaneously promoting a status-quo situation ( with a slight deepening of Israeli control ) in the West Bank , along with a continued hard-line offensive strategy vis- ? -vis the Hamas-held Gaza Strip . <p> On the domestic front , a right-wing coalition with religiously-oriented parties as core partners would likely undo recent changes ( ironically put in place by the outgoing Netanyahu government ) requiring ultra-orthodox Jews to serve in the IDF , while economic policies would likely continue as they have in the previous years . <p> At the same time , however , the ongoing problem of explaining hawkish security policies to the international community would likely continue as well , compounding the escalating clashes between the Likud and other parties in Knesset and causing instability in the coalition . <h> What about a resurgence of the Israeli left ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government since 2001 , the current elections may present the opportunity that the party has been waiting for . <p> Yair Lapid , the charismatic leader of the Yesh Atid party , has openly expressed his disappointment in the Netanyahu government ( where he sat as Minister of Finance for the last two years ) , and his party would likely join with Labor , and the smaller left-wing Meretz party . Based on the " Zionist Camp 's " secular and socialist leanings , the Kulanu party could possibly be persuaded to join as well . <p> A question remains regarding where the remaining backing for the coalition would come from . Two options exist . <p> The first-ever joint list of Arab parties has been formed for this election ( a response by individual Arab parties to fears of not passing the raised electoral threshold ) , and could provide the coalition with a critical block of 12 to 13 seats . <p> However , Arab participation in an official coalition would be unprecedented , and with demands from the Arab parties for collective rights and national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will on both sides for such a monumental shift towards accommodation with Israel 's Arab citizens . <p> Alternatively , were the coalition to emphasize its socialist agenda , it could attempt to court the ultra-orthodox parties Shas and Yahadut ha-Torah . Their entrance , however , would potentially alienate anti-religious parties such as Meretz and Yesh Atid . <p> While this balancing act is not new for left-leaning coalitions ( dating back to the days of Oslo and Yitzhak Rabin in 1992 ) , it does pose a serious challenge for Labor 's comeback . <p> As such a left-wing government would be weakened by its dependence on partners who are not " natural allies . " While all could likely agree on the security-diplomatic front of promoting a final settlement with the Palestinians , on the domestic level the parties would clash on issues of religion and state and economic as well as social policies . <p> Thus , while stability may be maintained if a diplomatic channel begins to form with the Palestinians , the failure of such a process would spell doom for the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map has seen much change in the country 's history - -- from a Labor-dominated coalition system , to a bi-polar one , and gradually to one that is highly fractured . <p> In the current round of elections , the playing field is unusually wide open , and depending on which type of coalition forms after Tuesday , we could be seeing a new phase beginning in Israeli politics .

Tesco , wounded by an ill-fated global expansion strategy and an accounting scandal , has reported resurgence in sales over the past 12 weeks . <p> J Sainsbury Plc this week posted its fifth consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales declines , and while it says there is evidence things have turned a corner , food price deflation will persist for the rest of the year . <p> Still , the sacrifice that chains such as Tesco have made to fund savage price cuts is obvious the minute you walk into one of the hundreds of supermarkets dotted around central London .

While it was the financial crisis in 2009 -- which originally prompted consumers to switch to discount groceries -- which underpinned Aldi and Lidl 's rise in the UK , lower commodity prices and stiff competition sparked a price war late last year , which is hurting everyone . Long-term grocery inflation in Britain has typically been 4 per cent but is now down 1.6 per cent year-on-year , according to global consumer research firm Kantar . <p> " Those big four retailers , broadly as a group , have been losing market share since 2009 .

" <p> Kantar 's latest market share figures have Tesco at 28 per cent , Asda at 17 per cent , Sainsbury 's at 16.8 per cent and Morrisons on 11 per cent . Lidl has a 3.5 per cent share . While the discounters ' share of the market is still dwarfed by the incumbents , their growth rates are far higher and there are estimates that half the households in the UK do at least some of their shopping there . <p> A spokeswoman for Lidl , which has 620 stores in Britain , told the Financial Review there were currently no plans to open in Australia .

They intend for the off-contract Chris Sandow and Hopoate to be part of that seven , however both would have to take substantial pay cuts to remain at the Eels . <p> Sandow is in the final season of a heavily back-ended four-year deal , understood to be on $800,000 for this season , while Hopoate is earning in excess of $700,000 this year . <p> " We can keep everyone that we want to keep but we wo n't be overpaying for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our market or out of our price range , then so be it .

" If you go back a few years when we bought some players towards the end of their careers and paid a lot for them . I would have preferred we had taken a punt on three or four local juniors .

" <p> The fact Peni Terepo and Ryan Morgan are among some of the highest-paid players at the club speaks volumes of the predicament the Eels found , and still do find themselves in trying to manage their salary cap . <p> Which is why some question how the Eels can fit Foran , as well as his former teammate Anthony Watmough , in the cap and still have enough money to be active in the market . <p> " Do n't believe everything that 's out there about the dollars we 've paid for Kieran , " Seward said .

" muses the Prince to Cinderella in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical . It 's a question that many great thinkers have struggled with in some form or another . Is beauty a " thing " which exists independently of the beholder ? How far can physical attractiveness be disentangled from concepts like character and emotion ? And how does our intimate knowledge of an object affect how we rate its beauty or ugliness ? <p> This is a true Greatest Hits of Greek art -- the first room alone juxtaposes the Parthenon Ilissos with Myron 's " Discus-Thrower " and the " Crouching Aphrodite " ( the last two being , like many objects in the show , later Roman versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear from the minute you walk in is that this is a defiantly traditional take on Greek art and beauty . Besides the selection of canonical objects , the narrative presented in the exhibition diverges very little from the familiar 1950s accounts penned by the likes of Kenneth Clark and Ernst Gombrich . The history of Greek art is conceived , once again , as a series of inspired innovations by individual male geniuses , enacted against the background of democracy , war and athletics . No paradigm shifts here , no alternative models -- just the comfortable , authoritative story of Greek art that we 've heard since the 18th century , albeit now enhanced with gorgeous lighting and multimedia . <p> Which is n't meant as a criticism . While the exhibition has already come under fire for perpetuating modern myths about ancient beauty , the decision to focus on canonical pieces is not per se a bad thing . For many visitors , the " wow " factor of these statues comes primarily from their iconic status -- that is , the fact that these are images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines and webpages . <p> And at the other end of the spectrum , the British Museum also has to think about how to present Greek art to people who are completely unfamiliar with it and who want to get to grips with the building blocks of art history before having them knocked down and provocatively reassembled . So while many visitors would have preferred a more unexpected and challenging selection of bodies to be included , on balance it makes perfect sense to stick with the old favourites . <p> At the same time , one ca n't help wondering if it might have been possible to do both -- that is , to retain the canonical artefacts , while simultaneously nuancing the definitions of beauty they embody . Some of the statements made in the exhibition are deceptively simple , and fail to indicate the multiplicity of viewpoints that we find reflected in ancient texts and material culture . To give one example : the centaurs are presented as " monstrous " and beastly , but ancient evidence indicates a more varied set of responses . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beauty of female centaurs , and the way " the delicacy of their female form gains in strength when the horse part is seen in union with it " . It is true that Philostratus was writing in a much later period of antiquity and that he may have been deliberately subverting established views of centaurs as ugly . But this just goes to remind us that even the simplest statements about beauty can not always be taken at face value . <p> Another effective tactic might have been to pay more attention to how these iconic blueprints have been appropriated and transformed in more recent periods . Defining Beauty does makes a limited gesture in this direction , by including a study by Michelangelo and an audio-guide interview with the editor of Men 's Health magazine . But how fantastic would it have been to see the ancient works alongside more recent pieces like Jeff Koons 's Gazing Ball series or Yves Klein 's Blue Venus ? <p> The exhibition 's curator , Ian Jenkins , suggested in a recent Radio 3 broadcast that including reception in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might then have alienated the British Museum 's many overseas visitors . But surely the benefits would have outweighed the risks ?

He then carried this drawing into the studio and showed the camera a huge painting called Dystopia , the last wetland , and how it was made using the carcasses of pelicans and bustards as enormous paint brushes . " I explained that one of the ways I try to bridge the gap , the disconnection between us and the earth , is by using the actual materials of which it is made in a performative way .

Photo : Simon O'Dwyer <p> " You are moving with nature , in a sense , to make the marks . " <p> There is no doubt Wolseley is a man of unusual methods . At his bush block , where the various buildings , including the living quarters and a " monumentally pompous studio " , are separated by 10-minute walks through the trees , he regularly cuts himself off from " worldly worries " . He describes the whole place as " an exploded house " but he and his partner , curator Jenny Long , are in a state of shock , he says , at the way forests on public land , such as around their property , are being " grotesquely overburned " , which he says will destroy biodiversity within a couple of decades . <p> He has another place in St Kilda but spends a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like East Arnhem Land . One Yolngu Aboriginal elder , Mulkun Wirrpanda , once proclaimed Wolseley her brother , or wawa , and gave him the name Langgurrk . It was high esteem for an English-born white man , but he is a person who has a natural understanding of the indigenous relationship with country : it is a concept he lives , rather than observes . He makes annual visits to the Blue Mud Bay region in East Arnhem Land where he and Wirrpanda hunt plants , paint them and eat local yams and tubers . <p> That 's certainly local produce -- and at Mason 's , a short drive from Wolseley 's block , the emphasis is strongly on Victorian produce , most from the local region . On our table there are fried zucchini flowers stuffed with Axedale olives , Meredith fetta and Simply Green tomatoes ; the carpaccio is Warialda beef ; and there 's a gorgeous little mountain of Mildura Black Mission figs with Holy Goat fromage frais , pomegranate , quinoa and parmesan crisps . <p> Again , all these delicious items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for the eye and they put us in mind of Wolseley 's own deeply beautiful paintings . He has just got the proofs for the new book about him and he is finishing up work for a big show at the National Gallery of Victoria that deals with the notion of waterways and wetlands from a spirited and concerned perspective : what we are doing to them , how they are crucial to biodiversity and how their deep beauty is what might motivate us to connect with , care for and protect them . <p> Wolseley 's work , like this food , might be beautiful but it is also intrinsically political : the food is a comment on food miles and the environmental benefits of growing and eating locally ; the art tells us about what we stand to lose , which is much more than any specific wetland system .

" When I go to certain types of landscape I do find ways of moving with it and trying to become in tune with it . In fact , I say that 's why I make paintings -- because they are a way of revealing the underlying shapes and rhythms . Art can be about a search for deeper underlying patterns .

You get to a stage where you want to celebrate it but also want to share with other people what you 've found in nature . But in the last 15-20 years it has become increasingly obvious , realising that so much of it is being diminished and destroyed . I now realise one of the reasons I 'm doing this artwork is to say to people ' Look , this is how it works and if we start pulling out bits of the cogs , the matrix of it will actually collapse ' . I realise , with this exhibition , that it is political in a sense because I am actually trying to say if I can show people how an ecosystem works , I can connect them again with it .

@@3148240 <h> The Invisible League Of Legends Attack Bug Riot Ca n't Seem To Resolve <p> Bugs and glitches are an unfortunate fact of life that usually just have to be tolerated when playing a game as hugely popular as League of Legends . The story of one such bug that 's teetered between irritating and insufferable got a lot more interesting this week after a player figured out how to reproduce it . <p> The bug in question affects Nidalee , a popular champion who 's already been a hot topic of debate amongst League players for a while since she 's currently so powerful that people go back and forth incessantly about whether or not she 's due for some sort of rework or nerf . One of the main things that makes her such a formidable ( and therefore often irritating ) character to go against in League is her special attack known as " Javelin Toss " . As the name suggests , the attack involves Nidalee hurling her spear at an enemy . <p> While it can be dodged , the spear takes away a substantial chunk of a target 's health bar if it is n't . The technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear bug " , renders her javelin , well , invisible right after she throws it using her special attack . If it 's invisible , it 's obviously much more difficult -- if not impossible -- to dodge . <p> Given how competitive the climate of League of Legends is , Nidalee 's invisible spear bug has sparked calls from fans for Riot to disable the champion until the bug is resolved . She actually was suspended as a playable champion at one point late last year , but for a separate and unrelated technical issue . The invisible spear bug , on the other hand , has remained as one of those intermittent **36;448;TOOLONG issues because it never seemed to appear often enough to warrant anything as drastic as pulling her out of the game . <p> This week , one player who goes by the handle " FLASHnFUSE " on YouTube posted on the League of Legends forums showing how he 'd managed to reproduce the invisible spear bug twice in a row using a technique he 'd come up with by repeated trial and error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> And the explanation for how it was performed : <p> I reproduced this several times in an empty custom game ( and a full of beginner bots custom game ) . I did n't record until I thought I could reproduce it easily and spent another 3 minutes until I reproduced the bug twice in a row . <p> What I did to do this bug : first thing I did was swap the attack move click to right click instead of shift-right click . Made things easier . <p> -I would mash right click ( attack move click ) and the " S " key ( hold position ) to try to get the wind up animation to just the right point <p> -throw a spear at the very end of a wind up animation , when the attack has technically " left " Nidalee . <p> -reissue the attack command <p> -the auto attack will connect with the minion ( or tower , which tends to be easier to reproduce the bug at simply because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auto attack disappears , so will the nidalee spear . <p> The timing window for this bug is INCREDIBLY narrow , but the spear from Nidalee 's Q disappears when the projectile from her auto attack hits a minion and disappears . <p> The times this bug successfully recreates , the spear from Nidalee 's Q disappears as the auto attack damage is counted , but if you miss the timing on reproducing this bug you will not auto attack until well after you 've thrown the spear . I think this bug 's source is something to do with the client 's disposal of projectiles . <p> Admirably ( and adorably , if you ask me ) , FlashnFuse was clearly trying to highlight the bug and his discovery of replicating it to try and help Riot stamp it out of existence more definitively than they have so far .

Unfortunately , framing the story as one of sharks preying on the hapless does not treat the financial problems being faced by those on low or precarious incomes seriously enough , nor how they can be resolved . <p> Why are more than a million Australians taking out , on average , three to four small loans ( typically A$100-$400 ) each year ? Why have they only been doing this since the early 1990s ? <p> Low income Australians are in good company with their counterparts in the USA , the United Kingdom , Canada and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with remarkably similar proportions of people borrowing comparable amounts of cash . <p> In 2012 research we found that overwhelmingly , the reasons people were typically borrowing $50 to $300 for a fortnight was to buy food or necessities for their kids and pay mobile phone , utility bills and the rent . Nearly eight in ten of those interviewed were receiving a Centrelink payment . Very few thought the industry should be closed down as they had no alternative way of securing a small loan . Credit cards were not a viable option , as one woman with three young boys commented : <p> " If you 've got a credit card you 're always going to use it , you know . Like if we 're low on money and we need to do shopping , if we 've got $100 in my purse , that 's what we 're going to spend . But if we 've got a credit card that 's sort of like an infinity bucket . " <p> For many people , credit cards are seen as far too dangerous a product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a set price ( borrowing $100 for less than a month will cost you $24 ) and a set repayment time frame . Rather than seeing consumers of payday loans as gullible , brain damaged or drug affected ( though a minority are ) , our research found low income people to be sharp budgeters and savvy in finding ways to make ends meet . <h> Poverty industry <p> The report 's finding that most people get caught up in an expensive cycle of repeat borrowing has led to calls by the media and consumer advocates to further regulate the sector and even close it down . A financial counsellor interviewed for the study summed up what is wrong with this argument : <p> " It 's very easy for a bunch of middle class advocates , financial counsellors , whatever , to say this should n't be happening -- but walk a mile in the shoes of the people who have no other access . I think our entire premise should sit around that Centrelink payments are inadequate for people to live with dignity in this community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small loans for a number of reasons . Firstly , accompanying the deregulation of financial markets in the 1980s , there has been a general transfer of risks and costs that accompany disadvantage from the state to both individual households and businesses . As a result , there has been a decline in the social wage -- the public provision of health , education and welfare . Secondly , there has been an increase in inequality and precarious work . Thirdly , there are no other viable options . The No Interest Loans Scheme shown on the Four Corners program does not provide cash for day to living - the main reason people go to payday lenders . <p> This is the reason why commercial payday lending has only existed for 25 years . Today there are more payday shopfronts in the USA than Starbucks and McDonalds combined . This new sector is just one part of what Gary Rivlin has termed the poverty industry - which includes appliance rental stores and other consumer leasing arrangements , low-doc second hand car finance , pawnbroking services and dollar shops . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poverty Industry " describes how the poverty industry in the United States has thrived as social provisioning has ebbed , student loans have become established as part of daily life , inequality intensifies and work precarity becomes the new norm . <h> Beyond regulation <p> It is a knee jerk reaction by media and consumer advocates to frame small loans simply as a market problem that can be addressed by greater regulation and smaller fees . The short answer is no it wo n't . It is expensive to be poor , and the higher risks associated with lending to those on a low income means that any tighter regulation will abolish this now-established market and send it underground . Secondly , ignoring the wider societal issues that drive casual and low-waged workers to online lenders and welfare recipients to street front lenders leaves the status quo unchallenged . <p> People turning to payday loans are portrayed in the media as passive , easy prey and financially illiterate . However , as our Caught Short report and other studies suggest , a person taking out a small loan is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt in small amounts over short periods of time rather than putting themselves at greater risk of being overwhelmed by a ballooning credit card debt . <p> Narrowly framing one financial symptom of current society -- payday lending -- to be a problem resolvable through tighter regulation lets the Australian government off the hook , airbrushes away the real financial struggles of low income earners , and offers no viable strategy to resolve their financial crises . <p> Those wanting to make a difference should place their energies into supporting campaigns to increase the social wage and access to steady , well-paid jobs . Defending the minimum wage and social services fit this bill , as do grassroots initiatives to stop Work for the Dole , which has been shown as ineffective at moving people off welfare .

@@3160239 <p> You might have seen recently that swift parrots -- little green parrots that migrate between mainland south east Australia and Tasmania -- are headed for extinction .

To do this , we 've teamed up with Australia 's leading political cartoonists to raise money to support our research . <h> Parrot conflict zone <p> Swift parrots are one of only three migratory parrot species ( the orange-bellied parrot , also found in Tasmania , is also critically endangered ) , and they spend their lives following rich patches of flowering trees across the forests of south east Australia . <p> There are only around 60 orange-bellied parrots left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight , CC BY <p> Consequently , swift parrots pose big problems for those trying to save them , and are a regular subject of controversy . <p> Migratory species such as swift parrots are vulnerable to habitat degradation even in relatively small parts of their range . <p> This is because the entire population of swift parrots converges on small patches of flowering Tasmanian forest where the right trees occur to breed .

Birds looking for a place to nest are squeezed into remaining habitat where they are very vulnerable to other threats . <h> Sweet possums with a savoury tooth <p> Recent research revealed that on the Tasmanian mainland , sugar gliders ( a species probably introduced to Tasmania ) are eating swift parrots in extraordinary numbers .

Deforestation in important swift parrot breeding areas is still happening despite the link between forest loss and predation , and is the focus of ongoing dispute . <p> Given the severe threats faced by swift parrots , we considered it pertinent to reassess whether swift parrots still fit the bill for an endangered classification . To do this , we conducted a population viability analysis for swift parrots using information we gathered from four years of intensive research . Using data on swift parrot movements , predation rates and reproductive success , we modelled how swift parrots might cope with predation by sugar gliders . <p> Our results reveal that swift parrot populations are on track for population collapse within three generations as a result of sugar glider predation . <p> We show that even breeding on predator free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the species could decline by a catastrophic 94.7% . <h> That 's the good news <p> Our models are best-case scenarios : we ignored other factors that kill swift parrots ( collisions with windows , habitat loss , food limitation , inbreeding , disease ) .

Our models indicate that the rate of decline of swift parrots exceeds this threshold . <p> This is very bad news for the conservation of the swift parrot .

@@3186231 <h> The punishment of virtue - options for staying and safety planning for domestic violence <h> Joyce Wu <p> Fairfax Media 's recent coverage of domestic violence has highlighted the difficulties victims face seeking help or leaving perpetrators . It 's important for the public to learn about these complexities , to reduce the victim-blaming attitude of " Why did n't she leave him ? " <p> I used to work for the Women 's Domestic Violence Crisis Service , which provides information and refuge referral services for women . We took calls from women who recognised what they were going through was domestic violence , but were not ready to leave or go to a refuge ( or , as was often the case , there were no vacancies ) . <p> Often children are involved , and women worry about how the kids will react to living in a refuge and how it might disrupt their schooling . <p> Advertisement <p> Women also fear repercussions . Some perpetrators may increase the level of violence to try to regain control . I have heard the line " He said he 'll kill me if I leave " far too often . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : here is someone who is clearly being physically and emotionally violated on a daily basis . But they are not ready , or not able , to leave for a variety of reasons . The women often put other people 's interests and welfare above their own . <p> In these instances , a domestic violence worker would respect the woman and develop a safety plan with her . ( I am referring to the victims as " she " and perpetrators as " he " in this article , but do I recognise that same-sex domestic violence is a reality , and that there are cases of male victims of domestic violence ) . <p> Such a safety plan would list strategies to maximise the victim 's safety while she is still living in the same house as the perpetrator . <p> You start by identifying the risks : does the perpetrator own any firearms or weapons ? Do you live in a rural or remote area where it 's harder to get help from a neighbour , or to get mobile phone reception ? Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare key to a friend 's car ) ? <p> Then you work out the strategies : always keep some petrol in the car ; have all your documents ready to take with you ; if possible , store some clothing and belongings with trusted families and friends , give them a " code " word for when to call the police ; have your children memorise the police and emergency numbers , and be ready to call them ; during a conflict , try to avoid bathrooms and kitchens ( because that 's where the weapons are and because these rooms tend to be confined spaces , making escape harder ) . <p> I learnt that survivors of domestic violence are courageous and resourceful -- many already have such strategies in place . One woman ( whose husband was financially abusive and regularly took away her earnings ) had secretly opened a bank account , and always had about $20 worth of petrol in her car in case she needed to escape . Another woman trained her children to run to the neighbours for help if the perpetrator became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options and gives them back a bit of the control and power that had been taken from them . <p> Some anti-feminist groups claim women exaggerate the extent of the violence . From listening to the women I have learnt how often they minimise or underestimate the extent of the abuse they suffer . This is not because the women " asked for it " or because they are meek or stupid , but because they have been beaten and told that they are ugly and worthless , and that the abuse is merely " punishment " . <p> When you get this every day , gradually you begin to believe the lies that the perpetrator told you . You begin to believe you are worthless and that no one else would want you . Then you start to become desensitised to the abuse , as a way of coping . <p> The act of creating a safety plan can be a reality check on just how much abuse a woman is putting up with from somebody who is supposed to love and cherish her . <p> I remember working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if her partner was abusive ( he was ) , and she certainly did n't want to go to a refuge , because she could n't take leave from work ( most refuges are high security and residents have to give up work to avoid the perpetrator tracking them from the workplace back to the refuge ) . So we brainstormed ways to increase her safety while she was living with the abusive partner , to buy some time while she considered her options . Towards the end of our conversation , the woman paused for a long time , then said , almost incredulously , " I have to do all this , just to stay safe in my own home ? " <p> But a safety plan is only part of the solution . It 's not perfect . It does not guarantee the victim will be safe , and it does n't mean the victim is responsible for the perpetrator 's behaviour . The safety plan is there for victims while they weigh their options and work out what is best , from a limited range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors who are planning to leave , or for those who have left an abusive relationship . It is also something community services can provide to women without having to have in-depth expertise on the topic . <p> Ultimately , responding to domestic violence requires a holistic approach . It should involve everyone from the community level , to workplace , schools , government agencies , the police , and women's/domestic violence services . The latter have been doing a great job n the face of the constant threat of funding cuts and uncertainty : the ACT Women 's Information and Referral Centre , chopped to pieces by Joy Burch in the name of restructuring in 2013 ; or the replacement of feminist-run refuges with management by religious organisations who had no experience on the issue ( the case with NSW ) . <p> In highlighting the issue of domestic violence , let 's not forget the survivor 's priorities and perspectives , as well as keeping the support feminist-oriented . <p> Find resources about safety planning , and how to use technology safely , on the Domestic Violence Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people dealing with abuse or violence within their relationship or family . <p> Joyce Wu is a lecturer at the University of Canberra .

Ideally , the more proactive we are in preventing young people from becoming attracted to IS , the less reactive we have to be with dawn raids and massive deployments of law enforcement personnel . <p> Being proactive means that we engage young people before they become attracted to IS propaganda .

As part of that competition , later today ( April 20 ) in Perth , P2P will be launching a new app aimed at young Muslims . <p> Initiatives like these not only have the potential to generate some innovative ideas , formulated by the very target audience that IS aims to influence , they have the added benefit of involving youth in positive solutions to issues that affect them . <p> What if Numan Haider , Jake Bilardi and others like them were given the opportunity to create and become part of a global community of educated influencers dedicated to challenging violent extremism ? <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure that several young lives have already been changed for the better by providing young adults with an alternative that diverts them from the lure of Islamic State -- both online and offline .

@@3211230 <h> meet one of our observers <h> 21 April 2015 <h> Australia has a glut of bedrooms but a dearth of policies : Cameron Kusher <p> The last Census showed that across Australia we have ample bedrooms to cater to our population yet the lack of new housing supply over recent years along with increasing demand for homes has resulted in increases in home values . <p> Particularly in Sydney and Melbourne the escalation in home values over recent years has been strong while most other capital cities have largely remained on the sidelines . <p> The 2011 Census showed that at that time there were 21,507,717 residents of the country . The data also showed that there were 7,760,320 private dwellings which were occupied at the time with a further 10.7% unoccupied . Given this , and if we assume that everyone has a dwelling to live in , each occupied dwellings would have an average of 2.77 residents . <p> According to the Census data , on average occupied dwellings in Australia have 3.1 bedrooms which is theoretically more than ample bedrooms to house the population . <p> The above table which is lifted from the Census shows that there are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we exclude those labelled as ' none ' , assume the four bedrooms or more category is just four bedrooms and exclude those where the number of bedrooms are n't stated there were 22,866,601 bedrooms at the time of the 2011 Census . When you consider that many married couples sleep in the same room there is actually a substantial oversupply of bedrooms nationally . <p> The problem is we have a housing market and taxation system which largely discourages home owners from moving to more appropriate accommodation as their lifestyle evolves . Furthermore , the high cost of housing makes it difficult for some younger home owners to move into more appropriate accommodation as their family grows . <p> First of all , home owners are taxed via stamp duty when they buy a new home , if they also sell they incur agent commissions . Both of these factors act as a disincentive for home owners to move on a more regular basis . <p> The disincentive for home owners to move on a more regular basis is highlighted when we look at the turnover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record-high number of sales occurred in July 2003 when there were 59,414 sales over the month . In comparison over the past 12 months there has been an average of 40,561 dwelling sales a month which is -32% lower than the peak . <p> While sales volumes peaked in July 2003 , the national population was recorded at 19.7 million persons at the end of June 2003 . The latest data to September 2014 shows that the national population was 23.6 million persons which is 3.9 million more persons than there were in June 2003 . Despite the fact that the population is substantially larger than it was in 2003 there are now fewer homes selling . <p> Housing is one of the most heavily taxed asset classes ; the most recent data for the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) showed that over the 2012-13 financial year , $35.931 billion in property related taxes were collected by state and local governments . Looking at the breakdown of this data , property related taxes were collected from the following sources : 17% was land taxes , 40% was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3% was government guarantee borrowing levies and 4% was from other sources . <p> Stamp duty in particular is the most contentious of these taxes because it is only collected from homes which are transacted rather than being broadly taxed on all homes . Over a typical year only around 5% to 7% of properties nationally are sold , given this more than a third of all property related revenue is collected based on how many homes are sold in a given year . As I have mentioned previously , in my opinion shifting away from a turnover dependent tax such as stamp duty to a more stable and broad tax such as land tax would seemingly make sense as well as potentially improve labour mobility and encourage residents to shift into more appropriate accommodation . <p> While investment properties incur capital gains tax , the sale of a home that is owner occupied does n't incur any capital gains tax . If the owner occupied home is sold , agent commissions are payable and if a new home is purchased stamp duty would be payable . This is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrooms across the country , after the children move out of home there is simply no real incentive to downsize . Furthermore , many homes have seen significant value appreciation over the past 25 years so there is substantial equity in these homes which can be withdrawn by the owners . <p> As owners of owner occupied property enter into retirement , their tax-free home is also currently not included in the pension asset test . Essentially this means that if an owner has held their home for say 25 years they have likely seen a significant rise in the home 's value and can then retire and still receive the pension . Again , if they were to sell and re-purchase they would incur stamp duty so there is little incentive to do so . Most people enter retirement with little or no mortgage so excluding the family home from the pension asset test seems counter-intuitive as it creates an additional cost to the government for people who can afford to sell or take out a reverse mortgage in order to fund their own retirement . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little other than their home to fund their retirement so there would likely need to be some balancing with regard to this policy . You also do n't necessarily want to put pensioners in a position where they have to sell their home to fund their retirement and as a result have to move further away from their support network . <p> Australia needs to investigate ways to encourage greater household mobility along with encouraging people to shift over time into more appropriate housing . The removal of stamp duty would seem like an easy place to start along with including the family home in the pension asset test for retirees . Stamp duty removal would make it easier for home owners to move into more appropriate and suitable accommodation as their family life cycle changes . Including the family home in the pension asset test may act as a disincentive for retirees to stay in their large tax-free homes and would also reduce the impost on the Government to pay a pension to these retirees , many of whom have the equity in their home to fund their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement by moving to a smaller home . <p> The data clearly shows that there is n't an undersupply of bedrooms , it is simply that many of these homes are locked away from the market because there is no incentive to move homes . Incentivising home owners to shift to more appropriate accommodation could go a long way to improving supply-side issues in the housing market . 
@@3211231 <h> The changing world of architecture ACA series <p> Architecture is undergoing rapid change -- the challenge for architects is how to work within new procurement and fee environments while maintaining financially viable businesses . These topics were addressed at the ACA -- WA 's November 2014 discussion event . <p> Neill Stevens of NS Projects facilitated the discussion , with panellists Chris Palandri of Brookfield Multiplex ; Geoff Warn , WA Government Architect ; Richard Mann , from the Strategic Projects division of the WA Government ; and Graeme McLean of the Department of Building Management and Works . <p> Richard Young , ACA -- WA President , began the evening with a brief overview of the contractual changes he has witnessed in the industry over the past 35 years . He recalled more informal and relaxed times -- days , where contracts were often only handshakes or , if they were formal , were generally the standard RAIA client/architect agreement . These were also the days of fee scales , with 6% being the norm prior to the intervention of the Trades Practice Act . <p> There has been a fundamental shift over the years , especially in major projects -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frequently separated from the party for whom they are designing . Bespoke contracts and procurement methods have also changed , particularly in the last 10 years . There has been a move away from the traditional design-tender-construct process and we now have a variety of contract procurement formats including , but not limited to D+C and PPP . <p> So , how might architects operate effectively in this changing professional world ? Geoff Warn got the session underway by pointing out that architects need to adapt to these changes and meet the many challenges and opportunities presented . He argued that the architect will remain a key component in the delivery and procurement process even if their traditional role is presented differently . Geoff also suggested that we may see a move away from the larger practices that have evolved over the past 10 years and that we may see firms fracturing into smaller practices once again . There is evidence that this is already happening in Europe in response to a struggling economy post-GFC . <p> Geoff argued that architects will always remain an important part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in the chain . <p> Chris Palandri , of Brookfield Multiplex , provided a contractor 's perspective on the advantages of new forms of procurement , especially in the area of major projects . Brookfield has been managing D+C contracts for 20 years and they believe that their projects work best when they are managing the architect and consulting firms . In their experience , architectural firms that have done repeat work with Brookfield have developed their skills and adapted to the requirements of the D+C environment . This means producing designs quickly to meet the brief and the budget parameters . The key advantage to the client is in the area of risk -- as the risk is transferred to someone who is better placed to understand the risk , there is more certainty about the budget and variations are minimised . <p> Richard Mann , from Strategic Projects , presented the government 's view on the advantages of these new procurement methods for major projects . <p> He argued that clients are becoming more sophisticated , as are contracting and procurement methodologies , and that architects need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpen their time and cost management skills as a complement to existing design and technological capabilities . Richard also argued that the design profession will need to be more flexible to be able to manage the intricacies of hybrid procurement models and the different risk allocation involved . <p> He commented that government looks to the architect to drive the design and consultant teams to ensure that the initial design concept is translated into the finished product . In his opinion this is fundamental and is unlikely to ever change . <p> However , very complex projects require complex contracts . This gives rise to the modification of standard forms of contract with so many special conditions that they effectively become bespoke contracts . <p> The final panel member , Graeme McLean from BMW , provided a similar view . He supported the view that the value of good design is still paramount in these various delivery methods but they must deliver value of money ' . <p> Graeme pointed out that the government 's commitment to getting a quality design outcome has not changed . However , this needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of life ' , value for money ' and the increasing legal scrutiny of contracts , with key provisions and unfair risk being passed down the consultant chain . The government will need to ensure they have the variety of procurement methods available for a range of project types and sizes so that the smaller firms are not ruled out . <p> The seminar provided a useful overview of how the profession is changing in terms of the procurement and delivery of key projects . Concerns still exist with respect to the unfairness of conditions incorporated into bespoke contracts and the rise of D+C type contracts where the architect is distanced from the client . <p> Leigh Robinson is a director of Taylor Robinson and a member of the ACA -- WA Committee .

@@3211237 <h> Implications of recent court case for SMSFs and bankruptcy <p> A 2015 Supreme Court decision is both good news and a caution for contributions to super in the context of business failure . <p> A recent court decision demonstrates what can happen when a business borrows from a bank to make large super contributions to an SMSF , and the business then folds . <p> The Court of Appeal division of the Victorian Supreme Court handed down the decision of Australasian Annuities Pty Ltd 2015 VSCA 9 ( ' AA 2015 ' ) this year . <p> In addressing one of the lines of argument , the case suggests that the SMSF was entitled to keep the money . However , the other line of argument involved the application of a well-established rule , which meant that the bank was entitled to its money back . <p> The facts <p> Australasian Annuities Pty Ltd ( ' AA ' ) carried on a financial planning business . More specifically , AA acted as trustee of a family trust , and in that capacity acted as a service entity , providing management , administration , accommodation and staffing services to another entity , which held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions and the like . <p> On 7 May 2007 , a facility with a limit of $2.5 million was signed with Macquarie Bank . Security for the loan included a registered first ranking fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets and undertakings of AA . <p> Ten days later Macquarie Bank advanced $2.5 million to AA pursuant to the facility . <p> The sole director of AA had an SMSF along with his wife and sons . A significant portion of the $2.5 million was contributed to the SMSF . <p> The fortunes of AA appear to have waned and on 29 June 2009 receivers and managers were appointed in respect of AA . The receivers and managers were appointed by Macquarie Bank under securities conferred on the bank securing the advance made by Macquarie Bank to AA . <p> The receivers and managers of AA brought a claim in AA 's name against both the SMSF trustee and the financial planner who was the sole director of AA , aiming to recover at least some of the $2.5 million . As the financial planner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SMSF trustee . <p> AA 's first case to recover money failed before the Supreme Court in Australasian Annuities Pty Ltd 2013 VSC 543 . AA 2015 was the result of AA 's appeal , which was based on two main arguments . <p> The argument that the SMSF was a ' volunteer ' <p> The receivers and managers of AA attempted to claw back money on the basis that the trustee of the SMSF received money ' as a volunteer ' . In simplified terms , this was an argument that the money should be returned because the trustee of the SMSF had given nothing in return for the money and therefore should be forced to make restitution by paying back the money . <p> In a welcome result for SMSFs , the majority held that the trustee of the SMSF did in fact provide valuable consideration in exchange for the contributions , and therefore this aspect of AA 's argument failed . In an earlier High Court decision of Cook v Benson 2003 HCA 36 , the High Court had previously held that superannuation funds provide consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties had dealt at arm 's length . The majority in AA 2015 essentially followed the High Court 's reasoning . <p> The case illuminates that the valuable consideration given by an SMSF trustee in exchange for contributions are the obligations of the SMSF trustee to provide beneficiaries with the rights and benefits under the rules of the fund . These rights and obligations include that an SMSF trustee must : <p> - Administer contributions in accordance with the terms in the deed ; <p> - Keep and provide records and accounts to members ; <p> - Credit contributions to the appropriate accumulation account ; <p> - Effect policies with an insurer ; <p> - Invest money in accordance with the investment strategies of the fund ; and <p> - Give members certain entitlements to death and retirement benefits . <p> Had the failed ' volunteer ' argument been AA 's only argument , it appears AA would have been , overall , unsuccessful . AA did however have another argument . <p> This was the argument based on ' knowing receipt ' <p> AA also argued that the SMSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' knowing receipt ' . The essence of AA 's argument was that the SMSF must return money because the following two elements had been satisfied : <p> - Element 1 : the SMSF received property ( money ) that had been misapplied or transferred pursuant to a breach of fiduciary duty or trust ; and <p> - Element 2 : the SMSF received that property with knowledge that it had been misapplied or transferred pursuant to a breach of fiduciary duty or trust . <p> It was not controversial that the sole director of AA was subject to fiduciary obligations . In addressing the first element , the sole director of AA was unanimously held to have breached his fiduciary duties in borrowing money , mainly for the benefit of himself and his wife . The Court found that the financial planner ( ie , the then sole director of AA ) facilitated the distribution of the money to his SMSF to benefit himself and certain family members as though the money was his to do with as he pleased . The Supreme Court noted that the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the interests of the shareholders ( who were the financial planner and his wife ) . Also , AA acted as trustee of a family trust . Although the financial planner and his wife were beneficiaries of the trust , there were many other beneficiaries including various other family members and corporate entities . Naturally , such a wide class of beneficiaries is very common in family trusts . Accordingly , the money that the SMSF received was transferred pursuant to a breach of fiduciary duty . <p> The second element that AA needed to prove was that the trustee of the SMSF had knowledge that the money was received in breach of fiduciary duties . The trustee of the SMSF had four directors , of which the financial planner was only one . As the financial planner was the most active director , the Court was required to decide whether he was the ' directing mind and will ' of the trustee of the SMSF . The majority decided that because the financial planner was the only active or knowledgeable director , was instrumental in the relevant transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMSF , he was the directing mind and will of the SMSF trustee . Accordingly , his knowledge was imputed to the SMSF . The SMSF was therefore held by the majority to have had knowledge ( through the mind of the financial planner ) that the money was received in breach of fiduciary duty . <p> The result of the above was that the trustee of the SMSF was liable to pay back money to the receivers and managers of AA . <p> Conclusion <p> AA 2015 reinforces that an SMSF does give real consideration in return for contributions . This is important for defeating certain claims that attempt to claw back amounts that have been contributed . <p> However , the case should also act as a caution to directors , trustees and their advisers that complex legal structures come with attached obligations that can be the undoing of the parties . <p> Perhaps the payment to the fund would have withstood the challenge if the contributions were made to a different type of super fund , such as an industry fund or retail fund .

Is it the bloody throat-slashings and eye gougings , the incestuous villains and their horrid children , the killing , the fornicating , the swearing ? Or is it , as Parks and Recreation 's resident uber-nerd Ben Wyatt puts it , that " it 's not just for fantasy enthusiasts ; they 're telling human stories in a fantasy world " ? <p> Until recently , Game of Thrones -- one of the most obvious pop-culture candidates for videogame adaptation , with its huge world and action focus -- had produced one solid Facebook time-waster ( Game of Thrones : Ascension ) , an unimpressive strategy game ( Game of Thrones : Genesis ) , and a middling RPG ( just titled Game of Thrones ) . By far the best videogame-related Game of Thrones experience was a full-conversion mod for Crusader Kings 2 , which reimagined the game 's strategic conflicts as a battle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a reskinned , tweaked version of an already very successful game rather than something built from the ground up with Game of Thrones in mind . <p> All of these games have had good ideas . The RPG was praised for having a well-written script , but also had poor performances , repetitive combat , and a general lack of polish . Genesis encouraged underhanded tactics in interesting ways , but was n't particularly satisfying , and failed to use the fantasy world effectively . Both games were developed by Cyanide , a developer who thankfully seems to have moved away from Game of Thrones for now . <p> Last year , Telltale Games -- who previously released the critically acclaimed Walking Dead episodic games , and who are also working on Tales from the Borderlands right now -- released the first episode of their Game of Thrones game . We 're halfway through the game 's season now , and with the television show back on screens as well , it 's a good time to consider how this series -- which has been largely successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form -- could inform future games . <p> GoT Ascent <p> Telltale 's Game of Thrones focuses on House Forrester , a family absent from the show and only mentioned very briefly in the books . As with Telltale 's other recent releases , the main gameplay element comes down to making choices during conversations and action sequences -- you do n't control the swings of your sword directly , but you might get to decide which throats to plunge it into . This tight focus on a single family allows the game to tell a more intimate , personal story , the exact kind of story that always works well on Game of Thrones ; the kind of story that tends to get lost among the hacking and slashing of some more action-orientated titles . <p> The game takes the larger conflicts of the show and narrows them right down , focusing on a family that , while loyal to the Starks , has no claim to the Iron Throne . The Iron Throne is a potent symbol -- it 's right there in the name of the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it exist in the background ( and on the game 's digital cover , because iconography sells ) . While the characters visit or live within numerous recognisable locations from the show , it never turns into a game of ' spot the references ' . Instead , Game of Thrones is really about what it takes to survive in that world -- it 's not about how good you are at killing your enemies , it 's about how you manage to balance diplomacy with self-interest , which parties you choose to appease , and whether you 're willing to kneel before the bastard you 're planning on stabbing later . <p> Telltale 's Game of Thrones series is at its weakest when it tries to directly tie in to the show . When Tyrion shows up , it feels like he 's there out of obligation rather than story necessity . When another familiar character pops up at the end of episode 3 , it 's hard not to worry that it 'll distract attention away from the more interesting relationship dynamics developing between characters introduced within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Game of Thrones -- because the world is so dangerous and interesting , you can throw new characters into the story all over the place and produce an interesting narrative about their struggles , their values , their take on the world . <p> These are all principles that could carry through to future Game of Thrones games . We do n't need a game where we play as Jamie Lannister on a killing spree , or pick a faction to seize the Iron Throne -- it 's best to focus on the smaller conflicts that arise from the big conflicts we 're all familiar with from the series . If a developer tried too hard to insert the player into the battle for the throne , they risk annoying fans . Keeping focus on characters not seen on the show allows you to achieve a narrative that slots in with the Game of Thrones canon neatly . <p> The Self-Titled Game of Thrones Lacked Polish <p> The obvious route for Game of Thrones to go down would be to produce an action-RPG , something along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the perfect studio to handle Game of Thrones -- their games prioritise characters just as strongly as the conflicts they 're involved in . They take their fantasy worlds , filled with aliens and monsters and magic , and use them to tell human stories . But a Game of Thrones game does n't benefit from being quite so grand as those titles were . Surviving in Westeros is an inherently interesting task , and providing us with interesting spaces to exist within is something games really excel at . Whoever develops the next Game of Thrones would do well to ignore the throne altogether . <p> Stay tuned as we next explore actual ideas and concepts within the Game of Thrones universe that could build off the above and become Triple-A games . <h> Follow Red Bull <h> Red Bull on <h> PRIVACY COLLECTION STATEMENT <p> Red Bull Australia Pty Limited ( Red Bull ) collects your personal information for the purposes of enabling you to use our website and make purchases via our website , for administrative and troubleshooting purposes and for the purpose of conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Improve regulations and transparency , or risk losing billions at the hands of rogue traders . <p> Back in 1995 , Leeson was a trader for Barings Bank in Singapore . <p> Things took a turn for the worst when Leeson began to lose money .

@@3284235 <p> Cheating in college has been with us since the inception of higher education . In recent months , cases of cheating , including large-scalecheating at elite colleges , have led to considerable turmoil . <p> Many of these behaviors could well start to take shape right at the level of high school . A survey conducted by renowned academic integrity researcher Don McCabe shows how widespread the problem is in high schools . <h> Large-scale cheating <p> In a survey of 24,000 students at 70 high schools , McCabe found " 64% of students admitted to cheating on a test , 58% admitted to plagiarism and 95% said they participated in some form of cheating , whether it was on a test , plagiarism or copying homework . " <p> Statistics for cheating for college students are much the same . Surveys indicate as high as 70% of students report some kind of cheating in college . These survey results , which have remained consistent over time , represent a variety of behaviors . <p> So , what could possibly lead to such behaviors ? <p> As Director of Student Conduct , I have been responsible for addressing these behaviors for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Association for Student Conduct Administration ( ASCA ) , an organization of over 3,300 professionals doing student conduct work at over 1,800 institutions across the US and Canada . All these positions have given me unique insights into the issue of cheating beyond my institution . And I can say these results are not at all surprising to me . <p> Students cheat for a variety of reasons : <p> It can be an intentional , calculated decision in order to get ahead . Often , it is motivated by the path to success that they see around them -- people cheating without incurring any real consequences . <p> What 's worse , society seemingly rewards these individuals for their dishonest behaviors . Students then come to believe that dishonest behavior is rewarded and often do not hesitate to engage in it . <p> My experience shows students engage in a cost/benefit analysis that goes like this : " If I cheat and do n't get caught , the reward is an ' A ' in the class , admission to a graduate/professional school of my choice or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't as bad as what Enron did , so the consequence wo n't be so bad . " <p> The example we set as a society is what I have found to be the most significant reason for students cheating . <p> This also gets combined with a pressure to succeed . These students have grown up in a culture where even the team that scores the least gets a trophy . So they are not prepared for failure . <p> When they believe they are going to fail ( which nowadays is often anything less than an " A " ) , students will do whatever it takes to avoid it , because they do n't want to let others ( often family ) down . <h> High schools are not teaching research <p> Another reason for student cheating is being unprepared for college level work . Over my many years addressing the issue of plagiarism , I have seen student after student who has written a research paper and not given proper attribution . This is not because they were taking credit for someone else 's words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a research paper . <p> I have had many conversations over the years with students who truly do n't understand how to write a research paper . So much of high school these days is teaching to the large number of standardized tests . As a result , learning how to research is being lost . <p> Also , students are n't being taught how to paraphrase . So , they just cut and paste from the articles they read on the internet -- it is easy , quick and takes very little effort to do this . <p> Some others do n't have any confidence in their own thoughts . So when given the chance to write a paper in which they must share their own ideas , they simply go to the internet and cut and paste someone else 's words or ideas , thinking they are worth more than their own . <p> I once had a student who cut and pasted large parts of her paper from the internet . When she was asked why she did it , she stated that the author had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was afraid of changing it using her own words , as it could be an incorrect interpretation . <p> This student lacked confidence in her ability to interpret what she read and then translate it in her own words . Another student once shared that he did n't know as much as the author he took his information from . He concluded , " Why would the professor want to hear the student 's own thoughts ? " <p> This has been a potential downfall of teaching to the test , as many of our secondary educators are being forced to do -- students are n't able to think and problem-solve for themselves . <p> And when they are forced to do so , they simply take someone else 's ideas . <h> Cheating could be a cry for help <p> Some others cheat because they have poor time management skills . College work is challenging , and some students underestimate how long it will take them . When they run out of time , they panic and take a shortcut . <p> Sometimes these students also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally , some students cheat because it is a cry for help . I will never forget a student I met with many years ago for a cheating case . <p> He admitted responsibility and accepted the consequence of a failing grade in his class . I felt convinced that he truly learned from this incident . However , within the week , he was accused of engaging in the very same behavior in the same class again . <p> This was very early in my career , and I was ready to remove him from our institution . However , as I found out more , I learned that his girlfriend had just broken up with him , his grandmother ( to whom he was very close ) had recently passed away and his mother had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer ( I did actually have proof of every one of these events ) . <p> The combination made it impossible for this student to focus on his academics . While these incidents certainly did n't excuse his behavior , they helped explain why he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help . It was only when there appeared to be no other option , did he open up about what he was dealing with . I was able to hold him accountable appropriately while also making sure he had access to the resources that would help him address his current emotional state . <p> He went on to graduate from the institution once he was able to get his life back together . Had his faculty not bothered to address the behavior , he would have likely dropped out . <p> I have never forgotten the lesson this student taught me . <h> What can administrators , faculty do to help ? <p> I learned to ask more questions . Now , I try to dig a little deeper when trying to find out why a student made a certain choice . Additionally , it has shaped how I present to faculty on the importance of reporting cheating . <p> So often I hear from faculty either that they do n't want to be the reason a student gets into trouble , or that they should n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of this student , it reframes for faculty the importance of reporting . It really is n't about getting the student in trouble ; rather , it is about making sure someone with training can interact with the student to help and set the student up for success when dealing with life 's challenges . <p> When faculty see it as potentially helping the student , they become much more willing to report . <p> Cheating is a challenge for our society , both at the high school and college levels . We need to remember , however , that it is rarely a thought-out , premeditated act . More often , it is an impulsive act . <p> To have a real impact , we need to address the underlying issues . <p> Tomorrow : Students cheat for good grades . Why not make the classroom about learning and not testing ?

But it 's unlikely Google will look kindly on it . Indeed , Williams hinted that this was part of the reason Adblock Plus did n't decide to go down the iOS route first , like most app developers . <p> " iOS is harder to develop on , it 's a walled garden that 's more difficult to get an API , simply put ...

I want to make clear that this is our first foray into the mobile solution and we are taking a scalpel to rather than a hammer -- doing one thing and doing it right ...

@@3287238 @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron ore inquiry ? <p> It looks likely that there will be an inquiry into the iron ore industry . The inquiry will probably look into accusations from Mr Andrew ' Twiggy ' Forrest ( of Fortescue Metals ) that the iron ore majors , BHP and Rio Tinto , have harmed Australia by expanding supply and driving down the price of iron ore , and explore suggestions from Mr Forrest that ore producers should instead restrict supply to restore prices to previously high levels . BHP and Rio have rejected the need for such an inquiry . But they should not be afraid of the opportunities an inquiry will present to clear the air . <p> An inquiry would particularly enable an examination of the obvious contradiction in Mr Forrest 's arguments . He is accusing BHP and Rio of collusion to drive down prices ; and his solution to this is collusion to drive up prices . He opposes collusion that harms Fortescue , and supports collusion when it benefits Fortescue . What a surprise . <p> Any inquiry would also examine whether Rio and BHP deliberately driving down prices ( or even colluding ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , and this has caused prices to fall to some extent . And a number of Australian and foreign producers are uncompetitive at these prices . <p> Advertisement <p> However , an inquiry would need to delve deep into the issue as there is no public evidence that Rio and BHP have colluded , and the ACCC has so far found no evidence either . Rio and BHP 's actions appear rational : they have capacity to expand , so why would n't they increase production if they make a positive margin ( ie their prices are still above costs ) ? Rio has also argued that if they do n't increase their production then someone else will . <p> Another possibility has beenraised : Rio and BHP are trying to drive other producers out of business , and once they have captured the market , then ramp up prices ( this is typically known as predatory pricing ) . However , it would n't be particularly difficult for production to be re-started at mothballed mines if prices get too high . So the potential for Rio and BHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , Rio and BHP ca n't be singled out for predatory behaviour : many other producers have been increasing their production ( including Fortescue ! ) .

It would just be a free kick to Brazil in particular . So any cartel agreement will need to include other major exporting countries such as Brazil . An iron ore version of OPEC , if you will ( although OIOEC does n't have much of a ring to it ! ) . <p> Superficially , there are arguments in favour of establishing such a cartel . The higher prices would make Australia as a whole better off : we would receive more for our largest export ; tax revenues will rise ; and the dollar will probably rise too , making Australian households better off ( because imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be magnified because the demand for iron ore is fairly unresponsive to price ( technically , demand is price inelastic ) . <p> But there are plenty of downsides to an iron ore cartel . It will damage our arguments against other production cartels ( like OPEC ) and harm Australia 's international efforts at collaboration in other unrelated areas . All net consumers of iron ore will be quite annoyed at us , particularly China , and retaliatory action could not be ruled out . In short , Australia 's global reputation would be trashed . <p> Advertisement <p> There is also the problem of maintaining a cartel . There are always strong incentives for members of a cartel to ' cheat ' and expand production .

But in housing , the reality is the opposite . The very mechanism we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation . <p> So it 's no surprise that true housing innovation locates on the fringes . What is surprising , and heartening , is that those bubbling fringes are looking really interesting -- even more in Australia than many more sophisticated bits of the globe . <p> Prefabricated and modular housing has twinkled on the architectural horizon ever since the socialist push this time last century , when quality mass dwelling became a holy grail . Genius French metalworker Jean Prouve , German Bauhaus-founder Walter Gropius ? and American wunderkind Buckminster Fuller each tried to design a mass-prefab that would mass-capture hearts and minds . Each failed . <p> More recently , corporate giants like IKEA and Toyota have entered the game , bringing technologies and systems from furniture and car manufacture , respectively . Given this techno-prowess , and the high-end architecture rep each country enjoys , we 've tended to accept their dominance of the field . <p> But there is a crucial factor missing : design . Of course , such houses are designed . But in the architectural sense -- implying a poetic and life-enhancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and the dire , playing deliberately to the design-agnostic end of the market . <p> By contrast , Australian prefabricated housing strives for a design edge . Associate Professor Mathew Aitchison , from the Innovation in Applied Design Lab at USyd , says Australian start-ups go for accomplished architects and " houses you 'd be proud to live in " -- a fledgling high-design tradition that " should be encouraged and cherished . " <p> A few examples in support of this counter-intuitive thesis : Tektum ( Sydney ) ; Happy Haus ( Brisbane ) ; Prebuilt ( Melbourne ) and Jigsaw ( Canberra ) . Each has a different approach and different strengths , but none feel like prefabs , or look like McMansions . <p> Many people 's first response to the idea of ready-made housing is " why not just live in a container ?

But you do n't have to live in the thing to reap the efficiencies of containerised transport . <p> Tektum 's modular , ultra-sustainable flatpack houses are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on site from their container-sized cocoon is faintly magical , like watching Princess Diana , as a new bride , unfold from her coach and four .

Summer-cool and winter-warm , it has sophisticated phase-change insulation that halves its energy bill and a flame-proof silicate skin that allows high-precision manufacture and still means you can rearrange your windows post hoc . Pretty cool . <p> Happy Haus grew from one man 's dissatisfaction with the cost and time blowouts of custom house-building and an idea , says director Lachlan Grant , about the " democratisation of architecture .

Most of these houses cost $200,000 to $400,000 . For about $2000 to $2500 a square metre ( compared to around $6000 a square metre for most architect-designed houses ) you can build lean , green , snappy , personalised and lovable . <p> I mean , sure . I 'm fond of the old hammer-and-nails approach . But it 's hugely inefficient , inexact and expensive . Housing manufacture , by contrast , could replace the dodo car industry .

@@3290231 <h> The most spectacular Russian military failures of all time <p> The Russian military has long been a bogeyman for the West , with Cold War memories lingering even after the fall of the Soviet Union . <p> However , over the years Russia 's fierce competition has produced a number of duds alongside its successes , as the country has scrambled to stay one step ahead of its geopolitical rivals . <p> The following is a collection of some of the most ambitious military projects that resulted in spectacular failures . <h> The Tsar tank has achieved almost mythical status since the unusual vehicle was first tested in 1914 . Due to weight miscalculations , its tricycle design often resulted in its back wheel getting stuck and its lack of armour left its operators exposed to artillery fire . <h> But it was n't Russia 's only tank failure .

@@3290234 <h> Ubisoft wo n't Syndicate mistakes of Unity <h> There 's nothing wrong with showcasing some pre-alpha warts . <p> Assassin 's Creed Syndicate was recently announced after a few leaks . Alongside the announcement , Ubisoft unveiled a 10-minute gameplay walkthrough to show off what can be expected when the game launches at the end of the year . It had its fair share of problems , too . Physics fails . Visible texture-rendering . Heaps of pop-in on a seemingly limited draw distance . <p> And that was absolutely the right stuff to include . <p> The video is branded with a ' pre-alpha ' label for the entirety of the walkthrough and , unlike other supposed alpha products , these are exactly the sort of kinks that should be popping up in a game at this stage of development . What we should n't be shown is a seemingly refined experience that goes on to become the buggy mess that Assassin 's Creed Unity was at launch . <p> To me , it means that developer Ubisoft Quebec has put time into developing the game in the correct sequence , instead of polishing a 10-minute section of gameplay for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of the final product . The pre-alpha label also means that it 's free to show off content -- features , characters , mechanics , etc. -- that may not end up in the final game . <p> For instance , the gang mechanics and the grappling hook look great in the walkthrough video , but may well change before release . The multifaceted grappling hook in particular is a bit of a game-changer for the Assassin 's Creed series in its current form . Free-running has been a staple of the series since the first Assassin 's Creed game , but it 's also something that 's been a problematic mechanic since the dawn of the series , too . <p> It used to be that free-running was separated into regular sprinting and parkour but , in more recent years , the dual-buttoned mechanic has been ' streamlined ' to a single button . This means a lot of the free-running is determined by what the game thinks you 're trying to do , and while that might work the majority of the time in an intuitive way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and has you launching backwards off a wall , or diving out to your death . At least , that 's my experience . <p> Unity attempted to improve the mechanic in terms of free-climbing descent , but it would appear that Syndicate is seeking to give players the option to bypass scaling entirely by essentially carrying around a personal elevator . The grappling hook also doubles as a zipline , meaning planning your rooftop waypoints on the run is no longer necessary when you can simply use a rope to fly across a gap . Assumedly , there will be restrictions on height and distance for the grappling hook , and there may even be a cooldown or limited inventory count to stop players from spamming it . <p> In its current form , it 's less controversial because I would assume that players still have the option of scaling , but those who want a greater fluidity of movement , the free-running pillar of Assassin 's Creed that has remained largely untouched since its inception may be forever changed . If the grappling hook works on release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be tricky to go back to a traversal system that does n't include it , at the very least as an option , in future Assassin 's Creed titles . <p> Syndicate 's combat looks more nuanced , too , with the walkthrough video emphasising unarmed melee fisticuffs with a flurry of combos . Much like the aforementioned free-running woes , combat has also been a longsuffering detractor , where enemies tend to only attack individually , and achieving victory is often as simple as mashing the counter button . While the multiple enemies gripe was n't addressed in the walkthrough video ( as far as I could see ) , the fact they 're looking at extending the combat options has me hopeful . <p> On top of this , Ubisoft Quebec has a playable brother/sister combination that helps make amends for the paradoxical omission of playable female characters in the four-player-co-op Unity . Given the series has consistently had playable female characters in multiplayer , and an entire game with a female protagonist ( Assassin 's Creed Liberation ) , this felt like a strange omission last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series who lost his faith in the series with Assassin 's Creed III , had it renewed with Black Flag , then saw it wane again because of the launch issues of Unity , I 'm again interested in the series because of the formula changes evident in Syndicate . Ubisoft 's willingness to include pre-alpha flaws and to not treat the status quo as unchangeable might just be the breath of fresh air the franchise needs . <p> This material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten or redistributed in any form without prior authorisation .

Stripping players of all the equipment they have amassed over the course of the normal game and adding a timer makes Bozak Horde all the more formidable . Developer Techland even inserted a warning into the DLC when you first enter into it , saying that the challenges ahead are extremely challenging and best met when playing with one or more allies in the game 's co-op multiplayer mode . <p> The forums on Steam and Reddit have been awash in posts both anguished and angry-sounding over the last twelve hours as upset players greeted the new DLC with discontent . <p> The problem most of these vocal players identified with the new DLC is that it 's really hard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , punishing , poorly designed way : <p> " This shit is impossible , " one player vented on Reddit .

@@3315234 <h> Michael Carayannis <p> Anthony Watmough has leapt to the defence of Parramatta teammate Pauli Pauli who is expected to come under scrutiny from the match review committee - for the lateness not the point of contact - on Monday for the tackle which forced Jamie Soward from the field . <p> Soward was upset at the perceived lateness of the Pauli tackle , who collected the Penrith half after he had passed the ball during Parramatta 's 26-20 win on Friday night . Former Test players Matthew and Andrew Johns also criticised Pauli for the tackle while Soward will learn on Monday how long he is expected to spend on the sidelines after hurting his shoulder in a tackle .

@@3327240 <p> Australia needs to have a housing conversation that is n't just about housing " bubbles " , profits and investment properties . Sadly , we punch well above our weight in international measures of poor housing affordability , and increasing numbers of Australians ca n't afford their rents or mortgages . <p> Even a modest increase in house prices will make things even tougher for these Australians -- but importantly , do we reliably know who they are , where they live , and how extreme their affordability problems are ? <p> Our new research reveals some poorly understood distinctions in unaffordable housing . Some people appear to be " slipping " in and out of housing affordability problems , while others remain " stuck " with them for long periods , or even a lifetime . <p> When we look at housing affordability in this way and compare these two groups of people , these " slipper " and " sticker " groups are shown to be very different within Australian society , with different intervention needs implied . <h> Limitations of the 30/40 rule <p> To address housing affordability and target assistance we usually rely on data on the prevalence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of housing affordability are based on simple ratios , for example , the 30/40 measure . This approach classifies people as being in unaffordable housing if they are in the lower 40% of the income distribution and their rent or mortgage payments exceed 30% of their income . <p> Such a simple , straightforward measure - that classifies people as being either in unaffordable housing or not -- is undoubtedly useful , and outside of the housing research community , data using these measures are rarely questioned . But it 's useful to think about that data a little more critically . <p> The picture of housing affordability portrayed by most of the measures we ( and policy makers ) rely on is a snapshot -- a point-in-time collection of people 's ability to afford their housing ( on Census night for example ) . Importantly , it 's a very blunt measure . In fact , when we look more closely at people 's experience of affordability problems we see that the snapshot is a pretty poor predictor of longer-term unaffordability . <p> For a great many households , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to other households - change a lot over time . This causes people to slip in and out of unaffordable housing . In a large Australian sample , we see that hidden within the segment of the population classified as being in unaffordable housing in any one year , fewer than half were classified in the same way the next year . Because the total number of people counted in unaffordable housing is stable , it points to a limitation in the way that we measure housing affordability . <h> Slippers and stickers <p> By following people 's income and housing costs each year for a five year period , we classify stickers as being in unaffordable housing ( using the 30/40 rule ) in every one of the five years . To be classified as a slipper , people must have made at least one transition into , and one out of , unaffordable housing over the five year period . Slippers outnumber stickers three to one , and therefore affordability initiatives may be more concentrated upon the needs of slippers . <p> Compared to slippers , stickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stickers have a disability , and stickers are twice as likely as slippers to be carers for other people in their household . Looking deeper , three quarters of those stuck for long periods in unaffordable housing are women , they also tend to be much older than slippers , and more likely to live alone . <p> This description points to what some might call a vulnerable group of people or even an " underclass " perpetually facing housing affordability issues and , most likely subject to the consequences of this , such as limited financial resources and stress . <p> It is interesting to note that the characteristics of the sticker population are very similar to those of Australia 's public housing tenant population , but because public housing largely addresses affordability by rent capping , stickers are most likely to be private renters and low income mortgage holders . <p> This means that , in addition to being highly vulnerable , many stickers are likely to receive little or no government assistance with their housing costs . It also implies a pressing need to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the taxation system or the land supply system . <p> Rather than looking at housing affordability as one problem , the distinct differences observed between Australia 's slippers and stickers imply a need to focus particular attention and interventions on stickers . We also need to better understand how people enter and exit unaffordable housing and what we can do to prevent people becoming stuck . <p> In the bigger picture our findings describe real social inequalities in Australia that are present and persistent . It reminds us that the conversation we need to have about housing affordability in Australia is n't just about the positives of " housing bubbles " , but also needs to be about how to address the serious affordability problems of the growing group of ( often already vulnerable ) Australians who are stuck .

@@3340233 <h> A whiff of Ruddishness permeates Tony Abbott 's government <p> Hopefully the Coalition will be taking notes on the ABC 's new post-mortem on the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd government -- on how to avoid being structurally unfit to govern . Aspects of the Coalition 's performance to date suggests it could do with the lessons . Any serious documentary would show that , vague concepts of fairness aside , the Rudd government had few principles , or any overarching framework , on which to set its decision-making . As a result , its policies become increasingly unhinged from anything other than solving pressing political problems or the daily news cycle . And so , for all the political frenzy and after the biggest mining boom in our history , Australia 's per capita income today is not much higher than when the Rudd government came to power in late 2007 . <p> What the first instalment of The Killing Season demonstrates is that apart from funnelling borrowed money into the economy when the global financial crisis hit from September 2008 , Labor simply ignored Australia 's key competitiveness issues : rising costs , sluggish productivity and the blowout in government spending . Before the 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless spending has to stop " . Yet the spending actually increased and became more haphazard and off the cuff -- as did the whole government 's whole approach to policy making . <p> The problem was , in office , that Mr Rudd behaved like a roving philosopher king , picking up on different issues each day , handing them up off to the bureaucracy to turn into concrete policy and then cherry-picking the most popular sounding bites to use . Examples abound . With the government 's 2010 Henry tax review , the only measure of note adopted was the ill-fated Resource Super Profits Tax , based on supposed economic rents that turned out to be transitory.The live cattle trade was banned due to one documentary of dubious provenance . Billions of dollars were thrown at producing a " green car " industry . The cottage industry of home insulation was super-charged with disastrous results . And a fishing super trawler approved through Australia 's sophisticated , fisheries management regime was banned on an environmental whim . <p> While Mr Rudd may have been chaotic , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions at arms-length . Julia Gillard did not . A creature of the party 's industrial 's wing , and progenitor of the Fair Work Act , Australia 's first female prime minister regrettably typified the webs of patronage and payback that have come to define the modern ALP . Her ascension exposed the absence of any framework on which to hang decisions apart from stressing the value of a good education . So , increasingly , government decisions seems to be aimed to keep power by throwing money at rural and regional Australia and by agreeing to the world 's highest carbon tax , by paying off the unions for their support , and to entrench new spending , with any thought of productivity running second . <p> This makes it all the more disappointing that the Abbott government appears to be losing its grip on both the budget bottom line and a competitiveness or productivity enhancing framework . Tony Abbott often seems to choose the politics over the policy -- immediately whacking Labor with every issue possible . Similarly , there are clearly tensions under the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he survived the backbench threat to his leadership in February . Some of the Prime Minister 's policy pronouncements have seemed just as ad hoc as under Labor : his now-abandoned paid parental leave scheme and his unwise ruling-out of many sensible proposals for spending restraint prior to the election now seem like ominous warnings . Joe Hockey 's venture into the world of Q&amp;A tax reform a fortnight ago was similarly fraught . Unless the government finds a coherent framework for entrenching Australia 's modern prosperity , the current whiff of Ruddishness could develop into a distinct odour .

Find out more here . <p> The point of any business according to business development specialist Mike Milward is to " do the business , invoice the business , and then collect the money for doing the business . " It 's this simple focus on what is ultimately the fundamental building blocks of any successful business enterprise that Milward highlights when he 's working with his clients to improve their performance and long-term sustainability . <p> But you can only do that , Milward says , if the things that are fundamental to your business , but often distractions from your core operations , are dealt with so that you can focus on building , doing and earning revenue from your business . <p> Milward says small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations because they have n't planned their tax affairs properly or indeed efficiently . <p> So we asked Mark Chapman , H&amp;R Block 's Director of Tax Communications , what he thought the keys to small businesses staying on top of their tax responsibilities were . <p> Chapman agreed with Milward and said that even though the burden of complying with the tax laws can often seem onerous that prior preparation is where it all begins . <p> " It 's essential to have good accounting and tax advice . Whether you 're starting out in business and want to know the best structure to use , looking to retire and want to know how to minimise your tax on exit or just want to know what you can claim on a regular basis as part of your trading expenses , " you need to talk to an expert he said . <p> Chapman walked Business Insider through that foreign land known as deductions . That 's the expenses you incur when you are seeking to make " assessable " income . Assesable for the tax man to then charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners blur the line between themselves and their business and often come afoul of the tax man for claiming expenses they should n't or are n't allowed to claim . But , he added that a surprising number of businesses also miss out on deductions they could have claimed . " In reality there are legitimate , not-to-be-forgotten deductions that almost every business can take advantage of , " he said . <p> Here is his list of " other " deductions businesses can claim . Do n't forget though , these are deductions from income , which reduces the amount of tax you pay by reducing that income . They are not dollar for dollar deductions from your businesses tax bill . <p> Advertising and sponsorship Costs to push your brand and garner publicity for your business are deductible and can be claimed , as can advertising or sponsorship to sell ' trading stock ' and to hire staff . Take care to ensure that the costs incurred do not fall within the definition of ' entertainment ' , which is not usually deductible . <p> Bad debts A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ' debt is an allowable deduction as long as it was included as assessable income in the present or even a previous income year , and that it is written off as bad ( uncollectable ) in the same year that a deduction is claimed . <p> Borrowed money Expenses incurred in order to get the borrowed funds can be claimed as a deduction , the proviso being that the money must be used to produce assessable income . These expenses can include legal costs , registration fees , valuation costs , fees to guarantee an overdraft and any commissions paid . But you may have to spread the deductions over more than one year , depending on the extent of the expenses , to cover for example the period of the loan . These deductions are quite separate from the interest actually incurred on the borrowed funds , which is also deductible if the borrowed money is used to produce income . <p> Business travel You need to record and document all particulars , but travel for business purposes can usually be claimed . So keep all receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets . Note the nature of the travel , its purpose , and where , when and for how long ( and look out for any personal activities that are mixed in as these expenses are non-deductible ) . <p> Car expense deductions You can claim a full deduction for any expenses your company incurs while running a vehicle , either leased or owned , provided the vehicle is used only for business purposes . If your business operates as a sole trader or partnership , you can claim certain proportions of deductions for vehicle expenses , but they are subject to substantiation rules . <p> Fringe benefits You can generally claim a deduction for any costs involved with providing a fringe benefit to an employee . <p> Home work claims If your work is done from home , or partly home-based , you can usually claim deductions for expenses such as interest , telephone , insurance and a portion of running expenses like heating , lighting or cleaning . <p> Insurance Workers compensation insurance premiums are deductible , as are insurance costs for fire , business-use cars , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equipment ( depreciating assets ) Larger items like cars or even buildings can be claimed over time as depreciating assets . And you may also be able to claim ( over a five year period ) certain capital costs in setting up or ceasing a business , as long as an outright deduction is not able to be claimed for that expenditure . <p> Repairs , replacement , maintenance A deduction is available for the upkeep of machinery , tools or premises used to produce assessable income ( provided they are not ' capital ' costs ) . These deductions include things like painting , plumbing and electrical maintenance , upkeep to windows and fences , guttering and machinery maintenance . Generally it means fixing defects , not totally replacing an item , and does not include improvements or work done immediately after acquiring an asset . <p> Superannuation contributions You can claim a deduction for a contribution made to your own super fund if self-employed , although care must be exercised if you also have some earnings from employment upon which super contributions have been paid by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deductible . Employers legally have to contribute to employees ' super anyway under the superannuation guarantee laws . <p> Salary and wages Operating as a trust or a company means you can claim a deduction for salary paid to employees or to yourself provided the salary is in respect of duties connected with the business . Partnerships ca n't claim for salary paid to a partner , but a deduction is available for salary paid to other employees . Sole traders ca n't claim for salary paid to themselves ( and you ca n't claim for amounts taken from the business for private purposes ) . <p> Tax management expenses Managing your business tax affairs can cost , and you can claim these as deductions . This includes paying a bookkeeper , having a tax agent prepare and lodge tax returns and activity statements , paying a subscription to an organisation like Taxpayers Australia , attending to a tax audit or the costs of appealing or objecting to an assessment . <p> Telephones For a telephone you use for business only , you can claim for calls and rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both business and private calls , you 're able to claim all business calls and a proportional part of the rental . An itemised phone account will guide this , but you can also base the claim on using a representative four-week period to get an average rate for the whole year . <p> Theft Losses incurred by theft or stealing by an employee may be allowable deductions . <p> And of course , for the next few years the Federal Government is allowing small business to take advantage of its instant asset write-off on any asset purchasing costing less than $20,000 . For the 2014/15 tax year that window has passed but if you are going to need new plant and equipment in the year ahead you 'll be able to deduct that from this year 's income .

@@3402234 <p> The University of Adelaide is planning to completely phase out lectures . In their place will be online materials and small group face-to-face sessions . According to University of Adelaide Vice-Chancellor Warren Bebbington , the lecture is dead -- and it is not coming back . <p> Lectures have been around for hundreds of years . They have survived other technological revolutions , including the printing press and the motion picture . Adelaide will be the first university in Australia to break with tradition and eliminate them entirely . But is this change good for learning ? <h> ' Flipped ' classrooms <p> The University of Adelaide 's move is part of a growing trend to " flip the classroom " by swapping what students do in class with what they do out of class . The flipped classroom is where lectures and other passive learning activities take place at home , while problems , questions and other activities that require socialising and interaction take place in the presence of the teacher . <p> This means students have to complete pre- and/or post-class activities to fully benefit from in-class work . <p> Research on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach is beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence-based practice yet . However , if we examine the components of this approach , the outlook is positive . <p> If the lectures Adelaide is ditching are monologues without any interactivity , then video is probably going to be a good replacement . Decades of research suggest this is not a great use of precious face-to-face time ; some have even claimed lectures are as bad for learning as smoking is for health . <p> Since the 1920s , researchers have been conducting " media comparison studies " where the same teaching approach ( for example , the lecture ) is applied to two or more media ( one is usually face-to-face ) . <p> These studies began with emerging approaches like correspondence courses and radio , and later progressed onto video teaching . When we pool together these studies we find , on average , that there is no significant difference in learning between different media -- assuming we teach in the same way . So learning wo n't be much better , or much worse , from a face-to-face or video lecture . <p> While there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in control . There is evidence that students fast-forward through parts they already understand , and re-watch parts they struggle with . Researchers call this " learner pacing " and it has been found to help students manage the cognitive demands of their studies . Learner pacing can even mitigate against some bad teaching approaches . <h> Ban lectures or just change them ? <p> If the choice is between being talked at non-stop for an hour face-to-face or by video , then please give me the video . The problem is , this is rarely the choice . <p> Delving deeper into the damning evidence on lectures , it turns out that only classes that were more than 90% passive listening were " as bad as smoking " . Walk into a modern lecture and you 'll be unlikely to find a 60-minute monologue . It 's more a caricature than a common practice . Bebbington claimed the lecture is dead , but really it just evolved . <p> The anti-lecture evidence actually just supports good lecturing practice : require students to spend at least 10% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures are long speeches , put them online . Or even better , divide them into smaller chunks first , as lecture video length strongly influences attention . But if students are already required to be active in lectures , then it 's a more subjective decision . <p> Another challenge of Adelaide 's new model is that class time becomes more dependent on students completing their pre-class tasks ( for example , watching the video ) . When students are n't prepared for their small group learning session , it turns a flipped classroom into a " flop " , because the teacher needs to catch up some of the students . <p> The good news is that flipped classroom approaches like Adelaide 's may help students develop a sense of autonomy , feel competent , and get connected with other students . Developing these attributes should lead to improved motivation -- and hopefully result in students preparing for class . However , this connection between flipped classrooms and motivation remains at best a theoretically informed hunch . <p> So , is the move to phase out lectures supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bans on any particular approach to teaching or assessment . It really comes down to the individual lecture , and whether Bebbington 's classrooms flip or flop .

@@3405237 <h> 10 Stubborn Sex Myths That Just Wo n't Die , Debunked <p> Perhaps you 've heard that size matters , women are naturally more bisexual than men , or that tantric sex means everlasting orgasms . None of these things is entirely true . Sex has been around forever , but we 're just starting to understand it . Today we 're debunking 10 of the most common sex myths to set the record straight . <p> I like sex as much as the next guy , but I 'm not going to pretend for a second that I 'm an expert . To help get to the bottom of each myth on our list , I requested a little help from some top sexologists : Dr. Debby Herbenick ( research scientist at Indiana University , sexual health educator at The Kinsey Institute , and author of multiple books including Sex Made Easy ) l Dr. Lindsey Doe ( doctor of sexual health and founder of Birds &amp; Bees ) ; and Dr. Amy Marsh ( clinical sexologist and sex counsellor ) . Let 's get down to business and find out what we do know . <h> Myth 1 : Penis Size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and shape of their penises , but do women -- or even other men ? And how much does it actually affect performance in the bedroom ? Some argue larger penises can create a more intense orgasm during penetrative sex . Others presume that men with smaller members make up for the difference with added effort . Debby says it can depend on the person but ultimately has more to do with a psychological connection than anything else : <p> To some people , size does matter . They may wish their partner were longer or shorter or thinner or thicker . The bottom line , however , is that research consistently finds that sexual satisfaction is more influenced by psychological connection , intimacy and relationship satisfaction -- not just the size or shape of a person 's genitals . In our study of more than 1600 men , we found the average erect length was about 5.6 inches , with most men hovering around that average . How two people connect through sex is typically more important than the size of the parts , however . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy agrees , and notes some men might underestimate what they 've got and that there 's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to genitalia : <p> Size matters to those who let it matter , and that includes men and women . People have and inflict too much body shame about genitals . Some even worry when they are " average " , For example , men who look downward at their penises ( or who have belly fat ) may see them as smaller than they actually are . Sometimes a larger penis may be " too large " for oral sex , but just right for penetration . Or a smaller penis may feel just right for oral sex , as it can be taken more completely into the mouth . Motion , rapport , depth of intimacy , lovemaking skills , and/or positions often have more to do with partner satisfaction than size . <p> So what should you do if you 're unhappy with the size of your package ? Stop worrying so much about what you 're working with -- whether too large , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use it to please your partner . Any partner worth your time wo n't reject you solely based on the size of your penis , and if they really want something different from time to time you can supplement your sexual regimen with toys . <p> On the other side of the issue , if you have a partner who struggles with his size , be supportive . If the sex is good , let him know . When it is n't , make suggestions that will increase your pleasure . It may be his insecurity , but good partners should help each other . <h> Myth 2 : Men and Women Reach Their Sexual Peak at the Same Time <p> When do men and women reach their sexual peak ? Some believe men get there in their late teens and early twenties while women experience their peak a little later in life . Debby believes there 's no real way to know for sure : <p> I hear this all the time and everyone means something different ( frequency of sex , enjoyment of sex , ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , I ca n't make full sense of it . Do men have easier erections at 18 than age 70 ? Sure , but the sex may be more meaningful and satisfying at 70 than 18 ( generally speaking ) . Enjoyable sex can happen at any age . It 's rarely all physical or all emotional . Sex is this fascinating place where our bodies and emotions and past experiences and future hopes collide , and that can result in something pretty spectacular at any age . If you think you 've reached your peak , forget it . The best may still be yet to come . <p> The same advice goes for those who have n't reached their peak . You should n't worry about it . So long as you 're comfortable with who you are , understand your own body , and remain reasonably open to new experiences , you should have no problem enjoying a satisfying sex life . Whether a " peak " comes or not does n't matter much if you 're having a good time . <h> Myth 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would n't it be easy if orgasms resulted from simply following instructions ? Just insert Tab A into Slot B , move it around for a while , and enjoy . Perhaps because it more often works that way for men , this unfortunate myth arose for women . Most do n't achieve orgasm from vaginal sex alone even though it 's possible -- anatomically speaking . Debby explains : <p> It 's not that simple to determine who " can " have an orgasm from a certain type of sex ( after all , whether someone has an orgasm during sex depends on more than just their ability , but also on how they feel about their partner , their partner 's technique , etc ) . And when women have orgasms from penile-vaginal intercourse , it 's not always clear-cut how exactly the orgasm came to be . After all , the clitoris has inside parts and outside parts and intercourse stimulates both . The vagina , including the G-spot area , is also stimulated during intercourse as are nerves around the cervix , including the vagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continuing on that theme , Amy notes that orgasms can occur in all sorts of ways : <p> Human beings can achieve orgasm in all kinds of ways . Mary Roach , author of Bonk , found a woman who could think herself to orgasm and another who orgasmed while brushing her teeth . However , the persistent emphasis on vaginal orgasm at the expense of clitoral stimulation is incredibly damaging . It 's more accurate to say that the " majority of women " will need some kind of consistent clitoral stimulation in order to experience orgasm . And we should also remember what sex researcher Mary Jane Sherfey asserted as long ago as 1966 : " the clitoris is not just the small protuberance at the anterior end of the vulva . " <p> So how do most women achieve orgasm ? Debby breaks it down : <p> What we do know very clearly is that women and men experience orgasm through diverse sexual behaviours . According to data from our 2009 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behaviour , most women ( about 2/3 ) have orgasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaginal , clitoral , breast or other kinds of stimulation . And yet in another study , nearly 1/5 of women reported preferring oral sex in order to have an orgasm . <p> We can examine statistics all day , but ultimately we still have a problem : orgasms are less common for women than men . For women who have difficulty achieving orgasm , Debbie recommends reading Sex Made Easy and Becoming Orgasmic for a little help . <h> Myth 4 : Men Ca n't Have Multiple Orgasms <p> Men are known for shutting down and going to sleep post-ejaculation ( for biological reasons ) , so the idea of multiple orgasms sounds almost ridiculous to many people . That said , it happens . Some men can do it naturally , but most have to work pretty hard . Amy explains : <p> Men can , but it 's usually learned skill involving Taoist or Tantric techniques which include breath control and making a distinction between ejaculation and orgasm . You can find these techniques in books like Mantak Chia and Douglas Abram 's account of Taoist sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that sex researchers William Hartman and Marilyn Fithian said that 12% of men they 'd studied were reporting multiple orgasms . <p> Debby notes that there are some men who can ejaculate repeatedly , however : <p> There are the rare men who can ejaculate over and over again , kind of how many women can orgasm repeatedly . Why this differences occurs is not well understood -- and there 's no sense it can be taught ( these men seem to have some physical differences from other men ) . <p> While some men can ejaculate more than once , most ca n't and never will . That said , men looking for more than a single orgasm can teach themselves to achieve them . <h> Myth 5 : Women Are Naturally More Bisexual <p> Females are generally considered a more fluid gender in regards to sex , but does that mean men are less likely to be bisexual ? According to Lindsay , the answer is pretty straightforward : <p> Nope . While there is no consistent data on how many people identify as bisexual , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as there are women . Sexual orientation is natural , and no more for one gender than others ; it may be more socially acceptable and therefore easier for women to express more flexibility or fluidity with their sexualities but this does not equate to their identities nor does it exclude the men who experience attraction for their sex and other sexes . <p> Debby concurs , citing a few studies of her own : <p> Sizable minorities of women and men have had sex with same-sex partners . For example , in one of our national studies , we found about 15% of women had had oral sex with another woman and about 11% of men had had oral sex with another man . Far fewer women and men identify as gay or lesbian or bisexual . Research suggests that both women and men may be somewhat " fluid " in their sexual feelings and behaviours . <p> Why is this myth so prevalent ? It might have to do with higher amounts of " lesbian " pornography aimed at straight men , or a perceived cultural preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of factors may have contributed to this misinformation , it all started with a 2005 New York Times article that argued bisexual men do not exist . More recently , that study was finally debunked . Bisexual men have known this for years that they exist , but now science is finally backing them up . Tell your friends ! <h> Myth 6 : Tantric Sex Means Orgasming for Hours <p> Ever since Sting essentially joked that he had eight hours of tantric sex ( surprise : he did n't ) and the world took him seriously , everyone wanted to get in on the party . Through quite a bit of misinformation , people came to believe that tantric sex essentially meant endless orgasms . In reality , the tantra uses a different ( and less commonly accepted ) definition of the word . Lindsey explains : <p> Tantra is a type of sexual intimacy in which partners use eastern techniques to share energy . The Venus Butterfly technique is said to bring about an hour-long orgasm . Talk about needing a nap after sex ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgasm with other stages of arousal , like plateau and resolution . I 'm not one to harness someone 's orgasmic capabilities or change the meaning of orgasm to them . I will put out there that the longest orgasm measured in the labs was around one minute and it was not the result of tantra . <p> Debby concurs , and explains that you generally should n't even expect to come close to a minute when achieving orgasm : <p> Orgasms last a matter of seconds , not even minutes . That does n't mean there are n't ways to experience euphoric feelings similar to the feelings one experiences during orgasm , but that does n't make it an orgasm . Not even if it comes with a DVD or a how-to manual or a weekend workshop . And that 's OK !

Generalisations lead us down a path of misinformation for no good reason , and what kind of sex each gender wants fits well into this category . Debby explains : <p> There 's no easy gender divide . As it turns out , most human beings enjoy sex and most people say their most enjoyable sex occurs in relationships ( not surprising given how highly both men and women say connection and intimacy matter to them ) . Of course , some men and some women prefer casual sex , and most people have tried casual kinds of sex at some point in their lives . Men and women tend to be far more similar than different in terms of the kinds of sex they enjoy ( connecting , intimate ) and with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the reputation of only wanting commitment , even nowadays ? Lindsey offers some insight : <p> When it comes to heterosexual partner selection , women tend to be more picky because they have more at stake , with the potential pregnancy and all . She 's also less likely to orgasm -- 35% less likely . <p> That said , infrequent orgasms do n't make a person automatically desire commitment . While culture might urge heterosexual women to settle down with a man and encourage young men to sow their wild oats , people do n't subscribe to everything they 're told . We find our own ways , like what we like , and few of us represent what the world considers normal -- even those of us who try . <h> Myth 8 : Oral And Anal Are Safe Alternatives To Vaginal Sex <p> Different kinds of sex come with different risks , and so what 's a safe activity depends greatly upon how you define safe . Debby explains : <p> If your only concern is pregnancy risk , then yes -- oral sex and anal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people have concerns about more than pregnancy , and should -- given that the US has particularly high rates of sexually transmissible infections ( STI ) . STIs can and are passed through oral sex and anal sex . If you 're having oral , vaginal or anal sex , let your healthcare provider know as different kinds of STI testing may be recommended for you ( for example , rectal STI testing if you are having receptive anal sex ) . <p> Transmission rates for STIs vary based on different practices and so many factors can increase your risk no matter what you do . For example , unprotected oral sex immediately after brushing your teeth , which can cause small tears in the gums , can be riskier than protected vaginal sex . Under the right circumstances , the inverse can be true as well . You always have to assume a reasonable amount of risk when engaging in sexual behaviour . Play it safe regardless of the activity and you 'll have less to worry about . <h> Myth 9 : Women Do n't Watch Porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing because most porn is marketed towards men -- both straight and gay . That said , pornography geared towards women does exist and women do enjoy pornography . Lindsey provides the numbers : <p> Almost a third of women report having watched porn and more than 10% of men do n't . Plus , when researchers study the physiological indicators of porn on the body , men and women respond equally to sexually explicit material . Their groins fill with blood , muscles tense up and for the women , a big myth debunk , they get wet -- so not a guy thing . <p> So while it is n't only a " guy thing " , that perception causes a bit of a problem in how both genders see and experience sex . Debby explains : <p> Most mainstream porn is made by men with other men in mind . It 's not surprising , then , that most of the sex acts we see in porn are more focused on men 's pleasure than women 's pleasure . For example , one study found that porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two-girl-one-guy threesomes . The market is changing a little with more " ethical porn producers " and more female directors , but it 's still a largely male audience . <p> What can you do to make porn an enjoyable part of a relationship ? If you want to watch it with your partner , discuss what 's suitable for both of you . If you just want to enjoy it alone , bear in mind that what you see is n't necessarily what you 'll get . Do n't masturbate solely with pornography -- use your imagination as well . Variety keeps things interesting , and prevents one activity from becoming too frequent in your sexual repertoire . <h> Myth 10 : Great Sex Comes Naturally <p> Does great sex come naturally ? If you ask a handful of people you 'll get just as many answers because nobody seems to agree . Some people have great chemistry and do n't have to work at it . Other people do n't have interests that collide in the throes of passion and have to put in more effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mix of both : <p> Sometimes people have phenomenal chemistry and everything clicks for a night or the first 3 or 6 months they 're together . But most great sex takes practice , patience , and a little forgiveness . Great sex takes accepting each other 's bodies and your own . For couples in long-term relationships , it sometimes means having sex to please your partner , knowing that another time he or she will have sex to please you ( because your desires are n't always in sync ) . Some sex will be for tension release , other times it 's so you can go to sleep , or to feel closer after an argument , or to make a baby , or to feel in love . One of you might fart during sex . One or both of you is bound to have sexual problems at some point . For example , our 2009 NSSHB data show that about 30% of women reported pain the most recent time they had sex and about one-third had difficulty with lubrication . With about 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure for erections as strong and reliable as superheroes , sexual problems and pressures abound . <p> So with all those problems , what can couples do to keep having great sex throughout their lives ? Debby offers some advice : <p> Great sex takes care . It takes making mistakes and getting over them . One study found that even among satisfied couples who have regular sex , sex was only " very good " about 20-25% of the time and " good " about half of the time . Kind of like your favourite restaurant -- sometimes it 's amazing but most of the time you just would n't want to eat anywhere else . And sometimes it 's kind of " meh " but you keep coming back regardless because you know that most of the time it 's pretty great . <p> So do n't be greedy . No single thing is amazing every time . Great sex would cease to be great if it did n't vary from time to time . <h> Remember : We Still Have More To Learn <p> We 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started studying it . We still have much more to learn . While this posts represents what we know now , things may change in the future . Remember to always keep an open mind and keep learning .

Twelve scientists then wrote to Jensen and Back , offering to brief them on the science . Jensen accepted . <p> Jensen claimed to the ABC there were " at least 10 " members of his party who shared his climate denialist tendencies . <p> With some prodding from ABC Radio National host Fran Kelly , Jensen set out why he thought the science needed a review . <p> Why not just accept the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ?

Ever . <p> In Jensen 's mind , the evidence that adding CO2 to the atmosphere can kick off feedbacks in the system to create more warming is " not compelling at all " . <p> So " not compelling " is the well-established understanding that CO2 warms the atmosphere . A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour - a greenhouse gas . <p> I asked Professor Steve Sherwood , director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales and a lead IPCC author about Jensen 's points ( he had more to say too , which we 'll get to at the end ) . He told me : <p> There is overwhelming theoretical support and observational evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity desired by Jensen is inconsistent with Earth 's climate record , which shows 2-5C of warming every time CO2 doubled . You can throw away the climate models and we still know we have a serious problem . <p> Victoria University 's Professor Roger Jones , also an IPCC author , said Jensen 's argument that climate models were overstating warming " did not hold water " and pointed to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change . <p> That study examined global temperatures for every 15-year period from 1900 to 2012 ( starting with 1900 to 1914 , then 1901 to 1915 and so on ) and compared these to temperatures delivered by climate models . The study found no evidence that climate models systematically overestimated global temperatures . <p> Jones said he would not be surprised if the current El Ni ? o delivered a marked shift in global temperatures , as high as 0.3C , and that this would push the planet into a " new regime " .

And he 's being fooled by dodgy analyses put out by lobby groups determined to delay action on reducing fossil fuel emissions . Colleagues overseas ca n't believe we have elected representatives who still do n't get the science . It 's an embarrassment . <p> Jensen said any review into the science would have to be conducted " from people outside the system " which seems to me to be another way of saying " do n't give me any actual experts " . <p> I 'm wondering if a Liberal Party review of the science might sound a bit like the Republican-led US House Science Committee hearing last year , reviewed here by Jon Stewart . <p> I do n't know if Jensen ever did clarify which of Monckton 's views he thought were reasonable , but the British viscount himself did pen a colourful nine-page response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications minister , Malcolm Turnbull , has a different view of Monckton , once describing him as a " vaudeville artist " and a " professional sensationalist " with " no credibility , politically or scientifically " . <p> So back to Sherwood , who has evidently had enough of the attacks on the credibility of his profession from non-experts . I 'll leave you with his thoughts : <p> If Jensen would like to have scientists investigated yet again , let him do it . If my colleagues or I have been guilty of what the likes of him are claiming , we deserve to go to jail . <p> But please ask him to also investigate climate sceptics , whose claims have repeatedly been shown to rest on misrepresentations of the evidence . <p> I am getting tired of my own integrity and that of my colleagues being questioned for political reasons when our conclusions are based on a deliberate , careful and completely open scientific process , the opposite of " groupthink.

Schwarzenegger was one of several muscle-bound action stars to emerge in the 1980s .

The Reagan presidency , American ascendancy in the wake of the crumbling USSR , the reputed weakness of the previous Carter administration and popular obsession with fitness all contributed to Hollywood heroes transitioning into big , muscular metaphors for a reinvigorated United States . <p> While his bodybuilder 's physique was important for embodying larger than life , " All-American " action heroes , what made Schwarzenegger distinctive was his peculiar vocal performances in those roles .

But one wonders whether this can fully account for Schwarzenegger 's mass appeal , particularly outside of the United States . <p> His heavily-accented delivery of snappy , pun-filled dialogue is often not quite right , just a little askew .

Many memes , quizzes , listicles , and " content " encourage an ironic perspective on celebrity and pop culture that 's awfully close to camp .

There are even tutorials on " how to do Arnold " : <p> Reiteration is where most of my research has been focused , and includes video montages of Schwarzenegger 's greatest quotes as well as soundboard pranks .

@@3448235 that being overweight and sedentary is commonly associated with being unhealthy . This has spurred a growth in the sales of fitness trackers with 25 million being sold globally last year . Fitness trackers and connected scales may help in measuring your progress to achieve certain goals but they typically do n't tell you what those goals should be or the best way to get there . <p> Public health messages and health professionals also may emphasise a need to not be overweight in order to reduce the risk of one of a range of chronic diseases , including heart attack or stroke . However , these messages are often packaged for impact and simplicity and the patient is often left not having understood what all of the numbers that underlie the risk actually mean , how they are all related , and what it actually takes to change them . <p> Part of the problem is that there is still a range of opinions about levels of risk associated with being a particular weight and whether other measures such as waist circumference , hip to waist ratio , waist to height ratio are more important . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take the average male in Australia who is 1.76 m tall and weighs on average 85.9 kg , their BMI is 27.86 . According to their BMI , to be in the health range of less than 25 , they should have a weight of about 76.7 kg for a BMI of 24.9 . This means they need to lose 9.2 kg . <p> By another measure however of waist circumference , the Australian male had an average waist circumference of 97.9 cm . By one measure , getting that into the safer zone below 94 cm ( see below ) would need dropping 3.9 cm in circumference by losing 4.3 kg . However , another indicator suggests that the waist to height ratio should n't exceed 0.5 , which means that the average male should have a waist circumference of 88 cm , which would take losing 9.9 cm and 11 kg . If the person lost 11 kg , their maximum BMI would be 24.2 . <p> Confused ? Yes , it seems that advice varies from losing 4.3 kg to losing a massive 11 kg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the average Australian woman who is 161.8 cm tall and weighs 71.1 kg , their BMI of 27.4 is still over the recommended 25 . They would need to lose 5.8 kg to get down to 65.3 kg to be out of the higher risk category . Based on their average waist circumference of 87.7 cm , they would need to lose 8.6 kg to drop 7.7 cm from their waist to get below the risk cutoff of 80 cm . In the case of the average Australian woman , using the waist to height ratio of 0.5 gives roughly the same cutoff of 80.9 cm . <p> In both cases , just using BMI would underestimate the amount of weight needed to be lost . What is not in doubt however is that the combination of being overweight , having too much fat around the middle of the body , and not being active greatly increases the risk of illness . <h> The measures <p> BMI ( Body Mass Index ) is a measure that compares height to weight and is measured by taking weight / ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and height in metres . So somebody weighing 75 kg and having a height of 175 cm would have a BMI of : <p> 24.5 = 75 / ( 1.75 * 1.75 ) <p> According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , a BMI of 30 and over is considered obese and between 25 and 30 , overweight . There is an online calculator that allows you to calculate your BMI easily . <p> The problem with BMI though is that people with a normal BMI can be still at high risk because their body fat is concentrated around their middle . A better measure of a weight problem can be measured using a person 's waist circumference . This is measured halfway between the bottom of the ribs and the top of the hip bone . <p> The target points for waist circumference are for an increased levels of risk <p> Men : 94 cm and Women : 80 cm <p> and greatly increased risk <p> Men : 102 cm and Women : 88 cm <p> There are other measures such as the waist to height ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist circumference alone . The cutoffs for this measure is 0.5 for increased risk and 0.6 for greatly increased risk for both men and women . In the example above , for a man of height 175 cm , his waist circumference would need to be below 87.5 which is a full 6.5 cm less than the Heart Foundation 's recommendation of 94 cm . <h> What to do ? <p> Knowing these targets however leaves the question of what someone who is overweight has to do to actually get to a safe weight . Surprisingly , fitness tracking software like that of Fitbit 's does n't actually call out these target ranges and only handles targets in terms of absolute weight loss . <p> So if you had a waist circumference of 99 cm and were 186 cm tall , what would you need to do to get your waist to 93 cm , or in other words , a waist to height ratio of less than 0.5 ? <p> The rough guide is that for every 1 kg that you lose , you will reduce your waist circumference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose 6 cm off your waist , you would need to lose 6 / 0.9 = 6.7 kg <p> In order to lose 6.7 kg , you would need to burn an extra 214,000 kilojoules over and above what you consume . This is based on the energy content of fat which is about 37 kJ per gram or 37,000 kJ per kg . <p> Assuming you eat 2,000 kilojoules less a day ( or increased your exercise by the same amount ) , it would take 107 days ( 214,000 / 2,000 ) or 15 weeks to lose 6.7 kg . <p> Of course , everyone is going to be different , and losing weight will in itself change how the body loses weight as it keeps adapting to new levels of energy input and output . But it is not capable of creating energy from nowhere and so a continued increase in activity and decrease in energy input will keep resulting in a loss of weight , and at the end of the day , it is this mathematical relationship that drives all weight loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@3457236 <p> We know that China 's economic growth singlehandedly saved Australia from the recession many other countries experienced after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-9 . <p> China 's requirement for our mineral exports saved our bacon and led to a number of years of prosperity . <p> Today , even though the mining boom is over , Chinese money is still flowing into Australia in a number of other ways including growing numbers of Chinese tourists , students , settlers and an increased bi-lateral trade relationship . <p> While there are economic pros and cons to the recently signed free trade agreement with China , today I 'd like to explore how Chinese capital has affected our property markets and it 's likely effect in the future in light of the current Chinese stock market slump . <h> What happened to the Chinese stock market ? <p> In case you missed it , while many of the headlines were focused on Greece 's economy over the last few weeks , another financial crisis has been competing for the world 's attention -- shares on China 's stock markets have nosedived , prompting fears of the biggest financial disaster since the 1929 Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst more than $3.2 trillion was wiped out in the value of the Chinese stock market , an amount more than 10 times the size of the entire Greek economy . <p> Now just to make things clear ... China is no longer a communist country . It 's a capitalist country with a totalitarian government and it 's now learning about speculation and market cycles . <p> By the way : share prices on the Chinese stock market are not as closely linked to fundamentals as they are here . Unlike other countries , in China , 80% of the stocks are owned by individuals -- in reality 90 million retail investors are speculating with their newfound capitalistic freedom . <p> It 's really the same as all those Chinese individuals and companies who speculated heavily in overseas property . <p> So to help put things into perspective , let 's first look at how Chinese money has affected the property markets in Australia and then I 'll give some thoughts about the future . <h> Chinese investment into commercial real estate is rising <p> We read a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off-the-plan inner city apartments but there 's much more to it than that . <p> Chinese capital flows to global real estate surged from $US1 billion in 2010 to $US10 billion in 2014 , and Australia has punched over its weight attracting over 15% of this investment in 2014 and over one-quarter of the $US4 billion invested in the first quarter of 2015 , with much of that capital flowing into the commercial property sector in Sydney and Melbourne , according to a ViewPoint report from CBRE . <p> Inner city development sites are a major destination for this Chinese capital . <p> In the period from January 1 , 2014 to March 31 , 2015 Chinese direct investors were the second largest purchasers of commercial property in Australia , after Singapore and ahead of the US . Chinese investors accounted for one-third -- or $3 billion -- of the $9 billion in foreign capital invested in commercial property assets nationally , with that momentum continuing to build . <p> CBRE 's head of research , Australian , Stephen McNabb commented : <p> " Flows from China into global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as regulatory changes over the past three years have allowed a higher investment allocation into real estate for life insurers , rising from 10 per cent to 30 per cent , and offshore investment to a limit of 15 per cent across all asset classes , " <p> He added that domestic economic and residential market risks in China had led investors and developers to diversify interests offshore into relatively safer markets . Also ... <h> Permanent migration is rising <p> There are around 450,000 Chinese born residents in Australia , still just 2% of the population , although the number has doubled in the last decade with China now the second largest source of migrants after India . <p> And those who ca n't move here send their children here to study ... <h> Foreign student numbers are growing again <p> Education is Australia 's third largest export and fourth-largest to China after commodity exports .

And while China 's growth has slowed from last decade , it 's still consuming record quantities of Australian commodities . <h> So what 's ahead for us ? <p> I can foresee a period of uncertainty and lower world and local economic growth in the coming year . <p> This is likely to translate into a lower dollar , a drop in our experts and even the slight possibility of a recession in Australia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates in Australia and the likelihood of another rate drop before they eventually rise in 2017 . <p> While in the long term I see a flight to the security of Australian property , in the short term it 's possible that segments of our property markets may stumble . <p> For example , some of the Chinese investors who bought off-the-plan properties in Australia but are yet to settle may not be able to complete purchases , as it 's reasonable to expect that many of these property investors are also playing the stock markets . <p> This risk is potentially devastating to those property developers who find themselves in the situation where overseas buyers refuse to or are unable to settle . Imagine trying to chase them overseas for the balance of their money . <p> Another risk is that those Chinese developers who bought the large CBD development sites may have difficulty obtaining Chinese funding for their projects <p> However , as I said , in the long term , unless the government restricts overseas buying , I see the lessons the new wave of Chinese investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe haven of Australian property . <h> So what sort of property should an investor buy ? <p> Let me start by saying that as an investor you should be looking for properties that are strong ( will increase in value at above average capital growth ) and stable ( should not fluctuate in value much if we hit some economic turbulence . ) <p> This means you should avoid : <p> CBD and off the plan apartments <p> Regional markets -- they 're likely to suffer more than the big smoke . <p> Mining towns -- but that 's nothing new . <p> Blue collar suburbs -- unemployment may rise a bit more and these areas could suffer . <p> First home buyer areas -- these regions are already having affordability issues . <p> The prestige end of the market -- this end of market suffers when the business sector suffers . <p> On the other hand there will still be good investment opportunities in the inner and middle ring suburbs of our three big east coast capital cities . <p> In particular , I 'd be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is high and increasing above average .

What started as a scratching post for Gareth Liddiard 's more avant-garde and obscure ideas in the late-90s across in Perth has evolved over the years into a collective widely regarded as one of this country 's most historically-important and endlessly-fruitful bands . Theirs is a musical endeavour that pushes through any and all conventions laid out by rock , blues and even noise music . It 's taken the band across six acclaimed albums , countless international tours and a live show that comes in the highest of regard across demographic and genre boundaries . <p> In 2015 , The Drones are both reflecting on the ten-year anniversary of their breakthrough LP , the remarkably-titled Wait Long by the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By ; as well as looking toward the imminent release of their as-yet-untitled seventh studio album . <p> We spoke with drummer Christian Strybosch , who was originally a part of the band from 2000 to 2004 before returning to the fold once again in 2014 .

When we jammed together , it was like nothing I 'd ever played before . Straightaway , we just locked in . <p> It was really working . None of us were interested in 4/4 rock'n'roll -- it was loose , it was loud and it was something we were all into . I got the gig on the spot and Rui told me that we had a gig in a week 's time .

It was beyond what any of us could have imagined . <p> Their success definitely felt like it was overnight to a lot of people , but anyone behind the scenes knew that it was a really long time coming -- even just in terms of getting that record out .

Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer in a scene from film The Man From **25;921;TOOLONG <p> Now he 's taking on another role that 's had its genesis elsewhere ( although the stakes are clearly not as high ) , as the dashing American spy ( " so not the dashing British spy , James Bond " ) Napoleon Solo in Guy Ritchie 's reimaging of the 1960s television series The Man From U.N.C.L.E . Cavill says he approached Solo in the same way he approached Superman -- ignore what came before . <p> " I 'm very careful about any job I take on . I try not to draw from other things because you end up imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Grand Plaza Hotel in Rome , the city where U.N . C. L. E was mainly filmed . " And imitation , while it 's the greatest form of flattery , is not what I plan on doing . I plan on doing my own thing . " <p> Ironically , the role was originally slated for Tom Cruise ( he pulled out due to a scheduling conflict on Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation ) . " Yes , it is bemusing , " smiles Cavill , of his occasionally complicated work history . " I try not to think about who came before me or who was supposed to play the role because that 's going to affect your performance . " <p> ( Still , he gets a little irritable when U.N.C.L.E . is mentioned in the same breath as 007 . " Obviously there 's a big hang-up about Bond because everyone thinks every spy has to be like Bond , " Cavill says . " I think it 's important that we bring some others to the foreground . James Bond does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) <p> Cavill says he initially signed on to do U.N . C. L. E , primarily for the chance to work with its director , Guy Ritchie . <p> " Guy was the draw , for sure , " he says . " He 's got a particular style , and what he does is very unique -- he 's electric and very charismatic . He makes all actors better . You just want to keep working with him . " <p> He also admits he had a more strategic reason for taking on the role ; he wanted mainstream movie audiences to see him as a character other than Superman . <p> " I definitely chose his role to be contrary to Superman , " he says . " When you have a movie that size come out , it 's human inclination to categorise , to say , I know who that person is , but you have to fight against that , " he says . <p> " And I do n't want to be crazy , I do n't all of a sudden want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the audience I have range . Not only that , but just because the first time people saw me on a world scale , was Superman . That 's not necessarily what I do . I 'm a period guy , to be honest -- that 's my jive . " <p> Cavill , of course , got his big break playing an oft-naked Duke in the television series The Tudors . ( In fact , his early career was made up of roles on very British crime series such as Midsomer Murders and The Inspector Lynley Mysteries . ) <p> Given his very British pedigree , Cavill finds it amusing that most people " still think I 'm American " . <p> " Which is funny really , because I have such trouble with the accent , " he admits . <p> He 's not joking , either . Cavill recalls how on the set of U.N . C. L. E , Ritchie pulled him aside and told him he needed to fix it up , because he sounded like " a bad Clark Gable " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guy said , ' You just sound like an English guy who ca n't do an American accent . ' He said , ' You 've got to fix that because not everyone is going to have watched Man of Steel . ' I sounded like an American who was trying to get rid of his accent . " <p> When we speak Cavill is still in the midst of filming Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice opposite Ben Affleck ( " he 's getting the haters now " ) . Indeed , Cavill says he works hard to ignore the pressure put on him merely by stepping into those very famous red boots . <p> " I 'm aware of it , but if you start focusing on it then you 're going to screw yourself up . It 's like saying , what if I fail ? What if I fail ? What if I fail ? Then you will fail , you will f--- it up . " <p> When it comes to work , Cavill will tell you that he has a very singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with work means his private life has often suffered . <p> " I would like to find a wife and have kids , " he says . " I have n't found the right girl yet , but I 'm still looking . " <p> Being in a relationship with an actor , he says , is n't always for everyone . <p> " It 's tough to be in a relationship with someone like me . It 's a tough lifestyle to be a part of . It 's also hard to meet people when you 're never home . I miss sleeping in my own bed . I ca n't remember the last time I did -- it feels like years . " <p> Still , despite all of the near misses and the intense superhero scrutiny , he 's pleased with where his career sits . <p> " I could n't be happier right now , where I am , " Cavill says .

Many dogs do ' warning nips ' when they feel threatened . Often these nips are ' air nips ' but this nip obviously made contact and made contact in an unfortunate place . If the parents did n't pat the dog themselves first to ascertain how comfortable it was with the situation , then they 're partly at fault . The owner of the dog should also be ' in tune ' with his pet and should have recognised early warning signs that the dog was n't comfortable . I realise in nanny state Australia , we take little personal responsibility these days and then expect the world to accommodate us when something goes wrong . I do however feel really sorry for the girl in this incident ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones and I hope that it does n't deter her from appreciating ' man 's best friend ' in the future . <p> Commenter <p> @Kane <p> Date and time <p> August 14 , 2015 , 5:16PM <p> This case is outrageous . After reassuring the father that it was OK to pat the dog , the dog mauls the child . If it was on a lead , why did n't the owner pull it away ? How could he say it was safe for a child to pat the dog ? I ca n't believe how low the fine was , and ca n't believe the dog was not destroyed . Instead , why is the owner being congratulated for not fleeing the scene ? ! This a serious warning that the Government must take dangerous dogs , and their irresponsible owners , far more seriously . Imagine if it was your child .

If your kid absolutely must approach an unfamiliar dog , SOME of the basics are slow movements , do n't let your head get close to the dog 's head , do n't look it straight in the eye , and DO N'T pat the head . Kids do n't know this , so if a parent has the burning desire to let their kid go up to a strange dog , it falls to them to know how to do it safely and read the telltales .

Part of that may be a marketing ploy to juice interest ( it works ! ) , but it 's also because OnePlus is a young company that does n't have the same kind of manufacturing prowess Apple , Samsung , and others have . OnePlus needs to make sure it has a buyer lined up for every phone it makes . <p> I 've been using the OnePlus 2 for about a week , and despite some minor limitations , I think it 's an incredible phone by any standard , not just because it 's cheap . <h> What is it ? <p> Unlike most Android phones , OnePlus goes out of its way not to meddle with the basic version of Android .

OnePlus can update its phones whenever it wants , so you get the latest and greatest features almost as soon as they 're available . <p> The OnePlus only has a few extras on top of the basic version of Android , including a fingerprint sensor and new menu that suggests frequently-used apps and contacts .

He was booed on the podium for months afterward , and by the end of the year many commentators pointed out that if it were n't for the incident in Spa , Hamilton would have wrapped up the drivers ' championship before the unpopular double-points finale in Abu Dhabi . <p> Post-race a storm was brewing in the Mercedes camp .

Neither car was damaged and they continued to battle until the chequered flag . It was a move that should have reinforced just how freakishly unlucky Hamilton was to cop a puncture and put to rest the nonsense argument that Rosberg had intentionally sliced his opponent 's wheel with his wing . <p> Nevertheless , whether Rosberg felt his teammate was acting in the best interests of the team or not , it was Nico himself who had committed the ultimate sin and was responsible for the collision .

( A popular example of a transformational leader is Nelson Mandela . ) Studies have found there 's a strong correlation between transformational leadership and leadership effectiveness . <p> The analysis found that positive affect accounted for over 20% of the variance in transformational leadership .

Joseph says companies can even measure trait positive affect using the same tools that researchers typically use , such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule . <p> Perhaps happiness is something that organisations already value in their leaders on an intuitive level .

Gypsy , for which Kelly received an Oscar nomination , is a musical of maternal ambition , the story of a woman determined to make her younger daughter into a vaudeville star . She then turns her attention to her older child , Louise , an unwilling recruit who finally comes into her own as a burlesque performer , and emerges as the legendary stripper , Gypsy Rose Lee . <p> " Natalie Wood created the role of Louise , but Orry-Kelly created Gypsy Rose Lee , " says McQueen .

But once again , the costumes are all about character and storytelling . The film is based on a stage play , and the larger-than-life title character , played by Russell , is constantly transforming herself , from a bohemian to an orientalist to an advocate of austerity to a Southern belle .

Studios tended to think of them as disposable items , part of the backlot , something to be re-used or recycled . They were certainly part of a business model -- the ACMI exhibition shows how Hollywood marketed its style to consumers -- but individual items were not necessarily valued or cared for . <p> Stars established strong ties with designers -- one of Orry-Kelly 's most productive and famous working relationships was with Bette Davis -- but they did n't necessarily prize the garments . Marlene Dietrich , however , had it in her contract that she could keep her wardrobe ; she is said to have parted company with Paramount over a dress she wore in Angel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banton ? that she was determined to have , and the studio bosses thought too expensive to relinquish .

" <p> The focus , he says , is on " the next thing , and it has very little to do with remembering and honouring the past " . <p> The studios did lavish care and money on the creation of costumes , even if they often treated the product as disposable . In the 1930s in particular , McQueen says , " Hollywood was making money during the Depression , they could afford to hire expert tailors and seamstresses , and their workforce was incredible . <p> " They had a certain way of constructing that was a little bit different from couture , a lot of things started around the waist-tape , and it was built up and down from there . " <p> You can often tell a Hollywood costume from an off-the-rack dress , he says , because of the corseting .

One of his Orry-Kelly pieces is a period costume worn by Olivia de Havilland in The Private Lives of Elizabeth And Essex , a 1939 costume drama . <p> " I admire how comfortable he was with the period costumes , the fact that he researched the era to such an extent that sometimes the heads of the studios did n't like it . " <p> Like McQueen , Inglis has seen the face of collecting change -- it has become more competitive and investment-oriented .

@@3537240 <p> I think at one time , Activision was getting worried about Call of Duty becoming stale . I mean , we now have three different developers working on the franchise -- trying to play quality control so we do not see a flop , but its more than staleness that has this namesake changing from year to year . Call of Duty is in an identity crisis . That is n't a bad thing as all long-lasting franchises go through this , but right now- the world 's shooter is stuck in the future , and attempting to innovate a tad in the genre with mechanics that seamlessly fit right into multiplayer . Call of Duty : Black Ops III is Treyarch 's turn to show off its technical abilities , and what a change this is from the past titles in their own line-up . <p> After getting a full scope of the beta , I want to say that I feel like Advanced Warfare comparisons are not really going to do it with this one , as while the same " futuristic " theme applies , Black Ops III is still grounded enough to stick to the basics , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing that is sure to jump out at players are the visuals . I know , we have seen a lot of change with Call of Duty over the years -- trying to shake that brown and grey stigma that seems to haunt first-person shooter titles everywhere , and most of the time the change is just to blue and grey or more of an orange . Black Ops III features more color than just about any COD title to date . The world is fascinating because of all the rich color and realistic textures , even though it does sacrifice the Call of Duty feel ( or atmosphere , if you will ) in order to put on this show . The end result however seems to be a game that has matured through feedback while still being able to keep an experience in-tact when it comes to players going to war in exciting battles . <p> Instead of having a ton of random accessories to change the look of the battlefield , Black Ops III adds in abilities that players can earn to quickly turn the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct class equipped , they can quickly gain bullet invulnerability for five seconds . That might not sound like a lot , but it completely changes the game in terms of balance . To balance across the whole field , other classes possess the abilities to throw special weapons or emit a sonar to pick up a nearby enemy location ( which is handy for snipers ) . I 'll admit , I did n't play a lot of the multiplayer for the last few titles , so coming into these changes reminded me when I played the beta for Halo Reach and encountered its new class system . It takes time to get used to , but we as the players get a much more fun game overall with more options . There still is a perk system for those curious that allows for special bombs and such to be rewarded , but I think these extra abilities will certainly add in a flavor that will attract players away from Destiny and back into Call of Duty . Yes , it seems Activision may just be competing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was quite pleased with the selection overall . There were only three maps to play in the beta , but all -- while different in look and design seem to compliment the new abilities and gameplay . For instance , the new wall-running mechanic works well in a lot of high up , narrow areas and actually shifted the momentum in my own direction when facing random players . The Outrider class also seem to be an early fan favorite . I can easily say that you should expect to see a lot of bow kills . While they take a little bit more skill to learn , this weapon contains pure satisfaction . Oh , speaking of kills , It would also be wise to mention you can die a lot easier in Black Ops III . This definitely is decent news considering how hard it was to take people down in prior titles , but also gives the edge back to campers who stay in one nearly closed-in area and shoot groups passing by from the side . This is the beta so that may change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the game . <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops III seems to be a game that finds its footing in the future , but incorporates enough of its past to make a varied yet outstanding experience for the fans that have been so loyal to the name throughout the years . This is just a beta and everything is subject to change , but if we continue to see this layered multiplayer during the launch -- I would say that the king may indeed reclaim his throne due to Treyarch 's fine work and major attention to detail . Stay tuned folks , as Black Ops III launches November 6th.

@@3543233 <p> This week the Chinese stock market has plunged more than 17% in three days . While its value still remains higher than it was a year ago , the fall in value is a reflection that China 's economy is undergoing a tough transition , with lower economic growth . For Australia , the plunging Chinese stock market will have little direct impact , but the slumping economy will . <p> In July I wrote of the falling Chinese stock market and the attempts by the Chinese government to arrest the decline . As generally happens with such things , the day after writing of the gloom , the main China stock market in Shanghai recorded a 4.5% jump , and was followed the day after by another 2.4% rise . <p> Indeed , by 23 July the Shanghai Composite index had risen 11% from the 3,709 points it was on the day I wrote of the gloom to 4,123 . <p> It would be nice if the end of the story was : commentator gets his face covered in egg , everyone breathes a sigh of relief , goes back to waiting for commentator to once again get egg on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen 29% and now sits ( as of close on Wednesday ) at 2,927 . <p> The near 23% fall in the index over the past seven days is the biggest weekly fall since 1996 , and dwarfs the 12.8% weekly fall that occurred in July . <p> And as often happens , the rest of the world 's stock exchanges followed . The London stock exchange fell 7.4% in two days before slightly recovering , the Dow Jones index in New York fell 9.7% on four days , before recovering 4% today . <p> Here in Australia , the All Ordinaries index fell 4% on Monday before recovering 2.6% on Tuesday and a further 0.6% on Wednesday . <p> In July , the Chinese authorities tried to stem the bleeding by halting trading on half of the stocks , preventing short-selling ( whereby traders buy options on stocks in the future at a lower price than they currently are selling for -- in effect betting their price will fall ) , and also getting the state-owned wealth fund to start buying shares . <p> This time round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assisted , as it is the Chinese economy that needs help . <p> Reflecting the concerns of investors around the world that China 's economy is slowing by more than anticipated , the Peoples Bank of China ( PBoC ) on Tuesday cut the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.6% : <p> This was the fourth cut in the past year . <p> The PBoC also lowered the required reserve ratio ( RRR ) for banks to 18% . This followed a lowering of the RRR in April . The relaxing of the RRR essentially allows Chinese banks to lend more and together with the lowering of the interest rates Beijing hopes to stimulate the economy . <p> It did little to calm investor 's nerves . On Wednesday the Shanghai composite index went on a wild ride . At one point it was down as much as 3.2% before rising 4.2% on the back of intervention by state-owned banks , before finishing the day down 1.3% . <p> Of course we need a bit of context before we get too carried away with our panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past three months is sharper , but not as severe as that which occurred during the GFC . <p> From October 2007 to Jun 2008 , the Shanghai index lost 54% of its value : <p> But the difference back in 2007 was that the Chinese economy grew by 14% , and even in 2008 with the GFC it still grew by 9.6% . Currently the IMF expects China 's GDP to grow by 6.8% this year and just 6.3% in 2016 . <p> Certainly there is the sense that what is happening in the Chinese stock exchange is a " correction " -- which is a fancy and hopefully not too scary way of saying that the market was massively overvalued . <p> Despite the recent large fall , the Shanghai index remains 32% above where it was 12 months ago . But that massive growth occurred during a period when Chinese growth was being downgraded . <p> It was growth that did n't match at all what was happening in the Chinese economy . In mid-to-late 2014 , Chinese real estate prices slumped . They have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest figures released yesterday show the prices of newly constructed commercial residential buildings declined in 29 of the 70 major cities and increased in 31 : <p> He also suggested the moves by the PBoC to cut interest rates and relax the RRR was " another positive step to help the Chinese economy " . <p> Of course the Chinese government is only doing such things because it is worried that the " fundamentals " are not actually " gradually improving " . <p> One other way to get some context for the fall in the Chinese stock market is to compare its performance over the past six-and-a-half years with that of the US and Australian stock markets . <p> Since February 2009 , which was when the stock market around the world bottomed out during the GFC , the Dow Jones index in America has risen 121% ( prior to the recent fall it was up 150% ) . <p> The Australian stock exchange 's All Ordinaries index , by contrast , is just up 56% in that period . <p> But when we look at the Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear : <p> In June last year , the Shanghai Composite index was virtually the same as it was in February 2009 . Within a year it would rise 122% . Now it sits at just 40% above where is was at the bottom of the GFC -- a performance even worse than Australia 's market . <p> Clearly , unless something magical in China 's economy had happened in the past 12 months , there was no solid reason for such a boom . Unlike in 2007 when the Chinese stock market boomed ( and then bust with the GFC ) , economic growth was strong . <p> This latest boom came via margin lending from investors seeking returns that were no longer coming elsewhere -- especially the real estate market . <p> It had unsustainable written all over it because there was no real economic reason for such an optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy . <p> The IMF 's latest report on China is headlined : " China 's transition to slower but better growth " . " Better " is a rather nice positive spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth " you would not assume to see that nation 's stock market going wild . <p> Of course there is not always a link between economic performance and the stock market . The Dow Jones index might be massively outperforming Australia 's stock market , but since the start of 2009 , Australia 's economy has easily outperformed that of the USA : <p> But as for China , the outlook , regardless of the performance of the stock market , is for lower growth than we have been used to ( and have taken advantage of ) . <p> Robb said he expects the falling stock market " will accelerate the level of investment inquiries coming into Australia across all sorts of areas of activity " . <p> But this is unlikely and certainly not something being anticipated on the foreign exchange market . The value of the Australian dollar has fallen over 7% on the past two months , to a six-year low of $US0.718 . <p> That does n't happen when investors are clamouring to get into the Australian market . <p> The reality is China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese economy is falling and a stock market and an economy can only stay disparate for so long . <p> The impact of the Chinese stock market on Australia will not be great -- aside from impacts on our stock market -- but the slowing Chinese economy , and the demand for goods and services from Australia will continue to drag on our own economic growth .

" In essence , this technology has allowed us to expand time . " <p> Every teacher and student got an iPod touch . Now they use iPads .

Nic Christensen talks to chief programmer Angus Ross and senior media buyers about whether the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2015 ? <p> Seven has had its toughest year for a long while with many of its key franchises haemorrhaging viewers . <p> House Rules was down 33 per cent , Winners &amp; Losers lost 29 per cent of its audience and My Kitchen Rules was down 12 per cent in consolidated viewing figures . Then there was the Restaurant Revolution debacle . <p> " We obviously had a program that underperformed for us in Restaurant Revolution , " concedes Angus Ross , chief programmer for the Seven Network . " We are a network that always has go to options so we have had to build a stabilising schedule as a result of that . <p> " However , we have still been particularly competitive in that time , especially when shows likes ' Cats that make you laugh out loud ' took the market by surprise .

" <p> " ( In quarter four ) Nine 's ratings were impacted by the two leading networks programming formats being in the same genre head to head . To some extent we were our own worst enemy as we competed aggressively , " said Wiltshire . <p> " This caused pressure on audiences on free-to-air TV and specifically Nine 's share of that audience . The size and magnitude of these changes coincided with advertisers moving to shorter term buying decisions and immediate ratings history to support their actions . This clearly worked against us as buyers worked to Q3 ratings in allocating Q4 revenues . " <p> But Seven 's Ross insists " there is no genre matching going on .

" <p> Media buyers are also watching the lead-in performance for Seven shows in the crucial 5-6pm slot building into the crucial news bulletins , in which Seven 's Million Dollar Minute has struggled against Nine 's Hot Seat in recent months . Now it is set to bring UK format The Chase down under . <p> " The 5-6pm slot we all know that is a crucial one just for delivering steady solid audiences , " says Nunn 's Walton .

It is tried and tested in another market and it has done well . Seven need to try something and build a bit of a firewall and be seen to putting that strong lead into news . " <p> Ross acknowledges shows like The Chase and Cats/Dogs/Pets Make You Laugh Out Loud are overseas imports that do well with local audiences . <p> On Cats/Dogs/Pets ross admits : " Put simply we bought it because we thought it was funny , and when the show rolled out I think it showed the audience was just looking for a laugh . <p> " It is family friendly entertainment , no violence , no swearing something the whole family can enjoy .

For example , wine currently taxed at between 14 and 20 per cent will be tax free .

@@3555239 <h> Australia : Drug testing both saliva and urine can be OK , says Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission <p> For the first time , the Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission has endorsed an employer 's right to enforce a drug testing regime that incorporates both random saliva and urine testing , in an important decision which gives employers more scope to manage safety risks in the workplace ( Construction , Forestry , Mining and Energy Union ? Construction and General Division v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Limited 2015 FWCFB 4075 ) . <p> Although the Full Bench allowed the CFMEU 's appeal , it still concluded that a policy that required employees to undergo both forms of testing was reasonable , given the deterrent value of the testing and its role in allowing the employer to identify and manage safety risks at the workplace . <p> Its position has been that a drug enforcement policy based only on urine testing is unjust and unreasonable , as employers do not have the right to intrude on employees ' privacy by imposing sanctions on them related to their drug use outside of working hours that does not necessarily affect their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saliva and urine testing can be OK sometimes <p> Initially , Commissioner Cambridge found that employees ' privacy concerns were outweighed by the need to maintain a safe workplace where high-risk work was performed : " a blunt distillation of the contest in this case and its determination can be described as a choice between private lives or saving lives and I have opted for saving lives " . <p> He found that a regime with both forms of testing was more effective , because it was more likely to detect both employees who were impaired at the time of testing , and employees whose capacity to work safely may be affected by long-term drug use . <p> While the Full Bench accepted that the Commissioner had erred in his interpretation of the expert evidence on drug testing and actually set aside his decision , it still came to the same conclusion that it was not unjust or unreasonable in the circumstances to implement a drug testing procedure using both methods . <p> The employer has a statutory duty to ensure , so far as reasonably practicable , the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed drug testing regime as part of the employer 's attempt to discharge this duty . <p> It paid particular attention to the fact that the testing regime was random , which added to the regime 's deterrent value ? it would be harder for employees to take steps to try to avoid detection , as they would not know which method would be used , or when . <p> The Full Bench also gave significant weight to the employer 's case management approach to non-negative test results . Employees who tested positive were not automatically subjected to disciplinary action ; other options were considered , such as rehabilitation , counselling or access to the employer 's Employee Assistance Program . <p> Implementing a drug testing regime for saliva and urine <p> While the Full Bench ultimately agreed with the use of both testing methods , this should not necessarily be taken as an endorsement of this approach in every case . <p> The Full Bench emphasised that its decision was based on the employer 's particular circumstances . These included : <p> a statutory duty to ensure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees and contractors ; <p> a workplace where high-risk work was performed <p> the random nature of the testing , giving it high deterrence value ; and <p> the fairness of the employer 's response to a positive result . <p> Given these caveats , employers intending to implement a drug enforcement policy involving both forms of testing should not assume this decision gives them carte blanche . It does , however , mean they can review their circumstances to see if random dual testing could be a reasonable method of managing the risks of employees ' drug use , and seek professional advice . <p> Clayton Utz communications are intended to provide commentary and general information .

The unprecedented volume of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe has left its leaders struggling to cope . Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , issued a sober warning that the crisis puts Schengen into question , while Italy says it is ready to impose border controls and Hungary has sealed off its main train station . <p> The Schengen Agreement is one of Europe 's most remarkable achievements .

It means that visas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schengen area apply across member states .

Social networks have become a normal part of life , allowing individuals to communicate across borders without having to even think about where the individuals you are talking to might be based . <p> This can be seen vividly when big international events take place such as the World Cup final last year , shown in the live map below .

The approximate cost for the express parcels industry alone could be more than ? 80m a year . These costs would inevitably be passed on to consumers if changes are made to the Schengen Agreement . <p> Plus , if border controls were re-introduced , the impact on shipping times and costs would inevitably go up and will have to be paid by everyone who might travel or send goods or services within the EU .

Oil prices indeed went over a cliff between the time Shell finalized its program in 2014 and when it began drilling this past summer , falling from about $100 to $45 .

Originally conceived in the 2000s and ready to launch in 2010-2011 , it was put on hold by the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster . This event , with its enormous public outrage , led to a complete revamping of the federal offshore regulatory system . The old Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , accused of sharing the sheets too often with industry , was replaced by a more vigilant Bureau of Ocean Management ( BOEM ) . <p> Shell 's program had to adapt , gaining approval for the 2013 drilling season . But then Shell 's Kulluk drilling rig broke loose from its cable tow and ran aground in Alaska in late 2012 .

Its Arctic waters have seen some successful drilling in recent years , such as at Goliat Field , operated by the Italian group Eni . Yet the big lease sales of the past decade have n't yielded anything like a surge in exploration .

Never A Dull Moment would do nicely for starters . <p> That he 's latterly joined Jack Gunston in becoming the subject of grand final week 's mandatory fitness intrigue is fitting . Hodge is famously easygoing , yet his 15th season has been anything but a smooth ride . <p> He will definitely play against West Coast , but little else in this year of living dangerously has been quite so predictable . His misdemeanours - three and two-game suspensions for offences against Andrew Swallow and Chad Wingard respectively , and a drink-driving conviction that could have carried a lifelong cost - have brought attention and ridicule . As one observer noted , he 's not an 18-year-old fresh from the country any more , but a 31-year-old husband , father and leader . <p> Hodge knows this . Driving home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of his Wingard suspension was an error to put a footballer 's on-field foibles in stark perspective .

He 's got that sense of responsibility , he would have been really disappointed with the driving offence . You think what could have happened ... he 'd be well aware of that . " <p> An influential figure on his early AFL days cautions that while the reports were avoidable , a footballer who has always played on the edge - who is physical and combative as a matter of course - can sometimes slip into the crevasse .

" His football , when he 's played , has been outstanding , " one close observer said . <p> He puts this down to Hodge 's " sense of the moment - some people wilt , he just feeds off it " .

@@3663234 <h> Oppression is the cause of the majority of the suicides ( or murders ) <p> In societies where the people are exposed to relentless oppression , suicide is a normal response -- the ultimate form of resistance to the prolonged violence of oppression . It is not the individual who takes her or his life who is responsible for this culmination but the act of relentless oppression that is responsible . The impacts of colonisation wherever in the world have come with dehumanisation , demonisation and repression of peoples , all in the name of justifying dispossession.I am writing this article so the discrimination and racism that does lead many to suicide can be better understood and for many others that it can be at long last acknowledged . Racism and discrimination are the direct result of the ruthless colonisation and they are impossible to separate . <p> Globally , in general , suicide takes more lives than all other forms of violence combined , including wars and civil strife . The underlying factors include a suite of psychosocial , psychological and psychiatric culminations and breakdowns , where the human will to survive and overwhelm imposts are finally whittled down to least resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relentless nature of these conditions , diminish the capacity or ability to resist . One rationalises the recourse to relief from the tumult of painful conditions -- suicide . <p> However , the victims of colonisation and their descendants register the world 's highest suicide rates -- from the Guarana peoples of the Amazon , to the Inuit and Lakota of North America , to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples of the Australian continent , and to the many other peoples right around the world . The colonisers ruthlessly exploited the planet -- murdering large numbers of the rightful inhabitants of their lands , terrorising them , dispossessing them , brutally exploiting them , corralling them in apartheid , and relentlessly smashing into their historical and contemporary identities , demanding a remake of who they are and what they should be about . Assimilation is not just about social engineering madness , assimilation is more regularly a tool for exploitation . It is used by the oppressor to ensure the oppressed do not simmer resistance . <p> For many of the oppressed , suicide is an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist the impost of racism and fight daily against situational , multiple and composite traumas and the relentless impacts of colonisation . They fight against the ongoing impacts of colonisation -- fight against the expectation that they should assimilate , fight against the implications of the demonisation of their identity -- cultural and historical , fight against the attempts by the oppressor to make them feel lesser than , inferior and powerless . <p> Racism is also felt to varying extents by the waves of migrants from non-Anglocentric cultures that come to Australia . Multiculturalism , in terms of its cultural prowess and dignities , in terms of its exacting a real say , in terms of plurality , does not exist in Australia -- it is a myth and secondly an indictment of the Anglocentric oppressor . Our federal parliament is comprised of 226 parliamentarians -- 213 are of Anglocentric origins , with the majority with more than 100 years of colonial ' settler ' familial history . The stranglehold by the colonial oppressor is one of stricture . It is relentless because any respite will undermine the oppressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and two centuries old and this is reflected in their expectations , in policies of assimilation , the viciously punitive controls , and in their inherent bent to exploit . But let us understand what the colonisers were predominately about -- to exploit . This bent for exploitation underwrites everyday laws and policies . Therefore the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy remains and there has been little respite . There has been little progress in unfolding social justice , equality and equity . <p> First Peoples , right throughout the world , resist . The culmination of this resistance can be suicide -- the ultimate sacrifice -- the ultimate act of resistance . <p> The higher the cultural content of a peoples , the greater the will to resist , the more powerful the acts of resistance , the more significant the fight , the anger and the displaced anger . Peoples who have only been relatively recently impacted by the colonisers or their descendants -- these days they are termed as ' developers ' among other nom de plums -- have higher rates of suicide than peoples five and ten generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view -- estimations -- the Kimberley is one of the world 's worst hit regions from the impacts of colonialisation . The majority of the Kimberley 's Aboriginal peoples have only had significant contact with non-Aboriginal peoples for less than a century -- they remain high cultural content peoples with the centrality of culture and identity psychosocially imperative . They have among the world 's highest suicide rates . Nearly seven per cent of the Kimberley is homeless -- 638 homeless per 10,000 population . Outside natural disasters and civil strife this is one of the world 's highest homeless rates . Nearly all this homelessness is comprised of the region 's Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples -- and I have worked out that this translates to thereabouts 12 per cent of the Kimberley Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples in some form of homelessness . The extreme poverty that many Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples live in is abominable and an indictment of Australia , one of the world 's most affluent nations , the world 's 12th largest economy -- a nation with the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health on the United Nations Development Program 's Human Development Index but when I standalone Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders their equivalent ranking on the global scale would be 132nd . In my view , the racialised economic inequalities are racism -- beginning and end of story -- and to this we must stay solid-in-our-thinking or we will go backwards . <p> The racism must be addressed -- the racialised economic inequalities must be addressed -- the right to land , culture and identity in the realest of rightful ways must be responded to if the suicides , the attempted suicides , the acute and chronic depressions are to be reduced at least to parity between the two populations , that of the First Peoples and the rest . Till then the acts of resistance will continue . Right through humanity 's history wherever there has been oppression , wherever there has been discrimination , consequently there is the will to resist , the acts of resistance . The ultimate act of resistance for many oppressed is that though you relentlessly punished my body you will not also take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours , they sought to exploit . Wherever these exploiters found humankind was in their way they gilded a suite of justifications to underwrite the demonising and the apartheid . We are still parcelled the demonising -- the racism -- because it is the most powerful justification , the most powerful tool of the exploiter , the oppressor . Racism sells people as uncivilised , heathen , stone-age like , child-like , inferior , different . <p> Selling ideas is a dime a dozen . We are sold the idea of multiculturalism but which in Australia the multicultural heart in fact does not exist . The oppressor paints the picture of multiculturalism but does not allow multiculturalism . They control its public discourse , its messages , and they corral people with assimilation . The oppressor is bent on the selling of misoxeny . All lives should matter but do not matter to the oppressor . Power matters to the oppressor and everything that facilitates power . Assimilation is imperative . The act of resistance is treated as dangerous radicalism and portrayed as treachery . <p> The colonisers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sanitise the annals of history , to fill the libraries of lands they barbarically dispossessed into their custody with barest comment about the rightful inhabitants and with one-sided vainglorious tales of themselves . The oppressor continues with the bent for zombie assimilation . In 2012 , Professor Paul Gilroy of Kings College , London University , referred to zombie multiculturalism -- where equality and cultural plurality are promoted but not effected , where the exact opposite occurs , a lie is sold while the oppressor denies the social equity to the oppressed and therefore disavows them from the equality that is touted . This may smack of institutionalised racism but it is a different form , however I will leave this for another article . The colonisers murdered , raped and pillaged . They created underclasses of extreme poverty and they were history 's greatest slum builders . <p> The racism will end when all this is addressed . Till such time the prisons will be filled , the acts of resistance will continue and many of these acts will translate as suicides . It should be understood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never directly resultant from the victim but are incurred by the oppression , the relentless oppression , by the oppressor . The oppressed are never the problem . The oppressor is the problem , always . Where suicide rates between the descendants of the dispossessed and the rest of the population are dramatically disparate then in two words it is ' structural racism ' . <p> When we look through the cultural lens and see that people are committing suicide ten times the rate of the rest of their region 's population then there are racial divides but built on the oppressor and oppressed dichotomy . <p> Oppression causes suicide and the natural human response is to resist oppression . The normal human response is not to allow oneself to be broken , beaten or dominated by oppression . The significant consideration is that if oppression causes suicide is it then in fact suicide ? Or is it murder ? Oppression kills . In my view it is murder and until we focus on the oppressor and urge the ways forward , address the inequalities , end the oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrific rates that have been naturalised . <p> The violence of ignorance will continue these narratives -- this is why I write articles such as this , to take on the social and political force of these abominable narratives . <h> ABC NEWS 24 -- Suicide , a catastrophic humanitarian crisis <h> ABC NEWS -- Cry for help -- youth suicide at crisis levels <p> -- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples of the Kimberley , the Northern Territory and far north Queensland have among the world 's highest suicide rates .

@@3678235 defends tax haven investments <p> As Paul Keating tells it , it all began at the Hoyts Civic Theatre at Bankstown , NSW , in 1955 . He was 11 years old and utterly transfixed -- and for years later haunted -- by Jedda , the first Australian feature film to use Aboriginal actors in lead roles . <p> " It was a very powerful film set in the Northern Territory and , in a way , it mirrored aspects of the stolen generations , " he tells Kerry O'Brien in Keating , the 794-page narrated oral history of his life in politics . " It ended in tragedy for the two Aboriginal people and left me with a sense that this was their place and we were all interlopers . " <p> Then he watched Aboriginal boxers in Jimmy Sharman 's boxing troupe getting " belted up for tuppence ha'penny " at Sydney 's Royal Easter Show . " And I went away thinking that this whole group of Aboriginal boxers in the Jimmy Sharman show was on the outer , copping the brunt of the game .

Photo : Nic Walker <p> It is as true today as it was then : " Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing . We took the traditional lands and smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The alcohol . We committed the murders . We took the children from their mothers . We practised ignorance and exclusion . It was our ignorance and our prejudice . And our failure to imagine these things being done to us . " <p> Now , in an interview to coincide with the release of the book and public conversations with O'Brien in Sydney and Melbourne , Keating has spoken of the need to reach a compact , or treaty , or acknowledgement , that finally " makes good our occupancy of the continent by rejoicing in the identity of the first inhabitants " . <p> The timing could hardly be more apposite , as a new prime minister contemplates what to do with the process that has meandered and stuttered along under four prime ministers : recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution . <p> Malcolm Turnbull has slipped into the role with all the ease and confidence of a surfer returning to a favourite break . He knows where the dangers lurk , and is yet to give any indication of how he intends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority of Tony Abbott , contains multiple difficulties . <p> Aside from a lack of consensus on the recognition question , or even the process for arriving at one , there are concerns that Abbott 's decision to bring the portfolio into his department was a mistake , and doubts about whether his advisory body is representative . <p> After initially resisting calls from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders for separate Indigenous conventions to reach a consensus on the question , Abbott agreed to the idea of them running concurrently with mainstream town hall-style meetings . <p> Then , in an interview with me during his visit to the Torres Strait , Abbott signalled that two of the more ambitious proposals that are competing for Indigenous support were unlikely to gain his backing . These were for the insertion of a racial discrimination prohibition in the constitution and/or the setting up of an Indigenous advisory body that would be recognised in the constitution . <p> Since then , if anything , there has been a strengthening of the view among Indigenous leaders that the proposition must include the insertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as strong support for the Indigenous process to precede the wider engagement . <p> " There have got to be more serious over-arching discussions with the government , with a more representative group , " says Pat Turner , formerly the country 's most experienced and senior Aboriginal bureaucrat . <p> Now Keating has tossed in a completely new approach to the discussion : that a compact or treaty be reached with Aboriginal people " as a nation " and then affirmed by constitutional recognition . <p> But he has also pinpointed the essential ingredient if any progress is to be achieved . " It has to have this sort of great flourish of goodwill about it for it to be meaningful and for it to work , " he tells me . Herein lies Turnbull 's challenge .

Aside from the absence of numerous Australian flags and grim-faced men in uniform as props when he spoke , what was most striking was the more nuanced , measured tone . <p> Then came the response to Labor 's ill-advised pursuit of his multimillion-dollar investments in hedge funds based in the Cayman Islands , which culminated in a rhetorical flourish about being fortunate , working hard , paying tax and giving back . <p> " I do not believe that my wealth or , frankly , most people 's wealth is entirely a function of hard work , " Turnbull said . " Of course , hard work is important , but there are taxi drivers who work harder than I ever have and they do not have much money .

@@3685233 <h> Does China care that it was left out of the Trans-Pacific trade club ? <h> Author <p> Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property , Texas A&amp;M University <h> Disclosure statement <p> Peter K Yu does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above . <p> Earlier this month , the US Trade Representative announced the completion of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . Despite the agreement 's far-reaching scope , some commentators have heavily criticized its exclusion of China . <p> The disappointment is understandable . China is now the world 's second largest or largest economy -- depending on whom you ask . Although President Barack Obama rightly notes that the global economy is too important for China to write its rules , the exclusion of this important market will certainly make the regional pact less attractive . <p> One question that has not been explored much within the US is whether China actually cares about its being excluded from the TPP . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the adoption of this regional pact . <h> Why China might care about being left out of TPP <p> From its inception , the TPP has been considered by many as a strategic instrument to isolate or contain China . Given the country 's ambitions , its leaders are understandably concerned about the concerted effort by the US and other Asia-Pacific countries to curtail its economic growth and geopolitical influence . <p> China 's outsider status could also be seen as an indictment of its inadequacies , such as limited intellectual property protection and a lack of government procurement standards . The exclusion of China not only has caused the country to lose face , but has also provided a painful reminder of its continued struggle to gain an equal status in the international community . <p> Finally , the lack of TPP membership will prevent China from enjoying new tariff reduction and preferential market access . If this regional pact is to operate according to design , it will divert trade and manufacturing from China to TPP members . <p> Who needs the TPP ? China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership at the 21st ASEAN Summit.Reuters <h> Why China could care less <p> Nevertheless , four reasons exist to explain why China may not care much about its being left out of the TPP . <p> First , China continues to actively engage its neighbors and trading partners . Indeed , many Asian countries -- including those involved in the TPP negotiations -- fear that they will have to pick between China and the US . As policymakers from Australia and New Zealand have reportedly told their US counterparts in the early stages of the negotiations , their countries would withdraw if the TPP were designed to contain China . Without containment , however , countries can still negotiate other bilateral or regional trade agreements with China . <p> Second , that the US and other like-minded countries have gone outside the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and other multilateral fora to negotiate new rules has set an important precedent for China to undertake similar maneuvers . From China 's perspective , such maneuvers could come in handy when the country needs to avoid multilateral intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the South China Sea . <p> Third , China continues to face myriad challenges within its own economy , which include massive urban migration , widespread unemployment and an enormous gap between the rich and the poor . Although China has worked hard in the past two decades to ensure compliance with WTO rules , the country may not be ready for new and higher trade standards . These standards can be particularly burdensome in view of the recent downturn of the Chinese economy . <p> Finally , China is unlikely to be able to join the TPP unless some of its standards are substantially revised . For example , the agreement 's government procurement standards would drastically alter the structure and operation of Chinese state-owned enterprises . The TPP electronic commerce standards could also deeply affect the country 's censorship and information control policy . <h> China 's wait-and-see approach <p> Given its ambivalence about the TPP , China may initially take a wait-and-see approach -- or what its Ministry of Commerce has called an " open-minded attitude . " After all , the TPP negotiations have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the final agreement is adopted . At this point , it remains difficult to predict whether the US and other negotiating parties will quickly ratify the pact . <p> An instructive point of comparison is the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , which was negotiated by the EU , the US and other developed and like-minded countries . Although this controversial agreement was adopted in April 2011 , it has yet to enter into force . Thus far , only Japan has ratified the agreement . Many commentators have therefore wondered whether ACTA will ever take effect . <h> Three additional lines of response <p> Apart from the wait-and-see approach , China could accelerate efforts in three areas . <p> First , China has been actively negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements since the early 2000s . Already established were agreements with Chile , Pakistan , New Zealand , Singapore , Peru , Costa Rica , Iceland , Switzerland , South Korea and Australia . With ASEAN members , China has also developed the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area . If the TPP begins to pose a threat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals through bilateral and regional negotiations . <p> China signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in June.Reuters <p> Second , China may become more active in the negotiation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) within the ASEAN+6 framework , which includes ASEAN , Australia , China , India , Japan , New Zealand and South Korea . Thus far , commentators have been skeptical of this initiative -- due in large part to the slow pace of development within ASEAN . Nevertheless , if China considers the RCEP an important instrument to counterbalance the TPP , it may exert greater pressure on its neighbors , or even offer attractive concessions , to ensure the completion of the RCEP negotiations . <p> Third , in view of the TPP , China may reassess its cooperation with the US . For those embracing a growing G-2 partnership between the two countries , the TPP could provide a major setback to US-China cooperation in areas such as climate change , nuclear nonproliferation and cybersecurity . China may also develop a closer relationship with the EU , considering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In sum , the TPP could elicit responses from China that would dramatically alter the trade and power dynamics within the Asia-Pacific region . Yet enough evidence suggests that China may initially take a wait-and-see approach -- at least before the TPP enters into force . <p> Diplomatic smiles and handshakes are in order when Chinese and US representatives meet , but separate trade talks driven by Beijing and Washington represent a high-stakes contest for influence .

@@3708234 to take care of things personally ... <p> Ahead of Halo 5 : Guardians ' release tomorrow , we sat down with Campaign and Sandbox Design Director , Brad Walsh , to discuss the finer points of the game 's AI companions and difficulty levels . <p> One massive change to Halo in this iteration is persistent four-player co-op . If you do n't have real-world friends to fill up a fireteam , AI will always be at hand to assist . <p> Welch told us that the AI was designed in a very specific way . <p> " Early on , we wanted to do the AI replacement of players -- we call them musketeers internally , " Welch began . " We thought that was really important ; it was also one of the most challenging additions too . " <p> In playing Guardians ' campaign for review -- and , its first three missions specifically ahead of the game 's review embargo at 6.00pm AEDT tonight -- we found the AI is n't about to carry you through a level . <p> " With the musketeers , they definitely become less effective as you move up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed . " That being said , we do n't want scenarios where they 're out and out dumb . <p> " The bleed out times speed up on Legendary and the AI has less time to get to you . They might be taken out themselves while trying to get to you . That 's to encourage more usage of orders and more careful play in higher difficulty levels . If you charge in or order the AI to do so , you 're not going to survive . There was some intentional design there to keep Legendary as challenging as possible . " <p> In-game , you can order your AI teammates to move up , attack specific targets , revive Spartans , pick up weaponry and more . When playing with a combination of AI players and real-life friends , only fireteam leaders Spartan Locke and Master Chief are able to order around any AI Spartans . <p> " We had a build where everyone could give orders , and it was just kind of a mess , " Welch confessed . " What would happen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI would get into a confused state . People would then start yelling at each other and it was n't a fun thing . Hence , the fireteam leader being the only one to give orders . " <p> Another change to Halo is that Spartans can now downed in combat ; if they 're not tended to while they 're bleeding out , they 'll eventually die . In our playthrough , we found that the AI could still be confused if multiple real-world players were all demanding a revive at once . <p> " There 's some ordering there , " Welch advised . " The first person closest to the musketeer should request a revive first and then work from there . <p> " Once you give the order to come and revive , the AI can be pretty single-minded about it , " he added . " That was deliberate as well ; we tried different versions of the AI where it was smarter and would stop and fight and do things like that . You would actually get a lot of scenarios where they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would n't revive . The easiest and most understandable solution there was -- you as a player have the intention of giving the revive order , and you can choose when to give it , and at that point the AI should come and do their best to revive . " <p> We think AI usefulness will be a point of contention at Guardians ' launch , but Welsh said 343 will listen and do their best to respond to feedback on AI-controlled Spartans . <p> " It depends on what the feedback on the AI is , " he said . " We definitely want to hear it -- but then it gets down to whether or not it 's something we can fix , post-launch . We 're just very careful after launch of tweaking that -- there 's an adage in game development that for every bug fix , there 's new bugs that could crop up . We get really careful in the last couple months , fixing stuff , because inevitably you break other stuff . <p> " Campaign changes after launch -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback is , " he summarised . " We 'll do our best to roll tweaks in post-launch as well . " <p> Welch also shed some light on Guardians ' difficulty levels . <p> " We scaled difficulty with the number of players , " he said . " Traditionally , playing Legendary in co-op was kind of the cheat mode if you wanted to get through it . We wanted to have the difficulty be the difficulty and have the scaling ramp it up with more real players . We actually scaled the difficulty quite a bit , compared to past games , so there was a lot of difficulty involved . That was a change we made for more longevity for players . " <p> According to Welch , Legendary is set to provide gameplay experiences of epic proportions . <p> " We kind of know the numbers of how many people play Legendary -- people choose that level , " he said . " It 's not half the player base or anything like that . It was a real decision to ramp up the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Xbox One . Our review of the game goes live at 6.00pm AEDT today .

The case was brought by the Authors Guild , which argued that Google 's initiative constituted copyright infringement and could deprive authors of revenue . <p> But Google has successfully argued that its efforts could actually boost sales by making the text of books searchable , making it easier for people to find published works . <p> This latest outcome came without much surprise in the US , and the ruling is consistent with the earlier court rulings on fair use . The Authors Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is unlikely that it would succeed . <h> Google Books and Australia <p> The Google Books decision is based on a so called " fair use " doctrine which means that everyone can use copyrighted works free as long as the use falls under a particular definition of " fair " , including for " criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research " . But such broad and flexible doctrine does not exist in Australia or in most other countries , including Europe . <p> Instead , Australian copyright law contains narrower and more specific " fair dealing " exceptions as well as a few even more narrowly defined specific copyright exceptions . <p> It is unlikely that the Google Books project would fall under any of these exceptions .

This can be a few lines or a short paragraph where the search terms can be seen . <p> The US appeal court 's decision on Google Books confirmed that the use of snippets ( but not chapters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an innovative and useful service but the question is whether Google should pay authors and publishers for its use of their work . <p> The Australian Law Reform Commission ( ALRC ) proposed last year that Australia follow the US and introduces a fair use doctrine . <p> Accepting fair use in Australia would mean that Google is free to digitise all Australian books for free , put the text in its search engine and allow users to view at least snippets from the books . <p> Australian authors argue that fair use would further worsen their financial situation that is already rather miserable . As a result , government has not shown any signs in taking up this proposal . <p> It is true that fair use doctrine has its own risks . For many it looks open , flexible and seems to welcome innovative services such as Google Books .

Maybe this could be a starting point for a discussion ? <p> One of the problems Google Books faced was the difficulty in finding all the copyright holders of a work and signing a contract with each of them .

A more important type of deposition , however , may be the one you face if you infringe upon the ' Strata Schemes Development Bill 2015 ' and ' Strata Schemes Management Bill 2015 ' ( ' Management Bill ' ) . Recently introduced by the Minister for Fair Trading , these bills represent another step towards the reform of a government legislation that is complex , voluminous and over 40 years old . In this article , Swaab solicitor Liam Mulligan discusses these reforms , and their potential impacts on you . <h> The Environment <p> There over 72,000 registered strata and community title schemes in NSW . What 's more , this number is growing , with almost half of the state 's population forecast to live in strata or community titled land within 20 years . <h> The Bills <p> These two bills are steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the Strata Title Law Reform Position Paper released by the government in November 2013 . The Management Bill seek to improve the functioning and administration of strata schemes by relaxing restrictions on owners carrying out minor renovations , limiting proxy voting , regulating strata agency contracts ( including requiring strata agents to disclose conflicts of interest ) and deformalizing the process of holding Annual General Meetings ( e.g. allowing voting over social media or by teleconference ) . <p> Most significantly , the Development Bill seeks to facilitate the renewal of strata schemes by allowing for the termination of a scheme where 75% of the owners consent to the sale . The legislation currently requires the unanimous consent of all property owners for termination of a strata scheme . <h> Collective sale and renewal provisions <p> The Development Bill seeks to strike a balance between fostering economic growth and urban renewal by replacing aged strata schemes , and protecting the rights of owners opposed to the proposal . Part 10 , which deals with the strata renewal process , aims to provide a fair and transparent method for collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related disputes where the owners can not agree . <p> Under the new Development Bill , there will be two classes of termination : <p> collective sale , where all units in a scheme are sold ; and <p> redevelopment , where the owners themselves redevelop the scheme . <p> Any person will be able to approach the executive committee of a scheme with a written ' strata renewal proposal ' . It will then be up to the committee to consider the proposal and ( if it decides that it warrants further consideration ) to put the proposal to a general meeting of the owners corporation . A ' strata renewal committee ' is then established to prepare a ' strata renewal plan ' for consideration by the owners . <p> The plan must set out details such as the proposed purchaser , purchase price , completion date , or if the proposal is for a redevelopment ? any periods where owners will be required to vacate their properties ( full details can be found in Division 5 , Part 10 of the Development Bill ) . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the owners corporation , the plan must still be approved by the Land and Environment Court ( LEC ) . The court is to approve the plan only if satisfied of the matters set out in cl. 182 ( 1 ) ( a ) ? ( f ) . These factors provide further protections for owners opposed to the renewal plan , and an opportunity to raise any concerns . Importantly , the LEC is required to satisfy that : <p> any relationship between the purchaser/developer and any lot owner(s) has been declared and did not prevent the plan from being prepared in good faith ( cl. 182 ( a ) ) ; <p> the procedure in the Act has been correctly followed ( cl. 182 ( b ) ) ; <p> dissenting owners are to be appropriately compensated ( cl. 182 ( c ) ) ; and <p> the plan is just and equitable to all owners ( cl. 182 ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) ) . <h> Compensation <p> Compensation for dissenting owners is a key concept in the Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with s 55 of the Land Acquisition ( Just Terms Compensation ) Act 1991 , giving dissenters the same protections that they would have if the government were compulsorily acquiring their property . <p> In a compulsory sale , the purchase price paid to each owner must be not less than the compensation value of the lot . This guarantees dissenters a just and fair price . In a redevelopment case , any dissenting owners are to be paid the greater of the compensation value or the amount that they would get if they had supported the redevelopment . <h> Conclusion <p> The Development Bill seeks to foster urban renewal , whilst balancing the rights of dissenting owners against the power of the majority . The disclosure requirements and need for LEC approval go some way to finding that balance . Such schemes have been successful at fostering urban renewal in other jurisdictions ( most notably Singapore ) , but have been criticised for insufficiently protecting dissenters against the will of the majority .

@@3716234 <p> Aristotle thought that the young were too immature to wrestle with reason , their passions too strong for a clear mind . The burgeoning worldwide Philosophy for Children movement is proving the great sage wrong . Dr Laura D'Olimpio charts the rise of a radical movement in Australia . <p> Some people may wonder if young people can do philosophy . In his Nicomachean Ethics , the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle writes that the young -- and not necessarily the young in age -- are not suitable students of ethics and politics because they lack experience and because they tend to follow feelings rather than reason . <p> Philosophy for Children is radical because it assumes that young people are capable of wisdom and can learn about difficult , abstract concepts . <p> Furthermore , in Socrates ' day , there was a concern that teaching the youth critical thinking skills would result in them being less obedient . If we teach students philosophy , will they simply argue for whatever they like , and be able to justify their arguments ? Is the study of philosophy corrupting or empowering ? <p> Philosophy for Children ( P4C ) is a program that takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary and high schools . P4C started at Montclair State University , New Jersey in the 1970s , when Matthew Lipman and Ann Sharp decided that a pragmatic approach to doing philosophy was needed . Their vision was to train children to think critically , creatively and collaboratively so that they would be better democratic citizens . <p> Influenced by the pragmatism of the philosopher John Dewey , Lipman applied the term ' community of inquiry ' to the pedagogy that is central to conducting philosophical dialogue with children . The community of inquiry sees participants seated in an inward-facing circle , allowing them to discuss philosophical concepts and ask questions of one another . <p> The role of the teacher is radicalised , as he or she becomes a facilitator of the community of inquiry , rather than the one source of all knowledge . The discussion that takes place in a community of inquiry is kept on-topic but allowed to flow , with the aim ultimately being shared knowledge and pluralistic truth . <p> Laurance Splitter brought P4C to Australia in the mid-1980s , and eventually a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was formed . Almost all Australian states now have P4C offered in some primary and high schools . <p> Queensland was the first state to offer philosophy as a non-compulsory secondary schools subject . Victoria followed in 2001 , South Australia came next in 2003 , Tasmania followed in 2006 and Western Australia introduced the ' Philosophy and Ethics ' course of study for senior students in 2008 . <p> Bringing philosophy into the high schools is a truly radical move that could certainly prove transformative . It 's radical because philosophy is a subject that asks people to think for themselves , rather than recite the correct answer to the question . So much of education today is ends-focused , with those ends being ' good test results ' and ' vocational skills ' . What is truly missing is the focus on learning for its own sake -- and the recognition that wisdom is more important than knowledge . <p> Wisdom involves practical knowledge -- what Aristotle would call phronesis . This is not simply about knowing facts , but also how to be virtuous and behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the flourishing of others . After all , we are social creatures who live together in communities . <p> Philosophy for Children is radical because it assumes that young people are capable of wisdom and can learn about difficult , abstract concepts . Of course , the philosophical dialogue must be age-appropriate , yet teachers who work with students in communities of inquiry often report being astounded by the insights young people can have when discussing topics as diverse as ethics , religious belief , politics or epistemology . <p> An additional source of pleasure is seeing how participants who regularly contribute to a community of inquiry grow in confidence and curiosity over time . Here is a space created within a classroom where they are allowed to ask genuine questions -- questions to which the teacher may not have the answer . And that 's OK ! <p> Teachers can explore the answers together with their students and , even learn from them , all the while guiding the philosophical discussion in a safe environment . Everyone is aiming for the best answers we have to date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if new information comes to light , we should be open to reflecting upon and further refining our existing answers . <p> In a well-functioning community of inquiry , members will move on from considering themselves and their own ideas as all-important . They become conscious of other members ' contributions and allow for the transformation and refinement of their own ideas . They eventually recognise they are not isolated thinking things , but rather part of an interdependent whole . They are members of a group of people who think and feel . It is this deep understanding that changes them . <p> The results can be extraordinary -- the children 's behaviour starts to change and you see , for example , less bullying in the school playground and rational resolution of disputes . However , in order for this to happen , the trust and care of a community of thinkers must be in place . Teaching philosophy in high schools using the community of inquiry pedagogy is a great way to achieve this . <p> One practical way that teachers can practice their skills build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of inquiry of their own . The chance to participate in an all-teacher community of inquiry can help inform teachers ' practice by helping them gain a sense of what it is like to be a member rather than a facilitator . <p> Getting philosophy into schools is a great way to make it more accessible , which is vitally important if the discipline is to be recognised as valuable in the 21stcentury . The thinking skills philosophy promotes are essential to living a good life -- and advocates of Philosophy for Children believe that by doing philosophy in a community of inquiry , children can become democratic citizens who think critically , creatively and collaboratively . Surely this is exactly what our society needs . <p> Dr Laura D'Olimpio is President of the Australasian Association for Philosophy in Schools and co-editor of the open accessJournal of Philosophy in Schools . She teaches philosophy at the University of Notre Dame in Perth . <h> Comments ( 5 ) <h> IB : <p> 28 Oct 2015 6:27:27pm <p> Yes , yes , yes .

With this kind of a shift though , the externalized correctness of answers loses significance and grading has to change . <p> Having said that , one of the things that commonly gets left off the table when drawing up a school curriculum is the presupposed assumption of measurement . The paradigm that students appeal their answers to an external source for the sake of grading .

That report carefully examined the evidence and foresaw that the changes in climate would create social and economic problems that would require multidisciplinary solutions . <p> Four decades on , and the world is at a critical juncture . The issues canvassed in that 1976 report are now becoming our realities . Decisions taken by the global community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the extent to which our world is changed by the enhanced greenhouse effect . As scientists , it is our duty to help the global community make the best decisions that can be made . <p> The Academy stands ready to help scientists discharge this duty . Our activities in science policy , and in public awareness and outreach , are designed to take the collective scientific opinion and put it in the hands of the public and the government . <p> But classrooms are not the only forum in which learning takes place , so the Academy provides science education for adults too . Nova : science for curious minds provides information on a very broad range of topical science , explained clearly and reviewed by leading scientists . Nova includes topics on ocean acidification , coral bleaching , the greenhouse effect , air pollution , biodiversity and the effects of climate change on human health . <p> Earlier this year , the Academy made a strong representation to the government on the issue of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets . We have argued that Australia must aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an important step along that process would be to reduce our emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030 , compared to 2000 levels . <p> I am heartened that the government is listening to the scientific community and has progressed the work of emissions reductions in Australia . I look forward to hearing of more progress in that respect , under the leadership of the new Prime Minister . <p> The Academy has also produced two " questions and answers " publications on the science of climate change . The Academy believed the Australian public deserved to have factual , unbiased and authoritative information on the science of climate change . <p> The science and information the publication contains is clear , concise , authoritative , defensible , reliable and accessible . It has been read widely in the community . Perhaps more pleasingly , it has also been read widely within government . <p> Late last year , just a couple of months before his untimely death , Mike penned a quick hand-written note : <p> Our task is to fix a generation of problems that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . We have the capabilities to repair climate and to lighten our footprints to what the planet can sustain . <p> We do have those capabilities . But in order to meet this grand challenge for our modern age , we as scientists must move beyond being truth-seekers . We must be truth-tellers . <p> We might not believe that truth conquers in the modern world , but I am determined that the Academy will act on one simple principle : scientific fallacy shall not stand . <p> The Academy will use its voice -- the voice of Australian science -- to stand for facts , to stand for rigour and to stand for free-minded and evidence-based analysis . As scientists , we can stand for nothing less . <p> As scientists , we enjoy some incredible privileges . We have the means to observe the wonder of the world at closer quarters than other members of our community . More than anyone else , I would contend , we have the ability to follow our interest and curiosity where it leads us . We also are equipped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our surroundings in a dispassionate and analytical light . <h> Divestment <p> Of course , with any privilege comes responsibility . We have a duty to conduct our work in an ethical and conscientious way . We must be mindful of how our work might be relevant to the wider world , and how we might use the results of our endeavour to improve the community and environment in which we all live . Perhaps most importantly , we must show leadership in those areas which are within our expertise . <p> As scientists , it 's often not in our nature to be happy in the spotlight . But current and future generations are relying on us not to shirk our responsibilities ; we must not leave the duty of leadership to those who seek only power and glory . We must ensure that we have a hand in shaping the future so it is fit for our children , and their children . <p> In this vein , I am delighted to announce that the Academy has taken some small steps in this area . This year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in environmentally sensitive activities . Accordingly , in the last month the Academy has divested itself of direct links to fossil fuels in its investment portfolio . <p> Of course , divestment is a difficult political issue , and the Academy is fiercely apolitical . Despite this , it 's a decision that we can make on rational grounds . Is the value that could be derived from fossil fuel activities sustainable in the long term ? Certainly not from the view of the Earth system , and probably not financially either . It is possible to put our support behind activities that are most sustainable , both financially and environmentally , so we have therefore committed to do so . <p> This is a small step that the Academy can take , but it is a step towards discharging our responsibility as scientists , and as leaders in society . <p> Our work in science education and science policy are small parts of being scientific leaders in the community . We will continue to expand our presence in the community , to be a bulwark of factual scientific advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encourage scientists to involve themselves in public discourse , and to encourage as many scientists as possible to be involved in the design and implementation of policy initiatives at all levels of government . <p> For those scientists who think that you do n't have a place in the policy process , I urge you to remember the words of Margaret Mead : <p> Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed people can change the world . Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . <p> This is an extract from the speech given by Australian Academy of Science President Professor Andrew Holmes at the Greenhouse 2015 Conference in Hobart on Tuesday 27 October 2015.

@@3720240 <h> Search form <h> Australian Review : Sony Xperia Z5 Compact - One of a kind <p> In the world of Android smartphones , if your handset is n't pushing at least 5.2-inches , it 's considered small . Many manufacturers are kitting out their flagship phones with 5.5-inch screens , if not bigger . Some smartphones push the envelope even further , encroaching on a massive 6-inches . <p> Sony 's Xperia Z5 Compact instead holds firm at a comparatively miniscule 4.6-inches . It 's easily the crowning jewel in Sony 's line of flagship smartphones , and deserves praise for the fact that 's a small Android smartphone that does n't skimp on hardware . <p> Of course , simply being different is n't enough in a smartphone market where we 're now well and truly spoilt for choice . Fortunately , the Xperia Z5 Compact is n't just unique , it 's also a good phone . <p> In plain black or stark white , the Z5 Compact is a bit boring . It 's the same design Sony has used for three years now , and it 's the antithesis to the modern aesthetic . While Samsung , Apple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved design in one way or another , Sony has stuck with its blocky , unpretentious look . It 's almost brutalist when you compare it to the competition . There 's a simple honesty to the Z5 Compact 's shell . <p> Sony does however offer two slightly more unique colour combinations : black and yellow , and black and salmon . I 'm sure these are n't for everyone , but they provide an otherwise tired design with a little bit of pop . <p> While Android feels a tiny bit cramped on a 4.6-inch screen , you 're comfortably able to use the Z5 Compact with one hand for the most part . The display itself it self is bright enough to use outdoors , and has sufficiently wide viewing angles ; no complaints here . Weighing in at 138 grams , the handset feels light but solid . <p> The Z5 Compact might almost look identical to last year 's model , but there 's one major change : the side-facing power button now doubles as a fingerprint reader . One press with an authenticated finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not quite as fast as the second generation of Touch ID found in the iPhone 6s , or the Nexus 5X 's rear-facing fingerprint reader , but Sony 's take at a fingerprint reader is nonetheless zippy and reliable . A side-facing fingerprint reader also has the benefit of working whether you 've got the phone face up or face down . <p> Sony has pushed the volume rocker a little further down past the power button this time around , which results in a somewhat uncomfortable stretch . Sitting underneath is a dedicated camera button that 's so far off-centre that it 's only useful when taking a photo in landscape . <p> As with last year 's flagship Sony smartphones , the Z5 Compact retains its IP68 waterproof rating . It 's worth mentioning that this only applies to fresh water ; salt water and chlorinated water are both potentially corrosive . As such , the waterproof rating is more of an assurance that the Z5 Compact wo n't break if your kid accidentally throws it into the bath , or if you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invitation to take underwater photos in the pool or at the beach . <p> The Z5 Compact is powered by an eight-core Snapdragon 810 processor . While this delivers plenty of grunt , the 810 processor family has gained a reputation from running hotter than the average smartphone CPU . I did n't notice any unusual heat during day to day usage , but the Z5 Compact runs a little hot after anything too intensive . A few minutes of Hearthstone are enough to warm the phone up . <p> While Sony certainly is n't the worst offender when it comes to Android customisations , it preloads a few too many applications . News for Socialife , Crackle , Spotify , and AVG Protection are just a few of the apps already on Z5 Compact out of the box . Annoyingly , apps like Xperia Lounge , What 's New and Movie Creator can not be uninstalled , despite the fact they 're all useless to me . <p> Somehow , Sony has also introduced bugs into certain core Android apps .

Setting your Exchange server to " m.outlook.com " will fix this for Office 365 accounts , as will downloading a third party dialler or messaging app , but it 's more than a little bit embarrassing - especially because the same issue existed in the Xperia Z3 's software . <p> The Z5 Compact battery is another big tick in its favour . It 's not quite as good as the Xperia Z3 Compact - which would last me up to two and half days per charge - but on most days I made it to midnight with 40% battery left . There 's not enough juice to last a second day , but I 'm quite a heavy smartphone user . A more conservative Z5 Compact owner could very well make it through two full days . The Z5 Compact supports fast charging , but a fast charger is n't included . <p> It feels like Sony sensors appear in almost every second smartphone . While companies such as Apple are able to get amazing results from Sony cameras , Sony - for some reason - is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ( albeit oversaturated and occasionally blown out ) photos when there 's plenty of light , but loses its panache as soon as it starts to get dark . While it 's possible to capture a good image at night , the Z5 Compact can just as easily turn it into a blurry , noisey mess , especially if motion is involved . Despite the massive 23MP sensor , photos taken on the Z5 Compact are devoid of minute details when you zoom in . It 's worth noting the camera app defaults to 8MP to out of the box - presumably to save users on storage . All in all , the Z5 Compact 's camera is good , but not effortless . <p> 100% crop <p> 100% crop <p> If you want a small Android smartphone that does n't compromise on power , Sony 's Xperia Z5 Compact is the one to buy .

@@3724234 <p> This week the AFL announced revisions to its illicit drug policy . With strident critics calling for " zero tolerance " and even criminal sanctions for transgressions , it is an opportunity to reflect on why such policies exist in sport , and to evaluate what the AFL 's latest iteration means by way of change . <h> Illicit drugs : internal regulation <p> In advanced nations like the US , UK and Australia , many professional sports have chosen to be internal regulators of athlete conduct in terms of illicit substances . <p> I have argued previously that the AFL , like other peak sport bodies , has five key aspirations with its illicit drug policy . These can be summarised under three headings : the management of risk , reputation and welfare -- whether to players or the sport . <p> While the AFL is hardly the only sporting league in Australia to have an illicit drugs policy , it has attracted criticism that it is too " soft " on users of illicit drugs ( three " strikes " before a suspension ) , and that it is " hiding " drug users ( counselling under a medical model rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cues , it 's worth mentioning that AIS athletes have four " strikes " under a policy conceived by the nation 's peak sporting body , the Australian Sports Commission ( ASC ) . <p> In the A-League there appears to be no testing of footballers out-of-competition for illicit drugs . The statutes and regulations on the FFA 's website do not disclose a policy position other than compliance to the WADA code . Curiously , there has been no invective directed towards either the ASC or the FFA in respect of their illicit drug policies . <p> In Australia there is healthy scepticism about any industry that self-regulates . In terms of illicit drugs , critics have every right to question whether a sport 's commitment to an internally developed voluntary code is genuine or a mere public relations exercise . <p> Given that concern , are there prospects for external bodies overseeing illicit drug testing and player transgressions , whether in the AFL or another Australian sport ? Is it time for heavy regulation by non-partisan authorities ? <h> Illicit drugs : external regulation <p> What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no international external regulator in respect of illicit drugs in sport . <p> When the champion American swimmer Michael Phelps was " caught " smoking marijuana , WADA was in effect disinterested . Phelps was at a party and out of competition . Yet if he had used cannabis during the Olympics , he would have been issued with an Anti-Doping Rule Violation . As U2 might have said , WADA moves in mysterious ways . <p> What about police intervention ? According to critics , sports like the AFL and the NRL , which conduct their own illicit drug-testing under a harm minimisation model , are violating the law by not " dobbing in " athletes to police . A problem with that assumption is that , as explained to me by a relevant source , police focus their resources on people in possession of such substances , and more seriously upon those who traffic them . <p> So from an illicit drug policy perspective , police are n't particularly interested in the " use " of illicit drugs by athletes ; their prime focus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciative of " intel " that allows them to investigate traffickers . That is less likely , ironically enough , if athletes who record a strike are publicly named ; their suppliers will be alerted . <p> What about government intervention ? Political parties are tough talkers in terms of illicit drugs in sport , such as with the publicity associated with the Australian Crime Commission report in 2013 . <p> Would a national illicit drugs policy for all sports be feasible ? There are many challenges , but I will mention only two . First , the Department of Health has long had " guidelines " for illicit drugs policies , but only required them of the ASC ( and thus AIS athletes ) , not national sport organisations generally . This is the four-strike policy that , I suspect , would raise the blood pressure of zero tolerance pundits . <p> Second , all drug testing is costly . Some sports may not be in a position to fund this type of monitoring ; would the government then step in to cover the cost ? If we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A$15.3 million in 2014-15 to $14.5 million in 2015-16 . If that 's an indication of federal government spending in this area , it 's reasonable to be pessimistic about a national illicit drugs policy for all sports . <p> It 's fair to conclude , therefore , that external regulation of illicit drugs in sport is presently unlikely . So what are we to make of changes to the most-prominent internally regulated illicit drugs policy in Australian sport ? <h> The AFL 's new illicit drugs policy <p> As explained ad nauseum , there is no requirement for AFL players to sign up to the league 's illicit drugs policy .

But the prevailing view is that year-round hair testing will ultimately become part of the three-strikes drug code that remains under review . <p> ... a player showing evidence of high drug dosages through hair testing will be warned to clean up his act before his identity is revealed to his club chief executive . That information will be communicated by the AFL medical officers . <p> Should target hair testing provide further evidence of illicit drug use , the player will be forced to undergo additional counselling and treatment with the knowledge of his club bosses , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Monitoring illicit drug use is understood by AFL players to be a health and well-being issue , but there is also the career-ending prospect of inadvertent doping through the consumption of a so-called " recreational " drug if it has been cut with a performance-enhancing substance . <p> This year , two AFL players , Lachlan Keeffe and Josh Thomas , were suspended from sport for two years after ingesting cocaine on a pre-season trip ; this batch of drug was laced with clenbuterol , a substance that is banned by WADA both in and out of competition .

@@3724235 <p> Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg , commenting last week on the recent environmental re-approval of the Carmichael coalmining project , sought the moral high ground against the government 's critics , claiming that there is " a strong moral case " for mining and exporting coal to poor countries . <p> So is there a moral case for coal , or not ? To answer this question properly we have to take into account all the benefits and harms resulting from the mining and use of coal . But we also need a critical reflection on our values . <h> The case for coal <p> Coal 's advocates say it lifts poor people out of poverty by supplying them with cheap and reliable energy . This argument is what philosophers call " utilitarian " : the reasoning being that coal boosts enough people 's well-being , by a significant enough amount , to outweigh the harm it does to the environment . <p> According to utilitarianism , morally " good " actions are those which maximise the overall amount of well-being and minimise harm . So a good utilitarian argument must take into account all harms and benefits -- including those affecting future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of utilitarian reasoning tells against coalmining . Fraser and those who agree with him are concerned about the large contribution that coal makes to global warming , which in turn will disproportionately harm the poor . <p> Climate campaigner and former US vice-president Al Gore , in his own assessment of the coal question , emphasises the harm to health caused by pollution from power stations , and the destruction of farmland and water supplies caused by coalmining . <p> Gore , like other opponents of coal , believes that renewable sources of energy will be better at lifting people out of poverty than coal-fired power stations . Whether present solar and wind technologies are capable of giving poor people the standard of living to which they aspire is open to doubt . But even if coal can still provide cheaper , more reliable energy than renewables , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that utilitarian morals do not make a positive case for coal . <h> Not just dollars <p> Most arguments on both sides of this issue have appealed to the costs and benefits to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is another , largely ignored , set of values that are not easily captured by a calculation of costs and benefits . <p> One of these values is emphasised in the Pope 's recent encyclical on the environment . Intervention in the service of business interests and consumerism , he says , is making our planet " less rich and beautiful , ever more limited and gray " . <p> Pope Francis advocates a profound change in our attitude towards nature . Relieving poverty , he says , requires a commitment to sharing knowledge and resources rather than the pursuit of development that threatens our future . <p> The Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein , in her 2014 book This Changes Everything , describes the threat posed by big energy companies to our political values . She blames these companies for distorting economies , corrupting politics and using their power to override democratic processes . In her view , finding alternatives to a dependence on fossil fuels is essential to the preservation of democratic values . <p> These positions are controversial . But they show that a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should value and how we should live . <h> Does it matter ? <p> How much do moral arguments about coalmining matter , anyway ? Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has admitted that Australian coal will not do much to relieve poverty in India , but also pointed out that if Australia does n't sell coal to India , other countries will . <p> I do n't agree with the idea of a moratorium on exporting coal . With great respect to the people who advocated it , it would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions . <p> Turnbull went on to claim that Australian coal is relatively clean and will cause less pollution . So the moral case for our coal , according to Turnbull 's reasoning , is that it will cause less harm than coal from other exporters . <p> Fraser thinks it unlikely that such a moratorium will be on the table at the upcoming United Nations climate summit in Paris in December .

@@3724239 <p> Hugh Morgan has been an apostle of the nuclear industry for more than 30 years . Australia 's biggest uranium mine , Olympic Dam , opened under Morgan 's watch as chief executive of Western Mining . And , to the ridicule of many , one of Morgan 's retirement projects was a business set up a decade ago that aimed to build nuclear power stations in Australia . <p> But Malcolm Turnbull 's support for a nuclear fuel industry based in South Australia is no Toyota moment for Morgan . And neither is our favourite defender of all things atomic tempted to excitement by Bill Shorten 's observation that an Australian nuclear industry should have been established years ago . <p> Morgan , you see , remains ever the financial rationalist . For sure , he welcomes broadest possible investigation of any and all the energy options that are available to Australia . But the decisions that need to be made about electricity generation in particular need to be informed by " their competitiveness and any other impacts that might arise from that production " . <p> " There is a certain correlation between our standard of living and our international competitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lower living standards . And the converse is true . The energy consumption per unit of standard of living is a dominant feature in all the data . So , in every sense , the community has a real interest in understanding all the energy sources and all the energy costs . " <p> Implicit in the Morgan commentary is that nuclear power is an uncompetitive option for Australia . In other words , nuclear power is wildly expensive to build and , apparently , dauntingly expensive to consume . Australia has plenty of cheaper options and it should stick with them . <h> Most recent insight <p> The most recent insight into the pricing underpinnings necessary to incentivise investment in nuclear power comes from the United Kingdom , where the governments of China and France have been given the opportunity to spend about $50 billion on the Hinkley power plant . <h> Related Quotes <h> Company Profile <p> To secure investment in a facility that will use relatively new and still uncertain technologies , the UK government has guaranteed to pay ? 92.50 a megawatt hour for power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average spot price for electricity across Australia on Tuesday was $39.89mwh . <p> That gap demonstrates the quantum of incentive that Australia might need to attract the capital necessary to establish a footprint in nuclear power . As things stand the only way to fill that gap would be to excessively price carbon with the aim of making nuclear competitive . Unless the rest of the world did the same thing , then the Morgan thesis would be that Australia would simply undermine the competitiveness of its energy economy . <p> " The big issue is cost , " Morgan explains . " The civil nuclear power program is driven by capital . The fact that we have a big base of uranium input is irrelevant . Uranium is the smallest portion of the input cost of running a nuclear fuelled plant . The overwhelming issue of relevance is the efficiency with which you are able to manage capital , " he said . <p> Again there is recent evidence of the cost of capital mismanagement . Areva of France is a leader in both power plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees by a next-gen plant it is building in Finland . Construction was approved in 2003 at a budget of $US3.5 billion ( $4.9 billion ) . The beast is currently running nine years late and it will not be finished until next year . It has so far cost $US9 billion more than it was supposed to . <p> In rejecting any of the currently live options for turning uranium into electricity , Morgan is endorsed by nuclear warriors that sit at the polar extremes of a discussion that has divided the Australian community since 1952 , which is when the Commonwealth allowed Britain to start testing atomic bombs here and when approval was offered to the Rum Jungle uranium mine without community consultation and without anything like the level of stakeholder or environmental audit that would now be regarded appropriate . <h> No policy to shape debate <p> Over the eons we have drawn advice on matters nuclear from competing worthies like founding chief executive of the Australian Uranium Association , Michael Angwin , and one of the nation 's hardest working anti-nuke campaigners , the ACF 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no obvious national energy policy to help shape the South Australian debate . " We do n't have an energy policy , " he said on Thursday . " We need one . Our energy policy is an implicit corollary of climate policy . Climate bureaucrats and ministers run energy policy by inference . " <p> Meanwhile , while some in the environmental lobby have openly embraced the nuclear option as a means to the zero emission world , Sweeney remains steadfast in opposing all pathways to a nuclear future . <p> " The gap between promise and delivery is stark , " he said in a note he wrote for us on Thursday . Internationally the number of nuclear power stations under construction is declining . Those that are being built face massive commissioning delays and cost overruns . Nuclear 's share of global energy production is at its lowest level since 1984 . The global reaction fleet is aging with scores of facilities set to be removed from operation in the next 20 years . <p> " Our energy future is renewable not radioactive , " Sweeny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the answer is nuclear , it must have been a bloody stupid question . " <p> Sweeny posits too that uranium enrichment and reprocessing is a high-cost , high impact industrial activity that is globally " oversubscribed and uneconomic " . <h> International bilateral engagement needed <p> Again , there is alignment here with uranium 's supporters . Angwin , for example , holds that the enrichment business requires bilateral engagement between one or more of the six or so nations that currently dominate both the supply and demand side of the market . <p> Morgan 's position is further textured . He observes that the technologies of enrichment are as tightly held , making Australia 's entry into the market even less likely that Angwin might imagine . In the end though , Morgan goes back to the numbers . These plants cost maybe $5 billion or so and Australia has a poor history in building projects in which longer term economics are shaped by being deliver on time and on budget . <p> The wildcard of disagreement between our three sages is that Morgan and Angwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing nuclear waste , while Sweeney argues we should step back and stop sending out the raw material in the first place . <p> " The Achilles Heel remains radioactive waste , " he suggested . " After more than six decades of commercial operation not one nation has a functioning final deposit site for high-level waste . That 's why the global nuclear sector is looking at Australia -- as a distant location to park a difficult issue . <p> " Nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste management remain exorbitantly priced and technically challenging . The routine production of carcinogenic waste that remains an environmental and public health threat for many thousands of years is simple proof of this truth : nuclear may be lower carbon than coal , but it is not clean " . <p> Morgan and Angwin see things very differently . Through their nuclear prisms , waste management is Australia 's best opportunity to grow its nuclear bounty . <p> " Spent fuel storage is the most prospective of the entry points , " Angwin said . " It is politically the most prospective as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the least difficult of the three options , technologically , from capital point of view and it is the one that has the most political support . " <p> Morgan is similarly convinced . " Nuclear power is the most capital intensive way of securing a regular source of energy , but the one with the lowest raw material input cost , " Morgan said . <p> " There is a longer tail of the management because of the issues of spent product , which is still subject to some rational and substantial irrational debate . Waste is the residual hotspot of the civil nuclear industry . It is our opportunity . "

@@3728231 <p> The state government is refusing to help fund Flemington 's new grandstand , despite spending much larger amounts on the grand prix which only provides Victoria with a fraction of the economic benefit of the Melbourne Cup Carnival . <p> The Victoria Racing Club is considering slashing the prize money on offer for the Melbourne Cup due to the standoff , as it will have to take on tens of millions of debt to fund the $120 million grandstand project . Any cuts to prize money would diminish the appeal of the event to overseas racehorse owners and trainers . <p> Last month Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews took to Facebook to announce his government had scored a three-year extension of the Melbourne Grand Prix to 2023 . The event cost Victorian taxpayers $61 million last year , and provided just $32 million of economic benefit to Victoria . In contrast , the Melbourne Cup Carnival provides an estimated $375 million of economic benefit to the state . <p> Advertisement <p> " The VRC funds the Melbourne Cup Carnival to the tune of $50 million annually , and the benefits to the state are multiplied many times over , " said the club 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected $375 million of economic benefit to Victoria .

" This is our original major event , and the stand at Flemington is shovel-ready as a project , but the bureaucrats in the department have made the decision they wo n't fund it , " said one senior ALP figure . <p> Treasurer Tim Pallas defended the decision , saying the club 's proposal for government support for a new members ' grandstand " would have to be considered against other budget priorities " . <p> " We are happy to continue discussing possible financing arrangements with the club , " he said . <p> Racing Minister Martin Pakula said since his party came to power the Victorian Racing Industry Fund had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The prize pool for this year 's Melbourne Cup is $6.2 million , of which the winner receives $3.6 million , making the race the richest handicap event in the world . <p> Mr Love said that prize money would fall if the club was forced to borrow funds to build a replacement for its ageing grandstand . <p> " If we have to take on significant debt , the money has got to come from somewhere , " Mr Love said . " Right now the club contributes millions of dollars of additional prize money to attract the world 's best horses . We also spend a significant amount to attract interstate and overseas visitors .

@@3728233 <h> Tagged In <h> Discuss <p> Richard Dawkins is a terrible scientist and a terrible philosopher . If he thinks religion is holding America back then he really is out of touch with reality . <p> Try racism , politics and the gun lobby , that 's what is really holding America back right now and having a heavy impact on American society . Religion has nothing to do with that and if I recall , two recent shooters over in America were militant atheists with a vehement hatred for religious people ( Craig Hicks and Chris Harper ) and this hatred of the religious seems to be growing over there from the atheist crowd . Maybe that needs addressing from Dawkins who acts as if the new atheism movement is without flaws . <p> The atheist movement is also sexist movement that denied sexual harassment towards the few rare women who attend atheist conferences , with Dawkins , supported by a huge amount of fellow atheists , making some ridiculous comments on women and rape . <p> Then we have the recent comments of Dawkins where he erroneously declared that trans-women are not women biologically at least because of their chromosomes , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's also apparently unaware of natural born women with saywer 's syndrome and androgen sensitivity syndrome which means these women are born with XY chromosomes but they are still women just like trans-women mainly because sex is also determined by the brain , physiology and yes indeed , even hormones not just chromosomes . All of that has to be taken into consideration and a good biologist would n't have made the same mistake of Dawkins in stating genotypic sex is the one factor in determining sex , seriously , he has apparently not heard of phenotypical sex or the brain 's importance and how trans-brains are different , truly aligning with the sex they identity with . <p> Now coming back to religion again , I can only say one thing to Dawkins and his idiotic ilk : <p> If you think the world is truly better off without religion then you are very free to go live in China or North Korea . These societies that are " free from religion " are n't really working out . <p> Then we had the Soviet Union which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions , not just of religious people but political dissenters too who opposed the atheistic state .

People will always fight over some ideology whether it 's political or something else and that 's not to mention crime which will continue to exist . When people like Dawkins finally wake up to reality and see this , I fear for them , their little bubble will pop and their reality will come crashing down upon them as they realize that mugger robbing them in the street is n't doing it because of God but because he is really desperate for cash and you ca n't blame religion for the goverment 's rulership on the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you experience in western society is from a secular government which includes the state oppression , censorship and divide of rich and poor . <p> And as soon as the gullible atheists wake up and realize this , the sooner Dawkins will stop making money from all those donations he receives from these idiots like a TV evangelists . He 's a cult leader and these atheists are too dumb to realize it . <p> " Religion is holding America back " no but politics is . Dawkins has no idea what 's going on America , he 's out of touch with reality . The real problems in the west come from class divide and racism , not to mention corruption in the secular governments . <p> However militant atheism is holding North Korea and China back .

It 's no wonder he spends his time writing books about religion and ranting on twitter .

" We were in all the papers all over the country . There was even a Gilbert &amp; George competition , dressing up with umbrellas and bowler hats . " <p> John Kaldor , a collector and patron of contemporary art , had invited the pair to Australia to perform their Singing Sculpture -- the piece that took them from obscurity to the art world 's doorstep .

They created the Drinking Sculptures , an honest combination of their art and themselves , which was to become the model for their future work : self-referential , self-sculptural , two men in a crumbling Huguenot house that they renovated even as they constructed their career . <p> Their art became the experience of making art in one place : Fournier Street , Spitalfields . <p> At one end of the street is Brick Lane , the artery of London 's Bangladeshi community , recently morphing into a trendy row of nightclubs and art galleries .

And just opposite is the Ten Bells pub , where rumour has it one of Jack the Ripper 's victims got drunk and another sold her services . <p> Gilbert &amp; George plundered their surroundings , taking photos of local " tramps " and skinheads , incorporating obscene graffiti into their collages , exciting and inciting controversy . <p> " The centre of the world is here , " Gilbert says . " They 're all marching in some way . Acting . Everyone feels like they 're inspired . " <p> The artists turned ever inward , shedding their suits to feature full-frontal in their photos , putting under the microscope and up on the wall their own excretions of every kind . Blood , sweat , urine , faeces and tears became material that , in Gilbert 's words " we wanted to make so beautiful that once they realise what it is , it 's too late " . <p> They stopped going to the movies , becoming ( in Gilbert 's words for a BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We like to be here , alone and weird , " George said . <p> For eight years they worked out of the house 's tiny kitchen , until they could expand into the backyard studio . They did n't use the kitchen for cooking , as they could n't bear the banality of shopping . Instead they became regular sights in the neighbourhood , going for an early lunch after their morning work shift , then in the evening walking again for a few hours , exploring , en route to the same Turkish cafe up the road in Dalston . <p> It 's a limited life . But , George says , he believes it keeps them artistically " pure " . <p> " We never go to the cinema , the theatre , or the ballet or opera , " he says . " We stopped 40 years ago .

We do n't want to be against or pro . <p> " But we only want to do our view -- that 's it . " <p> They never feel like they 're lacking inspiration . " We 're always bursting with more pictures than we 're ever actually physically going to make , " George says . " There are always more inside ourselves . " <p> Their work has evolved , as the Mona retrospective shows , in both form and content .

Says George : " For 20 years the journalists always said , ' Why are you always in your pictures ? ' Then one day they stopped asking that and they 've never asked it since . Because it 's normal now . " <p> Their suits are now considered " dapper " by the local hipsters . The West End is dead and the East End is crammed with creatives . When they started their careers , minimalism was trendy , now it 's " what every lady in the council flat would like " , says George , quoting Serpentine Gallery curator Hans Ulrich Obrist , " minimalism is the new kitsch " ( the quote has also recently been attributed to London artist Grayson Perry ) . <p> " Everything is moving , that 's what we believe , " Gilbert says . They are conservatives who love change . They perceive no contradiction : " if we do n't have a completely ordered , tidy , clean , organised studio , we would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They are still able to shock . It still affects their market price , Gilbert says . " A lot of collectors do n't want to offend the cleaning lady or I do n't know , whoever comes in the house . So they all want abstract art that does n't say anything . And a G&amp;G ' shit picture ' would be quite difficult to put up . " <p> But they want to believe that their art has , in some way , changed the world . <p> " The world is a different place than when we were baby artists , " George says . The arrival of gay marriage , the departure of obscenity laws . Books , art and films lead culture , and culture leads politics . <p> " The pictures are the same but the world changes around them , " George says . <p> Which brings them to Tasmania , and new surroundings . <p> As with all of their exhibitions , they have curated it themselves , building a scale model of the space , dobbing on tiny versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is some method -- " every time you turn a corner you are confronted " , George says .

So even hanging the pictures is some form of automatic , because of what we think and what we believe , what happened last year and 10 years ago , that forms how you will do something .

@@3739232 <p> Emma Alberici speaks with Shane Duffy and asks him what needs to be done to address the issue of Indigenous mental health and its link to mental health services . <h> Transcript <p> EMMA ALBERICI , PRESENTER : Shane Duffy is the chair of National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and co-chair of the Change the Record Justice Coalition , which is campaigning to slow the rising numbers of Indigenous people in jail . He joins me now from Brisbane . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Tell us why have successive Australian governments of all persuasions failed to address this issue , given rates of incarceration among Indigenous people is still on the rise ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Look , I think there 's challenges at two levels . Obviously the state and territory governments create the legislation and the public policy in relation to the incarceration rates , but also the second level is the Federal Government 's investment into addressing the disability and particularly the health services in the state and territories has n't been up to scratch . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Do you expect the NDIS , the National Disability Insurance Scheme , might go some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well absolutely . I think it 's a good start as a way to go forward from this point in time . But look , things are still up in the air around the National Disability Insurance Scheme . I work in the legal assistance sector and I work very closely with the disability sector . There 's a lot of confusion about what 's going on . So I think the more information that 's provided to the community - I note the Federal Government at this point in time is starting to roll out that public information . It 'll go a long way to bettering people 's access to the disability sector . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : The report that 's come out today says people with mental health issues are often seen as badly-behaved or too hard to control , so they 're left to police to manage . Researchers found this was true in all people with disabilities who come from disadvantaged backgrounds , but more so for Indigenous people . Why do you think that is ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Well I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face may be similar , but they 're also different from their cultural nuances compared to mainstream Australia . The policing methodology in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country has been more about lock them up and throw away the key . We continually see governments winning elections based off law and order agendas and incarceration . What we need to do is actually look at a new approach , a smarter approach to ensuring that we have safer communities across the country . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Why are n't the appropriate medical staff in the community to help these people ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Well I think the further you go out from the metropolitan and move into the regional and remote area , there 's a whole lot of staff burnout and stress , but particularly there 's a lack of resources in those communities . The further you go out from the cities , more often than not , you 'll find that our people , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to larger regional or metropolitan areas to get their health needs met . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Because a record amount of money is now being spent on Aboriginal health in this country . The Government spends roughly 1.5 times more on Indigenous health than on other Australians . Presumably some of that goes towards mental health services . Is it just a case of it 's not going to the areas that it 's needed or the services or both ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Well , Emma , I 'm no expert in relation to the health , but what I do is deliver legal assistance services . So if I can give you a basic scenario : what we find are our people end up before the courts because of mental illness or cognitive impairments . And we find that instead of the justice system dealing with them in relation to their health challenges in their lives , so what I 'm saying is , the reasons why they come to the attention of the justice system , what they actually deal with them is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long periods of time . They 're not actually dealing with the health challenges that they have . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Because when Aboriginal people are arrested and charged by police , why are n't their legal representatives arguing that they do suffer some sort of mental impairment ? Because if that can be established , is n't it more likely they 'll receive treatment rather than go to jail ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Well it 's hard . Right across the country , each state and territory government has different legislation , so what we try not to do is get people underneath the Mental Health Act . But what we actually need to do is look at some more coordinated national data , and obviously , analysis for not only the police to identify a client that may present with FASD or a mental illness , but more importantly , or just as importantly , that the courts are able to sentence people and understand the impact that FASD ... <p> EMMA ALBERICI : FASD - just for the audience who might not be familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> EMMA ALBERICI : ... FASD is Foetal Alcohol Disorder . <p> SHANE DUFFY : Yes , that 's right , Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder . So it 's really important that not only the police are able to identify the clients are presenting with this , but also that when they come before the courts after they 're charged , the legal representation are able to present an appropriate defence to the court . The courts at this stage are grappling with trying to understand the impact of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and mental illness in the criminal courts today . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : The first contact with police for Indigenous men is now around 14 , whereas for non-Indigenous men , it 's 18 . Is there a role for schools in addressing this issue ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Absolutely . School is - or education is a clear example . It actually leads toward better health outcomes . At this point in time , Emma , around one third of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are under the age of 15 . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention and early diagnosis of children when they 're very young , to start working with them in a positive way , to ensure the services are on the ground to meet some of the challenges that they may face , and what that 'll do is build better resilience for those young people to 1. ) remain in school and 2. ) keep out of the justice system , particularly the criminal justice system . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : If they do find themselves in the criminal justice system , in jail , are there programs to help them get better once they 're there ? <p> SHANE DUFFY : Look , it 's hit and miss and depending on what state or territory you look at , in some states there 's as many as nine in 10 young people that are in juvenile justice centres are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background . What we actually find also is that the vast majority of these young people are on remand . We need to look at bail hostels back in the community , so not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think more importantly , that we 're able to do some early diagnosis , some early intervention and build some strategies up to deal with the challenge that these young ones are facing . They should n't be in remand on health issues . They should have their health issues being addressed . <p> EMMA ALBERICI : Shane Duffy , we have to leave it there .

McCartney and John Lennon left the job of notating their music for the Beatles to producer George Martin . <p> Former member of the Beatles , Paul McCartney , during a 1989 concert in London.AAP <p> The news was received with frisson in some quarters , suggesting that a central goal of traditional music education , the ability to read music , was , self-evidently , unnecessary for a career , let alone a qualification , in music . <p> Given the ongoing threat to the funding of such music education in schools it certainly gives us pause for thought . <p> Should we teach music notation ? Should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music degree or , indeed , teach music ? <p> This is much more than simply an academic question . After all , a specialist music teacher represents a significant investment by the state . <h> More than simply notes on a page ? <p> Musical literacy is indeed no longer a prerequisite skill in many of the degree courses in music emerging at major Western universities . This is particularly true of courses that focus on popular musical genres and music production . <p> Music production today is largely concerned with technology rather than notation.Anna **30;671;TOOLONG <p> This shift reflects not so much the example of McCartney and others . Rather , technological advances in music production have all but obliterated the need for popular music to be transcribed into musical notation for it to be exchanged between producers , performers , and listeners . <p> Recall that it was not so long ago when the latest commercial musical hits could be bought as sheet music to be played at home on the piano or guitar . Sheet music may still be available today , but in the digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands mediation through a written score . <p> At the tertiary level , I suspect this emerging lack of confidence in music notation can also be traced to a broader , utopian urge to rid the world of old-fashioned hegemonic norms and institutional values . <p> The teaching of notation as a cornerstone of music education can appear to some as merely " just another brick in the wall " , as Pink Floyd would have it ; a means of subsuming individual artistic freedom into predetermined patterns of thought . <p> We thus end up with a rather Orwellian notion educational idea that here , at least , ignorance is strength . <p> Preordained systems of communication like musical notation are inevitably normative , and thus potentially oppressive to the creative expression of individuals and minorities . <p> The abolition of such norms has become , according to a recent essay by the great theorist of postmodernism Frederick Jameson , " a burning political issue " , often associated with " identity politics and the politics of secessionist groups and marginal or oppressed cultures . " <h> Preserving music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed a reductive system that inevitably shapes and limits what it attempts to describe . <p> But it still provides the most powerful means yet developed for turning the musical work into something preservable , transferable , and analysable . It connects us to well over a millennium 's worth of historical music practice . Above all , it allows us to render music into object of heightened critical contemplation . <p> Just as the printed word not only made it possible not just to preserve , but also deconstruct and reflect upon the various ways we construct words to help give meaning to our world , musical notation gave us a similar capacity to reflect deeply on how music does the same . <p> Rather than being a utopian moment of artistic ( and thus political ) freedom , an emerging loss of confidence in notated musical culture might in fact foretell its very opposite : a loss of a particular type of imaginative , historical , and political capacity in our society . <p> As early as 1938 , in the provocatively titled essay " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German philosopher and social critic Theodor Adorno suggested what such a loss might mean in practice . The real dichotomy faced by Western musical culture , he thought , was not between " light " and " serious " music but rather " between music that was market-oriented and music that was not " . <p> A significant question the music critic must ask , then , is : to what extent is the music offering any resistance to its appropriation as a tool in social and economic domination ? <p> Adorno was deeply distrusting of what he thought was the pseudo folk-culture around popular music . In his analysis , this ethos concealed a commercial imperative that was premised on manipulation and imposition of the populace from above . <p> So the role of tertiary music institutions in preserving the forms and critical tools of musical culture is crucial . As musicologist Ian Pace wrote recently : <p> ( Tertiary music education should ) provide arenas where it is possible to carry out intellectual and creative ( and other ) work , involving genuinely independent critical and self-critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything is rigorously questioned on a regular basis , with a fair degree of autonomy from commercial or other external function . <h> Music and late capitalism <p> What might a world without a critical music culture look and sound like ? Some commentators suggest we already know . <p> For cultural historian Ted Gioia , music criticism is becoming mere " lifestyle reporting " . Or as music critic Jessica Duchen suggests , pop music itself is becoming " watered-down tat with scant musical content , using only a few basic chords . " <p> Sam Smith won many Grammys in 2015 . Mike Blake/Reuters <p> A good example might be found in Sam Smith 's Writing 's on the Wall ( 2015 ) , the theme song for the latest Bond film . Heightened music production values can not rescue incoherent lyrics and an unimaginative melodic and rhythmic design .

Questions like these , after all , are what higher education in the arts should be about . Questions about what it means to be rational agents in civil society , and what kinds of investments -- educational and economic -- we need to make to sustain such a society . <p> Oh , and just for the record , Lennon and McCartney may not have read music . But you can be quite sure that pretty much everyone else involved in the transfer of their musical ideas into monuments of world culture did .

@@3743233 <p> IN LIFE there are always people who seem to take that extra step above the rest of the pack to be extraordinary .

What sets them apart ? What drives the motivation and the energy to keep following the dream no matter the challenges along the way ? Here are seven tips to drive your own success : <p> 1 . FIND YOUR PASSION <p> You absolutely have to love what you do to have a sense of being and a mission . The only judgment that matters is the one you have of yourself so decide what is it that you are going to stand for , what your testament is to the world , what difference you want to make today to influence the lives of others around you . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life , when you are clear on your ' why ' , you can then begin the journey to achieve what you desire from your life , business or profession . <p> 2 . MAINTAIN YOUR ENERGY <p> Today , now more than ever , the role of a leader or manager has never been so demanding . Think about it -- 24/7 communication , international and domestic travel , cross functional working , endless office meetings , conference calls , smaller teams , increased workload etc . Energy is critical to success . If you love what you do , you will have high energy . Passion and energy are identical twins that drive momentum . <p> Designer Ralph Lauren clearly loves what he does , and has the energy at 76 to stay actively involved in his business . Picture : AFP Photo / Emmanuel Dunand.Source:AFP <p> 3 . ATTITUDE IS KEY <p> The one thing you can control is you and your attitude to success . That is yours and yours alone . Understand what makes up your value system and own it . Live it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within , taking control to acknowledge your own values and beliefs and the person that you are on the inside , you will never be capable of being the better person on the outside . <p> This system is unique to you and it is your responsibility to take ownership . There are times when it will be challenged or when you will give in to other 's values -- and you will look back and kick yourself and wish you had trusted your intuition . That intuition , that gut feeling -- do n't ever mistrust it . It is a key part of you , and you should learn that it is one of your best assets . <p> 4 . YOUR NETWORK SUPPORTS YOU <p> Your network drives you , lifts you , pushes you further and sees more in you than you can often see in yourself . Build your network and spend time with them . Learn from them . Listen to how they speak . Be open to advice and feedback . Have the courage to ask questions and seek advice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Formal education will make you a living ; self education will make you a fortune " . To not invest in you is a waste of potential talent . The most successful individuals , the ' five per cent ' , read incessantly , continually increasing their knowledge base . Read , listen , learn and become an expert in your field . Learn , learn , learn . <p> 6 . FIND YOUR INNER PEACE <p> Successful people all have a solidity about them , a calmness , an ability to take on more than your average Joe and this stems from his or her inner peace . They are more self-aware , less stressed and let 's be honest -- it 's far easier to get what you want when you can see the wood for the trees and the clarity of the decisions that need to be made . <p> 7 . SELF-CONFIDENCE IN YOU <p> It 's not about being strong but rather having the strength , confidence , determination and resilience to succeed , to ask the questions when you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident enough for others not to agree , to put yourself out there , to face your fears and failures head-on , to course correct and keep going . <p> A positive , motivated attitude and taking ownership of your own journey are intertwined and part of any true success story . It allows you to take strength and learning from the times when you fail -- and yes , you will fail ; it allows you to turn the feeling of sometimes debilitating fear into useful adrenaline and a sense of excitement for the possible . It allows you to trust rather than doubt . <p> Just think about it . Say the words . <p> ' Yes I can ' . <p> ' Yes I CAN ! ' <p> How does that feel ? Believe in the possible rather than doubting , dwelling and living in the negative . Take a chance and embrace wholeheartedly what may be , rather than wasting energy imagining what can not be .

@@3747233 sceptics who have Turnbull by the short'n'curlies <p> Gone is the prime minister who once suggested climate change was " crap " , but the old guard of climate sceptics still remain within the Coalition to keep the new one in line , at least for now . <p> CSIRO this morning released a report looking Australians ' attitudes to climate change between 2010 and 2014 . Gender , age and education mattered little in a person 's opinion on climate change , but a person 's voting behaviour was found to have a strong correlation . <p> Overwhelmingly Liberal and National voters believe that climate change is natural , rather than human induced , at 52% and 42% respectively . Just 28% of Liberal voters believe climate change is human-induced , and that figure is 22% for Nationals voters . This scepticism is still broadly reflected in the party 's elected representatives , who are currently holding the Prime Minister back from any action on climate change that is n't Tony Abbott 's " Direct Action " policy . <p> Ahead of the climate talks in Paris , where pressure will be on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the sceptics he has to appease ? <p> Dennis Jensen : Arguably the most prominent and vocal climate sceptic in the Coalition , Jensen went full Godwin the last time then-opposition leader Turnbull attempted to act on climate change , suggesting that sceptics should be listened to : <p> " Albert Einstein was very much criticised by Hitler , and Hitler actually had a group of 100 top scientists in Germany write a book called ' 100 scientists against Einstein ' . " <p> Six years later Jensen remains a sceptic , and said in July this year that up to 10 MPs were sceptical of the human impact on climate change . He attempted to get the Liberal Party to back a parliamentary inquiry to examine the evidence of climate change before the government announced its 2020 emissions reduction targets . That was unsuccessful . <p> At the time he said that global average temperature had n't warmed as predicted for the last 15 years , and IPCC reports " overstated " warming trends . <p> Chris Back : WA Liberal Senator Chris Back does believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted climate science . When the carbon tax was repealed , Back claimed that recent bushfires in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney had not been caused by climate change , and that the planet could adapt : <p> " As a person with some experience in the biological sciences and as a person with some degree of optimism , what I can tell you is that organisms on this planet have always , still are and will always adapt . For example , there has been great dialogue and discussion about the polar bear populations in the Arctic . I recently made it my business to go examine what is happening . I came upon a paper presented only about a month ago -- on 11 June in the United Kingdom -- by Professor Susan Crockford , herself 35 years an expert in the biology and zoology of polar bears and their evolution . Her conclusion is that there has been no adverse effect as a result of changes in the Arctic Circle .

Emissions must be eliminated . <p> An ETS would give industries rights to emit , and allow the emitters to trade in the rights . Instead we should be providing alternative non-carbon power while taxing carbon , and eventually criminalising emissions . <p> Why is the Government spending billions on a " Direct Inaction " plan that wo n't work to address a problem , anthropogenic global warming , that most of its base and its representative do n't believe exists ? Could it be to pretend to address the problem so that people concerned about global warming can vote LNP with a clear conscience ? <p> There is no way that these politicians got into Parliament on merit . They are behaving stupidly in the most destructive possible way . They are hindering the wellbeing of the planet by giving ignorant , lazy , selfish and greedy people , like themselves , opportunity to deny scientific facts . These people argue that it is costing too much money to reduce pollution in the atmosphere without considering the terrible price of doing nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are eye-sores .

We are all blots on the landscape and we must decide what blots we can live with and windfarms must have high priority over others at this point in time . <p> Pre-agility Turnbull then .. Direct action will simply be a con , an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing ... Agility Turnbull now .. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is sticking by the direct action policies of Tony Abbott . " The reality is if direct action works in practice , it works . If it cuts emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , we have made things a lot worse over the past 300 years and soon the damage will be too great to repair and future generations will suffer .

The book was " 100 authors against Einstein " and was published in 1931 so was hardly the result of Hitler getting his mates to write the book ( Hitler appointed Chancellor in Germany on 30 Jan 1933 ) . As usual these people sprout nonsense for the gullible media . <p> KenL - so you disagree - " the more intelligent cohort of citizens vote for the coalition " with JS Mill 's observation ' not all Conservative are stupid but most stupid people are conservative ' ?

It is time for us to examine why on earth we are frightened of nuclear electricity . That is , except for that same fraction of the Greens who would rather our descendants should fry in hell on earth than that they should use their brains . <p> Bear with me as I am now on the Crikey watchlist for permanent moderation in case I say something against the Party line . <p> Agree we should be going nuclear in smarter ways with package plants , power ships , power subs , turning our uranium resources into a virtuous circle of selling , reprocessing and reselling , setting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the business and make some money etc etc .. <p> But we were disabled by a previous generation of Green ratbags led by the likes of Caldicott , aided by the Robin Williams'kind of ABC advocacy science exploiting the woeful scientific illiteracy of the chatterers ; mostly lawyers and journos and confining us to a coal/red dirt/agriculture economy . <p> This has left us with no native nuclear industry in a country with vast stable areas and huge uranium resources ; no space industry since the Brits left Woomera and 18 workable F-18 's and 4 subs to defend ourselves . <p> Ken , I understand your desire to keep mining something , but just remember it was less than three years ago that many UK farmers could start to use their land after the Chernobyl fiasco . Solar , solar thermal and wind farms could easily run Australia on current technology , let alone on what is soon to be available , so why take the risk on nuclear ? <p> Old Bill -- you say that there a risk with nuclear . But you fail to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been misled by someone who should know better , or that you did n't know that the uncertainty is out-of-date . Could it be that you just have n't bothered to check ? <p> Check this one -- how many people were killed at Fukushima by radiation ? When you discover how few that is , you will realise that the evacuation that killed more than a thousand frail people was driven by fear , propagated by voices such as yours . Outdated fear . <p> Australia covered in ice or in rainforests seems to presume that its location has been static over time - continental shift means that it has been located further North , and further South , than it is now . 
@@3747235 <p> Care homes are already in crisis . Up to 50% of them could close due to the shortfall between what councils can pay and what the care costs , according to reports in The Observer . But when you look into the future , I 'm afraid the news gets considerably worse . <p> Old age might seem a long way off to many . But when a recent YouGov survey asked us which should be the NHS 's priority areas over the next five years , care for the elderly came top , on 57% .

This is not as straightforward as it might first appear . By the 2030s , new technologies that make it easier to look after people remotely should have become standard .

And remote care wo n't always be enough on its own . Suitably equipped houses will be required . So we need to think about the future requirement for homes fit for everything from " independent living " through to very sheltered housing . According to estimates made in 2013 the future will look like this : <h> Time for a national plan <p> In total , our estimate at the Institute for Sustainable Construction is that the UK will need to build more than 15,500 residential " care " developments by 2035 , each of which would accommodate 40 to 70 people .

But to a large extent , those at local level are being left to fend for themselves , and we are in danger of over-focusing on technology that will never help everyone . Instead we need a national infrastructure plan to support councils and care providers to make the necessary changes . <p> Normally infrastructure is associated with major transport systems and utilities , but it should also be relevant to major changes in where we need to live -- and how we navigate around these places . <p> This is not just about funding but also strategy : we will need to identify gap sites in cities , towns and villages to enable as many elderly people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay at home , this is essential for enabling them to see family and friends , and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation . <p> We need to start responding to this immediately , over and above the current funding difficulties .

Samsung says that the Galaxy View offers 8-hours of video playback , though I found I got a little less . Plugging it in is easy enough , though it ruins the joy of portability while charging . The charger is a proprietary AC adaptor so you wo n't be able to enjoy any Quick Charge features . You 're also kind of screwed if you lose it . <p> In Bed This is where things get a little tricky .

@@3781234 <p> It 's now nearly nine decades since Virginia Woolf published Orlando : A Biography , but the story of a nobleman who lived for four centuries and inexplicably changed from a man to a woman halfway through her life retains all of its audacious and subversive power . Inspired by Woolf 's relationship with the extraordinary and eccentric writer Vita Sackville-West , the title character is touched by events and major figures from England 's history and discovers how his identity is shaped by the " spirit of the age " , and the gender in which he happened to be born into and the gender which she suddenly and miraculously came to embody . <p> In adapting the book for the stage , American playwright Sarah Ruhl has used much of Woolf 's text and retained its light and satirical spirit , as well as its incident-packed narrative . Just as Woolf explored and shook up the structure and conventions of biography , Ruhl does so by using on-stage narrators as biographers who pull details of Orlando 's long life into sharp focus , briskly leap over others , and ignore many altogether . <p> In one scene , Orlando is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine that we need n't hear any of the two hours of small talk between them because a ) nobody can be entirely sure what they said and b ) it was undoubtedly insignificant . A brief snippet of small talk might just reveal more about a person than a recount of every " significant " event of a person 's life , but a biography necessarily has its own rules and priorities . <p> It 's also no coincidence that the biographers -- the writers of history who are able to shape the story of Orlando -- are all played by men in this production directed by Sydney Theatre Company resident director Sarah Goodes . There 's John Gaden , who turns in a memorable performance as Queen Elizabeth I , Garth Holcombe , who has an excellent comedic turn as an Archduke and Archduchess , Anthony Taufa , who gets to briefly flex his Shakespearean muscle , and Matthew Backer , who is effortlessly suave as Marmaduke and embodies the female characters with more truth than the other three -- mostly because he does n't explicitly " perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pace and style , and is blessed with an extraordinarily generous performance from Jacqueline McKenzie in the leading role , constantly reaching out to the audience . <p> McKenzie starts out as the vivacious and passionate 16-year-old boy and transforms into a beautiful young woman with only the slightest changes to her voice and mannerisms -- mostly those necessitated by the wardrobe change from male to female . McKenzie 's Orlando never loses that youthful , unstoppable creative energy and joie de vivre , but four centuries do eventually take their toll on our young hero and an emotional tiredness sneaks in as she creeps closer towards the present moment . <p> McKenzie is particularly charming as the young man Orlando falling in love with a beautiful Russian princess Sasha , played brilliantly with a seductive , tough and regal quality by Luisa Hastings Edge . Sasha 's betrayal of Orlando is a pivotal moment in his life , but when Orlando eventually becomes a woman she comes to understand that women are innately no better built for loyalty and chastity than men are . <p> It 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- although nothing about the core of Orlando as a person changes when her gender changes , she is treated fundamentally differently by all the people around her . Even the law treats her differently -- she 's no longer able to own property because of a simple biological fact . <p> Orlando then realises just how much of her life was determined by her gender -- first as a man and then as a woman . And apart from the way Orlando 's story will be told ( by those rogue biographers ) what else in her life has never really been under her control ? <p> These are all big questions which Orlando ( and the audience ) must look inward to answer . This is an essentially introspective work which plays with notions of who we are publicly , who we are privately , and how we relate to the communities in which we happen to be placed . <p> Of course , it 's difficult to be as introspective on stage as you might be in a novel , but Renee Mulder 's set indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also uses two staircases atop a circular revolving stage , like a giant clock with two hands on its face , spinning quickly at times and halting to stretch time out at others . <p> Ruhl and Goodes allow all of Woolf 's biggest questions about identity to linger in the air while Orlando quickly leaps from century to century . Occasionally you do get the sense that there are deeper resonances in Woolf 's text which could be more obviously ploughed and projected .

@@3781238 <h> PowerPoint 2016 now helps people design slides that are n't terrible <p> If there 's one problem with presentation software , it 's that it 's hard for many people to create slides that look and feel professional . While Microsoft does its best to provide people with templates , it can still be hard to make slides look good -- and that 's made doubly difficult for users starting from a blank canvas . <p> Microsoft is aiming to solve that with a new feature for PowerPoint 2016 called Designer that helps people who are n't presentation experts put together good-looking slides . When users go to insert an image into their presentation , Designer automatically pops up a sidebar on the right-hand side of the PowerPoint window with a handful of design ideas . <p> There are more than 12,000 layouts , which Microsoft created in conjunction with professional designers . In order to present only a handful of layouts to users , Designer looks at the images inserted and detects the most important content to influence its decision . <p> Microsoft <p> The PowerPoint Designer interface . <p> According to Chris Maloney , the senior program manager for PowerPoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent manipulating slide elements in order to produce the same effect . <p> " But with Designer , we can give you this option that would have taken like 30 clicks , and we give you five of them , " Maloney said . " So right there , that 's like 150 clicks , and all you have to do is try them on , see what you like , and then just be on your way . " <p> There 's one downside : Designer requires an Internet connection to work , since the analysis that powers the feature is handled in Microsoft 's cloud . When PowerPoint loses its network connection , any existing slides touched by Designer can still be manipulated and edited , but the software wo n't suggest designs for new slides . <p> Another new feature , Morph , makes slick transition animations easy to pull off . It takes two different slides and transitions between them by fading and moving different slide elements around .

That 's why Microsoft designed Morph to be idiot-proof : all of the motion between slides is point-to-point , with object transformations taking place subtly . <p> Both of these features are only available to users who are subscribed to Office 365 , Microsoft 's software-as-a-service offering for its productivity suite .

With smaller devices and smarter analytics , they 're improving upon the systems that have been testing urban conditions for years . <p> The so-called " smart cities " trend has generated a lot of attention for things like automated traffic , parking management and better transit , but urban life also has an underside of health dangers . For the Senseable City Lab at MIT , that side is found literally underground .

And as this data is flushed down the toilet , there 's a vast reservoir of information on human health and behavior that goes with it , " Project Manager Newsha Ghaeli said . <p> It 's not a new concept , but today most sewage testing happens at wastewater treatment plants , which are miles from the source and collect material from all over the city . The Underworlds project , like other IoT deployments , brings it down to the hyperlocal level . <p> By studying sewage on a street or neighborhood level , the researchers hope to learn things like where outbreaks of disease begin and even detect pathogens before people start getting sick . Flu viruses and other bugs incubate in people 's bodies before they cause symptoms . <p> Testing can also uncover things like markers for diabetes and obesity , which are major public health issues in many U.S. cities .

After the robot has collected several samples , the scientists retrieve the filters and take them into a lab . The goal is to eventually build a near-real-time sewage information network with testing done by the robots in the field . <p> The team is already on its second-generation robot , Luigi , a slimmed-down version of its bulky predecessor , Mar.io . Luigi is also cheaper to build and can sterilize itself after doing its work , saving the researchers a lot of work , Ghaeli said . <p> MIT will build out its system across Cambridge over the next two years and then deploy a larger network in Kuwait , which is helping to fund the project .

Each has 12 sensors for things like carbon dioxide concentrations , said Kim Hunter , managing director of communications and engagement . <p> Since then , Aclima has ventured outdoors . Now Aclima sensing devices are attached to Google Street View vehicles in Denver as part of a pilot project .

When I was playing through the game my mind was completely on auto-pilot .

Nothing in this game was actually a challenge . There are some bits that take a few tries , but this seemed to come down to just a bit of good luck . The " last " boss was an exercise in frustration that almost made me put down the controller and walk away .

I think it 's actually the least fun boss I 've ever fought other than the optional one in FarCry 4 . <p> I was pretty disappointed with the campaign if you ca n't tell .

Luckily , the online mode is an absolute blast . <p> Ah OK thanks . Enemies that can kill you in one shot have always annoyed me , worse when they are bosses with inflated health bars such as in halo 5 . It 's also more painful to watch in this game than most as your allies flail about trying to help you up , but just get inevitably cut down before they can . <p> It just seems like a way of causing you to die artificially since barely anything else is actually a threat .

In fact , Texas is one of 11 states that do not require families even to notify educational authorities that they homeschool their children . <p> A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet certain educational requirements . Other states , such as California , stipulate that homeschoolers must study subjects similar to public schools .

Authorities can approve curricular plans , but such documents may have little to do with what actually occurs during the year . <p> Indeed , much of the value of the homeschooling approach rests in its inherent flexibility to customize learning experiences in ways that work best for individual children . While portfolios of student work at the end of the year might be revealing , they are also difficult to evaluate consistently and efficiently . <p> With this in mind , standardized basic skills tests hold the most potential for protecting children 's basic educational interests while leaving room for curricular flexibility . <p> Few of us would deny that children need basic skills of literacy and numeracy in order to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've spoken with over the years would share this view . <p> I suspect that the vast majority of homeschoolers would have no trouble passing basic skills tests . And even for students who struggle with basic skills assessment , the next step would be a closer look by the state to understand the context , rather than an automatic assumption of educational neglect . <p> It 's also worth pointing out that basic skills requirements need not dictate the shape or method of homeschool curricula ; there are countless ways to cultivate such basic skills in children -- from highly structured curricula to student-directed projects to experiential learning . <p> While the answer to this question should be obvious , there is plenty of reasonable disagreement about what other skills , knowledge and dispositions children should develop -- and whether such expectations should be standardized for each child . <p> The plain truth is that no such evidence exists . Wide-scale studies of homeschooler test performance have been based on volunteer samples , often with testing conditions far different from those of public school students . <p> And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorably with public school students , that would say nothing about the experience of children whose parents use homeschooling as a cover for educational neglect or worse . <p> Homeschool advocates will also point to data showing no correlation between the amount of regulation in a particular state and the test scores reported by homeschoolers in those states . <p> But here again we run into the problem with volunteer samples -- it seems highly unlikely that homeschool parents who neglect their responsibilities would even have their children take such tests , much less report the results . <h> Finding middle ground <p> Plenty of reasonable disagreement exists about what constitutes a great education . But we should all be able to agree that all children have a vital interest in gaining basic skills of literacy and numeracy . <p> Protecting those interests , while also honoring the role of parents in shaping their child 's educational experience , means finding a middle ground between intrusive regulations and having no oversight at all . <p> I agree that homeschool parents should be given wide latitude in the shape of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a complete lack of external accountability leaves too much room for neglect and abuse to go undetected . <p> A modest set of expectations such as annual reporting of enrollment and basic skills testing would go a long way toward protecting children 's interests while preserving homeschool freedoms .

@@3808233 Horror Emotional <p> From the moment I saw the first trailer , I knew I wanted to try Yomawari out . It looked both adorable and horrifying , but I had no idea just how powerful the experience would be . <p> Yomawari is a game from Nippon Ichi Software for the PS Vita . I think it should be classified as a horror game , but what I got was much more . <p> The game centres around a little girl . After both her dog and her older sister disappear , she is left to search through the dark and spooky town for them . Soon it becomes clear that there are dangerous otherworldly things out there in the night . <p> Right from the start , Yomawari uses the juxtaposition of adorable and freaky to great effect . The protagonist little girl is so cute and innocent in design that you immediately feel drawn to her plight . Then there is the setting she runs about in . Dark and foreboding , the peaceful town seems threatening and dangerous at night . The isometric view also helps to make everything seem more beautiful and scary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already been mentioned , but the tutorial for Yomawari is perhaps the most shocking and affecting tutorial for a game I have ever experienced . Without going into spoilers , the fact that what happens , happens , and that the game pretty much tricks you into making it happen is a masterful stroke of genius I 've rarely seen . It 's brutal , comes out of nowhere , and immediately makes you part of the story at hand . <p> One of the more affecting aspects of Yomawari is that it is a coming of age story of a little girl learning of mortality -- her own and of those around her . Initially she seems almost stupidly ignorant of most of the things going on around her , with only the guidance of the player to keep her out of harm 's way . But as the story progresses , and she continues to encounter and interact with forces from beyond , you get to see the dawning realisation on this little girl . The whole thing is very touching and very emotional and gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . <p> The colourful palette of creatures that inhabit the world of Yomawari is quite fascinating . Indeed , most things will attempt to kill you when you approach them , but interestingly enough , others are completely harmless despite their creepy or unsettling appearance . That said , the designs of the monsters are unsettling and freakish and never really stop being frightening whenever they show up . <p> The game captures much of the Japanese heart of ghost stories in that many of these beings are n't good or evil , they 're forces of nature that simply are . There 's no getting rid of them , no pleading that will make them forgive your trespasses , no knocking the bad guy into a pit of fire and then having credits roll . These things are a part of the world just as much as you are and the only solution is to try to coexist without having them kill you . The game 's ending really drives that point home and even after I cleared the game , I spent several hours thinking the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game it 's that you will die . A lot . By lack of skill or by accident , you will meet your grizzly end again and again . The game takes this into account by saving your progress and letting you keep things you 've obtained right up to when you were turned into a black screen full of red splatter . Unfortunately , this cycle of try , die , repeat lends itself into some moments of monotony and pattern memorization where you will be trying to navigate the same maze of shadow creatures for the umpteenth time without being slaughtered . <p> For me , Yomawari was a game I had high expectations for that still managed to surpass all of them . From its charming yet haunting atmosphere to a very subtle yet powerful story I absolutely loved my time with it . The game is short by modern gaming standards ( about 4 to 5 hours depending on your skill ) , but as a horror game , it 's a perfect length that keeps it from ever overstaying its welcome and becoming mundane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you want to experience the same story again , but it is still most definitely a game worth experiencing . <p> Yomawari is currently available for the PS Vita in Japan .

Ansar Dine -- which is Arabic for Defenders of Faith -- and two other jihadist groups , al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb ( AQIM ) and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa ( MUJAO ) , were originally allied to the MNLA , but escalating violence led to international intervention by a French and African force that effectively destroyed the organisational structure of these groups . <p> The French government deployed its air force and 3,000 troops in 2013 to secure the north of the country at the request of the newly installed president , Dioncounda Traor ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 when the troops were redeployed as part of a wider offensive to combat unrest in the Sahel region . <p> A UN force , MINUMSA , has been on the ground since April 2013 with the aim of securing the north of the country -- and , as of the end of June 2015 , had just over 10,000 personnel in Mali . <p> Tuareg nationalists and Islamists struggled to reconcile their conflicting views for the newly independent region and , after several clashes , the MNLA renounced their claim of independence for Azawad and engaged with the Malian government in negotiations on its future status in 2014 . <p> Despite talks resulting in in June 2015 in a UN-brokered peace between the main factions on both sides , the continuing violence illustrates the differences between the Tuareg nationalist and Islamist groups , but also the difficulties in maintaining peace in the country . <p> Malian defense minister Tieman Coulibaly surveys the damage after a hotel siege in August in Sevare , Mali.Reuters <p> According to a report by Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , several armed groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN troops deployed in the country .

Or is it ? <p> Despite private capital expenditure recording its biggest-ever quarterly fall , there may be a small-business-driven silver lining on the economic cloud <p> The apparent success of the instant asset write-off for small business is probably small comfort to Joe Hockey and Bruce Billson , the two ministers responsible for the policy . Photograph : Alan Porritt/AAP <p> The latest capital expenditure figures show that investment across the board continues to plummet . However , one bright bit of news is that the measure in the May budget , designed to encourage investment in machinery and equipment , looks to be having an impact . <p> Over the past couple of years , every three months the latest private new capital expenditure figures have brought a nice helping of economic gloom . <p> As noted last week , growth in Australia 's economy has gone from being driven by private investment to now being driven by exports . The latest GDP figures , due out on Wednesday , will likely show this to be the case , for once again the capital expenditure figures have shown a stunning fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . The fall of 17.8% is n't the worst ever , just the second worst -- only in 1991 has there been a steeper fall . <p> And as usual the big fall is in buildings and structures -- down 21.6% and accounting for 80% of the drop in total investment : <p> But more worrying is the fall in investment in machinery and equipment . While the fall in building and structures is to be expected , given the end of the massive boom in the building of mines and the infrastructure associated with them , the hope was that the non-mining sector would take up some of the slack . <p> And we need that to happen , because so quickly and so greatly has mining investment fallen , the non-mining sector is now the larger : <p> But the fall is across the board -- mining , manufacturing and the " other selected industries " sector , which takes in all other industries ( with a few key exceptions ) . The figures do n't include any investment for health , education and public administration -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This would suggest the transition from the mining boom is rather bust , and even more so when we look purely at the growth of investment in machinery and equipment . While the manufacturing sector saw a 14.8% rise in such investment , the value of that investment is only about 18% that of other selected industries , which fell 0.6% in the past year . All up in the non-mining sectors , the rise was just 1.5% : <p> So there is n't a heck of a lot of joy looking at what has happened in the past year . But the capital expenditure figures also provide a glimpse into what firms expect to do in the future . The latest figures contain the fourth estimate for capital expenditure in the 2015-16 financial year . <p> On first blush , the overall news is not good .

The latest ( estimate four ) has investment worth $36.007bn . <p> This latest estimate is 14% above that of estimate three and it is 33% above that of estimate two -- both of which represent the biggest such jumps since 1997-98 . <p> The worry with the instant asset write off was that it would just be a sugar hit -- businesses would quickly buy machinery , new cars , etc , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hit is continuing to come , with firms much more optimistic about their investment decisions than they were six months ago . <p> That is undoubtedly good news , and probably small comfort to Joe Hockey and Bruce Billson , the two ministers responsible for the policy who are both no longer in the cabinet -- and , with Billson 's recent announcement to quit politics , soon neither will even be in parliament . <p> It is ironic for a treasurer who loved to preach austerity that , in the end , his most successful budgetary measure was a stimulatory one .

Its Northern Railways subsidiary is developing the Erdenet to Ovoot rail project . <h> Aspire Mining cleared to build rail for shipping Mongolian coal <p> Aspire Mining ( ASX:AKM ) has received a key railway construction licence in Mongolia , setting up advancement of a critical and ambitious infrastructure plan to support the company 's prized Ovoot coal project . <p> The company 's rail infrastructure subsidiary , Northern Railways , has received its government construction clearance for the Erdenet to Ovoot railway , a project that spans 547 kilometres and forms part of a national policy aimed at connecting the northern provinces with Russia . <p> At full operation , the project will have capacity to move 30 million tonnes per annum of bulk commodities , agricultural , general

And a lot of the most persecuted minorities in the Middle East , the Jews , Christians and the Yazidis , do n't even go to the UNHCR camps , they do n't register there because they are afraid , they are scared for their lives by the Muslim communities that are there . -- Senator Cory Bernardi , speaking with the ABC , November 23 , 2015 . <p> Australia has decided to settle 12,000 refugees in Australia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program intake of 13,750 . <p> At the time of the announcement , the then Prime Minister Tony Abbott said : <p> Our focus will be on families and women and children , especially of persecuted minorities , who have sought refuge in camps neighbouring Syria and Iraq . <p> But it 's important to note that people who are not registered with the UNHCR can still come through the Special Humanitarian Programme . <p> Bernardi is right to say that many persecuted minorities do n't go to camps . But that may be for a variety of reasons , not just safety fears as described by church groups . In fact , increasing numbers of refugees live in urban areas , not camps . <p> The final determination about which 12,000 refugees come to Australia rests with the Australian government . <h> Refugee camps <p> Refugees from Syria or Iraq who are in Lebanon , Turkey and Jordan can register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . This does not give them a legal right to stay or work in those countries , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , food and assistance via the UNHCR . <p> Before the opening of Zaatari Camp in July 2012 , all of the UNHCR-registered Syrian refugees in Jordan were living in urban settings . Currently , the UNHCR estimates that more than 80% of the Syrian refugees in Jordan do not live in camps . <p> Why ? Well , living in refugee camps can be difficult . Many refugees choose to move onward to Europe rather than remaining in countries of first asylum , where they face poverty and an uncertain future . <p> To support his assertion that fear of Muslims dissuaded some minorities from staying in UNHCR camps , a spokesperson for Senator Bernardi referred to a recent news article that reported : <p> In a statement to The Weekend Australian , the welfare group said Christians were afraid to go to the official refugee camps because they were predominantly filled with Muslims and had also been infiltrated by the terror fighters . <p> There is anecdotal evidence supporting this assertion . But living in an official refugee camp is not a requirement to obtain UNHCR registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear being returned to Syria , do n't understand the process , or because of particular vulnerabilities ( such as disability ) . <p> There are two ways people can under the proposed resettlement program : via a refugee visa or via the Special Humanitarian Program . <h> The refugee visa <p> The Australian government works with the UNHCR to identify refugees who are the most vulnerable and in need of resettlement . <p> The UNHCR 's Resettlement Handbook details some of the factors they may consider , including age , gender , family members , disability and whether the person is from a minority group . <p> Identification of refugees in need of resettlement should be based on a refugee 's objective need ... identification should not be based on the desire of any specific actors , such as the host State , resettlement States , other partners , or UNHCR staff themselves . <p> When people are talking about focusing only on minorities , that 's not necessarily a true reflection of the people who are probably most at risk . So if people start pushing the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pushing that back and saying this is not the most important element for us . Particularly when , as I was mentioning , 99% of the people fleeing to Jordan are basically Sunni Muslims . <p> A spokesperson for Senator Bernardi noted that in the same interview , the UN representative said : <p> We do not take too much notice of what politicians anywhere in the world have to say . Some are being very forthright in their positions . What we will do is remain objective and focus on the criteria which we have , which is vulnerability . <p> ( You can read the full response from Senator Bernardi 's spokesperson here . ) <p> While the UNHCR refers cases , it remains the Australian government 's sovereign right to accept or reject that referral . Australian immigration officials conduct their own assessments including health , character and security checks before granting the visa or rejecting a case . <p> As reported in this recent news article , Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has previously said Australia will make the decision on who is accepted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently told the ABC : <p> It is a non-discriminatory program across the board and I am confident that by the end of this process , when you look at the makeup of the 12,000 people , they will come from a range of ethnicities and religions . <h> The Special Humanitarian Program <p> This allows Iraqi and Syrian refugees who are living in Australia , and who are either citizens or permanent residents of Australia , to propose close relatives ( spouse or dependent children ) for resettlement . It is not a requirement that they be registered with the UNHCR . <p> Once again , Australian immigration officials have to be satisfied that the asylum seeker and any family members satisfy health , character and security requirements . <p> Under this visa category , it is also possible for an approved organisation to propose a person and their family to come to Australia . <h> Verdict <p> Cory Bernardi is right , to the extent that the UNHCR determines the shortlist of who can be sent to Australia or not . But the final determination on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Australia can not be forced to accept refugees it does n't want . <p> Additionally , family members in Australia can nominate relatives for a visa under the Special Humanitarian Program , which does not require registration with the UNHCR . <p> It is true that there is anecdotal evidence that vulnerable groups may be reluctant to register with the UNHCR in camps due to fear of persecution . <p> However , the majority of refugees registered with UNHCR in Jordan , Turkey and Lebanon do not live in UNHCR camps -- and living in a camp is not a requirement to register with the UNHCR . <h> Review : <p> This is a fair analysis . I would add that the vast majority of refugees housed in camps do not get resettled . About half the world 's refugees live in camps for periods exceeding five years ; of those , the majority are there for at least 10 years . There is no meaningful " queue " for resettlement nor any legal requirement that refugees seek protection in a camp . <p> Have you ever seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks academic experts to test claims and see how true they are .

@@3847239 @ @ @ @ @ on Turnbull 's unheroic targets <p> One of the things that makes life difficult for Australian mainstream politicians trying to do something effective about Australia 's carbon emissions -- apart from being white-anted by colleagues -- is that voters seem to wax and wane on the urgency of climate action . John Howard found that his years of denialism on climate change were suddenly a burden in 2007 , leaving him scrambling to catch up with Labor , which had read a mood shift in favour of action in the electorate . Tony Abbott , in turn , exploited both a sense of disenchantment after the failed Copenhagen conference and , of course , perceptions of Julia Gillard 's broken promise on the issue . <p> Now , the pendulum is again swinging in favour of climate action , and the Coalition -- still riven by denialists and crony capitalists keener to look after favoured sectors rather than the national interest -- in the one that again faces a challenge . <p> That 's why Labor 's embrace of much higher emission abatement targets last week was less crazy brave that it seemed . Not merely is there an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters will be far more sceptical of any Coalition scare campaign after Tony Abbott 's over-the-top attacks on Julia Gillard 's carbon pricing scheme , in which precisely none of the claims Abbott , Greg Hunt and co made were ever borne out . <p> Voters might also notice that the removal of the carbon price preceded a collapse in investment and tepid economic growth . All purely coincidental , of course . <p> You can tell there 's been a shift in sentiment : business is now making pro-climate action noises , whereas the debate used to be dominated by rentseekers and special interests like the mining industry and power companies complaining about sovereign risk and predicting the end of the world . Part of this is that mining companies are suddenly more worried about survival than grandstanding in political debate , and another part must surely be a reaction against the maniacal hatred of renewables that marked the Abbott government -- voters like renewable energy , and they like governments supporting it , no matter how much some conservatives hate windfarms . <p> But what confirms an electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now flagging that it may go above its current , embarrassing target of 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 , telling The Australian targets might be reviewed upward if there was a " comprehensive global agreement " . <p> It 's been only a couple of days since Labor 's 45% target was being attacked as economically destructive in terms that recalled the python squeezes , cobra strikes and Whyalla wipeouts of the Abbott years . In fact , buried inside the Oz today was exactly that sort of stuff from Coalition backbencher Angus Taylor ( though sadly lacking the famous $100 leg of lamb ) , while the front page was signalling that Turnbull understood that for all his talk , he was going to Paris with a decidedly unimpressive package , both internationally and domestically . <p> If you 're trying to work out why Labor 's higher targets are economically destructive while the government says it 's prepared to lift its target , it 's all about trading permits , which would allow Australia to set a higher target and trade its way to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of trading emissions was banned under Tony Abbott , so any scheme involving trading will have to be carefully presented to avoid any suggestion of being market-based -- lest the Nationals and the hard right , outraged by the employment of the core mechanism of capitalism , rebel . <p> But given Direct Inaction wo n't even achieve a fraction of the Coalition 's target , the government needs something in order to credibly commit to it . So far the only thing on offer from Turnbull is this sort of blather about private sector technology , in which the Turnbull Era deities of Agility and Innovation will descend to the Earth and hackathon the problem away . <p> Labor , to its credit , is committed to a return to an emissions trading scheme , and made that commitment well over a year ago , but we know virtually nothing about how the scheme will work . It might be a bit much to expect an opposition to produce a full-blown emissions trading scheme policy , but as Lenore Taylor has been pointing out for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy to back up its emissions abatement target , ambitious or otherwise . <p> It makes the debate over such targets rather theatrical .

' " <p> Unfortunately , they could n't , and the bank foreclosed on the commercial building -- which passed in at auction and finally sold for $400,000 , almost 40 per cent below the bank 's previous valuation . <p> This cleared the loan for the renovations but it left Ms Burge without premises to run her business , and a big debt for the property that was sold out from under her . <p> Now the bank has taken possession of her investment property , along with the stock in trade of her craft business , which she had stashed inside . <p> And Ms Burge is waiting for the knock on the door of the home she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take possession of that , too . <p> It 's a pertinent illustration of what can happen when banks lend people money beyond their capacity to repay -- and why we have responsible lending guidelines enshrined in our banking codes of practice . <p> OMBUDSMAN FINDS ' MALADMINISTRATION ' <p> The Ombudsman determined the bank should not have lent Ms Burge and her ex-husband the money , and that CBA had " engaged in maladministration in lending " , by failing to adhere to best practice , overstating the business income , understating the couple 's living expenses and wrongly factoring in Ms Burge 's ex-husband 's full income despite the fact he was on probation . <p> Maladministration means conduct that is contrary to law or unreasonable , unjust , oppressive , improperly discriminatory or based on improper motives . <p> The Ombudsman ordered the bank to deduct $144,000 from the debt as compensation , but this still left Ms Burge with a six-figure debt she has no hope of paying . <p> Internal CBA emails seen by news.com.au reveal concerns were raised by the bank 's assessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I need to get some clarification around this paper prior to being able to decision this application , " one of the bank 's risk associates wrote . <p> " The company balance sheet reflects an extremely poor position with major deficit ( retained losses ) ... In comparison to past performances , the projected income seems optimistic . Please comment . " <p> The risk associate also wrote that the loan application had merit " based on reasonably strong personal balance sheets of the director and guarantor " . <p> Ms Burge said these balance sheets had gone missing , and were not in the copies of her loan documents that the bank submitted to the Ombudsman . <p> " I certainly do n't think it responsible lending to write that we have plenty of ' non sensitive assets ' that can be sold to reduce or clear the debt , " she said . <p> " I believe the documents show that CBA knew I was not going to be able to afford these loans , and yet went ahead loaning the money anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ms Burge also argued the bank had failed to secure an appropriate price , having valued the building at $650,000 in 2010 , but the Ombudsman found that CBA " did make all reasonable attempts to obtain the best available price for the property in the circumstances and at the time that the property was sold " . <p> " The value of the ... property had dropped significantly at the time of the sale and market conditions were very soft , " the Ombudsman 's determination said . <p> The potential sale price of the property was also adversely affected by uncertainty over the council zoning of the property . " <p> COMMONWEALTH BANK DENIES WRONGDOING <p> CBA spokesman Nick Creevey said it was not appropriate for the bank to comment on the circumstances of individual customers . <p> " Banks have no incentive to foreclose on loans -- everyone loses under this scenario , " Mr Creevey said . <p> " The best outcome for the customer and the bank is when the loan is repaid in full , and that often means coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride out their difficulties . But , regrettably in some cases , these options simply wo n't avert an inevitable fact if there is no realistic way that the loan can be repaid . " <p> He said the bank welcomed scrutiny and had actively participated in all inquiries since 2008 . <p> CBA is battling to salvage its reputation amid the controversy over its acquisition of BankWest , which led to its foreclosing on more than 1000 commercial loans worth more than $8.2 billion . <p> A number of small business owners have accused the bank of deliberately impairing their loans by deflating the value of their assets , in order to take advantage of a discount clause in their contract to take over BankWest . <p> The bank 's submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry into the impairment of customer loans is available online . 
@@3851230 <h> Translations <p> When Islamic terrorists struck Paris on November 13 , Europe was in the midst of a debate over how to handle the large numbers of refugees coming from Syria , Iraq and the Horn of Africa . <p> These two events have given rise to a series of contradictions concerning the opening or closing of EU borders and polarised positions regarding Islam and refugees . Indeed , a wave of hostility towards accepting refugees has spread based on rumours that doing so would make it easier for Syrian terrorists to enter the EU , when in fact most migrants are fleeing Islamic State ( IS ) and the regime of Bashar al-Assad . <p> It is for this reason that the majority of the countries neighbouring Syria , including Turkey , Lebanon and Jordan , have welcomed four million refugees , and that France , Germany and other European countries have decided to give those who qualify fast-track access to refugee programs . <h> No easy route <p> So have some terrorists " taken advantage " of the opportunity to legally enter French territory ? Even if a Syrian passport was found at the scene of one of the massacres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to terrorists as well , for several reasons . <p> The first is that most of the terrorists were French citizens , and therefore lawful residents -- IS did n't want to risk attracting the attention of the authorities by sending illegal immigrants into the EU to commit heinous crimes . That was the case for November 13 as well as the January attack against Charlie Hebdo and the Merah affair in 2012 . However , some of the perpetrators did steal Syrian documents to conceal how they entered EU territory . <p> The second is that the recognition of refugee status , including the fast-track route , known as prima facie , reserved for Syrians , occurs only after one or more interviews with the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons ( OFPRA ) . <p> These are conducted by officers who specialise in the regions . Where there 's doubt , individuals are n't given refugee status -- France remains strict on this point . <h> Different profiles <p> Jean-Claude Juncker , president of the European Commission , stated that the terrorist attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he was counting on the shared engagement of EU members . What appears to be a firm ethical stance on his part has not been challenged by the countries striving to " share the burden " of the 160,000 asylum applicants that Europe has said it would accept . Germany , France , Italy and the Scandinavian countries have n't called for closing the door to refugees because it might also allow for terrorists to enter . <p> One thing is self-evident : Syrian asylum seekers are very different from the followers of IS . On one side you have members of the middle class who paid smugglers to get them to the borders of the EU , either by sea ( the Greek Islands ) or by land ( the Greek-Turkish border and the Balkan route ) . Many are ready to enter the European labour market , even at the cost of accepting low-skilled work . <p> They come in family groups , in the hope of finding a safe haven from war and the opportunity to work .

@@3851233 <h> Read it and weep : the book trade needs more than parallel import restrictions <h> Author <p> Research and Technical Development Manager , Digital Humanities , Western Sydney University <h> Disclosure statement <p> Jason Ensor receives funding from the Australian Research Council . He is affiliated with the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities , the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations , DHCommons ( CenterNet ) , and the Society for the History of Authorship , Reading and Publishing . He works for Western Sydney University . <p> The Australian book trade has a long history of tension between books produced at home and books imported from overseas . But our contemporary age may be the first in which parallel importation is undertaken not by booksellers in competition with each other , but by individual consumers in competition with local booksellers . <p> Known in the trade as PIRs , parallel importation restrictions are a feature of Australia 's Copyright Act and can be summed up as two rules : <p> 1 ) For a title where no Australian published version exists , any overseas editions may be imported . <p> 2 ) Once an Australian edition is available for purchase , booksellers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable in Australia for more than three months . <p> It has not just removed the need to visit physical bookstores ; it has also undermined the economic benefits and protection that formerly accrued to Australian publishers , printers and booksellers through the general legal prohibition on the parallel importation of books into Australia by members of the local book trade . <h> Closing the market <p> Parallel importation occurs when a product protected by intellectual property rights is imported into Australia after an authorised locally-published version has already been made available for sale in Australia . <p> As a form of border protection for companies operating in the Australian market , the Australian edition of a book can mean a version of a title which has been solely manufactured in Australia by the owner of the copyright in the work . It can also be an edition by someone who is permitted to manufacture it in Australia under an exclusive licensed arrangement . <p> It can mean overseas published editions of the work which are allowed into Australia with regards to a contractual arrangement about who is authorised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can also be about who is not allowed to sell copies . <p> Restrictions on parallel importation provides protection for the publication of books in Australia by local firms and protection for overseas publishers who wish to maintain a " closed market " in Australia for their editions of titles only . <p> This prevents local Australian booksellers from sourcing cheaper editions of these same titles from alternative overseas sources . It stops booksellers from obtaining stronger local sales by passing the savings to the reader or from obtaining stronger profits by not passing on the savings . <p> Shane Lin <p> For booksellers , " closing the market " is seen to restrain competition at the wholesale level by limiting the choice of suppliers for physical books to authorised channels only . <p> For the consumer , the lack of access to cheaper imports in the local market places little pressure on local retailers to reconsider book prices . <p> Each major technological advance in copying and distributing text has historically been viewed as a potential threat to the economic equilibrium existing between publishers , printers , distributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new technology has also allowed readers to develop new purchasing behaviours with respect to digital and overseas sources of books . <p> In 2009 , the government considered removing copyright restrictions on the parallel importation of books under the view that their continuance increased local book prices . While Australia 's literary communities were responding to the Productivity Commission 's 2009 inquiry into this , readers could already parallel import cheaper books into Australia by way of their internet browser or Kindle . <p> Australian parallel importation laws certainly protected the local book trade from potentially anti-competitive practices by other bricks-and-mortar businesses . Critically , it did not protect them from the practices of several hundred thousand individual readers . <p> The combined volume of eBook purchases in Australia in the year following the Productivity Commission 's Inquiry was around 3.4 million sales valued at A$35 million . <p> At the close of the inquiry in 2009 , the government stepped back from altering the nation 's regulatory framework . The protections seemed less and less important to individual consumer 's book buying behaviour . It released a statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian book trade as a future source of support . <h> A recurring debate <p> The issue of parallel imports will not go away . It has been a regular point of debate since the first Australian book trade inquiries at the start of the 20th century . Then , as now , the issue was that the price advantage accorded to imported texts worked against the sale of Australian manufactured books , which seemed unreasonably expensive in comparison . <p> The added pressure today is that the book trade is now competing with its customers . <p> In 2013 , Amazon 's vice president of Kindle Content , David Nagger , acknowledged that the company 's early success in the US digital book market could be credited to a business model that set it apart from all previous e-reader experiments . Unlike other devices which could only display content that had to be manually loaded onto them using a computer , with the Kindle you were always " holding a bookstore in your hand " . <p> The Kindle bookstore was always available through the company 's own " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to another internet connection . <p> Where competitors had failed to gain mainstream consumer interest with various devices , such as the Apple Newton ( 1993 ) through to the Sony PRS-505 ( 2007 ) , Amazon recognised that : <p> the e-book market would rise or fall with consumers ' ability to get the books they wanted , at an attractive price , and with all the convenience they had come to expect from their increasingly powerful mobile devices . <p> For David Nagger , Amazon wanted to sell books during those stretches of personal time at home or on the train that were unreachable by the physical book trade . Being able to at any time tap into Amazon 's digital bookstore , which launched with more than 88,000 titles including 100 of the 112 New York Times bestsellers for November 2007 , was considered by many commentators of the time to be the Kindle 's single most revolutionary component . You could " think of a book , and have it in less than 60 seconds " . <h> Strengthen exports <p> Conveniences like this have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to rehearse past arguments in the current debate . From embargoes to tariffs , in order to create a book culture that is both native and international it would be useful to set aside these kinds of protectionist ideas . <p> We might instead consider strengthening an export market for Australian books . As British publisher Walter Harrup put it in 1945 , in the Sydney Morning Herald : <p> what Australia needs more than the sale of Australian books in Australia is the sale of Australian books in other parts of the world . What is the good of a country having something to say to the world and yet being unable to communicate those ideas to the world ? <p> It was a comment that implied the many ways in which the business of home and imported books were interconnected . Members of the Australian book trade in the early 20th century certainly seemed prepared to discuss how to restructure book imports and exports to greater local commercial advantage . @ @ @

@@3855240 <h> In brief - Claimants and respondents impacted by BCIPA changes <p> We examine three aspects of the amended BCIPA which perhaps require a rethink . <p> There 's no incentive to serve a payment schedule <p> Before the amendments , if a respondent failed to serve a payment schedule within 10 business days of receiving a payment claim , the respondent automatically became liable for the amount claimed , and the claimant could enter judgment against the respondent in the court on that basis alone . <p> BCIPA therefore required strict compliance with the time frames , and enabled claimants to recover payment quickly if its payment claims were not responded to . <p> All that has now changed . <p> Under the amended version of BCIPA , if a respondent fails to serve a payment schedule in time , before taking any action to recover payment , the claimant must give a notice to the respondent of its intention to do so , known as a " Section 20A Notice " . <p> The respondent then has a further five business days to serve a payment schedule after receiving the Section 20A Notice . If it does , it avoids becoming automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same as if the respondent had served a payment schedule in the first place . <h> Payment recovery under construction contracts will be slower <p> While this may seem fair and reasonable at first glance , the problem is that a Section 20A Notice can only be given after the due date for payment . <p> Under most construction contracts , the due date for payment does not arise until at least three weeks after the payment claim is served ( i.e. one week after the payment schedule is due ) , and for most subcontracts the due date is five weeks after the payment claim is served . Sometimes payment will not be due until 30 days after the end of the month in which the payment claim is served ( i.e. up to 61 days after the payment claim ) . <p> The BCIPA amendments mean that if a respondent fails to serve a payment schedule within the initial 10 business day time limit , the claimant has to wait until the due date for payment ( which could be many weeks ) , then serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further five business days to serve a payment schedule . Only then can the claimant commence action to recover payment . <p> Interest will accrue on overdue amounts from the due date for payment , and the claimant may have rights of suspension or termination under the contract , but in most cases a respondent seeking to avoid or delay payment will simply be able to ignore a payment claim in the first instance , force the claimant to wait until the due date for payment arises , and then respond to the Section 20A Notice once it is served . <p> This is contrary to the spirit and intention of BCIPA which is to provide a fast-tracked system for recovering payment under construction contracts , and is an erosion of claimants ' rights . <p> It may be impossible to get the benefit of the extended time limits for responding to payment claims <p> One of the key aspects of the BCIPA amendments is that they extend the time limits for serving payment schedules in response to payment claims where the amount claimed is more than $750,000 excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The amended BCIPA provides that payment schedules in response to complex payment claims must be served within the earlier of the time required under the contract ( if any ) or : <p> 15 business days after the payment claim is served , if the payment claim is served within 90 days after the reference date to which the payment claim relates <p> 30 business days after the payment claim is served , if the payment claim is served more than 90 days after the reference date to which the payment claim relates . <p> Previously , respondents had 10 business days to serve a payment schedule in response to a payment claim , regardless of how much was claimed . <p> However , these extended time limits will not apply unless the relevant construction contract either expressly allows for them , or does not specify a time by which payment claims must be responded to . This is because BCIPA says payment schedules must be served within the earlier of the time specified in the contract , or the extended time limits set out above . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be served within 10 business days of a payment claim , in which case that shorter time limit will apply rather than the extended time limits provided by BCIPA . <h> Extended time limits provisions may conflict with the Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act <p> In most cases it will be necessary to include specific provisions in a contract to allow for the extended time limits . However , those provisions are likely to be void under the Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act ( QBCC Act ) . <p> Under the QBCC Act , any provision in a commercial building contract is void to the extent that it provides for a due date for payment later than 15 business days after a payment claim is served . For construction management contracts and subcontracts , the maximum payment period is 25 business days . <p> This means that if a principal wishes to have 30 business days to respond to a complex payment claim which is served by more than 90 days after the reference date to which the claim relates ( as provided for by BCIPA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in the contract . <p> However , under the QBCC Act , the due date for payment will always be no more than 15 business days after the date of the payment claim . By the time the principal serves its payment schedule at the end of the 30 business day period , payment has already become due and interest has started accruing , and the contractor may have rights of suspension and termination under the contract . <p> It is not clear how this conflict between BCIPA and the QBCC Act would be resolved by the courts , but it has the potential to cause significant issues . <p> Claimants have been robbed of seven hours to prepare adjudication applications <p> Most of the time limits under BCIPA are measured in business days . It is generally accepted that a business day does not end until midnight , and documents can be served up until midnight on the last business day of the relevant time limit . <p> However , under the amended Building and Construction Industry Regulation 2004 , adjudication applications must now be lodged between 8:00am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new rule is entirely unclear , and it causes a not insignificant disadvantage to claimants . <p> Firstly , it means that claimants have seven less hours to prepare adjudication applications after a payment schedule is served . BCIPA provides that adjudication applications must be lodged within 10 business days after a payment claim is served , but the regulation reduces that to nine business days and 17 hours . Respondents still have 10 full business days to prepare their adjudication responses . <p> While seven hours may not seem like much , anyone who has prepared an adjudication application knows that the last few hours of the day are crucial for finalising documents and arranging service . <p> Furthermore , the new rule ignores the fact that the hours between 8:00am and 5:00pm are when many claimants are on site working , and having to prepare and lodge adjudication applications during business hours can be extremely disruptive . <p> Given that adjudication applications can be lodged online , the rule appears to be an unnecessary inconvenience to claimants . <p> The process will give certainty to landholders for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some comments from our readers ? ?

Preventing the jihadists from profiting from oilfields under its control should be a priority for the military coalition -- indeed , Britain 's first strikes in Syria were against oilfields . <p> But the coalition already has the capacity to stop the illegal oil trade . High above Syria and Iraq , beyond the range of any IS missiles , are US and UK surveillance and strike drones such as the Predator and Reaper .

This continuously generates extremely high-resolution imagery even through cloud and sandstorms . <p> These are the weapons with which to cut off IS 's oil trade income , estimated at US$50m a month ( US$600m a year ) . While looted banks and military bases provided IS with a reported war chest of US$1.5-$2 billion , this oil income is vital to pay the salaries of its administrators and fighters , around US$500m a year , buy black market weaponry estimated at US$1 billion , and other essentials that bring annual costs to around US$2 billion . <p> Why is cutting off the oil trade supporting IS not being addressed more enthusiastically ? Russian strikes have inflicted damage on the tanker fleets , but of 10,600 coalition strikes , only 196 have targeted oil infrastructure . With better use of airborne surveillance it would be easier to identify and destroy the tankers used to move illicit crude oil , cutting off this vital source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopping the flow of oil <p> Major IS-controlled oil wells lie between al-Qaim in Iraq in northern Iraq and Deir Ezzor in Syria , 100km southeast of Raqqa . IS uses mobile refineries to process crude oil required for military and domestic use , but also transports crude oil by road through IS held routes , via Aleppo and a northern corridor through " friendly " rebel-held areas , to southern Turkey . <p> There is oil trading within rebel-held areas , and Russia has also identified ( as yet unconfirmed ) that crude oil is also being transported from Deir al-Zour ( aka Deir Ezzor ) to Batman in Turkey . Russia was conducting air strikes in the rebel-held region through which the oil is transported when one of its Su-24 aircraft was shot down by a Turkish fighter . <p> A large road tanker can transport around 300 barrels , so carrying 25,000 barrels a day requires a minimum of 84 tanker trucks , assuming the round trip can be achieved in a single day . The round trip is approximately 600km , so the tankers could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too dangerous . To target an individual truck in transit with guided missiles from manned aircraft would prove very expensive -- more than the value of the tanker and the oil carried . But coalition drone pilots can patrol the routes used by the oil tankers continuously , calling in strikes from other aircraft or attacking where necessary . <p> Targeting the oil before it reaches the trading centres hidden in rebel-held territory would starve IS of the funds it relies upon . As Russian president Putin noted , severing IS 's support is the most effective way of shortening the conflict . <p> IS has learned from the North Vietnamese in its fight against the US , holding large areas of territory with small groups of troops who live among the civilian population -- not in barracks and frontline positions .

@@3859239 <h> Tech company HP ' thankful ' for new autistic employees <p> A program encouraging people with autism into employment with tech company Hewlett-Packard has turned out to be nothing but wonderful so far . <h> Transcript <p> LEIGH SALES , PRESENTER : If you 're a young adult living with autism , unfortunately the prospect of finding a job is slim . More than half of Australian adults with autism are currently unemployed . One young Queensland man nearly gave up trying to work after colleagues physically bullied and assaulted him at his first job in the hospitality industry . But now he 's finally found work as a professional software tester , thanks to a high-end tech company that 's thinking outside the box . Josh Bavas reports . <p> CHERIE MARTIN , MOTHER : He 's now even talking about moving out . I do n't want him to move out , but to have that confidence of wanting to move out and actually live on your own and start a life is just amazing . <p> JOSH BAVAS , REPORTER : Joel Bissmire is two months into his new job at Hewlett Packard as a software tester . <p> JOEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy due to the fact that it 's an entry-level software testing . <p> JOSH BAVAS : He 's highly skilled in IT , but like thousands of other young adults living with autism , work life has n't always been easy . He suffered months of bullying at his last job in a Brisbane fast food restaurant . <p> CHERIE MARTIN : He was in a situation where other staff were locking him in a freezer . And there was one time when Joel actually came home from work and he often asked me to cut his hair . And as I was cutting his hair and moving the towel on his shoulders , he flinched , he winced . I said , " Can you please take the towel off your shoulders ? , " and noticed massive red welts all over his back to the point of blood being drawn where the manager had actually been flicking the thick , red rubber band on to him . I was - I was so shocked . <p> JOSH BAVAS : Joel 's job prospects were n't looking good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , one of the first of its type in the world . <p> JOEL BISSMIRE : It was great .

They 're finding things that other software testers have n't found . Because of their eye for detail , we 've been able to change the way we do things here . <p> JOEL BISSMIRE : Most of us are pretty much all computer nerds . Not all of us are gamers . I 'm a gamer .

But there 's been so little work done on people with autism . <p> CHERIE MARTIN : But for Joel , it 's - he 's a - like we said , he 's a different person . Loves his role , loves having a job , loves having an income . He 's actually got money in his bank account now that he can actually spend and not worry about how he 's gon na live day to day . He can buy his lunch every day , pay for his mobile phone bill . So , just those little things that they do n't get the opportunity to do and it just gives them more independence growing up . <p> JOSH BAVAS : This team is preparing to deliver the findings to other corporations in London this week . <p> MICHAEL FIELDHOUSE , HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE : I actually thank them for actually working for us .

Photo : New York Times <p> Another set of atrocities , this time in San Bernardino , California , has people wondering whether anything can be done to lower the body count . Many angry voices on the left have been saying we could reduce the bloodshed if not for the National Rifle Association and its sympathisers . But they overestimate what gun control can achieve and underestimate the extent to which their own partisan emotion is an obstacle to progress . <p> Senator Chris Murphy , a Democrat from Connecticut , illustrated the growing rancour of the debate . After the Newtown massacre in 2012 , he tweeted his appreciation of the " thoughts , prayers , and words of support " from his colleagues in Congress . Now he is unhappy with such sentiments . On Wednesday night he tweeted , " Your ' thoughts ' should be about steps to take to stop this carnage . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing -- again . " <p> You can see what he 's getting at . Saying that your " thoughts and prayers " are with the victims of a mass murder is a hollow gesture if you are refraining from taking obvious and practical steps that would make future massacres less likely . But have gun controllers , including Murphy , actually identified such steps ? <p> A couple embraces following the shooting . Photo : Los Angeles Times <p> It is not a self-evident truth that the main gun-control proposals that have been advanced in recent years in the United States , from a renewed ban on assault weapons to expanded background checks to restrictions on gun buying for people identified as unacceptable risks , would have appreciably reduced murder rates , or prevented Newtown , where 26 children and teachers were killed at a school by 20-year-old Adam Lanza . <p> Advertisement <p> The assault-weapons ban in particular is a symbolic gesture : It prohibits some guns and allows others that are just as dangerous . The US Justice Department 's most recent review found no evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course Murphy was commenting too early to know whether any of these proposals were relevant to the shootings in San Bernardino . <p> Much of the debate over gun regulation founders on this basic truth : the proposals that have mainstream support are unlikely to achieve dramatic results , and more ambitious proposals are both practically and politically hopeless . <p> Police at the scene of a shootout about a mile from the site where gunmen left at least 14 dead . Photo : New York Times <p> It 's a point that proponents of tighter regulation often evade . While the killers in San Bernardino were still being hunted down , the Slate website urged people to re-evaluate " what liberty truly means " . The right to own guns is a " newly invented " liberty , wrote Mark Joseph Stern . The US Supreme Court embraced it only in 2008 . He continued : " Mothers , daughters , brothers , fathers , sisters , husbands , and wives are being slaughtered every day by guns . Their blood is being shed in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only because it takes a typical mistake of the gun debate too far : treating constitutional principle and moral indignation as though they settled everything important . Maybe the Supreme Court 's decision was flawed as a matter of constitutional law , but the evidence that it has made our streets less safe is non-existent . Murder rates have kept dropping since it came out . <p> Probably it 's true that we would have a lower murder rate if we had fewer guns , as the regulators always say . But what follows from that proposition ? Americans have hundreds of millions of guns . They are not going to get rid of them . That 's not because the National Rifle Association or the gunmakers ' lobby or a contested conception of liberty stand in the way . It 's because of the overwhelming opinion of the US public -- 72 per cent oppose a ban on guns -- and the practical impossibility of confiscation . <p> I 'm not a gun nut : I believe there is a right to own guns , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues have suggested three reforms : <p> We might move to prosecute anybody who has reasonable cause to believe he is availing a dangerous person of a firearm . <p> We might insist that to have knowledge that a person represents a grave and imminent threat to others is to have a legal responsibility to inform the authorities . <p> We might look to reform our lax treatment and commitment laws , which leave too many at-risk individuals on the street , suffering from hallucinations and delusions over which , without medication , they may have little control . <p> These ideas seem to me to be a more promising anti-violence agenda . But if politicians and activists take them up , they should not exaggerate the difference they would make or treat skeptics as the enemies of decency . And they should not disguise the modesty of the good their proposals would achieve behind the drama of a grand battle against the wicked . <p> Murphy is right that we should be thinking about what we can do to prevent mass shootings . But the existing agenda he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their posturing against their political enemies undermines it .

Based on assurances that all is well and the next 20 years will echo the past 20 years . <p> The historical precedent for the slow loss of reserve currency status is the strange case of sterling . The story begins with a geopolitical event far removed from the counting rooms of London -- the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand , heir to the throne of the AustroHungarian Empire , by a Serbian terrorist in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . <p> When the First World War began on 28 July , one month after the assassination of the Archduke , all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold except the UK . The conventional view was that countries needed to hoard gold and print money to pay for the war , which is why they suspended convertibility . <p> The UK took a different approach . By maintaining the link to gold , London maintained its credit standing . This enabled the UK to borrow to pay for the war . It was John Maynard Keynes who convinced the UK to remain on the gold standard . It was Jack Morgan , son of JP Morgan , who organised massive loans in New York to support the British war effort . <p> Initially there were huge outflows of gold from the US to the UK . Even though the UK remained on the gold standard , investors sold stocks , bonds and land in the US , converted the proceeds into gold , and then shipped the gold to the Bank of England . <p> In November 1914 , the flow of gold suddenly reversed . The British needed US exports of food , wool , cotton , oil , and weapons . All of this had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be converted into gold . The gold that had flowed east from New York to London now began to flow west from London to New York . <p> From November 1914 until the end of the war in November 1918 , there were massive gold inflows to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and its private member banks . It was at this stage that the dollar emerged as a new global reserve currency to challenge the supremacy of sterling . <p> The process of the dollar replacing sterling began in November 1914 , but there was no immediate or sudden collapse of sterling . Throughout the 1920s , the dollar and sterling competed side-by-side for the role of leading reserve currency . Scholar Barry Eichengreen has documented how the dollar and sterling took turns in the leading role with the lead shifting back-and-forth several times . <p> But by 1931 , the race was becoming one-sided . The dollar was starting to pull away . Winston Churchill had blundered by pegging sterling to gold at an unrealistic rate in 1925 . The super strong sterling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depression three years before the rest of the world . UK trade deficits caused Commonwealth trading partners such as Australia and Canada to get stuck with huge unwanted reserves in sterling . <p> The rise of the dollar , and the steady decline of sterling continued through the 1930s until the start of the Second World War in 1939 . At that point , the UK suspended the convertibility of sterling into gold . The international monetary system broke down for the second time in 25 years . Normal trade , currency exchange , and gold convertibility remained suspended until the international monetary system could be reformed . <p> This reform took place at the Bretton Woods international monetary conference held in New Hampshire in July 1944 . That conference marked the final ascendency of the dollar as the leading global reserve currency . <p> From 1944 to 1971 , major currencies , including sterling , were pegged to the dollar . The dollar was pegged to gold at US$35.00 per ounce . Bretton Woods was the definitive end to the role of sterling as the leading reserve currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency role -- a position it has held ever since . <p> The point of this history is to show that the replacement of sterling by the dollar as the leading reserve currency was not an event , it was a process . The process played out over 30 years , from 1914 to 1944 . It involved a seesaw dynamic in which sterling would try to reclaim the crown only to lose it again . <p> With hindsight it is possible to see that the turning point took place in November 1914 when gold outflows from the US reversed and became inflows . Those inflows continued until 1950 despite two world wars , and the Great Depression . <p> Yet , no one saw the collapse at the time . <p> From the Bank of England 's perspective , November 1914 may have seen gold outflows , but no one believed the process of decline was inevitable or irreversible . The belief in London was that Britain would win the war , maintain the empire , and preserve sterling 's position as the most valued currency in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost was too great . They lost the empire and sterling lost its role as the leading reserve currency . The issue for investors today is whether the US dollar already had its November 1914 moment . <p> Is it possible that the collapse of the US dollar as the leading reserve currency has already begun ? The answer is ' yes ' . <p> Looking at the massive flows of gold to China , the rise of a dollar competitor in the form of the SDR , and the coming inclusion of the Chinese yuan in the SDR basket , it is difficult not to conclude that the dollar collapse has already begun . <p> Yet , like the collapse of sterling a century ago , the decline of the dollar will not necessarily happen overnight . <p> It will be a slow , steady process . <p> Jim Rickards , <p> Strategist , Strategic Intelligence <p> From the Port Phillip Publishing Library <p> Special Report : If you want to get ahead in this world , it pays to have powerful friends in high places .

@@3874240 <h> Lessons from a model of effective eHealth implementation <p> Written by Terry Hannan on 08 December 2015 . <p> Earlier this year , I took a three-month sabbatical at the Universidad Catolica ( UC ) and its extended healthcare institutions in Santiago , Chile , where I was able to make some observations on the implementation of an electronic medical record ( EMR ) and other eHealth developments that could provide some lessons for similar implementations in Australia . <p> The Chilean healthcare system is funded under a national health insurance scheme which is sourced by a seven per cent tax on incomes . The system has separated into two main streams of care delivery with public and private components . Care within the private system usually requires supplementary funding from the patient or insurance , and like in Australia , patients may have care in both systems . <p> Each component of the Chilean health system has significant differences in care delivery , with the public system in Chile experiencing similar care delivery issues as the public system in Australia . That is not to say that the private component of healthcare delivery is perfect , and it is definitely more expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . <p> My working association during my sabbatical was predominantly within the UC private system , which covers both primary care clinics and hospital-based care , and I also taught some workshops in the department of biomedical informatics at the regional Duoc-UC San Joaquin , Valparaiso and Concepcion campuses , which provide TAFE-level education . <p> The Universidad Catolica group has a complex patient management system , with an EMR from Portuguese vendor Alert Lifesciences currently being rolled out . This is being accompanied by a powerful EMR support application called Epistemonikos and a bespoke temporal query system called ClinicalTime , which is being developed by UC physician-health informatician Daniel Capurro . <p> One of the strengths of the eHealth projects within UC is that the planning and constant evaluation is driven by the university faculty and the patient care departments , not government health departments . The EMR supports data collection and healthcare measures required by the government , with this data a direct byproduct of clinical care processes . <p> Because the EMR is clinically focused , doctors , nurses and other clinicians use the system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the necessary adjuncts to the clinically directed project . <p> The EMR system permits real-time adjustment of applications and modules without significant disruption of day-to-day clinical use . <p> In my opinion , the successful direction of this project must go to the clinical leadership of Associate Professor Capurro , who has enlisted the active and enthusiastic support of his clinical staff and IT personnel . The teams leading this project meet up to twice weekly to discuss its evaluation and the overall adherence to the implementation time schedules . <p> Attending these meetings , it was obvious that the core enthusiasm and drive demonstrated by the participants revealed a strong belief in the value of this project . Development was not driven by an imposed external system , and this team and the clinicians " owned " the project . <p> The combination of frequent end-user driven goal definitions , evaluations and clinically focused applications with an adaptable system application infrastructure complies with many of the core success factors that were defined by researchers Paul Biondich and Burke Mamlin from their work in low and middle income nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an educational meeting at a UC regional hospital called Cl ? nica UC San Carlos de Apoquindo , where the Alert EMR was about to be implemented . The hospital director addressed the meeting and all individuals involved in the system 's implementation and uptake had a voice in the proceedings . This includes both the objectors and the supporters . <p> The EMR has an excellent user interface , with real-time patient triage to care transitions and e-directed ( guided ) care management , such as patient-specific IV infusion times and rates and medication administration compliance schedules . <p> The system provides direct feedback on waiting times for patients in the emergency department -- there was great concern that one patient had been waiting for 48 minutes ! <p> I observed clinicians actually using the system to enter care plan protocols that supported their current care plans . <p> However , because clinicians are able to enter care plans , there is some variation at this stage of development . Dr Capurro is currently undertaking a project to refine the creation and design of clinical order sets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery . <p> In the development and design of clinical order sets , access to up-to-date knowledge and research is critical . The UC is using a powerful EMR support application called Epistemonikos , which was developed by the Epistemonikos Foundation , a not-for-profit organisation led by internal medicine specialist Gabriel Rada and created as a spin-off from UC and funded through international research funds . <p> The application is a free , multilingual database of the best available health evidence , and the UC team intends to integrate this system with the order sets management . <p> From my perspective , the Epistemonikos system is an ideal adjunct to the order sets program because it provides a functionality that , as former CEO of the California HealthCare Foundation Mark Smith put it , can " remove ourselves from the ' unscientific , non data driven personal recommendations ' for care " . <p> And as Andy Kanter of the Millennium Villages Project says , " The ability to feed back immediately to the people at the point of care ... is critical for measuring and improving the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a conjoint system called ClinicalTime which measures patient trajectories using time-dependent clinical and laboratory data . This has demonstrated that coded clinical data provides more accurate and dependable data for measuring healthcare than standardised coding using ICD-9 . <p> Dr Capurro describes ClinicalTime as " a temporal query system " that is a valid method to add to the currently available ones to identify patient phenotypes in patient databases and improve the ability to re-use routinely collected electronic clinical data for secondary purposes . <p> Another potential benefit is in the use of clinical data to provide the early detection of those patients in an ICU environment who are likely to develop acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . This is a clinical state which is often overlooked until late in the disease evolution in the ICU clinical environment . <h> Outpatients <p> The EMR has become the core patient care system in UC 's outpatient clinics and the emergency department , which became paperless just over three years ago . This change occurred with minimal disruption after going live overnight . <p> The outpatient system was impressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone or on the internet in advance of attending . Patients can pay their accounts online in advance while making the appointment . <p> When arriving at the clinic , the patient or their carer enters their unique Chilean ID number at the kiosk in the foyer or they can swipe their card with this number . This unique ID number and card have been a part of the Chilean health system for decades . <p> The kiosk can display educational materials but the main purpose is to direct the patient to their designated clinic and its location . If you have not paid in advance you go to the cashier and pay there . <p> At your clinic location the kiosk provides an ID number for that visit and the room number . These are clearly displayed on TV screens and this information is supported by voice-over instructions . <p> In the consultation the clinician has access to the patient 's record and associated reports . The information is in both coded and document formats . At all stages the clinician is functionally looking at the one system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical encounter into the record . In the wards , a dual e-record and paper coexist but the intention of the project governance committees is to have complete electronic integration in the not too distant future . <p> The Chilean government introduced legislation three years ago that states that all patients must be given a copy of their own record . The actual mechanisms for this are evolving . <p> The waiting lists for these clinics can be up to one to two days for chronic disease . A ' long ' waiting period is one to two months , which is considered not to be completely efficient ! <p> The UC EMR is also used as a data resource for capturing administrative healthcare data and is able to provide this in real time . For example , DRG data is captured on a daily basis . <p> The system was set to go live at an allied regional hospital of around 100 beds , with support staff living in for a period of time and providing 24/7 support , as I was leaving Chile . On-site training will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards . <p> While the cost of the EMR is confidential , it is significantly less than comparable implementations in many Australian hospitals . <p> My observation is that a significant eHealth project based on an appropriately designed EMR can succeed on a moderate budget as long as the objectives and design are driven by the direct patient care process . <p> Dr Terry Hannan is a consultant physician at Launceston General Hospital , a clinical associate professor at the University of Tasmania 's School of Human Health Sciences , a fellow of the Australasian College of Health Informatics and a visiting fellow at Macquarie University 's Centre for Health Informatics. 
@@3878233 <h> This story about Jeremy Corbyn ' fainting ' is classic example of how biased the UK press is <p> British politics could n't get more interesting or more exciting right now . With the Syria conflict , Brexit and the fight over the soul of the Labour Party , there is no shortage of things for the media to write about . <p> Yet the British press still feels the need to make things up . This story about Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a classic example . And it illustrates why no one trusts the UK media . The story -- from The Telegraph -- suggests that Corbyn recently " passed out " while in his office over the stress of running the Labour Party . <p> There are just three problems with the tale , which you can see this in this diagram : <p> The Telegraph <p> The story does n't have a single source in it , anonymous or otherwise , saying he actually fainted . It contains only denials from Corbyn 's staff . If Corbyn did faint from stress , it would have been great if The Telegraph had tracked that down , got a source or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . <p> Although the story is written as if it is news , it is accompanied by a comical photo caption that refers to him as " El Corbyno " and recounts his spartan dietary habits . His diet is not mentioned in the story . <p> The obvious parallel here is the David Cameron/pig sex story : Hilarious ... if only there was any evidence that the photo actually existed ... which there is not . <p> All this goes some way to explaining Corbyn 's popularity : People are n't stupid . They know the press is lazy and biased , they can see through it . They like the way Corbyn is trying to just tell it like it is , without the usual game-playing . Corbyn 's dislike of the media is one of his key strengths , because a lot of British people are disgusted by the casual dishonesty of the UK press . <p> The Telegraph is a Conservative paper , so we expect it to write from a certain perspective . When The Telegraph gets it right , it 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conservatives ' own top political strategist , Lynton Crosby , thinks this kind of thing is ridiculous .

" He described the wide publicity given to photos of Labour leader Ed Miliband 's inelegant eating of a bacon sandwich as " unfair , unwarranted and irrelevant ... nothing to do with his policies . " <p> When people see stunts like this , it reaffirms their belief that the person being attacked is the victim of an injustice . And that , in part , is where Corbyn gets his support .

Research suggests that the way we live our lives -- our diets , our exercise regimes -- can have a big impact on how we age . And it 's not just about the things we do to age well , it 's also about the things we avoid . <p> There is a large field of research that seeks to understand the factors that cause different rates of age-related decline . In particular , scientists look at how these factors change our ability to remember and pay attention to things in everyday life . We call such changes " cognitive ageing " . <p> Earlier work has looked at how diet or doing physical or mental exercise ( sudoku , crosswords ) affects ageing . However , the amount of stress we experience over a lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an under-researched area , until recently . <h> A lifetime of stress <p> Work from our lab and from others has found that many of the negative aspects of cognitive ageing seen in older people appear to be linked to the amount of stress they have experienced in their life . We began by measuring the number of stressful events experienced over the lifetime . We looked at a number of factors ranging from experiencing a major illness or losing a loved one , to changing one 's social habits or moving home . Old people who have experienced a lot of stress tend to perform worse on cognitive tasks than those who experienced less stress . <p> Crucially , old people who have n't experienced much stress in their life perform just as well on cognitive tasks as young people . This suggests that stress has a big impact on mental ability and that the effect of this only appears in old age . Indeed , young people did not differ from each other in their performance of cognitive tests whatever their life experience of stress had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people taking part in our study reflect the same effect : older people ( aged 60 to 80 ) who have experienced less stress have brain activity similar to that of younger people . However , when it comes to the brain activity of those elderly people who have led stressful lives , we find something very different going on . <p> This brain activity may give us some clues as to what 's going wrong and where in the brain it is happening . For instance , depending on the task involved , we can see that a significant amount of stress in a person 's lifetime can affect their ability to hold items in their short-term memory and can also reduce their ability to stop irrelevant thoughts from interfering with this process . <p> In particular , stress appears to affect an area of the brain essential for the formation of new memories ( the hippocampus ) . <p> But the long-term effects of stress are not only apparent in memory : recently it has been shown for the first time that brain processes and behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired .

Most of us know when we are feeling stressed . For those of us who do n't , smart devices can be used to alert us to the presence of potential dangers . By being aware of stress and its long-term consequences , we can begin to tackle it and to find ways to lessen its consequences . <p> The paths to de-stressing are numerous . Some people find meditation and mindfulness to be useful , for others the same techniques could be fruitless or even dangerous . Each person needs to find what works for them .

@@3886239 to contribute to the devastating flooding in Cumbria , there have once again been calls -- notably from the environmentalist George Monbiot -- for the reforestation of our uplands , to help tackle rural flooding . The government has stated that it is funding the planting of 11m trees over the next five years to this end . It has also been suggested that trees could help reduce the number and severity of flash floods in cities , such as those that devastated Hull in June 2007 . <p> To determine whether the humble tree really can provide such robust defences , we first need to understand the role they play in soaking up excess rain water . All floods , whether fluvial ( when rivers burst their banks ) or pluvial ( when rainfall overwhelms drainage systems before it reaches rivers ) , are caused because the rain can not soak into the soil fast enough . Instead , it runs rapidly over the surface of the land . <p> And while climate change is causing bigger and bigger storms , our alterations to the environment -- especially to the ground surface -- have been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern times . <h> Urban jungle <p> Cities offer the most obvious example of how human development is making flooding worse . In urban areas , the ground surface is covered by impermeable buildings and roads , which rapidly divert rainfall into gutters and drains . When these reach capacity , flooding occurs . <p> Computer modelling of water flows in cities suggests that for every extra 1% of impermeable land that is converted to woodland , runoff would be reduced by less than 0.5% . So even large-scale urban tree planting would only reduce runoff by a small amount -- far lower than the 80% increase in storm size that climate change models predict for the UK . <p> One of nine experimental plots in Manchester.Roland Ennos. , Author provided <p> But these estimates assume that trees do n't affect how much water runs into drains from buildings and roads . Recent research we carried out in Manchester has suggested that trees planted on the streets can have a much greater effect than predicted , largely because rainfall can run from pavements into their planting holes . <p> Trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Systems ( SUDS ) schemes -- in which rainfall is deliberately diverted into swales , hollows and soakaways -- could be even more effective . Unfortunately , though SUDS schemes are increasingly popular , little research has been carried out to monitor their effectiveness at reducing runoff . <h> Rural reforestation ? <p> Rural areas of the UK have also undergone a massive transformation at the hands of humans . Forests , which would have provided natural vegetation cover , have been removed and replaced with arable crops ( in the lowlands ) or grass pasture ( in upland areas such as the Lake District ) . Both of these types of agricultural land shed much more runoff than forests . Their thin soils are compacted by heavy farm machinery and the hooves of cattle and sheep . This reduces their permeability , making it more difficult for rain to penetrate the soil , while short-cropped grasses and flat fields offer little resistance to the overland flow of the runoff . <p> Reforesting such areas can have several benefits . For one thing , the tree canopy can intercept some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . But this only reduces the effective rainfall by a few millimetres , and the effect would be negligible in winter , when low temperatures reduce evaporation and deciduous trees have shed their leaves . <p> The effects of trees on the soil are much more significant . Fallen tree leaves build up a deeper , humus-rich soil , which is criss-crossed by thick surface roots that intercept the overland flow of rain water . Meanwhile , sub-surface roots penetrate deep into the soil , drying it out and increasing its permeability . These mechanisms are well-established , and seem to point to trees as a possible solution to flooding . <p> Yet in rural areas , the effectiveness of reforestation in preventing flooding is still uncertain . A recent study at Pontbren , in Wales , showed that planting trees on former pasture can increase the rate at which water infiltrates the soil by a factor of around 70 in just seven years , thereby reducing overland flow . Unfortunately , the planting was done on a relatively small scale , and there was no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to tell whether these changes had significantly reduced the speed at which water drained into the local streams , the water which would cause fluvial flooding downstream . <p> Ultimately , we lack the strong research base necessary to accurately quantify the anti-flooding benefits of planting trees : large scale studies cost money , and scientists have difficulty repeating experiments to confirm their findings , because no two catchments are the same . Most studies therefore depend on modelling , but even this is unreliable , because the models can not be validated by experiment . There are also a range of other factors , which might be affecting our results , such as soil type , slope , and whether the trees are positioned next to streams and rivers . But based on what we know , it seems unlikely that reforestation would be a total panacea ; after all , forested areas still flood . <p> And so it seems unlikely that reforestation alone would have been able to prevent the current floods in Cumbria .

Batters number eight and ten , Sarah Aley and Ashleigh Gardner , did what eight women before them had failed to do -- bat . With composure . And timing . And a little bit of luck .

" <p> The Sixers ' South African import Kapp succumbed for a golden duck in the second ball of the innings , playing an ugly shot around the legs . In the third over , and New Zealand captain Suzie Bates ' first for the Scorchers , two wickets fell . First a loosener down leg was enough to account for the visitors ' opener Sara Hungerford , whose leading edge found the hands of deep third man , and then captain Perry herself went , adjudged leg before . <p> Perry will feel hard done by , with replays suggesting that the ball would have easily sailed above the stumps , but when the umpire 's finger goes up , the game is up .

And do it the Scorchers did , bowling lines and lengths that could have come straight out of the coaching manual . The scorecard reflected this with the home side sending down just one extra -- a leg bye . <p> If the Sixers went into the innings break hoping that the wicket had something to do with their first innings performance , the Scorchers ' opening partnership of Charlotte Edwards and Elyse Villani soon assured them that this was n't the case . The two internationals timed the ball to all corners of the park as the home side made short work of the run chase . <p> Villani eventually fell for 19 in the seventh over , bowled by Laura Marsh , but the entrance of captain Nicole Bolton to the crease was a seamless transition from one high class batter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweeping , revers-sweeping and pulling everything that was thrown at her to see her team over the line in the 14th over .

Almost Ricky Ponting-esque , Villani will pull anything back of a length , regardless of line . <p> Their dominant display today is an encouraging sign for the Scorchers , who still do n't believe they 're quite firing on all cylinders . <p> " It was a much better performance than yesterday , " Edwards said .

The second season of the popular podcast is here , with a new case to try in the court of public opinion . Focused on the disappearance of Private Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan , this time around Serial is going big . Buckle up , kids . <p> Spoilers ahead for Serial episode one , " DUSTWUN " <h> Previously , on Serial ... <p> When it debuted a year ago , the podcast from the creators of This American Life became a sensation . David Carr called the show " podcasting 's first breakout hit " and it broke records as the fastest podcast to reach 5 million downloads . Parodies appeared on Saturday Night Live and in The Onion , and millions of listeners became armchair detectives in evaluating the story of Adnan Syed , who was convicted 15 years ago of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee . Questions about the case raised by Serial and its focus on Adnan recently allowed him to receive a new hearing . <p> While the case of Adnan and Hae Min was 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The protagonists had been in high school in Baltimore , and felt like they could be your friends or your kids . Whether or not you believed Adnan was guilty , there were obvious discrepancies and mysteries to unravel . People became personally committed ; some travelled to Maryland to investigate for themselves . I stayed up on too many nights reading comprehensive Reddit threads , turning the puzzle pieces over and over . <h> A Whole New World <p> This second season of Serial is a divergence from the first 's narrow focus on a singular event . In presenting the narrative of Bowe Bergdahl , a US soldier who disappeared in Afghanistan and was held captive by the Taliban for five years , Serial and host Sarah Koenig look to be taking on an extremely broad topic indeed : the morality of war , and whether Bergdahl 's decision to desert his post could be justified by the circumstances . This round of Serial is likely to be extremely divisive , and perhaps less accessible to the masses . But it 's an important and gutsy move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the first episode , " DUSTWUN " , which is a military abbreviation for " duty status whereabouts unknown " , we 're introduced to Bergdahl 's case . If you 've followed it in the American news at all , you know that the initial rejoicing when Bergdahl was freed via a prisoner exchange soon soured over accusations of his desertion . Serial tells us how a celebration in Bergdahl 's hometown of Hailey , Idaho was canceled , and how he now faces military charges , including desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , which could mean lifetime imprisonment for the 29-year-old . <p> Bergdahl is n't talking to the press . But screenwriter Mark Boal ( Zero Dark Thirty , The Hurt Locker ) recorded 25 hours of candid conversation with Bergdahl in the hopes of making a film about his experience . Both men agreed to share those discussions with Serial 's team . <p> Bergdahl is forthright about leaving his post . He explains that his intention was to trigger a " DUSTWUN " alert that would ricochet up the chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an audience with a General he never could have achieved as a private . He claims that his concerns about " crappy " leadership and fears that the men in his unit were in danger prompted this desperate gamble . Serial will be investigating the veracity of Bergdahl 's claims and the circumstances of his capture and imprisonment by the Taliban . <p> I 've been reading about the Bergdahl story for a while , but it 's absolutely fascinating to hear him recount his actions . Sounding half-sheepish and half-defiant , the soft-spoken Bergdahl admits there was part of him that had something to prove -- that he could be a Jason Bourne-like heroic figure . He prepared carefully for his plan to leave the godforsaken outpost where his unit was based and trek across hostile terrain . He mailed home personal items and packed essentials , leaving his weapons behind , and he purchased native Afghan dress to disguise himself . <p> The pre-planning element here shows that Bergdahl 's actions were the result of a good deal of forethought , not a rash and sudden choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deserters by himself : he was n't intoxicated , confused , or consorting . He made what seemed to him to be a moral choice to call attention to problems in his unit , even if many would find the methods by which he tried to do so questionable . <p> We hear how the full weight and reality of that choice hit Bergdahl partway through his trek . He backpedaled , and decided he was going to return to his post , and to counterbalance the panic he knew his actions would have kicked up , he decided to track down some Taliban activity and bring the information back to camp . That 's when he was caught by the Taliban -- the specifics to be discussed next week , when Koenig calls in to talk with Taliban figures with help from an interpreter . <p> Sarah Koenig , on the phone with the Taliban ! We are definitely in Serial v 2.0 : Go Big Or Go Home . I 'm not sure how to feel about the new season yet . I think Bergdahl 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about his actions . Serial 's masterful storytelling is in full swing , clips intercut with audio effects that create a resonant world , and rich scripts that promise to tell every side of the story . This is definitely a tale for our time . <h> So Many Questions <p> But I have some concerns , too . Bergdahl is facing serious charges -- life imprisonment -- and the first episode does n't exactly paint a sympathetic picture of his disappearance into the Afghan night . I think Koenig and the team intend to build up both sides as the season progresses , including exposing more of the conditions faced by Bergdahl 's unit in their hellish outpost as well as his time as a prisoner of war . " How do I explain that just standing in an empty dark room hurts ? " Bergdahl says in conversation with Boal . " I would wake up not even remembering who I am . The only thing I could do was touch my face . " <p> Listening to Bergdahl , it 's hard not to feel he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 23 and under conditions most of us can scarcely imagine . And it 's not hard to imagine that he witnessed abuses of power and horrific situations while deployed . In attempting to take on the war in Afghanistan , Koenig and the Serial team have their work cut out for them . <p> Can they untangle the mess of this conflict , ongoing since 2001 , for listeners ? Will we want to hear it ? For Bergdahl 's sake , I hope so . His involvement in Serial must indicate that he believes he 'll receive a more fair trial in the court of public opinion than from the military . If his story gets told , there 's a much greater chance he wo n't be forgotten or subject to totally closed-door proceedings . It 's a risky move , but Bergdahl does n't seem to be averse to those . <p> What did you think of Serial 's new season starter ? Are you on board ? Tell us in the comments .

Church 's Canadian-born mother , Marielaine Douglas , was also in the business , firstly as an actress , then as a drama teacher . The story goes that Jonathan Church 's first stage appearance was in utero , when the pregnant Marielaine was performing in a Nottingham Playhouse production of Hedda Gabler in 1966 . <p> Working his way up through the ranks , Church served as the artistic director of the Salisbury Playhouse ( 1995-1999 ) , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company ( 2001-2005 ) and the Chichester Festival Theatre ( 2006-2015 ) . He produced a brace of successful West End shows along the way , including Lucy Prebble 's Enron directed by Rupert Goold , The Judas Kiss with Rupert Everett ( directed by Neil Armfield ) , a Macbeth starring Patrick Stewart , a King Lear with Frank Langella in the title role , the smash hit Singin ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imelda Staunton . <p> Church is also a highly experienced fundraiser , having overseen the $46 million redevelopment of the Chichester Festival Theatre for its 50th anniversary in 2014 . <p> There is n't much about the process of making theatre that Church does n't know about . Even so , he is the first to admit he 's on a steep learning curve when it comes to running a major theatre company in a city , and a country , he knows little about . <p> " I 've been trying to connect with as many people as I can , " says the softly spoken Church over a cup of tea in the Walsh Bay Kitchen adjacent to the Roslyn Packer Theatre . " People who are the company 's history and people who will lead it in the future . Plus I 've been to Griffin and Belvoir , then up to Melbourne to meet some of our partners . It 's wonderful that you have competing cities and that they are your collaborators . All of these companies will influence our output to some extent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their audiences want , too . " <p> Sydneysiders , I say , never go " up " to Melbourne . " See ? I 'm still not on top of the geography , " Church says , laughing . " I was born in the Midlands , so I was used to going down to London , whereas in Chichester , you always went up . " <p> Ups and downs aside , many of the issues faced by the Sydney Theatre Company are similar to those faced by companies of similar standing worldwide : maintaining loyal audiences while chasing new ones ; developing new work at a time when government funding is being squeezed , and ensuring diversity on stage and off . <p> It 's impossible to address such issues individually , Church says . " These are big , complex questions and I have n't met anyone yet with whom I have n't had the same conversation : how do we diversify ? Everyone is alert to it . " <p> It 's when the money starts to dry up that diversity is most threatened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the safer the choices , the less risk you take . Adventure and opportunity can only thrive in well funded , well run , highly attended companies . " <p> Church is joining a company in a stronger financial position than those he has walked into in the past . That said , the STC posted a deficit of nearly $300,000 on its theatrical operations in the financial year 2014-15 , a significant decline from the surplus of $419,430 it reported in 2013 . A small surplus achieved by the STC Foundation reduced the deficit to $250,000 -- less than 1 per cent of the company 's overall turnover of about $36.5 million . <p> Church wo n't be concerned by that amount of red ink , says the London-based theatre critic Mark Shenton , associate editor of the venerable industry newspaper The Stage . " Jonathan has a reputation for turning around the finances of ailing UK theatres . He 's done it three times over , first at the Salisbury Playhouse , then the Birmingham Rep , then Chichester , all of which were seriously underperforming when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Birmingham , Church increased the Rep 's audience by a staggering 92 per cent . In Chichester , he transformed the Festival Theatre from a venue on the brink of closure into a powerhouse supplying the West End with shows including Sweeney Todd and Gypsy ( both directed by Jonathan Kent ) . <p> Shenton adds that Church is a much liked and admired figure in the British theatre scene , where his ability to bridge the technical , commercial and artistic realms of the business is unusual . " He 's a man of eclectic tastes and he does n't dominate the theatres he runs as a personal fiefdom to promote only his own work . " <p> Church 's Sydney appointment came from out of left field , Shenton says . " He had just announced plans to set up his own independent West End company in partnership with Cameron Mackintosh , so his move to Sydney did come as a big surprise . " <p> The Church-Cameron Mackintosh venture ( Jonathan Church Productions Limited ) will continue , regardless , Shenton says . " I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , not just of Jonathan but of productions . Church is a man of great commercial instincts , so I think this could mean that there 'll be more commercial co-productions . " <p> Will his focus be split ? Not at all , says Church . " The board and I discussed that previous STC artistic directors have generally had opportunities to occasionally work outside the company . I think outside experiences and different pressures can be a very good thing . STC is my main focus though . " <p> Church wo n't be drawn on programming at the STC , saying he wo n't unveil his vision for the company until he releases the 2017 season late next year . Are we likely to see some musicals ? <p> " Well , musical theatre has been a part of STC history , " Church says . " Of course , I 'd be interested , but it will have to happen at the right time in the right way . You have your own producers and an established musical theatre ecology here already with John Frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would first have to ask , is it necessary ? That 's one of the questions we should be asking all the time . " <p> Will we be seeing more work from British companies or people he worked with previously ? Again , Church wo n't be drawn . <p> " I want to bring out some artists I have a relationship with but that 's very much secondary to me encouraging Australian artists to make great work here . I want to bring the world to Sydney but mainly I want to build on what Andrew and Cate Blanchett have done , which is to take Sydney to the world . " <p> Church sees himself as a " hands-on " artistic director rather than a figurehead , but he 's not one to stamp his identity on everything the company creates . " I 'm hands-on in that I will have some personal stake in everything the STC does , " Church says . " I want everything we do to be the very best it can be . But it 's the actors , directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an artistic director , you are merely a custodian for a patch of its history . The people who own the company are the theatremakers , who see people like me in and out , and the audiences . " <p> As far as is practical , Church 's office door will be open to all comers , he says . " A theatre company has to be hungry for new talent and new voices . We want to attract those people who going to change the way we think about theatre . " <p> Church does plan to direct during his tenure . " I love directing , but I 've always taken my role as producer to be equally if not more important , " he says . " I see my job as backing talent .

@@3924230 <h> French Consumer Group Sues Valve Over Lack Of Steam Resale Options <p> Valve has come under fire from a French consumer association called UFC Que Choisir ( slightly different from that other UFC ) . The organisation litigates on behalf of the public , and they feel that Steam is letting customers down . <p> UFC Que Choisir believes that 12 clauses in Steam 's much-scrutinised Subscriber Agreement constitute breaches of French consumer law . Their main points of contention , translated by Silencement , break down as follows : <p> -Steam 's Subscriber Agreement explicitly forbids users to sell their games , despite the transfer of ownership of digital products/licenses being legal <p> -Valve declines any responsibility in case they get hacked and users ' personal info gets stolen <p> -Valve claims ownership on the rights of any user-created content uploaded on Steam <p> -It is impossible to get the money on your Steam Wallet back if your account is closed/deleted/banned <p> -Valve applies Luxembourg 's consumer law regardless of the user 's country <p> Sounds pretty damning , huh ? If UFC Que Choisir got Valve to concede these points , odds are they would n't be able to just flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some systematic changes . Problem is , most of UFC Que Choisir 's points do n't really hold water . Let 's break this down . <p> The first point -- that people ca n't resell their games -- is a complex issue that has n't been solved in other mediums , and Valve already won in court against a German consumer group that filed a similar complaint pertaining to games specifically . At its most basic level , the issue is that physical goods are finite and digital goods can be as numerous as the stars in the sky , as manifold as Donald Trump 's selection of weird neck/jowl configurations . On top of that , in the current system we buy licences to specific games under a larger Steam subscription -- as opposed to individual copies of games themselves . This allows us to , among other things , download and re-download games to our heart 's content . It also means , however , that we do n't technically own the games we buy on Steam . We subscribe to them . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we own . <p> Introducing the ability to resell would likely turn the current system on its head . Even if Valve implemented a feature that would , say , scrub a game from your account/machine and turn it back into a code you could sell , we 'd be looking at a more or less infinite secondhand market . Because digital games do n't expire with use -- like , say , keys you can sell on the Steam market -- a relatively large number of people could pass around a few keys quickly and easily . The convenience is the biggest factor here . It might not seem all that different from the way a few friends might pass around a copy of a physical game , but the ramifications could be much greater because it 's all so easy and the potential audience is so much larger . On top of that , what happens when big Steam Sales enter the picture ? It would n't be difficult for people to buy up games on the cheap from developers/publishers , wait for prices to go back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that , in time , that would cause publishers to raise the initial price of games , and Valve would likely need to cease Steam sales altogether . It 'd be a big hit to folks making games , is what I 'm saying . <p> That said , it might not be so bad . Microtransactions already help a lot of publishers deal with dual monetary damages caused by the brick-and-mortar secondhand market and piracy . If Steam were forced to implement some kind of resale system , we might just see more microtransactions and similar online features -- a direction the industry 's already trending toward anyway . But , as more games go free and rely almost entirely on microtransactions , digital resale of games themselves becomes less and less relevant . Valve , meanwhile , already allows for the sale of some digital goods on the Steam marketplace . <p> Still , laws in certain countries ( like France ) stipulate that the transfer of digital software licences is legal , despite what any single company might ( try to ) say . A EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Valve won the aforementioned case against a German consumer group in 2014 . Games , as it turns out , may not be mere " software , " given that they can contain all sorts of music and art that fall under various copyright laws . On top of that , Valve has recently implemented game sharing and refund features that mitigate some of the inconveniences that emerge when people ca n't resell games . <p> UFC Que Choisir might actually have something with their second point , though . Valve declines responsibility pertaining to hacks when users bungle their own way into compromising situations -- that is to say , when they get scammed by other users or duped by third-party trading sites . If an account is hijacked , however , Valve will sometimes make exceptions : <p> " Inventory restorations are granted on a case by case basis . In order for Steam Support to restore items , technicians will need to verify , using Steam 's internal data , that the account was hijacked . " <p> But what about personal information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen back in 2011 , and Valve 's report card there is ... mixed . They waited four days to initially report what happened , but they tried to investigate the ramifications of the hack and informed users that they 'd seen no evidence of credit card compromise . Unfortunately , it took them months to follow-up after that , and they found that hackers probably had gotten ahold of a lot of personal info , some of it encrypted . Ultimately , they advised users to stay on guard and use tools like Valve 's own Steam Guard security functions . It 's not clear what sort of steps they took to try and secure said data in the aftermath of the hack . So , in short , Valve responded to a hack by trying to clean up the mess , but they were slower about it than they probably could 've been , and they left users in a frightening limbo . Classic shitty Valve communication . The whole episode was n't great . Since then , Valve 's implemented tighter security measures , but UFC Que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When it comes to user-created content , Valve actually claims a non-exclusive right to your stuff , so you can still post or reproduce it elsewhere . Given that user-created content is often made within games Valve or their publishing partners own , that actually does n't seem like a terrible deal -- especially since Valve gives mod makers a cut of the profit if they end up selling said items . A handful of particularly successful creators are even able to make a living off it . <p> The fourth point -- the inability to get money on your Steam Wallet back if your account is closed/deleted/banned -- sucks , but it 's also kinda a " them 's the breaks " situation . You turned that money over to Steam , same as you do when you buy a game or what have you . It makes a kind of sense that it 'd vanish with all your games as punishment for breaking Steam 's rules in a way significant enough to get you banned . Admittedly , there are cases where account hijackers get people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks or months to respond . Until Valve convincingly clears that up , they 're not spotless here . All in all , though , the policy in itself is n't super damning . <p> The last point -- the bit about Luxembourg law -- is flat-out wrong . In Steam 's Subscriber Agreement , Valve writes : " However , where the laws of Luxembourg provide a lower degree of consumer protection than the laws of your country of residence , the consumer protection laws of your country shall prevail . " <p> I 'm glad to see this organisation trying to fight for the rights of Steam users , but I feel like they 're barking up the wrong series of trees -- or " forest " , as the kids are calling them these days . They have got one solid point and a bunch of weak/misinformed ones . Meanwhile , Valve has legal precedent ( albeit in another country ) on their side . <p> All that said , would you like the ability to resell your digital games ? What would need to happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It would n't be difficult for people to buy up games on the cheap from developers/publishers , wait for prices to go back up , and then sell for a high price . I imagine that , in time , that would cause publishers to raise the initial price of games , and Valve would likely need to cease Steam sales altogether . It 'd be a big hit to folks making games , is what I 'm saying . <p> The article was pretty alright except this point . This is exactly like a brick and mortar store sale with someone going into a store or two , buying a whole lot of cheap goods and selling the goods at a higher price when the sales are over . We have not seen an end of sales as a result of these . It seems we have actually seen a decrease in pricing as a result of more " competition " . why buy something shady off eBay for $10 less and wait for it to arrive when I could have it today . A global marketplace would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release day and will still buy it . A smaller group will wait for it to go on sale anyway . The in between crowd who will pay more but do n't want to pay release prices would benefit the most . If a used price was set by the developer with a portion of the funds going back to them it would benefit them the most . For example I want to sell Left 4 Dead 3 2 days after release . RRP is $99.95 , I want to get $60.00 out of it and the used price is set to $80.95 . User buys it , Steam takes their cut , I get my $60.00 and the rest goes to the developer , win win for all involved . <p> For some reason , the video game industry acts like second-hand sales are a thing of pure evil , spoken of with the same contempt as they have for piracy . This is despite the fact you can freely resell pretty much anything else you own ; your house , car , tv , furniture , books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later sell it , you do n't hear Fender complaining . However , we always seem to get apologists for large corporations like Valve screwing consumers over , people who buy up the bullshit argument that " you do n't own the game , just a temporary license that can be revoked at any time , without notice and without compensation for your loss . " <p> Ah , but you are n't selling the second hand Fender on their website/service though are you ? This is a very different beast than selling a physical item , I ca n't even think of a service that lets you sell digital content like music , films and software . <p> I 'm not against the idea of a resale feature on Steam , but from a business standpoint it 's fairly easy to see why it does n't sound appealing . <p> There 's nothing stopping them from being able to have a digital marketplace for games ; especially when they already have a digital marketplace for superfluous shit like hats for Team Fortress 2 . How is selling a digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital hat on the used market ? <p> 1 . It 's all data . The only difference between a hat and a game is the amount of data . It 's all digital information , and there is absolutely no technological reason it ca n't be done . 2 . EBay and Gumtree have no problem letting people sell their stuff . In this case , it 's merely the sale of a digital license . Besides , they could implement an approval system where publishers decide whether or not their games should be available for resale . <p> And being uncharted waters is n't very good justification for not doing something . Imagine telling NASA not to go to the moon in the 60s , or telling Steve Jobs not to give the iPhone a touchscreen because no-one else was doing it . Or telling Nintendo not to make a dual-screened handheld , or invest in motion controls because it was uncharted waters . Imagine telling the first people to write comics , do stand-up comedy , make movies , sell food from a van on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do it because it was uncharted waters . The great success stories of our time do n't come from people who followed the beaten path , but the ones who forged their own . <p> At risk of perpetuating that strawmans paradise , Steam is already a revolutionary bloody service . <p> I already said I agree that a resell system could work but let 's keep this grounded in reality man . You asked for a difference , I gave it and reducing it does n't help the argument . <p> Yes , having developers and publishers agree is central to allowing a resell system to work , but what is the incentive for them ? You already recognise that second hand dealing is a sore point for them and we all know how splitting the money went with the Skyrim modding debacle . <p> What 's the incentive , you ask ? The same as for every other second-hand market ; people sell their old stuff so they can buy new stuff . I sold my car , and bought a brand new one off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple weeks for delivery , but you get the idea ) . I 've sold old Bass guitars and then gone and bought brand new ones . At the moment , I 'm thinking about getting rid of my lounge so I can buy a brand new one . And look at trade-ins at stores such as EB or JB hifi . Sure , they wo n't give you much money for your old games , but if it helps knock the price off some new games by trading in stuff you do n't play anymore , do n't you think that 'll help entice people to make a purchase they otherwise would n't have ? You tell me to keep this grounded in reality , and I have . The ONLY thing stopping this digital resale market from happening is that some people simply do n't want it to . <p> That does n't really seem like a win for the developer - they wo n't get anything from that $80 on the second hand sale . And if the recipient resells it again , they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not only promote , but ensure , that any new release inevitably has more second hand sales than " first hand " sales - because really , when the digital second hand copy is 100% the same as a new digital copy , who would want to pay full price on steam when they conveniently ( and immediately ) do n't have to ? <p> I get where you 're coming from this , but the truth of the matter is that second hand sales of physical copies is not an identical situation to what will occur in digital form . <p> If this second hand system was to be implemented on steam , certain conditions would undoubtedly be added to mitigate the potential losses . For example , much like gifts , a game would most likely need to have been in the users library for over 30 days before it can be resold . A finite limit on the amount of times a title can be resold would also not be surprising . <p> Developers get paid for their work , and in some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the percentage of sales , and they very rarely pass it on ( which was why the devs from Infinity Ward left Activision , even though they literally had an agreement for profit-sharing , Activision would n't pay up , so they left and formed a new studio ) . But if devs did get a percentage of sales , then why do n't the people who claim to support the devs pay full price for their games ? How much money would they get when you buy a game in a Steam sale at 60 or 75% off ? And how many other industries let a producer profit twice from a single sale ? If I sell my car , should Mazda get some money ? And if so , how much ? If I sell my TV , do Samsung get a cut ? <p> Since Steam 's cut is something like 30% let 's assume that comes out of the difference between the price and the user 's price ( so $20.95 in my scenario ) . $6.28 goes to Steam and the remaining $14.67 goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that 's more than if I bought a physical version and traded it in at EB , of which the developer receives exactly $0.00 regardless of the price . This is also based on the current system where people feel they are entitled to trade their games in , just giving the developer a cut of the action . <p> You 're right , second hand sales of digital goods is not identical to physical goods . Physical goods degrade over time , digital goods do not . Selling a physical item second hand is at a lower price because of that , we could have people buying second hand digital goods at the exact same price . So rather than set a lower price point , as my first example , have an option to " sell " your right back to the developer and they re-sell the right to another consumer ( trading in , some might say ) . <p> Of course actual terms and conditions would need to be built , we ca n't even buy something online without agreeing to pages and pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to part with my games , even if it is just a digital copy with no physical component to it . <p> It never really made sense to me why people would want to trade a new $80 game back to EB games for a measly $10 in return . Even if their economic situation was dire , surely the replayability of the game ( and the hassle of obtaining the full rrp in the first place ) would outweigh the benefits of the $10 from selling it . <p> In regards to digital resales , as the author touched on , it has it 's own unique problems that pretty much make the concept unfeasible , due in large part to the speed and efficiency of communication with an enormous community . <p> With some indie games having a length of 4hrs , I could easily see a single copy of a game changing through many hands quite rapidly . In a single day , a single used copy could potentially pass through 5 people , assuming they sold it immediately after finishing the title . Obviously such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for indie devs . <p> I think the current steam system is fine . New games are often on sale for comparable pricing to second hand , but with the benefit of supporting the devs . Plus , it seems you can share a game with up to 5 people anyway , though I 'm not entirely sure what the limitations are on this ( it seems to be geared for letting family members access a game using separate accounts on a communal computer ) . <p> Even if their economic situation was dire , surely the replayability of the game ( and the hassle of obtaining the full rrp in the first place ) would outweigh the benefits of the $10 from selling it . I guess you never played Homefront . ; ) ( Bad example , I returned that one over the weekend for full refund . ) <p> That said , it might not be so bad . Microtransactions already help a lot of publishers deal with dual monetary damages caused by the brick-and-mortar secondhand market and piracy . If Steam were forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see more microtransactions and similar online features -- a direction the industry 's already trending toward anyway . <p> Are you saying that it 's not bad because we might get even MORE microtransactions in games ? <p> Microtransactions already help a lot of publishers deal with dual monetary damages caused by the brick-and-mortar secondhand market and piracy . <p> Really ? You 're lumping brick-and-mortar second game sales in the same basket as piracy ? Has Valve paid you to take their side , or something ? <p> It makes far , far more sense to decry the fact that we do n't even own the copies of the games that we buy anymore because of the legal fiction that these massive corporate entities have cooked up , than it does to defend and justify their tactics . <h> Trending Stories Right Now <p> Briefly .

He could not pay the upfront costs unless Soundwave was an immediate hit with ticket buyers . It was n't . Without the proper credit facility the upfront costs had to be paid in cash . That meant that he could not afford the top shelf artists as headliners he was used to booking in the past . Without an act like Metallica , Iron Maiden or Green Day , punters did not have the incentive to buy and they did n't .

So if he measured a thin-film thickness of 100nm ( nanometres ) , his uncertainty would be less than 1nm .

Implanting a few arsenic atoms here and a few boron atoms there into a silicon wafer forms the array of transistors that become the brains of " silicon chips " . <p> Ion implantation is one of the basic technologies that underlie the huge semiconductor industry .

To be " merry " is to be given to laughter , to be full of fun , to rejoice , and to be of a blithe spirit which is to say cheerfully carefree . None of this can be found in wrapping paper . <p> True , the things we get and the things we are invited to take part in can encourage a sense of merriment , but the essential ingredients for this state of being are entirely internal . <p> No amount of gift-giving or of feasting can make merry someone who lacks the inclination , the inner disposition , to simply let go and enjoy . <p> The well wish of a " Merry Christmas " was popularised by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novel A Christmas Carol .

@@4754234 <p> Soil health specialist Dr Pam Pittaway has warned farmers of the danger of using immature compost on crops of all kinds , and advised that either curing organic compost yourself , or testing it and the soil for nutrients , is the best way to ensure organic amendments benefit crops . <p> Speaking at a recent symposium about soil health at the University of Southern Queensland ( USQ ) in Toowoomba , Dr Pittaway said knowing the microbial stability of your amendment and its salt content were the best ways to ensure your crop got the optimum nutrients . <p> " If you know the salt content of your amendment , and the plant-available and total nutrient content of your amendment , you might be able to reduce the amount of NPK fertiliser you put on your crop , " Dr Pittaway said . <p> This could result in farmers greatly reducing their inorganic fertiliser bills , but Dr Pittaway said the age and content of the organic amendment , or fertiliser , needed to be taken into consideration , and the purchase of product of indeterminate age or properties was a risky business . <p> " As soon as you put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphorus , you stimulate a microbial feeding frenzy which can starve your crop . If soil microbes have access to fast food , they take up luxury amounts of available N and P , out-competing plant roots , " she said . <p> " Adding manure or compost high in potassium can also burn plant roots , as potassium is a soluble salt , " she said . <p> " And when growers continue to add fertiliser nitrogen on top of past organic amendments , they can get an uncontrolled growth flush which commits your plants to an extra load ; if they ca n't support that during the growth period , they can end up shedding tillers , or can lodge . " <p> Dr Pittaway said root disease was also a possible symptom of over-feeding crops with organic amendments . <p> Australian horticulture and agriculture use a vast range of organic amendments , including pig and poultry manure produced , cured and used on-farm , and commercially produced preparations , most of which incorporate straw or green waste as a source of carbon . <p> Dr Pittaway said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release which synchronised nutrient release with plant demand , and minimised grower expenditure on nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium ( NPK ) inputs . <p> " My advice is if you ca n't afford good cured compost , invest in more soil testing , and put immature products on your least valuable crop . " <p> Dr Pittaway said producers needed to be aware of the business model of some waste management businesses , which sought a fast turnaround on organic amendments . <p> " Some businesses need to push product out the gate to make space for more waste , and while Australian Standards say certain aspects of organic amendments must be tested , those results wo n't necessarily tell you what 's best for your crop or soils . <p> " Instead of a six-week turnaround , which is what some waste-management businesses operate on , you want to use organic amendments that have been cured for 16-20 weeks , because immature compost could do more harm than good . " <p> She said farmers should also be aware of the environmental risks of over-application of organic amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement into waterways . <p> Dr Pittaway has conducted studies on a number of organic amendments including cotton trash , feedlot manure , sugarcane waste , and sawdust in broadacre and horticultural applications . <p> " Fully cured compost costs more but immediately conditions your soil .

Adding humus-like , cured compost builds the stable , long-term organic fraction back into your soil . <p> " If it is fully cured , you can build a slow-release nitrogen bank which will release nutrients in synch with the crop 's development .

@@4758230 <p> Perth Scorchers openers Elyse Villani and Charlotte Edwards ensured their side 's top-order batting woes were put firmly behind them as they cruised past the Melbourne Stars ' total of 127 in record time . The two batters reached their target with 17 balls to spare and with the loss of just one wicket as they negotiated the searing heat of The Furnace intelligently and meticulously , dealing almost exclusively in boundaries during the run chase . <p> For Edwards , who was eventually caught in the deep for 61 , it was simply a continuation of yesterday 's innings , in which her unbeaten 56-ball 61 guided the Scorchers to an easy victory over the Melbourne Stars . For Villani however , it was redemption . The former Victorian has a knack of finding form against her old teammates ; a disappointing start to her WNCL season with the bat was eventually ended earlier this year with a mammoth innings of 142 when the Alcohol Think.Again Western Fury defeated Vic Spirit in November . <p> Today saw a repeat performance as Villani , after a string of low scores in the Rebel Women 's Big Bash League so far , timed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It feels pretty good , " said Villani following her knock . " It 's nice to get a few wins on the board . Winning is a bit of a habit so hopefully we 're on the right path now . " <p> " I was definitely happy because I finally contributed . As an opening batter you want to contribute in every innings and I have n't been able to do that . <p> " Nobody is more disappointed about that than myself so it was really nice to go out there and have a great opening partnership with Charlotte and set the tone for our innings . " <p> " I 'd like to make a lot more runs for the Scorchers and hopefully today was the start of something . I have the luxury that l played cricket with a lot of the girls in the Melbourne Stars and I probably know my game a lot more against that opposition which has probably come in handy for me . " <p> On paper , Villani and Edwards were indistinguishable ; both reached their 50s off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye however , the two batters went about their business in their own discernible style . <p> Villani 's front elbow is one of the most pronounced in the sport and it was her drives which once again stood out , one particular effort proving the shot of the day as she sweetly struck a Hayley Jensen delivery back past the bowler for a gun-barrel straight boundary . <p> Edwards on the other hand , just as she had done yesterday and said as much in her post-match interview , swept and paddled her way through the innings , using the fast WACA wicket and outfield to guide ball after ball to the boundary . <p> " I think it takes a while for an opening partnership to get that connection , " said Villani . <p> " I think we 've finally worked out how we 're batting together , our running together and how we 're communicating against the bowlers so I think we 've finally got the connection right and I 'm hoping for a big back half of the season together . " <p> The Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attempt to defend a below-par total of 102 , were guilty today of bowling a line and length that was easy for the accomplished figures of Edwards and Villani to punish . Too many deliveries were aimed too straight , and with little room for error ended up erring towards the leg side . Tough to set a field to two ' in ' batters , but Meg Lanning too was perhaps too cautious in adapting her field to the fine leg glances and paddle scoops emanating off Edwards ' bat . <p> Going into the innings break the Stars , after a slow start , will have been more confident of a win than at the same point in the game the previous day , in which they had only managed to muster 102 runs in their 20 overs . <p> Despite the loss it will be of some solace to the Stars to have been able to show that even with the relatively early departure of Lanning , they still have strength in depth further down the order . <p> Before Christmas , Lanning had been dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stars ' only defeat in their campaign until then . As with Vic Spirit in the WNCL , the question was whether the Stars other batters , of which there are many but who had yet to be tested , would be able to take on the responsibility of forming a competitive total . <p> Villani &amp; Edwards TAKE A BOW ! ! The openers have led us to an 8-wicket win , we 're two from two against the Stars ! **26;1397;TOOLONG <p> After a frustrating performance yesterday it was Emma Inglis , the Stars wicket-keeper who was on the cusp of international selection this time last year , who showed that the Stars are not just a one-woman team . Inglis , although disappointed not to have played a winning innings , was in fine form , reaching 42 not out off 30 balls after coming to the crease at a tricky time for the Melbourne side . <p> " Yesterday with the batting we did n't score enough runs , " said Emma Inglis at the end of today 's play . " We got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling from the Scorchers girls -- Deandra Dottin in particular -- which really squeezed us there in the 10 to 15 over period . <p> " Today we were just trying to rotate the strike more and score off as many balls as possible . That helped us get to 127 today , but just not quite enough . " <p> Inglis has one of the cleanest , most powerful drives in women 's cricket but has struggled to make an impact this season , coming in at difficult junctures and not being able to kick on from promising starts . A stubborn innings of 34 to top score for Vic Spirit against New South Wales in the last game of the WNCL showed that she has the versatility and ability to perform in any situation - it was just a case of delivery . Today Inglis , bumped up the order from previous matches , proved that she can deliver , and may well be an important component of the Stars ' campaign here on in if she can continue today 's form . <p> " I was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been moved up the order a spot for this weekend so it was good after yesterday coming in and not doing so well so it was good to bounce back and get some runs . <p> " Just have to keep building on that . It 's good to contribute , hopefully get a few more next time as I 'd rather have a win than top score , but that 's the way it goes . " <p> For the Scorchers it 's an ice-bath and a quick turnaround as they take on the Sydney Thunder in this afternoon 's fixture , while the Stars fly back to Melbourne with two consecutive losses and looking to improve in time for the much-anticipated derby against the Melbourne Renegades on Saturday January 2 . <p> The opinions expressed here are the views of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Cricket Australia .

@@4758237 <h> How The Hell Did I End Up In Michigan ? <p> Welcome back to the Connected States , the project that involves me living in a van for a year , driving around and telling stories . After going live last week I was absolutely overwhelmed by the positive response . I received so many tips , well-wishes , and offers of help that I have n't been able to respond to them all yet . It was truly moving . <p> AU Editor 's Note : this series was originally posted on Gizmodo US in mid-2015 , and is very US-centric , but we thought it was interesting enough to share again . Have a read , enjoy , and let us know what you think ! -- Cam <p> When we last left off I was in Iowa City , Iowa , which is not a very creative name for a city , so I moved on . By that point , though I 'd left myself very little time . I needed to be in Detroit by 9:30am the next day so I could finally do my TSA Precheck interview , and Detroit was 490 miles away . I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another Walmart parking lot and slept for 2.5 hours , and then kept going . My dad had recommended The Burning Room , a book by Michael Connelly , so I downloaded it on Audible and that did a good job of keeping me alert . <p> The real reason I was heading to Michigan was to see one of my oldest and best friends get married . Dylan and I go back to 7th grade , but many of the guests would be people we had gone to high school with . It 's still a pretty tight-knit crew , as , for various reasons , many of us had left our small California town for Brooklyn during the last decade , and so we 'd formed a sort of " I miss real burritos " support group . Anyway , the wedding would be a couple hours north but first we decided to explore Detroit proper a little . We met up with Dylan 's old roommate Blair who grew up in the area and had since returned , prodigal son style . <p> If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " powder keg , " which is two words , so I would have lost that game . But that 's what it is . There is so much potential energy in that city , and it 's just waiting for something to set it off . It 's also volatile as hell . I 've never seen a place that had been so obviously fucked by a single industry . Big auto burned these people , and these people are pissed . <p> Much of what you see on the news is true . There are rows upon rows of abandoned houses . Some houses -- and not just a couple -- have been burned to the ground . Everywhere you go you see desperate people . But Detroit is on the cusp of major changes . Real estate is so cheap that a lot of rich , white tech-industry type folks are buying up massive amounts of property , just because it 's cheap and they can . The artists have already moved in , and just like in any other city , once the artists move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see the original Detroiters in a hard spot . They want Detroit to keep its identity and so change is fearsome , but they also realise that what the city needs more than anything is jobs . And so there 's a precarious acceptance of the new wave pushing in . Tech is being welcomed in , as long as it does n't overstep its bounds . But it will . It always does . And I do n't know what the aftermath to that will be . <p> What I found to be most inspiring , though , is the creative response Detroit has had to all of this change . Take , for example , Tyree Guyton 's Heidelberg Project on the East Side , which has been around for 29 years now . It takes found objects , rubble , and abandoned houses and transforms them into something beautiful and inspiring . <p> More from the Heidelberg Project <p> Gabby in front of the MBAD African Bead Museum <p> The same could be said of MBAD African Bead Museum . Not only does this shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most amazing collection of beads I 've ever seen , but it serves as a conduit for the community . There I spoke with a woman named Gabby , of the Detroit Poetry Society , whose greeting for everyone was " Peace , " a sort of mantra she hoped would come true . She talked of the changes she 's seen , and of the importance of finding common ground among all people , which is n't so unlike the goal of Connected States . <p> The area around the MBAD Museum hosts an incredible array of open-air art , similar to the Heidelberg Project , but this is mostly made by the artist Olayami Dabls , who owns the museum as well . It 's at once breathtaking and heartbreaking . <p> Wedding backdrop <p> But Michigan is n't just Detroit . We left the city for Saginaw , a couple hours north , where my friend Sheila , the bride , grew up . I kept my van ( Ashley , " The Beast " ) parked either at her parents beautiful home , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot where some other weddings guests were staying . The wedding was a three-day Bangladeshi affair , but I stayed for five . I think I needed the peace and quiet , and I 'll forever be grateful for the hospitality Sheila 's family showed me . <p> Late night hangs in the van with some of my favourite people in the world . <p> I have to say , taking the van to a wedding is kind of the best . This is the third one I 've brought it to , and aside from the fact that you do n't have to pay for a potentially expensive hotel room , you can park it pretty much wherever you want and set up camp . It ended up being a sweet spot for after-partying , but it served an even more useful purpose . <p> Just before the wedding was set to begin , the sky opened up and the rain came pouring down in buckets . This was just before the groom 's family and friends were supposed to parade to the house and strike a deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dozens of us standing in a field and getting absolutely soaked . So we piled into the van . Not everyone , of course , but we managed to get 14 people in there , including the groom , who stayed dry for the 15 or so minutes before the storm passed . It was clutch . I even broadcast my first Periscope video from the middle of the chaos . <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Saginaw hosted another first for me . The bride 's family had an old Sea-Doo jet ski in the garage , and we busted it out on the small lake there . We tied a rope to the back of it and I pulled my trusty surfboard out of the trunk , a 5 ' 8 ? Rusty DWART made with Varial foam . Making the transition from prone to standing was extremely tricky . You have to get dragged on your belly fast enough so the board starts planing . Then you wedge your back foot against the traction pad , and slide your front knee up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your back hand , so you 're reaching across your body , and use your front hand to stabilise the nose of the board as you pop up . <p> It took about six tries before I got it , but once I did , it was unbelievably satisfying . I 've never gone anywhere near that fast on a surfboard , and the lake was so glassy it was like carving through a mirror . Also , falling really hurts at that speed . I had a good bellyflop dismount and it felt like the entire lake punched me in the gut . <p> Leaving Saginaw , I stopped to get an oil change , and then I just sat there for an hour , unsure of which way to go . This was the first time this trip that I could really pick any direction I wanted . I 'd originally thought I 'd head back through Detroit and spend some time with friends and family in Chicago , but people kept speaking with reverence of the Upper Peninsula ( " the UP " ) of Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Facebook . It was time to see if the social experiment part of this project had any legs . <p> Within half an hour I had almost 50 responses , most of them saying to go north , citing reasons like they have seen Chicago a million times , and they wanted something less explored . I took this all in . I knew there would be better opportunities for tech stories in Detroit and Chicago , but I 'd probably be passing through that way in the early fall anyway ... Screw it , I 'm going north ! <p> @brentrose Traverse City Film Festival @TCFF this weekend . Lots of interesting people are usually in town for that including @MMFlint . <p> A gentleman named Nick pointed me toward the Traverse City Film Festival , which is Michael Moore 's baby . I got word that the opening night party would be that night , so I quickly reached out to them , said I was with Gizmodo , and could I have press credentials . Five minutes later I was set and driving thataway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abomination of a " Manhattan " <p> Nick did n't live in TC , but he had a friend there named Brett who he linked me up with . Brett recommended I check out the Park Place Hotel which would provide a view of the whole town . It was beautiful up there , but I ordered a Manhattan and it was served on the rocks , so the whole place should probably be burnt to the ground . I did meet a lovely woman named Wendy who was there with her whole family . She 'd lived in Traverse City most of her life , and made me feel very welcome . <p> Jen Mackey and Northern Natural <p> From there , Brett advised me to check out the Northern Natural Cider House . I 'll be damned if it was n't the best cider I 've ever had in my life . It was so perfectly balanced and it did n't have any of that cloying sweetness . The lavender and elderberry were especially good . Really nice and dry . I spoke to Jen Mackey who runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was drinking cider ) , who told me all about their organic process . I highly recommend quaffing it out if you can find it . <p> These people randomly came up to me and insisted on taking a photo together . <p> From there I found the the Traverse City Film Festival party . An open-air deal that took over two city blocks . It was there that I finally met Brett , who was there with his friends . We gorged on the local foods on offer , which were absolutely amazing . The whole food scene in Traverse City is insane . I 've never seen a U.S. town so small with so much good grub . Definitely a foodie haven . We spend the rest of the party listening to the lyrical stylings of Rick Chyme , which I really enjoyed . <p> Rick Chyme on the mic <p> It turned out that Brett 's girlfriend Holly is good friends with Jen of Northern Natural , so we ended up after-partying in the closed-up pub . The after-after party was in the van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging as I made maple old fashioneds and sazeracs . <p> In the morning , Brett came through and showed me the project he 's been working on , a book for the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl . The foreword was by Dwight Clark , so I was sold . I flipped through the book and said I 'd get one for my dad for Christmas , which is true . You can check it out here . Plug alert over . <p> Holly at the Northern Natural Cider House <p> Basically , I could n't imagine a better beginning to the social experiment element of this trip . The very first try found me good people , good food , good cider , and good times in a place I would n't have known about otherwise . Truly incredible . <p> Today I 'll be continuing north to the Upper Peninsula . Maybe to Pictured Rocks , which I hear is incredible .

@@4758238 <h> This 1-minute visualisation on space junk reveals a serious problem <p> Right now , more than half a million pieces of man-made space junk orbit Earth , and if we do n't ' put a stop to the ever-growing clutter , it could become too dangerous for manned travel to space . <p> Our beautiful planet was n't always like this . The overwhelming amount of space junk did n't start until after humans cracked the code on spaceflight and began sending satellites into orbit in the late ' 50s . <p> Stuart Grey , a lecturer at the University College London and a member of the Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory , tells the story of how it all began in this 1-minute visualisation below : <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> Space junk accumulates because we do n't clean up after ourselves . Instead of returning defunct satellites , we usually leave them out in space . But out there , they run the risk of colliding with meteors or other human-made debris , which is travelling at blazing speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour . <p> A single collision will completely obliterate a satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you can imagine , this only exacerbates the problem because , after these collisions , the junk does n't simply go flying off into space . Instead , Earth 's gravity traps it in nearby orbits , which is rapidly cluttering up our path to space . <p> And if that path gets too crowded , it might be too dangerous to send anything into space , ever again , because the chances of a collision would be too great . It would be like sending a soldier through a mine field . <p> But if we 're going to do anything about this problem , then we better do it fast , Kessler said earlier this year . <p> " We 're at what we call a ' critical density ' -- where there are enough large objects in space that they will collide with one another and create small debris faster than it can be removed , " Kessler told Marketplace in September . 
@@4758239 <p> " Yes ! " I enthuse , " one that 's attached to a tattoo parlour or something . " <p> Advertisement <p> We laugh . Our complete absence of cool , and warm embrace of uncool , has been a long-standing joke between us over our 32-year friendship , perhaps reaching its apotheosis when we texted each other one Saturday night to find that we were both not just at home , but ironing . We vowed never to tell anyone about that either . <p> The truth is that , on this warm Sunday morning , we were making our way into the Melbourne Exhibition Centre for -- excuse me , I just need to fill up my wine glass . <p> Right . <p> It was for ... a craft show . <p> Clare and I are -- how can I put this ? -- crafters . Yes , we like crafting . <p> And seeing as we 're confessing , I might as well go the whole hog . We particularly like cross-stitch . For the benefit of anyone under 160 , cross-stitch is those tiny , neat stitches on patches of linen , with holes so small you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them . <p> Cross-stitch comes in kits that instruct you how to make particular designs , often leaning towards cheesy exaltations such as " friends are flowers that bloom forever ! " or " love lives here " . We do not like those . Ours tend to be landscapes , or designs for children 's bedrooms , or floral arrangements : Clare made a gorgeous one of elephants walking in the moonlight ; I stitched a pair of Japanese ladies in kimonos under blossom trees . <p> I came across sewing when I was at university , discovering that its tedium was in fact deeply therapeutic . I find it hard to sit still for long periods of time , so having something to do that was engaging yet relaxing was a salve to exam or essay stress . I have made bookmarks for friends and number or letter charts for their children . A stitched rendition of my grandparents ' favourite flower , the pansy , sitting in a round , white bowl , brought my nanna to tears , and I like to think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thrill as cooking for people , even though I am not particularly talented at either , in choosing a design suited to someone , then spending hour upon hour bringing it to life , framing it , and watching their faces when they unwrapped it . <p> As a hobby , sewing runs right up to the zeitgeist and slaps it in the face . It is time-consuming and labour-intensive . Snapchat it ai n't . <p> But as someone who writes for a living , I 've always had a longing to be able to create things , to see some tangible , practical reward for my labours . How wonderful it would be to be able to make a chair or a table , or bags or clothes . <p> Ah , yes , to really be able to sew , to whip up a skirt or a dress or a doona cover at a moment 's notice , to create something from a simple piece of fabric . <p> As we made our way along the neat rows of the craft exhibition , displaying everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two are by no means mutually exclusive -- I had an idea to up the ante . <p> " Hey , why do n't we learn to sew on a sewing machine early in the summer , and handmake all our Christmas presents ? " I said , and honestly , I was stone , cold sober . <p> Clare thought for a moment and said " You know , I 'd love to learn to sew . I have my mum 's old sewing machine and no idea how to use it . " <p> Actual sewing is , of course , far less daggy than cross-stitch , and in recent years it has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity , thanks largely to hipsters . On the crafting scale of cool , it is probably second only to knitting ( due to a few A-list celebrities with clicking sticks ) , but ahead of patchwork and way , way ahead of scrapbooking , which is to crafting what a weak skinny cappuccino is to coffee appreciation . <p> So we enrolled in a 10-week sewing course , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady called Pam , a neat , bespectacled middle-aged woman who called everyone " love " and had a fractious relationship with a little white dog she tried to confine to the back of the house . <p> We kicked off by making a pair of pyjama pants which , under Pam 's hand-on tutelage , was reasonably easy . <p> " How are you going there , love , have you managed to thread the needle ? " she would ask , without a trace of sarcasm . <p> " Ok , love , it looks like you 've sewn your cuff into the waistband there . Let me just take a look . " <p> Clare and I took to sewing in the way that has become so familiar over the decades : she was neat , meticulous , careful . I was impatient and bullish , ready to move from the pyjama pants to whipping up a ball gown , then crash into bitter disappointment when it did n't work out . <p> It reminded me of the time she and I went on a week-long trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasailing , after years of having my hopes dashed by inclement weather at various holiday locations . <p> Clare went first , drifting into the sky , taking in the glorious view and then , after about 15 minutes , landing gracefully on a spot on the beach no bigger than a 10-cent piece , taking a few balletic steps , then drinking in the applause of the impressed locals . <p> I went next , shoved awkwardly into a harness so that I was arching back uncomfortably , wanting to come down again after only about three minutes . Finally , the descent started and , still arched into a back-to-front " C " , I crash-landed on the beach with all the grace of a drunken albatross , my knees banging into the sand followed by my chest and face . <p> Clare laughed about it for some time afterwards . <p> And here we were again , a pair of beginners with a mildly competitive streak , ready to move from pyjamas to A-line skirt and then , dear god , a project of our choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was way above my skill level , harbouring ambitions to use it as the linchpin of an entire handmade summer wardrobe , before perhaps launching a global line . <p> Pam did her best , trying to teach me without actually doing it herself . By the time we finished our course , I still needed to connect the skirt to the bodice , trim and overlock the edges and generally tart up the whole thing . <p> The Christmas present idea was going to need time , so Clare and I arranged for a series of sewing workshops at my house in the already-stifling December heat to get the work done . <p> I was a woman possessed . I cranked up the aircon and made tote bags , another skirt , pyjama pants for family members and cushion covers . That is to say , I bought six cushions and enough material to make six cushion covers , but in fact I only made one , being brought unstuck by trying to install a zip and not having Pam there to just take a look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it was hideous , and sat lopsidedly on my waist , but I had put so much time and energy into it that I was determined to wear the bloody thing to our Christmas lunch with family friends . The material was a deep pink and black , Japanese-style floral print which , in an ankle-length dress , was way too much colour and movement . In an ill-fitting ankle-length dress , even more so . <p> " So , " one of our friends asked as I hoed into the nibbles in the courtyard . " Did you make it yourself ? " <p> " Yes , I did . " <p> " Oh , " she replied kindly , just stopping short of adding " I 'm sorry " . <p> The next week , seeing my creation clearly , I cut up the dress and turned it into a knee-length skirt , which I wore very happily for years afterwards . <p> That summer , the sewing tapered off bit by bit , my enthusiasm eroding with every 40-degree day . <p> I thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making bedding and play clothes and other charming things for my daughter . It never happened . <p> I did , though , begin a wildly ambitious cross-stitch of the alphabet adorned in Beatrix Potter characters , of which I stitched about four before running out of time and interest . <p> One day I may go back and finish it for her , but I suspect I will not . Toddlers are even more labour-intensive and time-consuming than cross-stitch . <p> But if I can think of a way to make a V , W , X and Y into an A-line skirt , I 'll get right on it .

Its first project , the House of Amstel hotel , was followed by more high-profile design appointments , including SLA salad bar outlets , the Americano Bar &amp; Kitchen , and the Amsterdam outpost of London 's ultra-stylish Hoxton hotel group LINK . In addition , the couple have put their stamp on interiors for menswear outlet No Label , a nightclub and several private homes . <p> " We 've developed a strong mutual vision ; it 's amazing how we complement each other , " says Urbanus .

Like many of the grand houses in the historical centre , the property , built in 1745 , is decoratively corniced and gabled , but when Urbanus and Roll first saw it , the interior needed serious work .

@@4773234 <p> Weekend penalty rates are under attack , which raises questions about fairness and how Australian society is evolving . <p> But first , what is this rather strange construct , the weekend ? <p> The week , which unlike most measurements of time - such as day , month and year - has nothing to do with astronomical movements . <p> Its origins are uncertain . It may owe something to Babylonian belief in the magic powers of the figure seven and certainly is connected to the Jewish Sabbath . <p> But it 's essentially a convenience , and one that is n't always consistent . The French Revolutionary calendar had a 10-day week , with one day off for leisure . And even today we ca n't decide whether the week starts on Sunday or Monday . <p> The weekend , originally hyphenated , arises partly from religious holidays ( initially holy days ) . In its modern two-day form it 's a by-product of the industrial revolution and incorporates Jewish and Christian sabbatarian traditions . <p> Many Muslim countries keep the notion , but change the days - either Thursday and Friday , or Friday and Saturday . <p> Religious observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the day particularly in the Productivity Commission 's cross hairs . <p> But there was also a secular , which is a polite way of saying it was a day for roistering , side to it . <p> Furthermore , there was a strain of religious thought , perhaps strongest in the US , which did n't like a day of leisure because satan exploited idleness . <p> In Australia , a penalty rate for working " unsocial " Sunday hours was first set in 1919 , with a lesser rate set later for Saturdays . <p> In the years following World War II most retail businesses opened on Saturday mornings , but from lunchtime on the shopping centres were dead . Much , though not all , sport was played on Saturday afternoons . Even cricket Tests had Sunday as a rest day . <p> No single event changed this . <p> As disposable income rose , as youth became more demanding , as church attendance dropped , more people looked for more things to do and , inevitably in a market economy , things were provided - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-day multiplexes and an explosion of restaurants , bars and coffee shops ( would anyone 20 years ago have known what a barista is ? ) . <p> And , of course , more people were needed to supply the services and take the money . And those people had to be paid what the hospitality industry regards as punitive penalty rates . <p> The consumer-is-king argument is simple - cut the rates and you 'll get more services at a better price . <p> The subsidiary argument is that such rates are anachronistic in a seven-day economy . <p> But that is n't truly so . How many banks or insurance companies or legal firms are open on Sundays ? How many government offices ? <p> By and large white collar professionals are not affected .

@@4773238 <h> Facebook 's Carolyn Everson on the importance of ' hard conversations ' <p> These days , Carolyn Everson runs global marketing for Facebook . Long ago , she tried to get MTV to buy the company . Now she 's part of an empire that includes Instagram , WhatApp , and Oculus Rift.Nicholas Carlson , editor-in-chief of INSIDER sat down with Everson at IGNITION 2015 , where they talked about the future of Facebook 's various businesses . <p> ( Edited for clarity and length ) <p> Nicholas Carlson : Facebook is a " tweenageer " it 's almost 12 years old basically . That 's crazy ! <p> Carlson : I wanted to go a little bit through the things that are Facebook beyond Facebook .... What 's the latest with Instagram ? Where are we now ? <p> Everson : This has been a big year for Instagram . As of September , we rolled out Instagram ads globally . From a consumer standpoint , it has over 400 million people using the platform . It 's growing faster than any other mobile social platform that is out there . It is beloved by consumers and they 're really using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . Consumers go to Instagram for visual inspiration . They follow a lot of people that they do n't know . Fifty per cent of them -- almost 50% -- are connected to businesses and from an advertising stand point , the marketing community has been very eager for us to open up Instagram as a platform that they can use . If you take Instagram and Facebook , you have the two most important mobile app platforms in the world . And so , heading into this holiday season , it was really important that , not only do we make Instagram available globally , but that we actually took the back end of the ad infrastructure for Facebook . So all of the targeting capabilities the measurement , the self-serve , APIs -- so that we could actually really scale the platform . And we 've been really excited with it . So this was a big year for Instagram . <p> Carlson : What 's working on Instagram that you would n't see on Facebook ? <p> Everson : Well what 's interesting is Instagram started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things that would be maybe the initial kickstart of a campaign that then you would follow through on Facebook . What we 're seeing now is a variety of business objectives being served well on Instagram . We launched all of our direct response objectives , you can click to learn more , shop now , install an app -- and those are doing very , very well .... The key is actually figuring out how to get the right ad -- the most relevant ad -- to the right person at the right time . And really that comes down to people-based marketing . And so taking advantage of the Facebook back end , where we have the data of who people are , applying that to Instagram is allowing us to serve much more relevant ads in the Instagram environment . But it 's no longer just quote a " brand environment , " it 's something that 's serving across all business objectives . <p> BI <p> Carlson : Instagram was sort of a separate business with its own sales and business solutions . Now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why did that happen ? <p> Everson : So Instagram actually has always been covered by the same team . You know , the team that I lead around the world and that my colleague leads on the small business side . So that has been the same from the very beginning . <p> What we did do with Instagram initially is we do have some people around the world -- a couple of dozen -- that are are called " brand development leads . " And they sit on my team , and they are Instagram specialists , if you will . They help the market understand what the possibilities are on Instagram , and the deeper insights around what the audience does . But the actual team -- the sales and marketing team across the globe -- actually services both Facebook and Instagram . And that 's been working very well . <p> You know , when Mark acquires companies -- and Instagram was the first big company that he had acquired since I been there for almost five years -- each internal team needs to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for us , Kevin Systrom really needed to see how all of the different functions worked at Facebook . And now , the Instagram team takes advantage of the core ads , and for infrastructure for Facebook . They take advantage of the network infrastructure , and of course , the sales and marketing . So it 's a really great way for us to go to the market , because the agencies and marketers do n't need multiple people talking to them : one about Facebook , one about Instagram . Nobody has the time . They 're looking to actually talk to fewer people that can solve their business objectives . And so , my team really needs to be consultants and business advisors -- not about selling Facebook one minute or Instagram the next minute -- that 's not what it 's about . It 's : What is the business problem we 're trying to solve for the client ? Does Facebook make sense ? Does Instagram ? Or both ? <p> Carlson : OK . So it 's interesting you say you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WhatsApp famously is like " we 're never doing ads ! " And I 've heard you say WhatsApp does n't have ads yet . Do you hope someday to get your team working with them ? Is that something that 's ever going to happen ? <p> Everson : So we 've followed a similar formula with all of our platforms . First and foremost , it 's about getting consumers to utilise the platform . Right . That 's what we did on Facebook , and then we rolled out the monetisation strategy . It 's what we 've done on Instagram , and now we 're on the monetisation phase . <p> Messenger is really the next place that we are testing monetisation models and bringing that to life for marketers . So Messenger now has 700 million people using it . It 's an incredible success story . It was embedded into the Facebook core app just over a year ago , and now it 's a stand alone . And it 's growing tremendously . We 're testing with Zulily and Everlane and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and businesses . So , for example , if I buy something on Everlane -- I can get the notification via Messenger . I can change the order . If I order a black shirt , I can say , via Messenger , " Gee , I should have bought a red one . Can you add that to my order ? " So it 's a really interesting new way for consumers to communicate with businesses . So Messenger will be the place , first and foremost , that we test these new models out . <p> Carlson : So you talked a little bit about that before -- and I do n't entirely get it . Walk me through , why is it better than sending an email or calling or texting a brand or something like that ? Explain to me the business . <p> Carolyn Everson/Facebook <p> Everson : Sure . So if you think about email -- all , most that occurs in email today -- you get your confirmation of your order , you get your shipping confirmation . And what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . It 's getting lost in the barrage of email . On top of that , you have the young consumer behaviour . Particularly , the younger millennials that are actually not utilising email the same way that those of us are in our 40s are using email . And so , what they 're using , they 're using much more of a messaging type service . And the expectation is that if you communicate with a business , that they will actually respond . And so , yesterday we announced that we have 5o million business pages now on Facebook . The last time we made the announcement , it was 45 million . It 's growing very nicely . But there are 2.5 billion messages occurring per-month between consumers and businesses . This is the new expectation of consumers . So when you send a shipping confirmation via email that gets lost , that is a very different consumer experience than a shipping confirmation via Messenger , and oh ! If you want to change the address , or if you want to add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the consumer expectation is . So I think you 're going to see a major shift in how people in businesses communicate . <p> Carlson : That is amazing . If you could privatize email , that would be very valuable indeed . Alright so next . Next , lets talk about the next entrepreneur -- Oculus . Is that a group that you work with eventually ? How do you get marketing into VR which we do n't even have yet ? I mean what is the process there ? <p> Everson : Well ... <p> Carlson : Do you even think about Oculus ? <p> Everson : We get asked about Oculus all the time . Because marketers , understandably , want to understand what the new opportunities are , and make sure they are getting ahead of it . Right now , with Oculus , we 're really focused on actually just getting the consumer product out the door . <p> Right now , with Oculus , we 're really focused on actually just getting the consumer product out the door . <p> We have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device . In early 2016 , we 'll have the the Rift , which is phenomenal . And if you have n't tried Oculus -- I do n't know if you have ? You have . It 's just transformational , I mean it is going to change every way we interact -- be it entertainment or with healthcare or education or travel . I 'm really excited about it . But it 's really too early to actually be thinking about marketing and Oculus . It 's one of those things , you know , look at how the first few years of actually selling smart phones took a while . For now , we have the explosion -- where it 's actually more mobile connections than there are people . But Oculus is in its early days . <p> Carlson : Am I reading too much into Facebook 360 ? Which is the video where you can click and drag around ... sort of a pre-cursor to Facebook being on VR ... ? Maybe I 've got it wrong ? <p> Everson : No , no you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we use Facebook now -- we serve up memories , every day . If you actually posted on that day the year prior , a few years prior ... it 's a really interesting thing to look at . Because if you 've been on Facebook for a number of years , back in 2010 , 2011 , it was text . It was : " I 'm going to be interviewed by Nich today at Business Insider . " That would have been my update . Then over the last couple of years , maybe there would be a photo of us . And then a video , which is still incredibly dominant now . We have over 8 million video views today and growing exponentially . <p> But the 360 videos a step up that ladder a more immersive experience . And we have been really pleased with the adoption . " Star Wars " was the first marketer to take advantage of it for the release of their film coming up . I mean , " Star Wars " was one of the top two topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even launched yet . It 's going to be quite , quite something . The 360 video is just a step up to say the more immersive experiences we can bring consumers and brands the better it 's going to be . So it 's a little bit of a precursor . <p> Carlson : So just explain what 360 is . It 's like a video that you can kind of change where the camera is pointed ? <p> Everson : Yes . If you just take your phone , and then you get one served up , and you start to move your phone -- literally -- you will experience all of the different angles and it 's just a phenomenal way to shoot . When it first launched ... Bob Woodruff had just shot a video of from Korea that we never would have been able to experience what it was like to be on the ground with the military the way he was able to shoot that video . And same thing with " Star Wars . " So , more immersive , more interactive experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> One of the ad units that we have that is becoming incredibly popular through this holiday season is Canvas -- which we released and gave a little bit of a glimpse at Canes this year , in June . And now is actually out in the market . But it 's a really immersive way to show dynamically more content and have consumers be able to click in and purchase something more directly . And I just think you 're going to see us really explore what the creative Canvas possibilities are . It is definitely not just that little box . Mobile is , I think is , the most exciting and dynamic , creative canvas that we 've had in a long time . <p> Carlson : I 'm realising I 've let you off the hook with whatsapp . So it 's just Facebook Messenger for now , but ? <p> Everson : Whatsapp is at 900 million people . Jan clearly is aware of what we are doing on the advertising and marketing side , but he is very focused on the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . You 're on the -- look at what we did with Facebook Messenger , Jan . Do n't you want these resources ? Do n't you want this revenue ? Alright . Aquila the unmanned flyer . We 're going progressively further away from things that make immediate sense to me . So Facebook has this giant solar powered winged craft . They built this . In a warehouse . And launched it and it 's going to fly over Africa ... or ? <p> Everson : You have most of it right there , it 's pretty good . So if you have the connectivity problem . Right . Start with the mission of Facebook . The mission of Facebook is to connect the world . Well only 40% of the world is connected . So you 've got over 4 billion people that are still not connected . <p> You 've got over 4 billion people that are still not connected . <p> And there 's not going to be one magic answer that solves that problem universally . Their two big problems are awareness -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what it is . And cost . <p> And so we have a number of different strategies to try to help that situation . One of which is an unmanned aircraft vehicle named Aquila , which is the Latin word for eagle . It has the wing span of a 737 , it weighs pretty much like a Toyota Prius , it flies between 60- and 90,000 feet -- so it 's above commercial airspace -- it 's powered by the sun , and it beams connectivity 11 miles away -- which is like to the size of a dime . And it can stay up for three months . The reason why this is so exciting is because we had not a single aerospace engineer working at Facebook two years ago -- not even 18 months ago -- and Mark realised that not only satellites are going to be important -- we are doing a satellite for sub-Saharan Africa -- but also an unmanned vehicle was going to be key to get to some of the remote areas . And this is an example of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actual record for an unmanned aircraft vehicle staying up is two weeks , but that was just not acceptable to Mark . So he 'd tell the team " I 've got to come back with a different plan " and this will break the record if it stays up for 3 months . So we 're really excited about it -- and again -- this team did n't even exist 18 months ago . <p> Carlson : When did you join Facebook ? What year was it ? <p> Everson : It will be five years in February . <p> Carlson : So five years ago , were you like : " In five years we 're gon na be talking about aerospace engineers . " <p> Everson : I never , ever . I mean if I -- if I just think about -- we did n't have Instagram , we did n't have whatsapp , Messenger was n't a standalone , we had no ad tech assets , we had no unmanned aircraft vehicles , we had no Oculus . There has been a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mission is to connect the world and give people the power to share and discover . And every one of those initiatives does that . <p> Carlson : I do have to interject with one thing -- " oh you know we did n't have aerospace engineers before and now we do . " I think now ... ehhh ... it 's Facebook . It would be ok if you did n't have any . But it 's great ! It 's very exciting ! Phew ! Finally this app has aerospace engineers . Good ! <p> Everson : Well if you 're an aerospace engineer you can come work at Facebook now ! <p> Carlson : No . You can afford them , it 's good . Try it . OK . Lets talk about some of the people at Facebook . Mark Zuckerberg -- to me , the transformation with Mark Zuckerberg was remarkable . A while ago , I wrote some stories about what he was like as a college student and he was kind of nasty sometimes . Probably a good kid , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45 billion . Just tell me a little bit about the radical change of Mark Zuckerberg . <p> Everson : Before the $45 billion announcement and the birth of Max , I 've said this -- and I believe this wholeheartedly -- that Mark is going to go down as one of the most important business leaders of our generation . <p> Mark is going to go down as one of the most important business leaders of our generation . <p> And to have the privilege of working for him and to see somebody that constantly wants to improve : himself , what we do as a company , never settling for the status quo . Super humble . Working every day . A work ethic that is second to none . An inquisitive personality . Constantly , intellectually curious . You know , he comes up with these annual challenges each year . You know , one year was to meet somebody new every single day . This year , is the year of books , and he 's been doing that . He just -- <p> Carlson : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight to Save Yahoo ! ? <p> Everson : I do n't know if that 's in his like ... in his repertoire ... <p> Carlson : It 's great ! I know the author ! <p> Everson : But I will ... I will definitely make sure to share that feedback with him . So , Mark is like a really incredible person to work for . Then you add the element that I 've been so excited for , as a mum of twin daughters , to get to see him and Priscilla get ready for the birth of their daughter . And to see what he just did.Now he 'll probably just go down as one of the greatest humanitarians . And -- in addition to being one of the best business leaders in the world . And he 's not even 32 . It 's really humbling . And every time that I show up each day at work and I work with my team and we think about what our goals are and how much we should be thinking about the business I always think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because look at what he 's dreaming about . He 's dreaming about a world that , literally , everyone has the opportunity to be connected to the Internet . He 's dreaming of the world where people have a voice . He 's dreaming of a world where we 're disease free -- in 10 to 15 years . I mean he 's just a remarkable person to work for . I ca n't describe it . The only thing I can tell you is that he makes us better every day because you ca n't help but look in the mirror and say : " I 've got ta improve because that 's who I 'm working for . " <p> Carlson : Every time I go out to San Francisco and talk to people in the industry -- they 're always saying : " Sheryl 's bored and she 's gon na run for Senate " or " She 's gon na be Hilary Clinton 's vice president or secretary of state " . Do you think she 's bored and done with Facebook ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge business . And she did it . And she can do other things . Or , what 's the deal ? <p> Everson : I think Sheryl is more committed to our mission , and more committed to our business than I 've ever seen her . I also think Sheryl can do anything she wants to do because she 's an extraordinary leader and a person . But I will tell you -- she has found connection to our mission this year through tragedy -- a very personal tragedy to her that 's very meaningful . She has found connection to the mission through giving women voice and seeing groups emerge in very , very oppressed communities that suddenly look to Facebook and have a voice . She 's incredibly active in the business day-to-day and so , you know , it is certainly my personal hope that she stays with us as long as possible . She can do anything she wants , but she 's very happy at Facebook . <p> Carlson : You talk about " hard conversations " at Facebook . Where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean ? <p> Everson : So , if you were to drive into Facebook headquarters , we have the sign and it has a sort of " like " button . You expect that -- that 's , that 's the sign . What most people do n't know is that if you peak behind the sign , there 's a Sun Microsystems sign still there . And , so why is that ? It is because we moved into Sun 's space . And it 's a reminder to every employee -- as you leave that campus every day -- to never be complacent <p> If you peak behind the sign , there 's a Sun Microsystems sign still there . And , so why is that ? It is because we moved into Sun 's space . And it 's a reminder to every employee -- as you leave that campus every day -- to never be complacent . <p> ..... Even if the business is going well , that we never actually have things completely figured out . So there 's this deep rooted part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past , did n't fail because they woke up on some Tuesday morning and said , " oh wow ! This digital or mobile thing -- this is big ! Wow ! We 're out of business tomorrow ! " It took time . Right . Things started to unfold . People were n't willing to have tough conversations . They thought it was too political , they thought it was career limiting , it was n't my problem it was someone else 's team not doing their job . And there are some great companies that have just completely vanished . They are no longer relevant and we do n't want to be . <p> We do n't want to be in that situation . And so , we use these things called " hard conversations " which is we ask people to have hard conversations with . And then we check in on how often are you having them ? So it is totally common , you know , like every time I see Sheryl she 'll be like : " So what 's the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to know what have I raised with a peer , someone I 'm working with , ca lient , whatever it might be . What are the hard conversations we 're having day-in and day-out ? <p> She gave me a hard conversation recently -- about 6 months ago -- I 'd been working on this thing that I 'm very passionate about at Facebook which is called Fuel . And it 's the notion of really making Facebook a sustainable place to work that can also deliver high performance and results . And I 'm so close to it , that she said a couple of people were having trouble giving me feedback about it because they were afraid of insulting me .
