A great chunk of the federal budget goes to military and defense . It has been the same old story this year . The defense budget was raised by 17 per cent in the annual federal budget under the pretext of ongoing war against militants while the spending on education is less than 3 per cent . According to a recent report by Sharmila Farooqui , advisor to Sindh Chief Minister , 6.5 million children in Pakistan are deprived of education . Seventy-two per cent children leave school at fifth level or primary while 28 per cent quit before primary . <p> In the wake of such dismal figures each time the news of parliamentarians ' holding a fake degree surfaces , it pushes us deeper into the abyss of hopelessness . Above all the audacity of Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Aslam Raisani was shockingly sad when he blurted , " A degree is a degree .

Unfortunately , Pakistan 's political arena has become a great circus with the political elite making a mockery of the educational system and ethics . The essence of education is to accumulate knowledge , skills and values . True education is one which nourishes a person intellectually , physically and emotionally . It helps building the discerning and analytical abilities so that people could think and decide for themselves . <p> The acquisition of fake degree is n't a new phenomenon in Pakistan . People buy themselves degrees , take up government jobs and successfully get away with the fake credentials literally for their entire lives . The young and old politicians resorted to acquiring fake degrees when the former President General Pervez Musharraf passed the law in 2002 , which required all candidates contesting for office to hold bachelor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this law was the inclusion of educated MPs into the political stream . That law , however , was repealed in April 2008 two months after the February election of that year . <p> One wonders , if the law of having a bachelor 's degree was enforced when the elections were held in February 2008 , why did the Election Commission of Pakistan not scrutinize the application of the candidate along with the supporting documents thoroughly ? Why the Higher Education Commission failed to tighten the grip on the issuance of fake degrees through different channels ? <p> The verification process of HEC is totally dependable on the university that issues the degree . In my experience , they verify two things : first , whether the degree awarding university is accredited and secondly , whether that person 's record is present in the examination section of the university concerned . A few years back HEC had taken a commendable step by making public the list of accredited universities . It helped prospective students a great deal to stay away from those institutions that were n't recognized by HEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examination system transparent . <p> Post 9/11 Pakistan 's educational system has been under the spotlight . Many analysts , in the US , link low spending on public education with growing extremism . Religious seminaries are multiplying , while public schools are deteriorating . Under the Kerry-Lugar Bill in 2010 the US plans to spend $200 million on education in Pakistan . But the question is whether this aid will reach and benefit the masses ? Will this aid help revamp Pakistan 's educational system -- a fair and unified medium of education for all ? <p> Talking about the broader picture , these politicians with their fake degrees have set a very bad example . How can an ordinary citizen applying to foreign universities be trusted in terms of qualification and degrees when many of our legislators hold fake ones ?

" We 've been studying an area of 11,000 hectares ( 27,000 acres ) for 17 years , and of late the population is dropping 7 percent each year .

But little is being done to stop it . <p> Less than five agents are tasked with protecting wildlife in a jungle region covering the western two-thirds of Amazonas state , which is more than twice the size of Texas , according to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources ( Ibama ) , the enforcement arm of the Environment Ministry . <p> " It 's a matter of priority , and right now the government is focusing on deforestation , " said Ibama 's Andrey Silva .

Some 884 tons of the fish came from Brazil in 2007 , according to the Colombian Institute for Rural Development . That jumped to 1,430 tons in 2008 and spiked to 2,153 tons in 2009 . <p> Simple economics exacerbates the problem : Killing dolphins is free , and their meat is valuable . Using the flesh from one carcass , fishermen can catch up to 1,100 pounds ( 500 kilograms ) of piracatinga . According to da Silva and other researchers , they can sell the catfish for 50 cents per kilogram , translating into $550 for just a few nights ' work -- about double Brazil 's monthly minimum wage . <p> " It 's attracting a lot of poor people to this region to kill the dolphins and make easy money , " said Antonio Miguel Migueis , a dolphin researcher with the Federal University of Western Para since 2005 . <p> So far it 's impossible to quantify the exact impact fisherman are having on the river dolphins -- little research has been done to study the killings or even the overall population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that waiting for exhaustive studies could mean the dolphin population would be irreversibly devastated by the time the work is complete . <p> " This is most definitely a threat to the future of this river dolphin species , " said Alison Wood , with the England-based Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society . " This is a relatively new threat , but clearly an extremely serious one . " <p> Migueis said he warned Ibama and other authorities numerous times about the dolphin slaughter , but his reports fell on deaf ears . <p> Growing up to 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) long and weighing as much as 400 pounds ( 180 kilograms ) , Amazon river dolphins are the largest of four species known to exist in South America and Asia . <p> Their genetic siblings have already died off elsewhere : The Yangzte river dolphin in China was declared functionally extinct in 2006 , the victim of pollution , overfishing and increased boat traffic . <p> Meanwhile , the International Union of Conservation of Nature lists the Ganges river dolphin in India as endangered , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe river dolphins likely arrived in the Amazon during the Middle Miocene era 16 million years ago , when ocean levels were high around the world , and the sea inundated what is now lush rain forest . <p> For centuries they have been revered by locals and protected by myth . According to one tale , the dolphins transform into handsome men and leave the water at night , seducing and impregnating local women before returning to the river . Many simply consider it bad luck to kill them , given their supposed magical attributes . <p> But today , the quick payoff is trumping legend and superstition . <p> " Killing the dolphins is a fast and easy way for the fisherman to make money . It costs nothing but time , " Vera da Silva said . " It 's ugly because these dolphins have a folkloric value in the Amazon , and all that is disappearing for the sake of using them as bait . "

@@4516236 <p> KARACHI : The prime minister has used his discretion to provide a bailout package for Pakistan Steel Mills ( PSM ) worth Rs25 billion . The idea of a bailout package is that the company is given some money to keep it afloat while the problems that landed it in its current financial mess are dealt with . <p> Most importantly these remedial measures must precede the delivery of the package otherwise it is just more lambs for the slaughter . <p> To avoid taxpayer money being embezzled , the management structure needs to be changed and strict regulatory controls need to be incorporated .

This loss is being conveniently shifted to " global crunch , so as to secure a clean chit on one hand and justify approval of Rs8 billion loans from National Bank and a running facility of Rs2 billion announced by the PM . Moeen Aftab was appointed as Chairman of PSM by the present government in May 2008 to " achieve optimum level of production and making Pakistan Steel cost effective " . What he did was to extend to Abbas Steel Group exclusive rights to all the production coming out of the factory at reduced and discounted prices . PSM is the largest and only large scale blast furnace in the country having a monopoly in raw materials of steel industry . The product that is at the centre of controversy is called low carbon steel billets , with a carbon deposit of 0.10 per cent or lower , and an international classification of SAE1008 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give the steel malleability and ductility to be shaped into wire rods that can be used to make end products such as screws , nails , buckles , fan covers and welding rods . <p> In June 2008 , there was an unusual rise in the amount of steel allocated and set aside for ASG , which by October November 2008 it peaked to almost 100 per cent of the total produce . PSM decreased its production of high carbon steel to cater to ASG requirements , which added to its losses . <p> Data compiled by the Competition Commission of Pakistan verify these facts and even the Transparency International is on record to complain of these irregularities . Pakistan Steel Re Rolling Mills Association also objected to these irregularities . Drastic reduction in prices of billets were made from Rs63,000 per ton to Rs41,000 per ton . <p> Instead of making amends , PSM sold its entire stock of 4,500 tons to ASG on the night of 9-10 Feb at below cost price resulting in an enormous loss of Rs34,000 per ton to the mill . Numerous reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural advantages , and an example quoted in the investigative period is of November 2008 , when a tender contract was awarded to Abbas Steel Group for 4,000 M/Tons of Billets valuing at over Rs 194 million , which included an extra ordinary interest-free credit facility of Rs 76 million for 90 days on November 25 , 2008 , even before the ASG completed any proper registration procedures . <p> Other than that , the Steel Mill did not await the proper clearance of the security deposits submitted by ASG on November 27 ; their checks were cleared on the December 3 , 2008 . The steel was shipped out of the factory floor on the 26th of November . Complicating this uncharacteristic " interest-free " policy was the fact that the prices of steel products was also reduced by over 35 per cent of the market price on November 26 , 2008 and 100 per cent of the Pakistan Steel production was handed over to Abbas Steel Group , surely such favouritism helped the group make millions overnight . <p> The scarcity of low-carbon steel in the market being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price fluctuating anywhere from Rs5,000 ' on ' to even a reported premium of around Rs100,000 over and above the market price . <p> This was an advantage that Abbas Steel exploited to make millions . <p> This is taxpayer money that the PM has put at the disposal of almost the same management , the same vendors and privileged contractors , who were responsible for the robbery in the first instance . <h> Reader Comments ( 3 ) <p> There is somthing fishy how easily scores of Billions are doled out to these incompetent organisations.everage pakistani hardly gets an benifit from these organisations ( few thousands travel on PIA , there are even better travel alternatives than PIA , same is the case with railway and steel mill ) , still rulers prefer to waste and spend these multi-billions , rather than spendind on health and education of hapless pakistanis , somthing is very , very wrong.Recommend 
@@4516237 <h> Ethical dilemma of academics <p> The recent commotion of parliamentarians having fake degrees is a horrendous scenario compromising every ethical standard in the academia field and it is quite a relief to see many politicians taken to task for that . The idea behind this article is to highlight another area , towards which we 've almost turned a blind eye : plagiarism . <p> What prompted a post is a book for sociology referred to CSS students in a local academy here in Multan . The book is ' written ' by Mr. Javed Jiskani Baloch , commonly referred to as J.J. Baloch , who is the AIGP forensic division , Sindh Police . While I was preparing for my sociology exam , I mainly read ' Sociology by Horton &amp; Hunt ' ( McGraw Hill Books Company ) and consulted some other books for the Pakistani perspective on different topics ( JJ Baloch being one of them ) . I remembered Horton &amp; Hunt being taught to us in LUMS as well for Intro to Sociology and I must say it 's a very comprehensive book for introductory sociology and of course a ' legitimate ' one . <p> The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JJ Baloch ' and was shocked to find whole sections or parts of sections from chapters of Horton &amp; Hunt 's book literally copy pasted in the relevant chapters written by Mr Baloch . <p> Now this does not mean that he had only duplicated H &amp; H but had used his own , as the book reviews said , ' lucid ' expression as well . Not much effort was required to discover that much of the work by Baloch was paraphrasing and at certain points blatant copy pasting . While doing so , he very conveniently ' forgot ' to cite the work and today his book is out in the market credited to none other but himself . <p> I must admit here that I 've been procrastinating upon writing for a long time and due to my lethargy it took me this much time after my CSS exams to write about this matter . Out of the same laziness , I was least bothered to open up both the books for references for plagiarism , so I randomly opened a page of JJ Baloch 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the same topic in Horton &amp; Hunt and found out the whole page 52 to be paraphrased or at some points just copy pasted from pages 347-349 of H &amp; H. <p> I did n't bother any further as I remembered many such instances while I was preparing for the exam and I 'm sure a lot of such ' instances ' could be found where Mr Baloch and H &amp; H share the exact same ideas in the exact same words . Now that 's what I call the ' similarity of opinion ' . <p> I did n't want this article to be a bashing of the civil servant ( Baloch ) but somehow it can not be helped . I do n't even know the guy ; he might be a very competent police officer as I do n't know anything about his professional life but recognition for writing such a book is not what we want as a precedent against him , certainly Horton &amp; Hunt would not have wanted that . He might have worked hard to consult different books and paraphrased them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our education system , but that 's not ' writing ' . <p> During my , and I 'm sure everyone else 's , course of education , we 've been taught to strictly condemn plagiarism with serious penalties for the offenders . HEC 's policies for plagiarism can be found here . <p> The penalties for students and researchers/teachers are quite severe but I wonder if the severity extends to other government officials as well . And obviously there are a lot of instances where such plagiarism is going on in Pakistan . It was a relief to find out that HEC is now working on the problem and even took action against a departmental head at International Islamic University , Islamabad who was found guilty of plagiarism with his group mates . A small piece on the issue was published here . <p> On a lighter note I would like to quote one of the book reviews of JJ baloch by Khadim Hussain Rind ( ASP 24th common ) : <p> " I have only one thing to tell the aspirants of CSS that is to read this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursory glance over it and hence not in the position to comment on its material . But I am fully convinced that Mr Javed 's book is full of zeal for studies , his spirit for guiding others and his endeavours to facilitate new comers in the field . " <p> I could n't help but let out a chuckle after reading a review of a person who admits that he had n't read the book completely and was somehow in a position to recommend it highly to students , probably because of his ' perception ' of Mr Baloch 's personal aspirations . And the book was full of similar reviews , mostly by his CSS ' comrades ' out on a ' back-scratching spree ' . <p> Like I said before , probably this is not the only instance of plagiarism in Pakistan , and I 'm sure many people would have found this book useful as well but did n't happen to have read other books at the same time and thus could n't find out about the whole story . But there 's another sad side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many CSS academies , which implies that for CSS exam , such a book is an effective tool . <p> Reflection <p> This whole scenario gives us a lot of food for thought . <p> First and foremost is the inefficient education system of Pakistan which does not have effective anti-plagiarism tools . Even if educational institutions could somehow deal with it , other areas of academia fail to do so , like getting your own work published is quite simple , all you need is the money to pay the publisher and contacts with booksellers for the marketing of your work . Checking for plagiarism is hardly the agenda in most of the cases ( except for some renowned publishers ) as most of them neither have the tools nor the motivation to do that . And for people who do n't care about ethics in such cases do not have a problem to begin with . <p> That being said , another shortcoming of the system is the lack of moral training and for that matter , ethical dilemmas like plagiarism and cheating are not hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce results in our system , regardless of respect for knowledge , makes the students and such writers to achieve the ends , with a complete disregard for the means . <p> The mention of the fact that a book like that by Baloch is recommended for CSS students if they want to ' succeed ' in the exams , is reflective of the fact that CSS exam can be ' cracked ' with certain formulas . The criteria for the exams is an absurdly large syllabus shoved into the faces of the candidates which never made any sense to me as civil servants are not even required to have studied so many subjects . <p> The test for knowledge and truly competent people is not the top priority , as most of the people who pass the exams actually ' cram ' piles of books down their throats with virtually no insight on issues of ' real ' importance . The induction of such ' mechanical ' people into the elite bureaucracy then translates itself into the inefficient system that runs our country . This practice is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still calls for people who could actually facilitate the status quo by being ' just another brick in the wall ' . <p> The education system plays a major role in the personality development of people , and a system with all the aforementioned problems is bound to create people with low moral standards . For the same reason , on a cumulative level , these people make up a larger system which turns out to be inept as well , thus hardly producing people willing to deliver for the society . In order for us to even start progressing , we need to lay serious focus on moral issues in academia and set knowledge as a benchmark rather than superficial success and glory . <p> The views expressed by the writer and the reader comments do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of The Express Tribune . <p> aismab <p> lip service to such sensitive issues has enabled ppl like JJ baloch to find an easy path to fame .

I invite attention of all those rich students who hail from big schools and who pay lot of money for their schooling and get quality education to raise the issue of moral ? pparthied " prevailing in our education system : on the one hand rich children are getting quality education in private schools and on the other poor students get poor education in government schools . this is real moral issue to be addressed and far more important than what mr wasiq has tried to highlight after having been in UK where such issues are taught . our society will automatically get rid off Plagarism when we ensure equal schooling for all tom dick and harry . This is great merit of mr baloch who has made his way to success by dint of pure merit and mr. wasiq should appreciate him . mr. wasiq should avoid earning popularity for this as most of the people here do nt even know what is plargarism . Mr jj has tried to save money and time of CSS students as CSS is exam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a research degree ...... and all people do nt have chance and money to compete with people like wasiq who think only of themselves but not of the rest ...... who are not in a position to avail such opportunities ..... so long live JJ Baloch .... we are proud of youRecommend <p> Dr Parissa <p> I agree with Fahad that real issue is ? ducational appartheid in our society . Rich people like wasiq can buy costly books but students like that of JJ Baloch 's background can hardly . so JJ baloch has rendered a great service to the people of his community by compilling his book . He has not claimed any research but has addressed the problems that students in CSS face due to lake of resources , unlike Wasiq ... Cheers JJ ... we appreciate ur services to us.Recommend

Almost 665 km of the pipeline will pass through Balochistan while about 115 km of the pipeline will be laid in Sindh . <p> He said under the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement ( GSPA ) , Pakistan will import 750 million cubic feet per day ( mmcfd ) of gas with a provision to increase it to one billion cubic feet a day ( bcfd ) . <p> The senators suggested that the stakeholders in the pipeline routes must be taken into confidence , majority of which are remote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hospitals and vocational training centres . <p> In response to queries , the MD Interstate Gas Systems said being one of the largest infrastructure projects , the Iran-Pak pipeline will create new job opportunities in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh , thus improving income level and standard of living of citizens . <p> Sharafat stated the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement was broad enough to allow force majeure in the event the project is hampered due to United Nations sanctions on Iran . He said in case the project does not materialise , a liquefied natural gas terminal will be set up at Gwadar to allow re-gasified LNG to the system . <p> Giving the current status of the project , Sharafat said a detailed route survey was in progress to pave the way for engineering and design of pipeline facilities . <p> Later talking to media , the chairman Senate committee said it was important that the project start as soon as possible to bridge the rising natural gas demand-supply gap . @ @ @ @ @

PHOTO : NOOR JAVERI/EXPRESS <p> KARACHI : Home-cooked meat is healthier than the meat sold in restaurants or roadside cafes because it is cooked at high temperatures that kill the bacteria , researchers warn . <p> A study , " Microbial Contamination of Raw Meat and its Environment in Retail Shops in Karachi " , conducted by five researchers in 2009 was published earlier this year in the Journal of Infection in Developing Countries . <p> The research confirmed the presence of at least 550 potential pathogenic isolates in samples of meat , as well as equipment used to cut and display meat at shops . Thirty retail outlets located in main Saddar Market were randomly selected for the study . A total of 340 meat and surface samples were also collected . <p> The study showed the process by which pathogenic bacteria , or disease-causing bacteria , is transferred from the environment to the meat and to the cutting apparatuses , given the hygiene conditions in most retails shops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bacteria were resistant to antibiotics , probably because the animals are fed them at some point along the livestock farming line . <p> The authors included Nafisa Hassan Ali , Amber Farooqui , Adnan Khan , Ameera Yahya Khan and Shahana Urooj Kazmi , who is also a professor at the Department of Microbiology and the pro vice-chancellor of the University of Karachi . <p> The grilled food sold on roadside stalls may appear delicious but it is not hygienic , said Dr Kazmi , adding that most of the times the meat is half-cooked , meaning that bacteria is still present . " Minced meat , which has the greatest amount of such bacteria , is often used at restaurants to make kababs and burger patties that are cooked for a very short time and hence are very dangerous to consume , " she told The Express Tribune . <p> While some people have started opting for packed meat sold at supermarkets , 23 per cent of the households still buy raw meat from open-air retail shops that do not have appropriate temperature controls . <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of micro organisms will definitely grow on it because it is a rich source of proteins , " explained another researcher . <p> Dr Kazmi pointed out that although this bacteria can cause various complicated infections , such as typhoid and diarrhea , they are not usually transferred to our cooked food . This is because of the vigorous cooking styles followed in the sub-continent , she added . " Fortunately most of these bacteria die at high temperatures and hence do not harm us , " she explained . <p> According to Dr Kazmi , the overall storage and quality control methods of slaughter animals are not satisfactory . According to the West Pakistan Slaughter Control Act 1963 , slaughtering should be strictly undertaken in recognised places with ante- and post-mortem veterinary inspection , she said , adding that we do not have any scientific diagnostic laboratories at our slaughterhouses . <p> " What our veterinary officer does is just brush his hand over the body of the animal and if the fur sticks to his hand , the animal is declared fit , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughtered outside the two government-controlled slaughterhouses is much higher than those within them , Dr Kazmi said dejectedly . The slaughterhouses have poor hygienic conditions with unclean equipment and to top it all , meat is transported to the retailers in open trucks that add to the contamination , she added . <p> Butchers at the Burnes Road market , for example , have been known for the quality of their meat . Amjad , a butcher who sells beef , says customers trust him more because he slaughters his animals close to the shop , thereby doing away with the hazards of transporting it . " Our meat is sold within hours after being put on display , " he claimed . " We have old customers who know the quality of our meat . " <p> Much like Amjad , most of the butchers in the city manage the business with very little interference of the authorities .

The Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever Virus , a level 4 pathogenic disease , is actually carried by ticks in the fur of cattle and ruminants that gets transferred to the animal . When such an animal is slaughtered , the virus can easily get transferred to humans either through blood or tissue contact or through meat consumption . <p> In order to adopt a healthier lifestyle , Dr Kazmi suggested that there are proper sanitation procedures at slaughter houses and butcher shops . The hygiene of the butcher and the health of the animal should also be taken care of . Lastly , the meat should be cooked well before eating . <p> Another factor found in this study was that consumer platforms and counters of the shops were cleaner than the floors as they were probably mopped several times during the day . <h> Reader Comments ( 1 ) <p> Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the whole trip .

@@4517237 proposed to increase the depreciation by 100 per cent . Photo : File <p> ISLAMABAD : The government is contemplating enhancing the age limit of used cars from three to five years for import under the special scheme . This could put to an end the car manufacturers ' monopoly . The proposal pertains to old cars which are eligible for import under the Personal Baggage , Gift and Transfer of Residence Schemes . <p> Sources told The Express Tribune that the commerce ministry has proposed to the government that the age limit for the import of cars be increased from three years to four or five years . The proposal will be tabled before Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and he will take the final decision in this respect . <p> " If the government takes this decision , it will bring to an end the monopoly of car manufacturers , " said Shahzada Saleem , President of Car Dealers Federation Lahore . <p> He said people did not have any other option but to buy expensive cars . He said that according to his information the manufacturers have started pressurising the government not to take a pro-consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector study highlighted the anti-consumer practices of the manufacturing industry . The industry has constantly been increasing prices since a long time and the government has been a silent spectator . <p> In the current fiscal , the second year of the three-year trade policy , the government may fix the export target at $21.3 billion against projected imports of over $38 billion . The government is also considering allowing import of 22 more items from India , taking the number of items that are allowed to be imported from India to 1,956 . <p> The commerce ministry has also proposed an increase in the depreciation of cars by 100 per cent to two per cent per month for a maximum of two years . The depreciation is the decline in the value of car calculated by taking into account the age of car . The older the car is the more benefit the importer gets . <p> The depreciation will favour the importer who claims refund of the duties it pays on the import . The importer can claim depreciation for a maximum of two years . Any decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent would also help lower the cost of used cars . <p> The import of used cars is allowed only under special regimes . At present , the imports are allowed under the Gift , Baggage and Residence Transfer schemes . <p> The government has determined certain rules in this regard . For personal baggage , a minimum stay abroad for becoming eligible for the import is six months within the last seven months . For gifting a vehicle to a relative , the requirement is at least two years stay abroad during the past three years . A vehicle may be gifted only to a family member normally resident in Pakistan . <p> In case of cars with engine capacity of 1,800cc and above and 4 ? 4 vehicle in new condition to be imported either under Personal Baggage or under Gift Schemes , the duty and taxes will be paid out of foreign exchange arranged by Pakistan nationals themselves or local recipient supported by bank encashment certificate showing conversion of foreign remittance to local currency . <p> Under the Special Regime , the taxes are levied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vehicle and the optional or additional accessories . The accumulated amount of taxes , covering Custom Duty , Sales Tax , Income Tax and Capital Value Tax based on engine capacity , on import of the used vehicles meant for transport of passengers , are listed below . The duties run from $ 4400 to 26000 dollars depending upon the engine capacity . <p> This is apparently being done to make low priced cars available in the country ; a step consumers would welcome . However , some news reports mention that easy import of reconditioned cars is already allowed in large numbers . I guess this explains how such junk cars are allowed to be dumped into the country ; they are generally in deplorable conditions , and at the end of their productive life . Yet with their cosmetic changes , they manage to fool the consumers . It seems Pakistan has become an easy target for disposing of useless vehicles . I request the government to focus on such areas benefitting the consumer , as relaxing the regulatory duty on auto parts which would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit would be support of a sustainable manufacturing industry , something Pakistan direly needs in order to achieve progress . I would rather go for a new local car ( with a warranty ) than a reconditioned imported car of which nothing is known !

The features of even a ten years old imported car are absent in recent models of locally Manufactured Suzuki and Toyota . They are earning hundreds of thousands on just manufacturing crap . <p> I admit importing hurts your economy but as far as automobile industry is concerned I am in favor of allowing atleast upto 5 years old cars . This will not only bring down the car prices but will also motivate local manufacturers to produce better cars.Recommend <p> M , Arshad with all due respect even if the govt allows import of 5yr old cars i can guarantee u one thing tht no one will put a gun to your head asking you to buy an imported car , u can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please open your eyes as most of the cars plying on our roads today are really very old and your calling 5yrs old car a junk.Recommend <p> Mohsin and Asad , I respect your point of view but do you really expect a 5 years old imported car to be actually 5-years old ? The import tariffs on used cars in Pakistan are considerably lower when compared to the protection offered to local auto manufacturers in India , Thailand and other countries . The current policies of used cars in Pakistan are still extremely liberal and are often misused by importers under transfer of baggage scheme . Many cars are imported into Pakistan from Dubai under the transfer of residence or gift scheme , which means that the car is suposed to have been registered and used in the UAE for a certain period . However , the majority of these vehicles are right hand driven , whereas the UAE only allows left-hand drive vehicles on its roads . This means that such cars actually come from countries other than the UAE and are imported through various malpractices using false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of low quality used cars into Pakistan . Often the odometer of such used cars is reversed , using unscrupulous techniques to give the false impression that the vehicle has done low mileage .

@@4517238 <h> Where sufism stands <p> Sufism is a complex and cross-cutting belief system in Pakistan . Even Deobandis believe in Sufism . Naqshbandi , the major Sufi cult in Pakistan , is mainly comprised of the Deobandis . It is interesting that Maulana Masood Azhar , head of the major terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad , is also believer of Sufism and has restricted his followers to the practices of the Naqshbandi cult . <p> To further complicate the intermingling of beliefs and practices , the Barelvis , who are considered representatives of Sufism in Pakistan , are not free from pro-militant jihadi tendencies . In the Kashmir insurgent movement during the 1990 's the Barelvis were quite prominent . Some Barelvi militant groups , such al-Baraq and Tehreek-e-Jihad , are still active . Sunni Tehrik , a major Sunni sectarian group , was found to be involved in the violent activities in Karachi and Interior Sindh . <p> Pro-Sufism Barelvis dominate Pakistan 's religious landscape . The reason why they did not play a major role in the Afghan jihad of the 1980 's was not because of any religious or ideological bindings , but because of political factors . The Saudi influence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Saudis supported only the Wahhabi and Deobandi groups during the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union . Moreover , the Arabs and Africans who took part of the Afghan jihad had similar sectarian orientations as the Wahhabis and felt more at ease working alongside the local Salafi and Deobandi commanders . The Afghan and Pakistani groups had also preferred to work with Arab and African mujahideen because they had the more substantial resources . <p> Had it not been for the Saudi and Arab factor , the Barelvis too would have been able to secure their share in the jihad effort . If that had happened , would the promotion of the Wahabi ideology be suggested as a counter-strategy today ? <p> When one ideology is supported financially , morally and politically to counter the other , it can increase sectarian strife in a society . Pakistan faced the consequences during the Afghan jihad as sectarian strife dramatically increased in the country . Similarly , strengthening one group or sect can give rise to similar trends in other sects . So we see that many Sufi groups have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other violent groups , though they lack the training and resources received by the Deobandis and Wahabis . <p> Instead of targeting the entire Wahabi/Salafi community , can terrorism and political extremism not be countered by encouraging the more moderate elements within the Salafi school of thought ? <p> It can not be denied that the Wahabi movements have created challenges within Muslim societies . They have marginalised the elements of moderation by promoting a narrow vision of Islam . But how these movements are changing Muslim societies and what kind of political , economic , cultural and social challenges they pose is a separate issue . Their domestic and international implications demand different kinds of strategies to the one proposed by counter-ideology theorists . <p> It is not a surprise that campaigns to promote counter-Islamist ideologies like Sufism have had little success in Pakistan . &lt;oderate enlightenment and Sufism movements have failed to gain acceptance among the masses . Anti-US and anti-Western feelings are on the rise in Pakistani society and any campaign aimed to counter these sentiments is perceived as a part of the American agenda . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated class in Pakistan considers the spiritual rituals of the Pirs inappropriate and activities like use of drugs and prostitution on the shrines immoral . The Sufi culture in Pakistan itself needs reforms . That is why the government-sponsored enlightened moderation has failed to attract common people .

But please do n't sit in ur own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you even know what Sufism is .. ! please study and write ... Recommend <p> Khadim Husain <p> There are two entire different matters Sufism and followers of Hanafai school of thought . Sufism is non-practical and non-practicable doctrine . Neither anybody follows Sufism any where in entire world.It is a business to sell their products and none of merchant selling Sufism is Sufi . Nobody can achieve any spirituality from graves and none saint has power to stop any disaster . The propaganda that Sufi saints have unlimited powers than why colonists occupied entire world including Iraq and Iran the centre of Saints . All the four branches of Sufism were made public after many hundred years of Islam and whole links of spirituality are designed one keeping in mind specific mentality . The persos that says that Sufi never fought Jihad are naive , those must study Sufi history , Naqshbandi 's in USSR , Libya , Morocco and other East African areas . In fact face of Sufism in Pakistan is other face of Hinduism practically , flags , decoration of graves and method of worship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , in fact those are worshippers of Sufi graves only . Brelvi Pirs and Ulema are richest persons in Indi-Pakistan , those declared Jihad against British Sarkar un-Islamic . Moreover if anybody say that Deobandi are not follow sufism is also naive . First study who guided Sufism in Indo-Pak , Shah Waliallah . He merged all the four Sufi orders and later two school of thoughts Deobandi and Brelvi merged . Myth that Deobandi are Wahabi is also wrong because Abdul Wahab and Saudi 's got power not more than six seven decades back and both sects were merged into society around 1850 's . However Brelvi school approached to Shariff e Makkah for support with the backing of English Sarkar when Deobandi actively started mutiny against British Sarkar . In fact both Brelvi and Ahmadi declared Jihad unIslamic . Same thing those are repeating today . Pir Sibghatullah was active supporter of Jihad and many others backed Deobandi and Salafi 's in Jihad against British Sarkar . Afghanistan was declared Dar ul Harb by all school of thoughts and today it has same position , occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has changed faith of all type of Mullahs . Brelvi is not a religion , it is combination of rituals , worship to different idols , Mela 's on Mizars , Chars , Bhang consumption or superstitions . Deobandi 's are not behind in illitracy to follow Sufism and those also have large Khanqah 's . Recommend <p> Khurram Hasan <p> Drug trade and other tabos at the shrines had been promoted by the powerful pro Saudi , Pro wahabi and Pro Jihadi friction which exists within the pillars of establishment of Pakistan . Even at some very holy shrines , the " Sajjada Nashin " is actually a proxy of the secret police instead of the real successor of the sufi of that shrine . These people are also involved in attrackting youngsters towards drugs and also misguiding the students of colleges and universities who visit the shrine to slove the confusing questions rising in their minds about sects and religion and when this confused youth come across with these " Mujabirs " , either bents towards lucrative drugs OR runs far away into the world of extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illogical teachings which the young guy is unable to absorb showing an sponteneously opposite reflux action to what he calls " shirk " . Recommend <p> Khadim Husain <p> True history always hurt sentiments of peoples but I would like to quote some examples that one of the great Sufi married to his sister , another Sufi was famous pedophoil and both were hanged by state . Both are famous in Pakistan without their involvement in henious crimes . Another sufi that uses his Hindu alongwith Muslim name was lover of a teen age boy . Read the true history not the Kachi Roti Pakki Roti . There are dozens of examples . Shrines are active place of prostitution , drugs and rascals since hundred of years . Since the time even Abdul Wahab Najdi was not even born . Data Darbar was a centre of such traditions like other shrines but when Ayub Khan nationalized majority of shrines than police has started to control the situation . Today go to Lal Shahbaz and inside Sehwan organized gangs of prostitutes are running business . Sufi saints are nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are creating mess . When any pir is caught that is labelled as fake pir , otherwise all Pir 's are treated as sacred even those are allowed to touch women . Pir 's worship , grave worship or superstition is a curse and that has pushed our society backward . Wahabi was an abusive word against those Ulems which opposed the British Raj in 1857 , whereas Brelvi and Ahmadi favored the Raj and issued decree against Jahad un-Islamic , later those peoples bullied victamized peoples with the word Wahabi . However Govt. of India declared word Wahabi illegal and was counted as crime to label anyone Wahabi , refer Calcutta High Courts decision is on record . Sectarianism is also curse and peoples that are dividing Pakistani nation are trying to dig grave of Pakistan . Only those Muslim nations progressed that banned Sufism and halted rubbish practices like Turkey , Attaturk engaged all Sufi Mullah 's to join parade and closed all shrines . Saudi Arabia also did best thing to throw out Sufi fraud Pirs . Brelvi sect is not a religion because it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol , each grave is idol and each pir is assistant of God . It is like Hindism that also has unlimited Gods . Brelvi are illitrate peoples of that era when Prophet started to preach Islam and those did not agree that Allah could listen without any person in between them and Allah . That is why those were named as Kuffar , means denying Allah is an alone entity . First war slogan of Muslims in Badar was " Ahad " mean only Allah but Kuffar replied with their idols . That is happening in Pakistan and Brelvi Mullah 's have been funded by foreign Governments , for shrines U.S. and Australia are providing funding . Chief Minister Punjab allotted a plot worth 350 million to a Brelvi Moulvi.Recommend <p> Umair Ahmed <p> @khadim hussain Better to know facts before Abdul Wahab Najdi the head of wahabi every body went to shrines od sahaba and aulia many books and many riwayaat told that even Rasoosl Allah Sallallahu alaihi wasallam visit too much every yaear a proper date Rasool Allah Sallallahu alaihi wasallam and Sahaba rizwanaullah aalaihim ajmaeen went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i can give you proofs from your books . and give me proof of all eligations you imposed on barelvi at first i told do n't blame with out proof on any body.Recommend <p> Khadim Husain <p> There is a great difference in visit to grave yard and worshipping graves . Muslims never have tradition to build houses on graves . The grave of prophet was constructed due to safety , however history of construction of dome is less then 100 yrs old . I do n't know what Wahabi says , but worshipping humans like idols is foolishness . Even grave of Hazrat Ali was not known to public for 700 years and current grave is a guessing because grave of Hazrat Ali is also available in many countries , same grave of Hazrat Husain is also in many countries . Point of discussion is not existance of grave because grave did not enhance sacredness of a person . The peoples who want to pose Prophet as Brelvi , must tell that why Prophet did not constructed grave of his mother and father , grand father , daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever prophet practically showed that such and such person is alive , therefore Muslims must channelise their worship through person inside grave . Illitracy , superstitiousness , selling the name of owner of graves is a business and a political move . If any saint may have power after death so why did any waliullah failed to stop earthquake or floods . Non-Muslims ruined Palestine , Kashmir , Iraq , Afghanistan and drones are pounding over the graves of saints . No human has a power to show super naturality . Make religion simple , easy and straight and according to practical actions of Prophet . Recommend

This tagline of a popular Bollywood film evokes a myriad of emotions and political connotations . It alludes to the chasm between two socio-cultural forces ; the West and the Islamic world , which pervades at both the institutional and human level . It feigns the yearning of the ' moderate ' Muslim , to break out of the shackles of stereotypes in the wake of an ever-growing xenophobia in the West , fomented by ongoing episodes of terrorist plots targeting western interests and people . Furthermore , it illuminates the aspiration of such Muslims to transcend the archaic , rigid ideals held by pockets of their own background and to propagate the pertinent message of peace , rooted in Islam . <p> Tracing the origins of how stereotypical representations make their way into popular culture , would take us to the purveyor of ideas .

What we have instead is a series of crude , essentialised caricatures of the Islamic world ... ' ' The frequent portrayal of the Muslim world in such forms insinuates that perhaps the majority upholds retrogressive traits .

Their reticence to approach religion in a holistic and open minded fashion thus acts as a precursor to extremist tendencies . The simplicity with which Khan 's character interprets the tenets of Islam is incredibly rousing , citing examples from Quranic verses like one advocating that in the eyes of god , the killing of one person is equivalent to killing the whole of humanity . <p> My Name Is Khan is a breath of fresh air in that it sheds a different light on Islam , one that is rarely glamourised and glorified in popular culture .

@@4518233 @ @ floods land management <p> The writer is the country director of the Centre for International Private Enterprise email protected <p> Living in the modern age of computerisation and digital identification , Pakistan still languishes in an era of the stone-age Land Management System ( LMS ) . The current land administration system aims at land revenue assessment and tax collection for fiscal purposes . The system is structured on the traditional land registers and cadastral maps on paper , and their maintenance is mainly dependent on local land administrators , the so-called " Patwaris " . Although the local administrator reports all changes on land rights and boundaries of land parcels to the higher government authorities , the maintenance and quality of these registers has always been questionable . The limited accessibility and reliability of these records restricts the operational and legal usefulness for securing land ownership as well as for carrying out reliable planning and development activities . It is worth mentioning here that the privatisation programme of Pakistan has also suffered from this lack of clean title and property rights . The government had sold to Etisalat 26 per cent shares of country 's telecom operator in July 2005 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to a dispute over the legal transfer of land and property titles , the buyer has been holding back payment of about $800 million of the $2.6 billion PTCL 's privatisation proceeds . <p> The LMS will now be put to its ultimate test by the nature in the form of floods of the century . When the floods recede , one of the most serious after-effects will crop up in the shape of land grabbing and fake demarcations of boundaries washed away by wanton waters . While in Punjab and Sindh , the computerisation is in bits and pieces , most of the land record in province Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was still being maintained manually . In cases where the record has been computerised , the land demarcations can be verified by retrieving the data but it would be next to impossible to stop land grabbing of areas with damaged or lost records . <p> The land record maintained in flood affected areas of Sindh , Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa needs to be preserved to meet the eventualities in any future disaster of this magnitude . The problem which will pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land erased by the flood water which , would be difficult to locate , especially in case of small holdings , in all the affected provinces . Venal minions of revenue department will have hey days in connivance with unscrupulous and conscienceless land-grabbers . <p> A ' do or die ' situation will evolve for the farmers whose livelihood mainly hinges on the small tracts of land they hold . Before starting the rehabilitation and resettlement process , the revenue departments have got to act at meteoric speed to remove these fears and take immediate concrete steps so that land grabbers find it extremely difficult to rip off the already devastated farmers with their piercing fangs and talons . <p> One of the major problems that will emerge in Sindh is that in the ' kachach ' area where most of the people move from one place to another without having any proper land ownership documents .

@@4520230 <h> Book Review : Images of Afghanistan <p> When one hears of Afghanistan , it is usually in conjunction with the words " terror " or " Taliban . " The media speaks about the region in a mechanical , cold way to the effect that the world thinks of only the many troubles afflicting the region as opposed to the individuals living within it . Images of Afghanistan is an exercise in humanising the country and reminding readers everywhere that under the multilayered social and political turmoil lies a rich , potent culture . The editors , Arley Loewen ( a scholar in Persian literature ) and Josette McMichael ( a family medicine physician ) , are expatriates working and living in Afghanistan who realised the beauty of Afghan and Persian culture over their many years spent working with the Afghan people . The compilation of this work was an attempt to remind those watching Afghanistan , as well as those living within it , that there is more to the country than the war and violence that continues to make headlines across the world . <p> The book looks broadly at two aspects of Afghan/Persian culture : art and literature . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paintings , handicrafts , music and cinema . Literature informs the readers of the ancient Persian tradition of poetry and storytelling , recounting the Sufi poet masterminds and their works , as well as discussing new literature coming out of the region . Loewen and McMichael point out that the study of the art and literature of Afghanistan becomes a study in anthropology ; novels , stories , poetry , music and traditional crafts -- all become windows into a rich culture the world knows little of , till now . Images of Afghanistan aims to fill this vacuum by creating an entry point into the interesting Afghan tradition , so that other writers and researchers will realise the potential of this subject and follow suit . <p> The book has been divided into seven sections . The first is an introduction into Afghan history and a discussion on the importance of recounting cultural and traditional aspects of Afghanistan . In this section the editors recount the various rulers of the region -- from local amirs to Mughal rulers , and then the British . The Afghani experience involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , the local traditions and norms are a unique blend of subcontinental experiences . This explains the flavour and depth of Afghan culture . In addition to being an interesting read in general , the editors have offered a well-rounded synopsis of the Afghan timeline , which serves as a good introductory point to those looking to learn more specifically about the nation 's roots . <p> After introducing the reader to the geo-political origins of Afghanistan , the book proceeds to tackle the components of its culture . An integral element of this culture is the literary work that has come out of the region . <p> Part two is concerned with Dari literature or Afghan-Persian literature , whilst part three is about Pashto literature . These sections shed light on the thousands of years of poetry running subterranean to mainstream culture . Part four illustrates this ancient tradition ; it is labelled " Themes of Culture " and contains the poetic genius of great minds from Hafiz to Maulana Rumi and beyond . The importance of religion to the average Afghan is easier to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he/she has been raised is centred around religion and spirituality . The medieval works of poets like Hafiz , with their emphasis on mysticism and the desire to be re-united with God , are well known amongst the Afghan people . Poetry permeates every Afghani class and is not circumscribed to the educated elite , as is often the case in western cultures . The function of poetry in Afghani life is as pertinent today as it ever was in the past . <p> Images of Afghanistan holds many examples of cases where the wisdom of medieval poets is called upon even in recent times . The editor recounts a personal experience where he witnessed a woman awaiting her brother 's trial in an Afghan court of law with a pocket-sized Diwan-e-Hafiz in her hand , illustrating the importance and appeal Sufi poetry holds for the Afghani people even today . <p> What makes the book particularly interesting is the artistry with which the editors have selected material , and the juxtaposition of higher forms of art with the seemingly banal . For example , alongside Maulana Rumi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published . The content of these rhymes is out of the ordinary and unlike those common in the West . The editors have chosen nursery rhymes regarding fallen rulers , political leaders -- both popular and unpopular -- and the political state of affairs of the country . The overtly political rhymes reflect the receptiveness of Afghan adolescents to their surroundings , furthering the idea that the Afghan youth are sensitive and intelligent . Aside from nursery rhymes , the tales of Mullah Nasruddin are another example of the higher forms of storytelling enjoyed by Afghan children . Mullah Nasruddin , with his tomfoolery and false wisdom , offers a multitude of profound lessons in the disguise of children 's tales . The stories have permeated foreign markets as well , and variations of the traditional tales told to Afghani children can be heard all over the subcontinent . <p> After the discussion on poetry , parts five and six inform the reader of the many traditional art forms of the region , such as wood-carving , pottery and handicrafts . The photographs accompanying the chapter on handicrafts are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistry that the editors write about . The craftsmanship that goes into each piece of work is remarkable and will undoubtedly be appreciated by international buyers if marketed properly . One hopes this book will open new avenues for international appreciation of Afghani goods . <p> The last section , " Potpourri , " speaks of recent literary and artistic developments taking place in Afghanistan and the fusion between western work and Afghani work . It highlights the growth in the industry locally and the growing acceptance and infiltration of Afghani talent the world over . An example of East-West Afghan fusion discussed in the book is the international best-seller The Kite Runner ( which was also made into a motion picture ) by US-based Afghani author Khalid Hosseini . The editors offer an interesting discussion on this book and the flurry of excitement that surrounded its release . The Kite Runner is used as a gateway to discuss cinema in Afghanistan . While the film industry is virtually non-existent in the region itself , individual filmmakers from Afghanistan have ventured abroad to make movies . These small-scale projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts and the desire of the Afghan people to break into a new form of artistic expression . The endeavour to bring cinema to Afghanistan and the growing work to make it a viable field reflect the Afghan aptitude for the arts . Loewen and McMichael have carefully picked such examples to illustrate their point that Afghanistan holds a wealth of culture and character that the rest of the world could gain much from , both in terms of entertainment as well as enlightenment . <p> Images of Afghanistan makes for an enriching read where the reader puts down the book feeling hopeful for the nation and all its talent . It is successful in its mission of depicting a softer side of Afghanistan and provides the first-ever overview of art and literature of the region , thereby giving a key insight into the complexities of Afghan culture . The book offers the opportunity to learn about Afghanistan in a new way , divorcing the nation from the harsh paradigm within which it is usually discussed . <p> This review was originally published in the October 2010 issue of Newsline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It also led to signing of MoU to sell 50 MW to Karachi Electric Supply Company . In FY09 , the plant 's production capacity was increased to 7.75 mtpa . <p> During FY10 , the company 's production of clinker and cement increased by 7.92% and 13.05% respectively .

However in the Middle East , Iraq and Afghanistan , the export demand was relatively similar . <p> The overall capacity utilisation of cement plants increased to 76% in FY10 from 74% in FY09 due to increase in domestic demand with capacity expansions in the sector . According to recent statistics released by APCMA , 3 million tons of capacity expansion took place in FY10 ( as compared to 5 million tons in FY09 ) .

Being one of the largest cement manufacturers , Lucky Cement has a profit margin of 12.84% compared to the industry average of 1.4% , depicting its profitability owing to a large proportion of export sales . The company is also not highly leveraged with a Debt to Asset ratio of 34.5% compared to the industry average of 50% . This can be owed to its reduced financing costs and its financial stability . Return on assets is also above the industry , ie 8.19% , as compared to 1% indicating a well above proportionate increase in the net profit compared to the assets acquired . <p> Owing to such factors , its Earning per Share is also Rs 9.7 as compared to an average of Rs 2 showing high investor confidence and growth potential . <p> PROFITABILITY FY10 <p> Lucky Cement Limited posted a profit after taxation of Rs 3.137 million in FY10 .

The decrease in gross sales was largely due to lower cement prices , locally and internationally . The local sales volume of the company increased by 26.32% and the exports increased by 2.21% , hence doing better than the sector trend . The net sales of the company decreased by 6.92% ; from Rs 26.330 million in FY09 to Rs 24.509 million in FY10 . The increase in sales revenue was thus mainly due to lesser prices as although sales volume had increased , sales price remained constant . Lucky Cement decreased exports , which had increasing distribution cost . <p> Cost of sales increased by 0.07% during FY10 . The cost per ton of cement decreased by 11% due to the implementation of Waste Heat Recovery Project and using lesser expensive coal from a local supplier . The fuel and coal costs are 62% of the total costs , which went down by 16.2% . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greatly affected as cost of sales had increased by 31% in FY09 . <p> Thus , a decrease in sales revenue as compared to costs resulted in a decrease of 18.68% in the gross profit for FY10 . The operating expenses increased by 44.05% mainly due to distribution costs of exports , however , it was the drastic decrease in the finance costs ( from Rs 1237 million in FY09 to Rs 569 million in FY10 ) that increased the profitability of the company . The finance cost was mainly reduced due to early repayment of high mark-up carrying long-term loans and resorting to export refinance and Foreign Currency Import Finance ( FCIF ) , hence the company recovered via the hedge of exports . <p> PROFITABILITY ( FY03-FY10 ) <p> The profits of Lucky Cement have been increasing since FY03 , however , at varying rates . The growth in profits had been declining from FY06 to FY08 due to rising costs but surged during FY09 . During FY08 , the growth of the company 's profits slowed down to 5% . <p> FY08 was marked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cement prices , both locally and internationally , helping the companies to secure more profits ; but also the year in which they faced massive growth in operation costs , primarily fuel and electricity costs . This led the cement companies of the country to face massive problems in continuing productions and even to obtain profits from sales after the deduction of operation costs . Many cement companies were faced losses due to these costs . <p> Lucky Cement managed to obtain profits during FY08 when other companies posted losses . Lucky Cement anticipated these events and quickly employed counter strategies , like shifting to exports and reducing finance costs , resulting in high profits for the company . Also the energy and fuel crisis has also been spotted by the company in due time and preventive measures are employed with the hope that they will reduce operations and fuel costs in the future . <p> Lucky Cement had showed a growth of 35.4% in sales , from 12.25bn in FY07 to 16.95bn in FY08 . This growth was achieved through increase in exports , along with the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices showed an increase of Rs 133.7 per bag in FY08 from Rs 129.7 per bag last year , having a growth of 3.1% . Export retention prices , on the other hand , showed an increase of US $55.7 per ton ( Rs 152.6 per bag ) in FY08 as against US $47.2 per ton ( Rs 133.2 per bag ) in FY07 . <p> Although sales volume of the company grew by 19.7% to 5.56m tons as compared to 4.64m tons last year , yet domestic sales for the same period declined by 9.2% to 2.89m tons as against 3.18m tons last year . This occurred due to more focus toward high yield exports , which showed a growth of 83.0% to 2.67m tons in FY08 from 1.46m tons last year . During FY08 , ratio of local sales to export was 52:48 against 69:31 in FY07 . <p> PROFITABILITY RATIOS <p> The gross profit margin of the company fell to 32.56% during FY09 from 37.26% in FY08 . Likewise , the profitability margin of the company also fell from 17.46% in FY09 to 12.8% in FY10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during FY10 after improving in FY09 . <p> The gross margin showed a rising trend in FY09 , primarily due to the increasing export demands . Net margin showed a slight increase as finance charges drastically increased to Rs 1237m from Rs 127 million representing a rise of 881% , as the company was wound up in cross currency swap transactions which were providing interest rates hedging and SBP had also increased its markup rate- hence a higher financing cost . <p> Return on assets ( ROA ) and Return on Equity ( ROE ) also decreased during FY10 due to a lesser proportionate increase in profits as compared to the increase in asset and equity base of the company . The assets of the company decreased by 0.2% and equity increased by 7.93% but the profit after taxation fell by 51.75% . <p> ASSET QUALITY <p> The company 's performance in terms of asset management remained more or less the same during FY10 as compared to in FY09 . The operating cycle of Lucky Cement became 79 days in FY10 as opposed to 80 days during FY09 . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell its inventory as compared to 63 days during FY09 . This is because the stock of the company increased while the sales reduced . Also , the Day sales outstanding went from 15 days to 11 days during FY10 , depicting that it took the company greater period of time to recover credit payments . <p> The Total Asset Turnover ratio of the company had a declining trend till FY05 , after which it started improving . The ratio continued to improve during FY09 but again declined marginally in FY10 . The total asset turnover ratio had been increasing due to higher growth in sales revenue as compared to the growth in assets over the years till FY09 but then it slightly decreased due to lesser selling price despite high sale volume . <p> The rising trend of Sales/Equity was disrupted during FY08 when the ratio declined from 1.34 times in FY07 to 0.91 . However , the Sales/Equity ratio improved to 1.13 times in FY09 due to higher sales revenue and again declined to 0.98 due to lower sales revenue . <p> LIQUIDITY <p> The liquidity position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio fell from 0.86 in FY09 to 0.71 in FY10 . This was due to 12.55% decrease in current assets and 6% increase in current liabilities . The stores , spares and inventory of the company declined by 2% and the net taxation income fell by 17% . However , the major reason behind decline in current assets was a 68.2% decrease in cash and bank balance of Lucky Cement . Cash is the most liquid asset and such a substantial decline could make it difficult for the company to meet its obligations . <p> Lucky Cement had shown a positive trend in FY09 . The current assets were raised by cash in hand due to a smaller Days Sale Outstanding time period and also sales tax refundable by the company . On the other hand , current liabilities had increased , there were quite a few short-term borrowings done by the company as financing facilities , along with many bills payables . Liquidity position may remain weak until the company reduces its bills payables and short-term borrowings . <p> DEBT MANAGEMENT <p> Lucky Cement has a strong position when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FY06 , the company has employed strict measures to keep its debts under control . This futuristic preventive measure has helped the company a lot in these times when interest rates are continuously on the rise . The action to reduce loans and to depend on equity for expansionary purpose finances has been critical in saving the company valuable profits that would have been otherwise lost in the name of finance costs . The swap agreements are another preventive measure the company is employing to save itself further from interest rates . <p> The results of the preventive measures are visible in the debt to asset ratio and the long-term debt to equity ratio , which show a downward trend since FY06 . Total debt to equity has also been on a declining rate . In FY08 , although the total debt increased significantly , due to the rise in current liabilities , yet the overall effect has been declining owing to the rise in equity by the issuance of GD . Recently cost reduction measures like the Waste Heat Energy Project and using local coal has also helped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company succeeded in lowering its overall debts and strengthening its financial position . <p> The TIE ratio had been declining from FY04 to FY07 but in FY08 the TIE raised significantly , ie from 4.28 to 24.48 times . It again declined in FY09 to 5.85 and then marginal increase in FY10 to 7.46 . Although the EBIT for the year was less than that of FY07 ( 3,077,660 as compared to 3,695,402 ) , but in FY08 the finance costs were reduced drastically through swap agreements , causing the rise in TIE . Still , for future times , the company would have to reduce its operating costs along with its finance costs to maintain the positive stream of TIE . <p> The earning per share of the company had a general positive trend that has been established since FY05 . The earning per share of Lucky Cement decreased to Rs 9.7 in FY10 from Rs 14.21 in FY09 , due to a lesser PAT . However , the price to earning ratio rose during FY10 , depicting high investor confidence in the company . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rs 54 , which rose to Rs 71 during FY10 . The company announced a dividend of Rs 4 per share for FY10 . <p> FUTURE OUTLOOK <p> Although currently the price of cement has fallen worldwide , major construction projects due to the rising income per capita of countries leading to more residential and commercial construction projects worldwide will boost its sales and within the next 3-4 years , the price of cement is expected to increase . <p> Local cement sales can be expected to show positive growth during FY11 due to the construction of 8 dams in each province , rehabilitation of flood victims in Pakistan and increased spending by the private sector will give a boost to local cement sales . <p> Export sales growth may slow down as it has slightly reduced already due to Gulf region capacities . Also , political tension with India has already closed a window of opportunity that had appeared in FY09 . India constitutes 8.5 percent of total Pakistan 's cement exports . However , local cement manufacturers are exploring markets like Central Asia and other new markets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working capital ratio can easily improve if they manage and reduce their Days Sales Outstanding . Also a likelihood of increasing in world cement prices plus increase in local demand may lead to higher selling prices which can in turn increase its sales revenue leading to higher gross margin .

@@4520237 <h> Heritage Under Threat <p> Pakistan is home to some of the oldest civilisations known to mankind and , interestingly , the remains of these civilisations dot the river courses . Their rise and fall were inextricably linked to the change in the course of the river . This is true of Moenjodaro and Bhambore in Sindh , and of innumerable sites across the country . <p> It is unfortunate that we do not have an ' official ' archaeological map of the country , but history buffs are aware of the cave paintings dating back to 18,000 BC , discovered by Dr Fazal Dad Kakar , present DG Archaeology , in Zhob district . Interestingly , artifacts found in Soan Valley near Rawalpindi predate even these , and evidence of the Paleolithic , Mesolithic and Neolithic periods ( old , middle and new stone age ) are found in many areas . <p> This land housed Hindu , Jain , Buddhist , Sikhs and Muslims , and their rich religious and cultural heritage dot the historical landscape . Six of these sites have been recognised for their uniqueness and placed on the World Heritage List of UNESCO . These are Lahore Fort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Moenjodaro , Rohtas Fort , Takht-e-Bahi , Makli necropolis and Taxila , and are consequently on the organisation 's watch list for proper maintenance and management . <p> But the changing constitutional status poses a great danger to the management and preservation of heritage sites in the country . <p> After the passage of the 18th Amendment and with the abolition of the Concurrent List , there is likely to be massive confusion over the question of ' ownership ' and management of the museums and archaeological sites across the country , prior to which the Federal Archaeology Department was managing all the affairs . <p> Article 70 ( 4 ) shows the Federal Legislative List Part I and II , and the Concurrent List . According to this now , museums will be managed by the Federal Archaeology Department , while the surrounding site will be managed by the province . How that will work out , no one knows yet . To cite a case in point , Taxila Museum , as well as the two UNESCO Heritage sites in Taxila Valley will be federally managed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taxila Valley will be divided geographically between Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , because some of them are on the road beyond the Khanpur dam , which falls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . If that is n't a recipe for confusion , then what is ! <p> The matter of safe and efficient management of our national heritage according to internationally acceptable standards is too important to be left to political machinations . Whatever the new mode of devolution that comes into play after the 18th Amendment , care must be taken that political correctness does not override matters that should transcend these changes . <p> Photo : AFP <p> However , proper management is not the only concern : it is also pertinent to establish whether the floods have affected the archaeological heritage of the country in any way . <p> Even two months after this catastrophe , there has been no assessment of the damage in this sector . In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , where roads and bridges have been washed away , it is difficult to access archaeological sites high up in the mountains . Some damage is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since the army has control over it , it carried out the repairs soon after the water level receded . <p> There was concern about Moenjodaro as well , due to the raging waters of the Indus that came very close to it . Mercifully , the site remained undamaged , though another archaeological site , Amri , in Sindh lies submerged , and the damage will only be assessed after the water recedes . The final damage assessment can only take place once all the places are accessible . As far as the Makli necropolis is concerned , it has been converted into a massive relief camp , and only after the IDPs depart can any kind of assessment be made of the damage , if any , caused to it by the human habitation of the area . <p> We will only get a clearer picture -- and know the extent of the damage -- once the UNESCO team , that arrived on October 9 , completes its survey and publishes its findings . <p> Afia Salam is Pakistan 's first female cricket journalist .

@@4520240 <h> US Interests in Central Asia <h> Rana Kashan Saleem <p> Thursday , November 04 , 2010 - The political birth of the Central Asian States ( Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan ) is the result of the political demise of the Soviet Empire , after the end of the cold war . Somewhat , in the history of global politics , this was a unique incident of getting freedom , without any such struggle and demand by the masses . For the United States , the Central Asian region is of both emerging importance and emerging challenge . Geographically this region is landlocked , and had a little strategic concern for the United States during the first decade of its independence . <p> Afghanistan and India was always a serious concern for the United States . After the 9/11 attacks this region has been emerged as a center of global war against terrorism , which galvanized US policy makers to develop new and attune relationships with Central Asian states . Presently , the United States has basically three-fold interests in Central Asia , firstly , pertaining to geo-strategic realities of security , particularly in the war against terrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , and finally to the effort to support liberalizing and democratizing reforms in the region . <p> To date , the United States controls a military base in Manas , Kyrgyzstan , named after ? Peter J. Ganci ? , for mobilizing its forces and to provide logistics support in war against terrorism in Afghanistan , retaining of Manas airbase in 2009 is considered a landmark of U.S. foreign policy for Central Asia . As a result of this supporting behavior of Kyrgyzstan , Kyrgyz government may enjoy a possible increase in American economic aid from $24.4 million to $41.5 million in the new fiscal year that began in October 2009 . Nevertheless , it shows U.S. foreign policy ? s steepness towards the region for protecting and promoting its interests , furthermore , U.S. is also encouraging the NATO ? s Partnership for Peace Program ( PFP ) , which provides military training assistance and more broadly a complete security package for the novice Central Asian states to counter the threats of terrorism , extremism , and separatism . <p> Nonetheless , the ejection of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2005 , after the incident of Andijon , was considered a serious blow to the U.S. policy for the region . However , the new Obama ? s administration may remove the plagued effects of the President Bush ? s fallible policy for Central Asia , and may insert a new page of friendly relations . However , Shanghai cooperation Organization ( SCO ) and Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) are the two platforms that are used by Russia and China that hindering to achieve the U.S. objective in the region . For Beijing the presence of U.S. and its partners in the region is an attempt to encircle China . However , Russia considers the region as its ? natural sphere of influence ? . China is more interested in developing economic and trade relations with each state of the Central Asia rather than to fix the security problems of the region . Hence , the influence of Russia and China is the main hurdle for the U.S. to achieve it ? s near and long term objectives in the region . <p> Central Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a significant aspect of geo-politics and geo-economics in the region . However , Russia holds the majority of oil export routes from reserves in Caspian basin and Central Asia ; nevertheless , the western oil companies are also doing effort to win this pipeline politics . BTC ( Baku , Tbilisi , and Ceyhan ) pipeline is one of the examples of their effort . Furthermore , the investments by China and India in oil and gas sectors have yielded more options for non-Russian export routes . U.S. ardently interests for exploiting the untapped natural resources of the Central Asia and Caspian region is the need of hour , it is estimated that by 2050 , Central Asia could account for 80 per cent of America ? s oil supply . The process of introducing democratic culture and to develop new policies for human rights in the Central Asia is a long term policy of the United States . However , if one scrutinizes the history it is logically convincible that authoritarian regimes are more suitable to the United States for protecting its interests , but to nurture democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s style of governance is the core concern of U.S. state department for Central Asia . Among all Central Asian states , Kazakhstan is more willing to develop diplomatic relations with the United States , in a recent visit of Kazakh ? s President Nursultan Nazarbayev to Washington where he attended the nuclear security summit ; he was hoping to go home with a valuable trophy . <p> Indeed , the presence of regional powers particularly Russia , China and Iran are posing a threat to the United States for achieving its objectives in the region , but the new Obama ? s administration may understand that a military presence is not the only solution , but rather a well devised diplomatic policy towards the region , and dealing each state separately , will be helpful to protect the United States strategic interests in Central Asia .
