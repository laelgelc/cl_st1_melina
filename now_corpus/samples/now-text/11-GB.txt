@@3967230 <p> Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne , the two great novelists of 19th-century America , were close friends at a major juncture in their writing lives , and it 's hard to imagine a more fruitful , poignant or complex relationship . For Hawthorne , it was a connection that stirred deep intellectual interest . For Melville , it was a matter of love . <p> After several years in Boston as an inspector at the Custom House , Hawthorne moved to Lenox , in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts , in 1850 . He lived in a small cottage with his beautiful wife , Sophie , and their two children , Una and Julian . The Berkshires were dominated by such imposing literary figures as Catharine Maria Sedgwick , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Fanny Kemble and James Russell Lowell , but Hawthorne was a shy man who rarely ventured into literary society . <p> In early August , when Melville was staying with an aunt in Pittsfield ( six miles from Lenox ) , a prominent local figure invited him to meet the great Hawthorne -- who had just published The Scarlet Letter to wide acclaim -- at the base of Monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiked up a trail with half a dozen others . Apparently a storm blew up , and the group retreated to a cave to drink champagne from a silver mug and read poetry aloud . Melville grew buoyant , leaping into the rain to a rocky precipice , where he played sailor , pretending to haul up imaginary ropes for everyone 's amusement . Hawthorne , in particular , admired this brash young author , who at 31 was 15 years his junior . <p> Two days later Hawthorne wrote to a friend : " I met Melville the other day and liked him so much that I have asked him to spend a few days with me before leaving these parts . " <p> The visit went so well that Melville -- always impetuous -- insisted on moving his own family at once to the Berkshires from New York . They -- Melville and his wife , their infant son and Melville 's mother -- purchased Arrowhead , a lovely farmhouse on the edge of Pittsfield , only a month later . At the same time , Melville reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sketches by Hawthorne , in a prominent journal , declaring : " There is no man , in whom humour and love , like mountain peaks , soar to such a rapt height , as to receive the irradiations of the upper skies ; there is no man in whom humour and love are developed in that high form called genius . " The review was a big wet kiss for Hawthorne . <p> Now in the Berkshires , Melville came by to visit often , and Sophie Hawthorne found the young writer highly entertaining . The following spring she wrote that Melville spoke " his innermost about God , the Devil and Life , if so be he can get at the Truth " to her dear husband . " Nothing pleases me better than to sit and hear this growing man dash his tumultuous waves of thought against Mr Hawthorne 's great , genial , comprehending silences , " she added . <p> Melville was working on Moby-Dick , his masterpiece , at this time , and Hawthorne pushed him to go beyond anything he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately hoped that his rip-roaring story of the pursuit of a massive and dangerous white whale would attract readers . <p> Hawthorne , the allegorist par excellence , saw that Melville had before him more than a sea story . Here was a metaphysical quest , with man pitted against nature . Without Hawthorne 's conversations through the winter and spring of 1851 , Melville may not have realised fully what he had on the desk before him . <p> We do n't have all the information we might like to possess about their friendship , but we do know that once , in a snowstorm , Hawthorne appeared at the back door of Arrowhead and was invited to spend the night . The two authors sat in Melville 's study all night , talking in low voices , arousing the curiosity of his wife , mother and sister , who listened closely at the door . The extent of their intimacy is unknown , though it has intrigued biographers for a very long time . <p> For the most part , as Sophie Hawthorne said , Melville poured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extant letters of Melville to his mentor are full of yearning . In one , he imagined the two friends sitting down together in Paradise in eternal conversation : " O my dear fellow-mortal , how shall we pleasantly discourse of all the things manifold which now so distress us . " <p> Hawthorne withdrew , infuriating Melville by refusing invitations to dinner and tea . One would have to suspect that he could not bear such closeness . Yet Hawthorne did manage a letter in praise of Moby-Dick . The book was , after all , dedicated to him . <p> Melville wrote back in ecstasy : " Ah ! It 's a long stage , and no inn in sight , and night coming , and the body cold . But with you for a passenger , I am content and can be happy . I shall leave the world , I feel , with more satisfaction for having come to know you . Knowing you persuades me more than the Bible of our immortality ... I should write a thousand -- a million -- billion thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The divine magnet is on you , and my magnet responds . " <p> Hawthorne seems to have panicked when presented with Melville 's effusiveness and he fled the Berkshires for good , saying the weather there did n't agree with him . That weather , one might assume , was Herman Melville . <p> The two met only once after this , in England , where Hawthorne served as American consul in Liverpool . They went for a long walk one afternoon along the beach , smoking cigars and talking , as Hawthorne recalled in his journal : <p> " Melville , as he always does , began to reason of Providence and futurity , and of everything that lies beyond human ken ... It is strange how he persists -- and has persisted ever since I knew him , and probably long before -- in wandering to and fro over these deserts , as dismal and monotonous as the sand hills amid which we were sitting . He can neither believe , nor be comfortable in his unbelief ; and he is too honest and courageous not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a religious man , he would be one of the most truly religious and reverential ; he has a very high and noble nature , and better worth immortality than most of us . " <p> Hawthorne never contacted Melville when he returned to New England in 1864 , and died soon thereafter . Melville , by this time , had fallen sharply from public view , working as an obscure inspector in the Custom House in New York ( a position that echoed Hawthorne 's earlier position in Boston ) . By the time he died in 1891 , all of his work was forgotten . <p> A few years before Melville died , Julian Hawthorne ( who was researching a biography of his father ) stopped by for a visit with the elderly man and recorded his impressions : " At first he was disinclined to talk ; but finally he said several interesting things , among which the most remarkable was that he was convinced Hawthorne had all his life concealed some great secret , which would , were it known , explain all the mysteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Melville wanted more from Hawthorne -- much more -- than Hawthorne was prepared to give .

She was the same age as my three-year-old son and the two of them played together . <p> Later that evening , I noticed a blister-like rash on the girl 's head . I recognised it as chickenpox and feared she would have passed it on to my son . I knew the symptoms could be severe and that there were no effective treatments for chickenpox . <p> Two weeks after we had babysat the girl , my son developed a rash on his face that quickly spread across his body . His symptoms progressed quickly and severely . His temperature shot up and he began to have trouble breathing .

I had gone to Houston on a one-year fellowship with the Rockefeller Foundation to study the link between viruses and cancer at Baylor Medical College . <p> I moved back to Japan in 1965 . At that time , there was a fear that the chickenpox virus might be linked to cancer so a vaccine could end up being carcinogenic . Some researchers also feared that while a vaccine might stop chickenpox , it could lead to the development of shingles later in life . If I was to develop the vaccine , I needed to prove that neither of these fears was true . <p> It took me four years , using cultured human embryo cells , to prove that there was n't a link between this family of viruses and cancer . <p> And then , because the vaccine would use a lab developed virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine would be far less severe than those caused by wild-type viruses . <p> I started to work on the chickenpox vaccine in 1970 .

It was an exciting time for vaccinologists . <p> By 1972 , almost nine years after my son first developed chickenpox , I was ready to start clinical studies on the vaccine . Chickenpox usually spreads quickly through children 's hospitals but in the hospital where we conducted our trial , the spread of chickenpox was prevented .

The pluses therefore seem on the whole to outweigh the negatives . <p> The Russian government would appear to offer a more reliable and protective partner than the private sector oligarchs who have been BP 's bedfellows to date . And in any case , Rosneft wo n't have a seat on the BP board , so in theory it 's no more powerful than any other BP shareholder .

It 's what everyone is doing . There will be major upsets along the way , but the East 's ascendancy is as guaranteed as is the US 's relative decline .

As the world reaps the harvest of slack lending practices , it is a question more and more people have been asking . <p> But as the spotlight falls on the professional integrity of bankers , and the clamour for greater regulation rises , one thing becomes glaringly obvious -- the relative paucity of the kind of professional qualifications demanded of , say , doctors or lawyers . <p> Bankers bank . But can we bank on them if they have not done their homework first ? <p> Perhaps those one-time masters of the universe need to stop pocketing their bonuses and go back to school .

" It combines the high-level skills and professional competencies that will be increasingly necessary for the post-crisis banking environment . " <p> Peter L Griffiths , chief executive of the Principality Building Society , agrees : " As a practitioner who traded through the credit crunch , it seems clear to me that qualified bankers who truly understand the risk will be in great demand . <p> " The world lost sight of the basic canons of lending and debt is likely to remain a global phenomenon . Banking is a profession and demands professional standards and competence .

Eeven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run their affairs , whether they are politicians or university dons . <p> But there is a renewed interest in making the industry more professional , both in outlook and training . If nothing else it will restore public confidence . <p> " We believe this is the right course for the right time , " says Prof Ted Gardener , of the Bangor Business School , one of the key architects of the CBMBA . <p> " The banking sector used to stick to its guns , doing what it thought it did best , and not welcoming outside interference . But one of the things to emerge from the banking crisis is that risk management systems in many top banks were not up to the job . Some bankers need to be re-educated in the basics of lending . " <p> With more than 400 MBA students , the Bangor Business School , which has a London centre in the City , is ranked No 1 in the UK for research in accounting and finance , and offers a wide range of MBA and other courses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Bankers in Scotland reflects the fact that there is now no equivalent body in England . <p> The old Chartered Institute of Bankers merged with the Chartered Building Societies Institution in 1993 before becoming the Institute of Financial Services in 1997 . <p> As the City became increasingly deregulated , the banking profession became diluted . There was more emphasis on risk-taking , less on risk management . <p> " In the Seventies , there was still an old-fashioned professional ethos in the City , " says Prof Gardener . " John Major was typical . Before entering Parliament , he was an executive of the Standard Chartered Bank and also an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers . That kind of CV is much rarer today -- and the City has been the loser . " <p> Simon Thompson , CEO of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland , agrees : " The need for qualified bankers has never been greater . Customers , regulators and employers demand skilled banking professionals committed to high ethical , professional and technical standards who can help us build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the only remaining professional institute in the UK , but the oldest such institute in the world . It dates back to the 1870s , when the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank had served as a wake-up call to the profession as a whole , just like the recent collapse of Northern Rock . <p> " We like to think we embody traditional Scottish values such as caution and financial prudence , " says Thompson . " Not so long ago , those values enjoyed a worldwide currency . HSBC , for one , was founded on Scottish values . But as the industry became more competitive , and bankers started to style themselves ' retailers of money ' , a lot of bad habits crept in . " <p> For Thompson , banking is all about a sense of stewardship : remembering that your primary responsibility is to look after someone else 's money , not make money for yourself . " Running a bank is different from running a pharmaceutical company , say . Of course , you need some of the same management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . But an MBA is not going to teach you the dos and don'ts of lending . And it is not going to give you the intellectual grounding you need to manage liquidity and capital risk . " <p> Bankers from as far afield as Hong Kong currently apply to become Associates of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland . " There is a respect for the qualification , just as there is respect for chartered accountants and chartered surveyors , " says Thompson . " A banking degree has no afterlife : once you have graduated , that is that . But if you are a member of a chartered profession , you are required to maintain ethical professional standards throughout your career . " <p> At the moment , ambitious young bankers keen to acquire a further qualification are likely to target an MBA rather than seek chartered status ; they are unlikely to do both . But the new hybrid qualification , in theory , offers the best of both worlds . <p> " Banks certainly need leaders with good organisational skills , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But given that the core business of banking is lending , and that is the area of competence in which too many bankers have been found wanting , that is the deficit that now needs to be addressed . It would be nice to think that , over the next 10 or 20 years , we will see far more bankers , at every level , taking their professional responsibilities more seriously . " <p> With that objective in mind , the new CBMBA qualification is targeted at professionals in the banking and financial services sector , keen to extend their knowledge and understanding of global banking in the post-crisis era . Students will typically be in their late 20s or 30s and will generally continue to work full time while studying . <p> CBMBA courses start in January and July , and should take between two and five years to complete depending on how much time students can devote to the work .

Coursework can be done as easily in an airport lounge as at home . But the flexibility of the teaching model is not achieved at the expense of academic content . <p> The CBMBA , say its providers , is not to be confused with a " fast-track " MBA , one of those quick-and-easy qualifications that look good on the CV but do n't amount to very much . It is only recommended to those willing to make a strong commitment to invest the time , effort and energy . <p> It is early days and the first cohort of CBMBA students barely reaches double figures .

@@3975236 <p> Darren Aronofsky 's Black Swan is delirious hokum , high-class trash , the best movie Ken Russell never made . Less a follow-up and more a companion piece to The Wrestler , another grimy exploration of the emotional toil and physical hardship that goes into the making of popular entertainment , I found myself , especially towards its frenzied close , becoming a laughter-geyser : exploding at the uninhibited chutzpah of every over-the-top scene , at myself for the state of quivering breathlessness into which I 'd been driven , and out of sheer delight at the prospect of seeing the film again . <p> Nina Sayers ( Natalie Portman ) is a young dancer with the New York City Ballet who is preparing for a production of Swan Lake choreographed by the charismatic Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel ) . He 's looking for a lead to replace ailing star Beth ( Winona Ryder ) . She must possess the virginal grace of the White Swan , but also the elemental passion of the Black Swan . Nina , he believes , lacks the latter ; she is too poised , too much in control . The implication -- is it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's to land the role she covets , she must be willing to untether herself . <p> Being French , Leroy 's suggestion comes with a kiss . Nina bites him . It 's a promising sign , he thinks , and immediately installs her as the Swan Queen . But what should be the run-up to her finest hour quickly turns into a nightmare . Nina keeps having visual hallucinations , the many mirrors of the dance studio multiplying and assailing her self-identity . Her anxieties about whether she 's good enough ; her growing paranoia that another dancer , the more naturally expressive Lily ( Mila Kunis ) , is plotting to take her role ; the borderline-schizophrenia induced by the doubleness of her character : soon she 's not so much untethered as unhinged . <p> Are we meant to feel sorry for her ? Not at all . Her pain is our gain . After Lily , with whom she goes out clubbing , slips Ecstasy into her drink , she ends up necking random strangers in the toilet , before going home and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return items she 'd taken from her changing room only for the distraught woman to stab herself through the cheeks with a file .

Lily says she bedded some guy from the club ; Nina leaves the hospital holding a bloody file ; paintings are not megaphones . Aronofsky and his three screenwriters -- Mark Heyman , Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin -- pile on lashings of psychological thriller , exploitation horror ( at Leroy 's suggestion , Nina cultivates her passionate side by taking up masturbation ) , and pulpy theories about the relationship between art and fantasy . The result is that we can never be sure of what we 're seeing . <p> Are those really feathers growing out of Nina 's back ? Are her feet really becoming webbed ? This kind of Cronenbergian bodyhorror should revolt us . But its absurdity -- and the literalness with which this absurdity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily seems elated at the idea that she had phantasmal sex with Nina : " Was I good ? " she asks eagerly . Literalness is meant to be a mark of naivety and inexperience , something that children grow out of as they become adults ; part of Black Swan 's genius is to remind us of how much more vivid and dramatic the world can seem without the filter of metaphor . <p> Portman , in as demanding a role as she 's ever played , gives an impressive rendition of an actual ballet dancer . But it 's her face as much as her steps that most compel : her eyes and fleeting smile move from eagerness to brittleness to exhaustion -- and back again in a flash . Hershey is terrifying as a clingy , possibly incestuous mother whose reassuring smile recalls illustrations from 19th-century fairytale books .

Clint Mansell 's score , which torques and digitally reassembles Tchaikovsky 's original music , is an equally bold meshing of modern and classical that 's particularly effective at evoking Nina 's near-subliminal soundworld . <p> Early on , talking about his decision to stage Swan Lake , Leroy admits it 's a ballet that 's " Done to death , I know , but not like this . " He wants , he says , to " make it visceral , make it real " . Black Swan may not be the most profound statement about ballet , but , more often than not , it feels claustrophobically , clammily visceral .

In Black Swan , his camera doggedly keeps returning to the bent , bloodied toe wrapped beneath the silken ballet shoe , a metaphor for concealed pain which is destined gradually to work outwards . <p> Natalie Portman plays Nina , a ballerina who wins the lead role in Swan Lake , in which she is required to play both the sweet , virginal White Swan and the wicked , seductive Black Swan . She struggles with the latter , to the chagrin of Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel ) , the ballet 's ludicrously imperious artistic director , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase he uses with full sexual intent . Meanwhile , the former prima ballerina Beth ( a wild-eyed Winona Ryder ) is cracking up at being dispatched from Leroy 's favour . <p> Nina is beautiful and relentlessly hard-working , but she has n't much room to breathe . Her mother Erica ( Barbara Hershey ) , a thwarted ballet dancer herself , is creepily obsessive about Nina 's career and well-being . Nina sleeps in an oppressively pink room , in a white bed festooned with soft toys - we can safely deduce that any thoughts of ' letting go ' here might ordinarily be hard to arrive at . <p> But as she strains to portray the Black Swan , and Leroy becomes increasingly impatient with her failure to exude the required whiff of decadence , she finds herself giving masturbation and lesbian sex a whirl , not to mention telling her ubiquitous Mom to back off . <p> In another context , this would all sound rather hopeful , and before long Nina would have moved into her own apartment on the Lower East Side with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her role has been double-stamped ' tragic ' right from the outset , as she picks a joyless path through physical anxiety and the bitchy whispers of her fellow dancers . <p> Black Swan is marketed as a thriller , but there is very little true suspense : Nina is mentally ill , self-harming and bulimic at the start , and her miseries and hallucinations merely intensify . <p> Portman is excellent as a girl whose intense pursuit of perfection has extinguished in her the ability to feel pleasure , but she is rarely off the rack : even Rourke 's bloated , feckless wrestler was treated with more tenderness . <p> The ballet scenes are beautifully filmed , but the heart of this film is roaring high camp , with cruelty in place of comedy .

@@3975239 <h> Peter Oborne is the Daily Telegraph 's chief political commentator . <h> Baroness Warsi was right to speak out : Hatred of Muslims is one of the last bastions of British bigotry <p> It is not in the least surprising that Sayeeda Warsi 's speech last night against Islamophobia has created anger . Many people will disagree profoundly with her claim that British Muslims suffer discrimination . This is because of the common assumption that Muslims have brought almost all of their problems on themselves , above all through their refusal to assimilate and play a full role in mainstream society . <p> Nor is that all . It is often claimed that Muslims have behaved differently from other immigrant groups , such as Sikhs or Hindus , by refusing to accept the legitimacy of the British state . Of course , there is some truth in this assertion . The Islamic political organisation Hizbut-Tahrir ( to give one example ) gives its fealty not to the national state but to the misty vision of an international caliphate , something which has not existed in substantive form since the collapse of the Ottoman empire in 1922 . <p> The fear of terrorism adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that the London bombings in 2005 , which killed 52 Britons and maimed many others , were linked in some perverted way to the religion of Islam . So I have no doubt that Norman Tebbit , one of my political heroes and a man of rare moral and physical courage , was speaking for many readers when he called on his Telegraph blog yesterday for a " period of silence " from Baroness Warsi . <p> Yet I believe that the Baroness was right to make her speech and that Lord Tebbit was in the wrong . Indeed , I would go further and argue that the Baroness is showing exactly the same kind of moral courage that made Lord Tebbit such a towering figure among his time-serving colleagues in Margaret Thatcher 's cabinets of the 1980s . <p> Baroness Warsi is not stupid . She would have calculated well in advance that yesterday 's speech was a wretched career move . It is less than a week since she found herself in hot water after her injudicious remarks about the attitude of what she called the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election .

In doing do , she has shown exactly the same kind of foolhardy moral courage for which Norman Tebbit became famous when he was Tory chairman , the post Baroness Warsi occupies today . <p> What she said yesterday has desperately needed saying by a mainstream politician for a very long time . I know this because , over the past few years , I have visited many Muslim communities and spoken to scores of Muslim leaders . With very few exceptions ( such as Anjem Choudary , the fanatic who tried to organise a protest march by British Muslims through Wootton Bassett ) they are decent people . Many have come from countries which persecute their citizens and trash human rights . So they are even more keenly aware of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is why what Baroness Warsi has to say is so important -- British Muslims get spat at , abused , insulted and physically attacked . Vandalism and mosque burnings are common , and often unrecorded . The far-Right in Britain has changed its nature . In the 1980s , organisations such as the National Front and the BNP concentrated their hatred and odium on blacks and Jews . Today , racist organisations such as the English Defence League focus on Muslim immigrants . <p> One of the most troubling things about this racist violence and abuse is that it is legitimised and made respectable by so much of the daily conversation which takes place in the media . Over the decades , Britain has learnt through ugly experience not to insult and discriminate against almost every other minority : blacks , Jews , homosexuals , Irish . For some reason , Muslims are still seen as fair game . <p> Here is Martin Amis , arguably Britain 's most famous living novelist , on the subject of Islam . " There is a definite urge -- do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to say , ' The Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order . ' What sort of suffering ? Not letting them travel . Deportation -- further down the road . Curtailing of freedoms . Strip-searching people who look like they 're from the Middle East or from Pakistan . " In these remarks , Amis was doing rather more than insulting Muslims : he was using the language of fascism . And yet that did not prevent Amis 's fellow author , the equally celebrated Ian McEwan , leaping to his defence . <p> Muslims are fair game in British public culture . Polly Toynbee , of The Guardian , is regarded as Britain 's most politically correct columnist . " I am an Islamophobe and proud of it , " she once wrote . These sentiments were echoed by the rather less politically correct polemicist Rod Liddle : " Islamophobia : count me in .

This was supposedly happening at Leicester University , so I went there to investigate for Channel 4 's Dispatches programme , only to discover that not a single member of staff had come across any problems with hand-washing . <p> The students were shocked by the stories . One said : " I always roll up my sleeves , and everyone that I know does . " The university told us that one student had asked a question about the new regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grain of truth , but it had been grossly distorted . <p> Above all , the insulting claim that Muslim medics were putting their religious beliefs before patients ' safety was simply not backed up by evidence . <p> There is only space on this page to publish a tiny fraction of the evidence I have assembled which proves that hatred of Muslims is one of the last bastions of bigotry in Britain today . That is why I am so certain Baroness Warsi was right to speak out as she has . <p> It 's important to stress that she was n't demanding special treatment for Britain 's two million-odd Muslims . She was n't pretending they are all perfect , and she was n't denying there is a big problem with terrorism which Muslims themselves must confront .

Building relationships with the handicapped teaches us valuable lessons about our own weakness and vulnerability .

God bless . <p> Jim Cargin <p> Thanks to Ms. Phillips , for this accurate and inspiring blog on one of the true prophets of our time . <p> Just to comment , from the point of view of a longterm member of L'Arche , and as a Catholic , on the inter-religious aspect , which is slightly frowned upon by EditorCT , who wishes that L'Arche were more Catholic . <p> From long experience , I would agree with Vanier when he has said previously- though perhaps not in this lecture at Blackfriars- that he would prefer to live in community with an assistant who was a good caring person , but without belief , than with a person who professed to believe , but was n't a good caring person . <p> At present , with the policy of openness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions are drawn to share life in community , with people with a disability . This can be a rare opportunity for many people , especially at the start of their adult lives , to experience first hand a faith-based community that emphasises less what they have to give , ( though their service is important ! ) but what they have to learn -- often at the hands of people with a disability . I believe that cumulatively , this work contributes in a small way to the humanisation of our society , making it friendlier for all , especially those on the edge , a place many people with a disability are sadly familiar with . <p> Given the make-up of contemporary secular society , more and more young people ( but by no means all ) arrive without any explicit faith . What they find , and hopefully take with them when they leave , is an understanding of what it means to care for others , and for themselves as well . The built in diversity can , as you might imagine , be problematic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am far from saying we have found a fruitful way to integrate all the diversity , but I am glad that it is there . For instance , those of us for whom our faith is a rock could get better at finding ways to put across our faith in ways that engage those without faith , and raise in their minds the kind of questions to which faith is for us a natural answer . But I also find it important to listen : what are these people who profess no faith , actually saying : is faith more something that one does , rather than what one professes ? <p> Certainly , there are many people with an intellectual disability who would not be able to express their faith verbally , but who have a clear heart-understanding of human nature , and what makes for ' the good life . ' This is why , as Vanier often states , a disabled person can be a teacher , a person for whom life obviously ' clicks ' , and who is thankfully generous in sharing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would I want L'Arche to be more Catholic ? It might be a lot simpler if it were ! But possibly also less open to the many in secular societies for whom religion in any organised form , has ceased to make sense . <p> One of the many challenges facing us in L'Arche ( there are always quite a few of these ! ) is the insight offered by a French theologian , Christian Salenson , with whom L'Arche in France has been in dialogue : to paraphrase : ' In L'Arche , you describe yourselves as a ' faith ' community . But history shows that a ' faith ' community , not rooted in a religion has no future ! ' <p> As we try and take this insight on board , and be true to ourselves , I would ask for your prayers .

Also farmland will become more prominent as a sought after asset , as world farmland markets become increasingly accessible and new emerging markets open up , creating new opportunities . <p> The report also says that as concerns over food security become greater and the use of land for agriculture comes under pressure , the financial sector and some governments/sovereign wealth funds have now joined the increasing numbers of private investors who are now appraising the investment opportunities . Some have already invested in the sector . <p> Their motives differ , the report says . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns and portfolio diversification , while governments and sovereign wealth funds are looking for surety of the long term supply of foodstuffs . <p> It points out that food consumption is expected to double by 2050 , with both the world 's population forecast to grow by over 40% ( an extra 2.7 billion people ) and also an increase in the demand for higher protein diets as the emerging markets become wealthier . <p> At the same time , production/supply is expected to shrink , with pressure from a wide range of factors including urbanisation , climate change , the demand for bio fuels and rising input costs . <p> Although the recession has affected levels of growth in some countries , Savills expects the basic economics of supply and demand will continue to support farmland values globally . Returns will vary in absolute terms and the degree of volatility will depend on a number of factors . These include whether a farmland investor has elected to either participate in the business of farming with its higher returns/risk profile , or take the more stable returns of cash rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection . <p> ' Farmland as an asset will increasingly become a sought after investment .

In addition , the returns from agricultural investments have a weak correlation with mainstream investments , which means agricultural property performs well when other assets show poor returns .

' <p> Another relative then shouted : ' You 've had a year to think about that . ' <p> Rose Gentle , whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in Iraq in 2004 , told Mr Blair : ' You lied , your lies killed our son . I hope you can live with it . ' At the end of his testimony , Mr Blair was approached by Reg Keys , whose son , Lance Corporal Tom Keys , 20 , was killed by a mob in southern Iraq in June 2003 . Mr Keys said : ' I just wanted to say that you are a disgrace to your office . ' <p> Grilling : A protester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II Conference centre , in London , where the former PM was today giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry for the second time <p> Graphic : The Stop The War Coalition turned up with a huge banner depicting Blair standing next to a huge pool of blood <p> Valerie O'Neil , 53 , of Halifax , West Yorkshire , lost her son , Kris , 27 , in the war . She said : ' His regrets were too little , too late . I do n't believe he was sincere in the slightest . ' <p> Deirdre Gover , 64 , whose son Flight Lieutenant Kristian Gover , 30 , was killed in a helicopter accident in Basra , said : ' I would like him indicted as a war criminal . ' <p> Mr Blair was recalled by Sir John because the account he gave last year has been contradicted by other witnesses and official documents . <p> The inquiry issued a list of 106 questions on which they wanted further detail , including Lord Goldsmith 's recent claim that Mr Blair did not faithfully represent his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last appearance when he slipped unseen into and out of the inquiry , yesterday he used the front entrance . The security bill for the day could top ? 200,000 . <h> HIS ' UNCOMFORTABLE ' MOMENT <p> The former PM effectively admitted he lied to Parliament by telling MPs it would not be illegal to invade Iraq without a second UN resolution.He deliberately disregarded the advice of then attorney general Lord Goldsmith that a resolution explicitly supporting military action was vital.Mr Blair said he believed the guidance was provisional and that the government 's top lawyer would eventually fall into line.Lord Goldsmith had told Mr Blair in January 2003 that UN Security Council resolution 1441 , declaring Iraq in material breach of its obligations to disarm , was not sufficient to justify Saddam Hussein 's removal.In a statement declassified earlier this week Lord Goldsmith said he had been uncomfortable with statements Mr Blair made to MPs.Mr Blair told the inquiry he too was ' uncomfortable ' making the claims but was trying to build a case for ousting Saddam . ' I was n't making a legal declaration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accept entirely that there was an inconsistency . ' <h> Tony Blair called for a ' gung-ho ' plan to help Bush oust Saddam Hussein a year before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . <p> The former prime minister told the Iraq inquiry that he put the UK on ' track ' to enforce regime change even as early as the 9/11 attacks of 2001 . <p> He promised President Bush he could count on Britain regardless of the ' political heat ' but worried about selling the war to the public . <p> Under tough questioning in his second appearance before the Chilcot committee , Mr Blair went further than before in spelling out how he privately agreed to military action 18 months before Parliament voted for it . <p> He said : ' The beginning of the track that led to regime change was straight after September 11 . ' <p> Then , just before his key meeting with George Bush at the president 's ranch in March 2002 , Mr Blair demanded a more ' gung-ho ' approach and a ' game-plan ' for ousting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : ' A political philosophy that does care about other nations -- eg Kosovo , Afghanistan , Sierra Leone -- and is prepared to change regimes on the merits , should be gung-ho on Saddam . ' <p> Mr Blair recognised in the memo it would be ' very tough ' to persuade an unconvinced public -- and his own Labour MPs -- that war was necessary . <p> He wrote : ' My own side are worried . Public opinion is fragile . International opinion is sceptical . ' But his determination to go to war , whatever the doubts and opposition , was clear : ' We have to reorder our story and message ... We have no inhibitions . ' <p> Mr Blair demanded ' a proper worked-out strategy on how we would do it ' . <p> He said he needed to be able to present the Bush administration ' with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game-plan . I will need a meeting on this with the military folk . ' <p> His justifications for the war make no mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason for sending in troops . <p> The memo <p> It makes clear that ' the immediate WMD problems do n't seem obviously worse than three years ago ' . Mr Blair offered whole-hearted support to Mr Bush 's plans for regime change from the start , admitting he told the American president that if efforts to control the Iraqi dictator culminated in military action ' we would be up for that ' . <p> In December 2001 , Mr Blair said he told Mr Bush : ' I was in no doubt it would be beneficial for the world to get rid of Saddam Hussein and to get rid of his regime . ' <p> The former prime minister told the inquiry : ' What I was saying to President Bush was very clear and simple : " You can count on us . We are going to be with you in tackling this " . <p> ' I was saying to America , whatever the political heat , if I think this , I am going to be with you , I am not going to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to back out when it gets too hot politically . I did it because I believed in it . ' <p> Mr Blair said having given such pledges to Mr Bush , it would have been ' profoundly wrong ' to back out later . <p> Despite fresh calls from Sir John Chilcot to agree to the publication of his letters to President Bush , Mr Blair continued to refuse yesterday , insisting they were ' very private ' . <p> He was quizzed closely on the failure to keep his Cabinet informed about the rush to war . Most ministers never saw an options paper detailing how regime change could be achieved . <p> He struggled to explain whey there was no substantive cabinet discussion on Iraq between April and September 2002 while military plans were being drawn up . <p> Mr Blair said his ministers could have been in no doubt about his plans , since he had made them in television interviews . ' I made it absolutely clear that regime change was possible . ' <p> The memo <p> Making his escape : He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of testimony <h> QUENTIN LETTS : The thespy offered a wretched posture of apology <p> Just behind Tony Blair at the inquiry , a woman started to shake . First it was her shoulders , then it was her whole upper half . It became apparent that she was weeping . Mr Blair was uttering some sticky-voiced assertion that he regretted the deaths in Iraq . <p> He was trying to tidy up some business from last time . Trying to put a good gloss on his own respectability . And so , yes , of course he regretted the loss of life . ' Too late ! ' a few sobbing voices commented , half-checking themselves . <p> Being decent Englishmen and women , they were reluctant to break the rules of the room . Sir John Chilcot did not have to do much to restore order . The dignity of the protest somehow made it all the more affecting . <p> But was this sun-tanned former prime minister with his male-model suit and his quasi-American cadences truly sorry ? <p> Did his jaunty self-justifications , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly belong to a contrite soul ? <p> Or was his attitude to that sort of thing encapsulated in the striking phrase he minted to describe the West 's current stance on Iran -- ' a wretched posture of apology ' ? A wretched posture . Takes one to know one . <p> The protests from the families at the very end of his evidence may have startled Mr Blair , although the TV pictures were cut before we could see his reaction . Reg Keys told him he was ' a disgrace to your office ' . <p> Another bereaved parent , Rose Gentle , said she hoped he could live with the accusation that he had ' killed ' her son . <p> Relief : Blair leaves the Iraq inquiry with a security guard after giving evidence <p> That was harsh yet understandable . For during yesterday 's evidence , Mr Blair came close to admitting that he misled Parliament when he took this kingdom to war . <p> During a long , intriguing passage of interrogation from efficient Sir Roderic Lyne , he came up with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being told by the attorney general , and the ' political point ' of what he said to the House of Commons . <p> ' I was trying to keep up maximum pressure , ' he wheedled . ' It was less a legal declaration than a political point . ' This was a euphemism . Let 's not delude ourselves . He lied . <p> Not that you would have thought it from the way he held himself yesterday . <p> The old thespy fraud is still as collected as ever . In fact he was cockier than at his last appearance in front of the inquiry . It was as though he had come with a determination to sound blase . Upbeat . Mr Sure . Next target : Tehran . <p> He presented himself as a master of decisiveness.There was a gurgling confidence -- almost a merriness -- at the back of his throat as he remembered how popular his Government had been . ' We were probably the most successful centre-left government in the world , ' he said delightedly . <p> Call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost the tax payer ? 250,000 to cover security <p> And with that he threw a half-second 's glare at the inquiry 's members , as though to remind them of the mandate he had held . That brief look seemed to contain contempt . It seemed to say : ' I was voted into office , unlike you lot . ' <p> He kept issuing the word ' right ? ' , checking that his audience was yielding to his command , following his plausible sophistry in all its detail . <p> The one time he slipped into the truly ridiculous was when he insisted that Charlie Falconer was one of the ten best legal brains of his generation , and that that was the reason he became a law officer in the Blair government . Sure thing ! <p> Apart from ' a wretched posture of apology ' what struck me most was the way Mr Blair talked of ' the leading ally ' . Did he mean Britain ? Or himself ? <p> This question remains unresolved after yesterday : was our involvement in the Iraq War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did our soldiers fight -- and die -- because it was in the national interest ? <p> Or were they sent off to war because this bold fox demanded it ? They will love him no less in America . And that may be all that worries him . <h> AND WHY IRAN WOULD BE HIS NEXT TARGET <p> Mr Blair yesterday issued a stark warning to Western countries to get tough on Iran.The former Prime Minister said world leaders must be prepared to use military force if necessary to deal with the ' looming challenge ' from the hardline regime in Tehran.He said the Iranians would remain a destabilising force in the Middle East while President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pursued his nuclear ambitions . ' I am out in the region the whole time . I see the impact and influence of Iran everywhere , ' he said . ' It is negative , destabilising , it is supportive of terrorist groups , it is doing everything it can to impede progress in the Middle East process and to facilitate a situation in which that region can not embark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The West has got to get out of this wretched posture of apology for believing we are responsible for what the Iranians are doing , or what these extremists are doing . ' We are not . The fact is that they are doing it because they disagree fundamentally with our way of life and they will carry on doing it unless they are met by the requisite determination and , if necessary , force . ' Mr Blair said U.S. President Obama 's attempts to extend the hand of partnership to the Iranians had failed to bring a change of policy in Tehran . ' We have got to get our head out of the sand and understand they are going to carry on with this , ' he added .

When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested , police felt the ensuing media coverage overstepped the bounds of what is legally acceptable . <p> There are strict rules on what media outlets can and can not report under the Contempt of Court Act , which seeks to ensure a fair trial in any subsequent court proceedings . <p> The government 's senior law officer stressed that there was ' freedom of the press ' , but said newspapers had to comply with the Contempt of Court Act . <p> ' We need to avoid a situation where trials can not take place or are prejudiced as a result of irrelevant or improper material being published , whether in print form or on the internet , in such a way that a trial becomes impossible , ' Mr Grieve said . <p> ' I do n't want to comment on the precise coverage , but I think it 's important to understand that the contempt of court rules are there to protect the rule of law and the fair trial process and they require newspapers , and indeed anyone who is covering material , to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair trial taking place at a later date . ' <p> The Attorney General added that newspapers were ' pretty familiar ' with the contempt of court rules and asked them to make responsible judgement calls . ' I would simply ask them to reflect carefully on how they provide proper coverage on a matter of public importance while at the same time , mindful of how our legal system works , they can also ensure that a trial process -- if one were ever to happen -- would not be prejudiced by material being published that may be irrelevant to any case that comes before the court but could be seriously prejudicial to an individual who is standing trial . ' <p> However , while more traditional media outlets have obeyed the letter of the law on this latest arrest , within hours of the arrest the internet was awash with rumours of a suspect 's identity , including micro-blogging site Twitter . <p> Mr Jefferies is now said to be considering suing police for wrongful arrest after his reputation was arguably damaged by press coverage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current or future suspect , hence their warnings to the press . <p> As part of the statement released to confirm the arrest this morning , police gave a firm instruction to media outlets covering the case . <p> It read : ' Proceedings are active and everyone is reminded of the Contempt of Court Act and therefore you will understand that we can not discuss any more details at this stage .

' <p> Police believe Miss Yeates , 25 , arrived at her flat on Friday December 17 after walking home from a pub where she had been drinking with colleagues . <p> Yesterday a team of officers closed off Canynge Road and put up scaffolding and 12ft-high tarpaulin barriers around the two ground floor flats . <p> These were once connected via a door that was bricked up when the building was converted to flats . <p> Forensic experts also began a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr Tabak 's friends . <p> Officers cordoned off a townhouse on Aberdeen Road , around a mile away , just after midday . <p> Last night they loaded three wheelie bins and a mountain bike from the house into an unmarked white transit van . <p> Another police vehicle marked ' Scientific Investigations ' had earlier been parked outside the address , which is usually occupied by 31-year-old Emily Williams , who is currently in South America . <p> It is believed she was letting Mr Tabak stay while the police activity at Canynge Road made his flat uninhabitable . <p> Her street is in Redland , an affluent Bristol area popular with students and professionals , which borders Clifton . <p> Calls to Mr Tabak 's office at the architectural firm Buro Happold Ltd in Bath were directed to the force investigating Miss Yeates 's murder . <p> Yesterday her father , who this week made an emotional appeal to anyone who may have been hiding her killer to come forward , said he was pleased the investigation had made progress . <p> With his wife Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holding Miss Yeates 's cat Bernard , he said : ' Both Teresa and I are very pleased an arrest has been made and the investigation is moving forward . <p> ' Police informed us at 6am this morning that someone had been arrested on suspicion of Jo 's murder , and their age . <p> ' They told us before they made the announcement about the arrest and other than that we do not know much more . <p> ' We are optimistic about the progress , but we have not been told the name of the person who has been arrested .

@@3978235 <p> On his three trips into space , Mark Kelly has marvelled at the beauty of Earth from the rare perspective of an astronaut . For the past fortnight , he has witnessed wonders much closer to home - and even more thrilling . <p> They come in the moments when his wife Gabrielle Giffords plays with his wedding ring , removing it and placing it back on his finger ; pats his face with her hand ; gives him a neck rub ; or just looks up at him and smiles . <p> They are all the small gestures of affection that Gabby , as everyone knows her , has always shown her husband . What is so remarkable is that she is making them again , just two weeks after the bullet of a would-be assassin ripped through the Democratic congresswoman 's brain . <p> " Every time I interact with her , there is something quite inspiring , " Capt Kelly , 46 , told The Sunday Telegraph as he reflected on the rollercoaster of emotions since a lone gunman shot his wife point-blank in the head , then killed six and injured 12 others at a public forum in Tucson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth what he is sure are words , although the tracheotomy tube in her throat means she can not speak and doctors do not know if she will regain that ability . She has even flicked through photographs on his iPad . <p> " I imagine the next step is she 'll be walking and talking , " the space shuttle commander continued , in a strikingly upbeat assessment of her condition . " She is a fighter like nobody else I know . " <p> For a community and a country in shock and mourning , the extraordinary progress of Miss Giffords , 40 , is not only a source of delight and relief . It is also playing a cathartic role in America 's national healing process after 22-year-old Jared Loughner embarked on his murderous shooting spree with a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol . <p> And that recovery entered a new phase this weekend after she was flown by air ambulance to Houston - with Capt Kelly , her mother , medics and aides at her side - for treatment at one of the country 's top rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a rousing send-off as her motorcade , escorted by military veterans on motorbikes , swept past cheering crowds . Inside the ambulance , the congresswoman smiled and tears welled in her eyes when she heard the shouts and applause . " It was very emotional and very special , " said Dr Randall Friese , a trauma surgeon travelling with her . " Her reaction showed she knew what was going on . " <p> Before she left , she was wheeled out of her room at the University Medical Centre in Tucson to enjoy the sunshine of the Sonora desert for the first time since the attack and a view of the breath-taking Santa Catalina mountains . <p> Uncertainty about the damage to her vision remains . But Capt Kelly was in no doubt that a smile of recognition spread across his wife 's face as she looked across at the range in whose foothills she grew up . <p> And then he gave a promise to the surgeons and nurses at UMC that she would soon be back in person to express her gratitude for saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 've been telling the hospital staff that they should expect to see her walking through these halls within a couple of months , " he said . " I 'm sure of that . She 'll be back . " <p> It is possible she will manage that , say her surgeons . They warn , however , that despite the advances of the last two weeks , how far and fast she will recover remains unclear . <p> " I do want to caution that she has a long road ahead of her , " said Dr Michael Lemole , the chief neurosurgeon at UMC . " It is not uncommon for someone to initially improve and then plateau for a little while and then improve again , so everyone has to gear their expectations for what she 's willing to show for us as opposed to what we want . " <p> It is not known what she knows or understands about her condition . Capt Kelly has told his wife that she was shot and is in hospital , but he has not shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her " Congress on your Corner " forum outside a shopping mall - or that six people are dead . <p> The astronaut was at his home in Texas near the Nasa Johnson Space Centre , where he was preparing to lead the final US space shuttle mission in April , when his wife 's chief of staff called him as he was talking to his daughter Claudia about her use of text messages . <p> " Gabby 's been shot , " was the devastating message . Mr Kelly immediately called a friend with private plane to fly him to Tucson , then heard media reports that his wife of barely three years was dead . " I just walked into the bathroom and broke down , " he said . " To hear that she died is just , it 's devastating for me .

The bullet passed through the left side of her brain , which controls movement on the right hand side of her body , vision , language and emotional responses . It is unclear how these functions will recover . <p> In Houston , Dr Gerardo Francisco , chief medical officer at Memorial Hermann hospital , said she has " great rehabilitation potential " . Dr Dong Kim , a neurosurgeon at the hospital , said : " She looks spectacular " but added that major challenges face her . He said that she has some " weakness or paralysis " on her right side and may have trouble walking . <p> Yet some 90 per cent of people shot through the brain do not even survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three feet , she benefited from the trajectory of the single bullet and indeed his proximity to her . <p> It did not cross hemispheres from left to right or right to left , a path that would have almost certainly been fatal , but instead entered the left rear of her head and exited the left front near her eye . And had he been further away , the bullet could have exploded in her head or caused broader injuries as it passed through her brain . <p> Miss Giffords has benefited from the sort of medical expertise in treating traumatic brain injuries that is a beneficial spin-off of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Part of her skull has been removed to allow the swelling of the brain that followed the attack and she was flown in a protective helmet to Houston . Her doctors will decide in the future whether to put that section of skull back or replace it with a synthetic version . <p> But just as important a role as medical science has undoubtedly played in her progress , Miss Giffords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grit and fight as a true daughter of the West . She grew up riding horses at home on 18 acres of cactus and mesquite , later moved on to driving Harley Davidsons and is also an enthusiastic runner , roller-blader and cyclist . <p> She displayed that toughness by winning three congressional elections as a centrist Democrat in a conservative-leaning district - particularly last November when she was subjected to feverish attacks by her Tea Party foe . <p> Miss Giffords opposes the death penalty , supports immigration reform but also backs gun rights and owns a 9mm Glock - the same weapon with which Loughner tried to kill her . <p> She was born into a prominent Jewish Tucson business family - her grandfather , the son of a Lithuanian rabbi , founded a successful tire company in what was then a sleepy desert town and pit-stop . <p> She initially had other plans for her career , taking a job with the accounting firm Price Waterhouse in Manhattan after receiving a master 's degree at the Ivy League institution of Cornell .

Four years later , she oversaw its sale to the tire giant Goodyear and moved into politics , winning a seat in the Arizona state legislature . <p> Her unconventional style was in full display at her wedding to Capt Kelly in Nov 2007 .

Woodlee , the hit show 's choreo ? grapher , is fretting a bit ; he is waiting in his studio for an update from the producers ' office . He needs to know the musical and vocal arrangements of the songs he will be working with this week . And without the music , Glee is nothing . <p> ' Every TV show has a wrinkle to it , ' says the co-executive producer Ian Brennan . ' Some shows have car chases that take a long time to shoot , or hospital surgeries . Ours is music , that 's our thing . That 's the elephant in the room that we always have to be working around . That 's the tricky part . ' <p> Funny , emotional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William McKinley High School in smalltown Ohio .

Even the teaching staff -- notably , the hilariously horrifying PE teacher Sue Sylvester -- is largely disdainful . The repertoire of the glee club teenagers includes happy-clappy versions of youth-friendly pop , rock and R&amp;B tunes . But they are generally lampooned for their love of Broadway showtunes and their willingness to break into song and dance in matching outfits as they struggle their way through a national show choir competition . <p> Twenty months since its US debut ( it premiered in Britain last January ) , Glee regularly attracts an average of 12 million American viewers .

The Fab Four achieved 71 Hot 100 singles between 1964 and 1996 ; Glee managed 75 in only 16 months . <p> Since Glee premiered in America in May 2009 , the cast have released nine soundtrack albums and ( at time of writing ) 139 singles . Album sales stand at five million , digital single sales at 13 million . The cast have performed for President Obama at the White House , guested on The Oprah Winfrey Show , appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine , and sold out an arena concert tour in America . <p> Ian Brennan was working as an actor in New York when , in August 2005 , he wrote the first version of Glee . The script was based on his experiences at school in Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was still funny , but it was a wryer , darker view of it , ' Brennan recalls .

' <p> None the less , Brennan felt that glee clubs ' were always a very rich environment -- how much music weaves in and out of your life . When I think back to high school , it has a very definite soundtrack . That 's probably the kernel of the show for me .

A former ' dance captain ' for Madonna ( he worked on her 2004 Re-Invention tour ) , Woodlee knows all about pressure . Equally , all of the cast understand the narrative importance of making sure the musical performances hit the right note . <p> Ryan Murphy is the writer/director/producer who is in overall charge of the top-to-bottom detail -- narrative , musical , visual -- that makes Glee such giddily entertaining viewing . ' Obsessive ' is the word most used by his colleagues to describe him . He directed the recent Julia Roberts film Eat Pray Love , and was previously best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was doing Nip/Tuck it was very hard and relentless , ' Murphy says , ' just because there was a very heavy feeling . And I was thinking , " I want to be happier at the end of the day . I want to write something where , at the end of an hour , you feel good . " ' <p> When Glee was still an unmade film script , a friend introduced Ian Brennan to Murphy and Brad Falchuk , who had worked together on Nip/Tuck . They persuaded him that Glee would work better as a television show . The three , who are now co-executive producers and writers of all the episodes , ' re-envisioned it ' and pitched it to the Fox network . <p> ' I had just done the world 's darkest , sickest drama , ' Murphy says of Nip/Tuck . ' And Fox paid me a development deal , thinking that I was going to do more twisted sex dramas , which is what they really wanted , I think . ' But instead he told the network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges me that I think has never been done before . I want to do a musical . ' <p> He says the people at Fox were initially perplexed , but he persisted . ' I kept saying , " This could be a way to sort of complement the talent show American Idol , which your network has always been looking to do , and you 've never figured out how to do it ... " ' Fox was convinced , and the pilot episode of Glee duly aired right after an episode of American Idol . It was an immediate hit . <p> Some of the young cast had been equally confused at first . ' I had no idea in my head what the show would be like , because the concept of music in TV seemed so weird , ' Kevin McHale , the ( able-bodied ) actor who plays Artie , remembers . ' But when I read the script , it just worked . The humour was completely self-deprecating .

Jenna Ushkowitz , who plays the ' Asian vampire ' Tina , and Lea Michele ( needy ambition-monster Rachel ) are also Broadway veterans . Ushkowitz 's time on stage ' definitely taught me discipline , ' she says . ' Performance-wise , it 's different to performing on TV , but you 're still singing and dancing . Any training at all will help you with the schedule that we have .

In terms of his singing , Monteith is honest about his performances . He is pleased with his recent attempt at a ' tuned-up ' version of REM 's Losing My Religion , but is less keen on ' any of the early performances . I hear a song like REO Speedwagon 's Ca n't Fight This Feeling , and I hear all the work and the production that went into it to make me sound good . ' <p> Glee 's song choices , Brennan explains , emerge during ' story-breaking ' , when he , Murphy and Falchuk are coming up with storylines before writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan 's strongest suits , ' Brennan says . ' He has a weird , near-encyclopaedic knowledge of two things : what people wore to the Oscars , going back to the beginning of the Academy Awards , and top-40 music going back through the 1970s . ' <p> Hence Glee 's wildly eclectic song selection : the show smoothly sequences cover versions of show tunes ( Do n't Rain on My Parade from Funny Girl ) and soft rock ( Do n't Stop Believin ' by Journey ) next to contemporary pop and hip-hop by the likes of Lily Allen and Kanye West . <p> In terms of securing the rights to feature -- then rearrange , then release commercially -- original songs , Murphy remembers that ' when we first started , no one had really seen the show , but there were a couple of heavy hitters who liked that the show was about supporting the arts . ' He cites Rihanna , Beyonc ? , Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand as artists ' who very instantly said , we do n't know what this is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , go with God . ' <p> With the show providing a new kind of promotional platform -- as well as the cast 's versions hitting the charts , the original songs and artists have also benefited commercially -- artists are now clamouring to have their songs featured . According to Brennan , even Paul McCartney sent the producers a mix tape of his compositions . <p> Murphy admits that the songs are ' all just very personal choices for me , songs that I love . But the first thing we do is come up with the script -- what 's the story , what 's the theme ? -- and then we come up with the songs ... You know , it 's really fun for me . It 's like therapy . I revisit my childhood at least once a week . ' <p> Glee is n't only about fun and escapism .

Because Kurt is strong , he 's brave , he 's a hero . He 's not a constant punchbag or punchline . He 's someone that people can look up to . ' In dealing with issues such as homophobia , bullying and difficult parent-child relations -- Kurt lives with his widowed , stoutly blue-collar father -- ' they 've handled such sensitive material very delicately . ' <p> Glee , the cast note , is inclusive on every level , and works hard to tackle the issues that affect young people , from teenage pregnancy and sexuality to body image and divorce . ' In one of the episodes with my character they shine a light on self-confidence , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones . ' It dealt with some food issues : not harming your body , eating healthily and being healthy . Mercedes is all about being confident and loving herself . That 's her message and her character . ' <p> ' At the end of the day you do n't see 11 people and someone in a wheelchair , ' Kevin McHale says . ' You see 12 glee club members . ' But equally , the show is not overly saccharine . Sue Sylvester comes out with some wonderfully vinegary lines about the glee club 's overweight , sluttish and sexually ' deviant ' members . ' That 's real life , ' McHale continues . ' It 's not like , oh , you need to be sensitive . High school is not always sensitive . That 's the difference when people compare us to High School Musical , ' he says of Disney 's sweet'n'smiley movie trilogy , Glee 's most immediate antecedent . <p> ' Glee presents this idealised world where no matter who you are or how different you are from the " norm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee club , ' says Jane Lynch , who plays Sylvester , and who is also gay . ' And you 're going to be held up as unique , and you 're going to be loved for it . Also , raising your voice in song is one of the most courageous things you can do . And I think people really respond to that . ' <p> Back on the Glee set in LA , the cast have gathered around the piano in their school rehearsal room . The afternoon is winding on , and they are filming scene 46a , which features the sixth and closing number in this week 's episode . In the background , Lea Michele is having one of her tattoos covered by a make-up artist . Already the recipient of an award from the music industry magazine Billboard and the cover star of women 's magazines , she is the one cast member who would not be interviewed for this story . <p> The cameras start rolling .

' Cue Dog Days Are Over by Florence and the Machine , another left-field but instantly appropriate song choice . <p> Ask the cast and crew why they think Glee has struck such a chord all over the world , and they all reply differently . But Chris Colfer -- recently nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Kurt -- has perhaps the most comprehensive answer . ' It 's three things : there 's something everyone can relate to , whether it 's a character or a situation ; it 's the music -- it just has this magical way of connecting everybody ; and it promotes emotion . High school is such a trying , horrible time for everybody . Your hormones are crazy , your body 's changing , all kinds of things are happening .

Probiotics greatly help my IBS and I wondered if there is anything similar for GORD without resorting to surgery ? Laura Hanson , email <p> DR DAN RUTHERFORD WRITES : <p> A Reflux of stomach contents back up the gullet is a very common problem and many of the symptoms this causes , like heartburn , are due to stomach acid . <p> Proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) such as omeprazole and lansoprazole effectively switch off stomach acid production and have become by far the most commonly used drugs for this condition . They are safe in long-term usage , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other " non-drug " things that will reduce their symptoms . <p> Weight loss helps , by encouraging the muscular valve at the lower end of the gullet to remain shut rather than lie open . <p> Raising the head of the bed by 5-10cm employs gravity to keep stomach contents where they should be when you are lying down . <p> Avoidance of late meals also prevents food and other digestive juices , such as bile , from refluxing and causing just as much bother as acid . <p> Some people find particular foods give them more reflux than others -- you need to experiment a bit to find what you should avoid . Little research has been done on the use of probiotics for reflux in adults but there is some suggestion they might be helpful in children and infants . <p> Reflux is a complicated condition with more to it than acid alone . For example , if you find that a PPI at full dose does not help your symptoms then you might benefit from seeing a specialist who can go into more detail about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) is a condition in which the oesophagus ( the tube leading to the stomach ) becomes irritated or inflamed because of acid backing up from the stomach , causing the burning sensation of heartburn ( so called because the oesophagus lies just behind the heart ) . <p> The stomach produces hydrochloric acid after a meal to aid the digestion of food . Normally , this acid is kept from backing up into your oesophagus by the oesophageal sphincter , a ring of muscle which functions as a valve and opens only as you swallow . But sometimes the valve relaxes or weakens , allowing stomach acid to flow back up , and into your oesophagus . <p> Although there is little scientific evidence of the efficacy of lifestyle measures , many people report improvements when they change their diet and other habits . <p> Being overweight puts extra pressure on the stomach and this encourages reflux , so losing any excess weight , if this applies to you , may ease the symptoms . <p> Food and drink commonly reported to trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , citrus fruits , peppermint , tomatoes , garlic and onions . Caffeine in coffee , tea and cola and theobromine in chocolate have been reported to worsen symptoms , and alcohol and excessive amounts of vitamin C ( from supplements ) can also increase acid secretion . <p> You could try keeping a food diary to help identify what may be triggering your symptoms . <p> How and when you eat is just as important . Sitting up straight and maintaining good posture will help food and acid pass through the stomach instead of backing up into the oesophagus . <p> Also , avoid eating within three hours of bedtime as this will allow your stomach to empty and acid production to decrease . Never lie down straight after eating . <p> Eating a lot of food at any one time will increase the amount of acid needed to digest it , so eat smaller , more frequent meals so that you have less food in the stomach at any time . <p> TONY GALLAGHER WRITES : <p> A There is a place for exercise considerations here . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ligaments and tendons , in addition to disturbance of sleep patterns , some type of exercise should help alleviate the symptoms . With acid reflux , watching and managing your weight can also help , and exercise plays a part there , too . If you are feeling fatigued it may well be the last thing you wish to do but bear in mind the potential benefits . <p> Firstly , avoid the exercises that can potentially cause acid reflux . Jarring and high-impact exercises such as jogging , do not help . Excessive contraction of stomach muscles can induce symptoms of GORD . <p> Keep your exercise as low-impact as possible . Cycling , swimming or walking should be the most beneficial exercises for you . Tai Qi is also a nice , low-impact form of exercise that looks to improve circulation , to strengthen the muscles of the pelvis and to increase flexibility in the hip region . It is also thought to reduce pain and fight fatigue and depression , so is worth considering . <p> The aim of meditation is to help you relax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . A combination of exercise and meditation can be found in Qi Gong , an ancient Chinese practice that helps improve the immune system , aids flexibility in muscles and improves skeletal alignment . <p> As always , eat sensibly before exercising , keep hydrated and wait one or two hours after you have eaten before you begin . Pace and adapt your exercises , and stop before it hurts . If taking your medication causes you to experience heartburn during exercise it may be prudent to talk to your doctor about whether you should be taking it before exercise at all . <p> Kathryn Whittaker ( **34;114;TOOLONG ) has a free newsletter providing methods for tackling acid reflux , heartburn and GORD and this may be of help to you . <p> SECOND OPINION : Dr Jame LeFanu <p> Out on a limb with itchy feet <p> The legs and feet are obviously indispensable for sustaining the downward weight of the body while simultaneously propelling it forwards .

@@3980236 <p> Q We live in a four-bedroom detached house with a condensing boiler . When the heating comes on in the mornings , the radiators in the bedrooms and bathrooms heat up quickly . <p> However , the radiator in the kitchen and one of the two in the sitting room are barely warm by the time the heating goes off two hours later . The heating has to be on for several hours for these radiators to become hot . A friend has suggested that the system may need balancing . <p> Could you explain what this means and is it something we could do ourselves ? AM , by email <p> A As I wrote a couple of weeks ago , balancing the radiators in a wet central heating system is an operation that plumbers and heating engineers used to carry out as a matter of course . <p> Since the widespread and mandatory fitting of thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) however , the practice has become sadly neglected . <p> At its simplest , balancing means adjusting the radiator valves so that the radiators all heat up at the same rate . If a radiator is too cool , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another is too hot , then the flow through it needs restricting . Balancing is achieved using the balancing or " lockshield " valve -- the one at the opposite end of the radiator to the main on/off wheel valve or TRV . <p> The term " lockshield " means that once adjusted , the valve is shielded with a plastic cap that prevents it being accidentally changed . Balancing is a simple operation that any competent householder should be able to do . <p> Start by fully opening the main wheel valves or TRVs on all the radiators . Then unscrew or prise off the plastic caps on the lockshield valves . In most cases this will reveal a half-moon-section brass spindle sticking out of the top of the valve , which can be turned using a small adjustable spanner . Try to avoid using pliers , as the jaws might slip and burr the spindle . <p> Then , starting with the radiator nearest the boiler , close the lockshield valve completely off ( fully clockwise ) and then open it a one-quarter turn . Do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a turn . And so on until the radiator furthest from the boiler , which should have the lockshield valve fully open . <p> With the boiler and pump running , see how quickly the radiators warm up and how comfortable the rooms are . Make further small adjustments until the system is balanced to your satisfaction . Then replace the plastic covers on the lockshield valves . <p> A more precise method is to use a pair of clip-on pipe thermometers on the flow and return pipes at either end of the radiator . Starting with the radiator nearest the boiler , adjust the lockshield valve until you get a temperature drop of 11C across the two pipes . Then move on to the others in turn . <p> QThe inner rubber core of my shower hose is broken . Can I replace the rubber tube or do I have to get a brand new shower hose ?

Often these timbers are simply ceiling joists or wall studs which were never meant to be left exposed . A main beam is a large load-bearing member , usually hidden within the wall structure . A secondary beam spans two main beams , to lessen the span of upstairs floor joists and might well be left on display .

A news ? studio was set aside on a Saturday morning and we worked through a fictional scenario .

He wanted me in the office to take over from Martyn Lewis , who had been on air since the early hours . <p> None of the rehearsals we 'd done could have prepared us for this , the violent and sudden death of the Princess who had been virtually ostracised by the Royal Family .

The BBC has a policy on everything , yet , when the chips are down , presenters make up editorial policy as they go along . On that day , every nuance , every question , was mine and mine alone . ? Editorial policy was what I thought fit . <p> Goodbye : The Royal family stand by the Queen Mother 's coffin at her funeral service inside Westminster Abbey in April 2002 <p> I was to learn subsequently that if you get it right the BBC will take the credit ; if you get it wrong , you are on your own . <p> Three weeks later , the top brass of the BBC took themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana coverage , from the first newsflash through the whole extraordinary week of mass grieving to the funeral . <h> HERE 'S THE NEWS , I 'M A MATE OF THE BEATLES ! <p> Friends : A young Peter Sissons , ringed , John Lennon , centre , and Jimmy Tarbuck <p> I was born in Liverpool in 1942 and grew up as part of what would be known as the Beatles generation . As it happened , I knew three of them . I was at the same primary school as John Lennon and George Harrison ( not to mention Jimmy Tarbuck ) and the same grammar school as Paul McCartney . <p> Many years later when I was at ITN , I was called to reception to see some visitors who had asked for me . <p> There I found a dozen or more Hare Krishna devotees in their distinctive saffron robes and from among them stepped forward a familiar face . It was George . <p> The Beatles had dabbled in Eastern mysticism , notably with the Maharishi , but Harrison had gone further than the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He had come to ITN House on a mission -- to bring their message to the nation .

It has to be the lead story . ' <p> My mind raced . Even if it did n't make a lead item , ex-Beatles ( as they were then , the band having split up ) were still big news . So , what was this big story , I asked . <p> He moved closer , took my arm , looked me in the eye , and said one word -- ' Peace ' . <p> Resisting my instinct to say ' Is that all ? ' I asked him to go through the Big Story again . ' Peace , ' he said again and then repeated it two or three times more . Then he and his friends drifted towards the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back towards their familiar territory on Oxford Street . <p> No hint of dissatisfaction came from this post-mortem , but what was really puzzling was that neither I nor any other presenter , producer or editor working on that first day was invited to join the discussion or submit their views . Nor were any conclusions that were reached ? conveyed officially to those of us who had actually done the work . <p> Yet , as I was to find out when I drew the short straw on the next royal death , the editorial policy for royal deaths was subsequently reviewed and changed . In 2001 , new guidelines were decided upon after a heated internal debate at the very top of the BBC . <p> Realistically , there was only one death on the horizon that the BBC could plan for , that of the Queen Mother . But the old lady was nothing like as popular inside the BBC as she was in the country , and there was high-level opposition among senior managers to going overboard when she died . <p> Front page of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor , apparently , was the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in the United States . The controller of BBC1 , Lorraine Heggessey , was concerned that coverage of one royal death , when it came , should not seem excessive compared with the thousands who died in America . In a little-noticed speech to a professional body known as the Broadcasting Press Guild , Heggessey said plans for wall-to-wall deferential coverage had been abandoned . <p> Instead , it would be ' in tune with the times ' , and the amount of ? coverage decided only after assessing the depth of public mourning -- ' we will take the temperature on the day ' . <p> Rather than giving a lead to the nation -- as one might expect -- the BBC had decided to see which way the wind was blowing before responding fully to the death of the former Queen . <p> Heggessey 's remarks were not widely reported , and certainly not circulated to the journalistic ? ? infantry at the BBC . My reaction was that if there was anything in them , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . <p> And even if they had been , there was an underlying problem . The new policy , if that 's what it was , did n't address what we would actually do when the Queen Mother passed away . That became my problem . She died in the afternoon of Saturday , March 30 , 2002 . And , yet again , I was on duty . <p> In news terms , there was n't much happening that day , certainly no hint that , six weeks after her last public appearance , the 101-year-old Queen Mother was fading fast . Not for her the weeks of daily medical bulletins that preceded the death of Winston Churchill . Her time came privately and quietly , and only the closest members of her family were alerted . <p> I was the newscaster that day . ( Michael Buerk was on holiday , as he had been when Diana died .

Astonishingly , we were kept in the dark . <p> Popular : The Queen Mother was much-loved by the general public throughout her long life <p> Looking back , I still ca n't believe that we were given only 20 minutes notice of such a broadcast , when the BBC had been privy to the knowledge of the Queen Mother 's death for more than an hour and a half . <p> Earlier that afternoon , I had been surprised to glimpse a few of the BBC 's editorial bigwigs in the building , a weekend rarity . I assumed they were having some secret ? meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that , if something important was happening , they would keep it from the news team . <p> Now we had to move very fast .

Inside were four ties . <h> It was not my finest hour , I freely admit . I looked uncomfortable and I was . The text had some minor errors , the product of the haste in which it was written . I failed to read it fluently , but I blame no one for that but myself . <p> There was a normal striped tie for everyday use and a black tie , of course , plus two ' sombre ' ones that I kept in case I had to announce some awful disaster and the tie I 'd come to work in was considered too colourful . <p> Of the sombre ties , one was deep burgundy , and I took that and the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV news .

There was no hesitation . The most senior figure in the newsroom at that moment ? indicated the burgundy . <p> Then , as I walked towards the newsroom door to go to the studio , the weekend editor caught me up . ' Do n't go overboard , ' he said , ' she 's a very old woman who had to go some time . ' <p> At this point , the script was still being written and I had n't seen it .

But with what ? This was the moment that the BBC had talked about and rehearsed for the best part of a decade . <p> Yet , for editorial guidance , all we had to go on was the vague policy that had filtered down from on high that the whole panoply of black-edged mourning might not be appropriate . <p> After we 'd run an eight- or nine-minute obituary , it began to dawn on me that we had very little other pre-prepared material to work with . Thank God for ? Jennie Bond , who arrived and immediately dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background and anecdote .

Her name , they told me , was Lady Margaret Rhodes , and they put her on air immediately . ( I called her ' Lady Margaret ' , not knowing that they 'd got her title wrong and she was plain Mrs Rhodes . ) <p> I asked when she had last seen the Queen Mother and she replied : ' I left at half past three this afternoon . ' From this , I realised that Mrs Rhodes might actually have been at the deathbed . She confirmed this , and it took me a second or two to take this in .

It was just a few members of the family , but the great thing was that the Queen was there . ' We then talked about the Queen Mother 's ' tremendous life ' and that was it . <p> In the following days , this interview caused a storm . I was accused of showing no human feeling and of being intrusive and insensitive . Yet Mrs Rhodes was dry-eyed and matter-of-fact throughout .

I knew that it was n't like that , but nonetheless I felt quite lonely . <p> There was one more shock to come . I was at home when the BBC Press office rang . A female voice inquired , ? solicitously , had I seen the papers ? I asked what the Press office was saying in reply to inquiries .

' My constipation was awful : ? sometimes I could n't go to the loo for up to ten days and this caused my tummy to swell up like a ? balloon . I would bloat from a size ten to a size 14 in days ; none of my clothes would fit . I suffered stomach cramps and acid reflux .

Psychological Medicine Unit . <p> ' When I was told I was going to see a psychiatrist I felt slightly defensive again , ' says Angela . <p> ' But it was explained that no one was in any way doubting I had the physical gut symptoms -- just that they had been ? unable to find a physical cause and that sometimes conditions such as stress and emotional trauma can affect the gut . <p> ' Because I trusted the advice given at St Mark 's I decided to give it a chance -- it helped that the Psychological Medicine Unit was within the hospital and not in a mental health unit . ' <p> In fact , there is now a growing body of scientific evidence to show a link between psychological feelings such as stress and gut problems . <p> As Dr Julian Stern , the unit 's consultant psychiatrist in ? psychotherapy , explains : ?

Dealing with those issues may improve some of the symptoms . ' <p> The unit , which was set up in 2005 , treats about 150 patients a year -- about half of them have IBS symptoms , while others ? suffer from a variety of gut ? problems , including intestinal failure ( where patients can no longer absorb food and need to be fed by an intravenous line ) and Crohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At Angela 's first consultation with Dr Stern they discussed the relationship between stress and the bowel .

@@3982231 <p> Back in November 2006 , I remember sitting in a lecture at Oxford University 's Sa ? d Business Schoolbeing delivered by Matt Cohler ( employee number five at Facebook and founding team member at LinkedIn ) entitled : " What is Silicon Valley ? " . Cohler explained the geography , physical components and mindset of Silicon Valley , and I 've had the good fortune to travel there a number of times since then to see these characteristics for myself . <p> In the lecture , I remember contrasting the Valley with what I knew of Europe - in particular , London . We were lagging behind . There were start-ups dotted around , but not clustered in large numbers . There were one or two start-up networking events each month . Venture capitalists wanted six figures of revenue before investing . Angel investors generally did n't understand the internet . Times were tough . <p> Jump ahead two years , to November 2008 : the overall economy may have been in turmoil , but significant leaps were being made in entrepreneurship , most notably by Saul Klein , founder of Video Island ( now LOVEFiLM ) and Partner at Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary ingredients to build the next generation of world-beating businesses . All that was required now was that they be brought together . <p> Based on these observations , Klein began what would turn out to be two key catalysts . Firstly , OpenCoffee , a weekly networking event for entrepreneurs and investors that served as the first port of call for many start-up founders , from which they could start navigating the ecosystem . Having started in London in 2007 , it has since grown to over 130 locations worldwide , of which over half are in Europe . Secondly , Seedcamp , the early stage investment program . <p> In addition to Klein 's efforts , Alastair Mitchell and Andy McLoughlin , founders of London-based start-up Huddle , started DrinkTank in May 2008 , an elite invitation-only event for founders , chief executives and investors in technology start-ups . <p> If we fast-forward again , to January 2011 , almost four years after Klein made his observation , all the ingredients have indeed now come together . London is the capital , and Europe has everything necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces world-class companies . <p> Silicon Valley has been around a lot longer than London and is more mature , but London now has the same ingredients - and , crucially , they are now gelling together . <p> While the Valley has a dense population of technology start-ups in and around San Francisco , we have over a hundred in and around Shoreditch ; while they have Starbucks on University Avenue , we have Benugo by Old Street roundabout ; while they have venture capital firms scattered all over Menlo Park , we do throughout Mayfair ; while they have Y Combinator , we have Seedcamp ; while they have Plug and Play , we have TechHub ; while they have so many start-up networking events that you could go to one every night of the week , we do too ; while they have Stanford , Harvard and MIT producing wave after wave of super-smart , hungry entrepreneurs , we have Cambridge , Oxford and Imperial College ; while they have gifted engineers moving to Silicon Valley in droves from states all over the US ; we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU . You get the idea . <p> I founded my start-up , GroupSpaces , in October 2007 with fellow Oxford graduate Andy Young . Our first proper hire was an Imperial College engineer who moved to Oxford to join us in June 2008 . In 2010 , we raised $1.3million from European venture capital firm Index Ventures , who also backed Skype , Betfair and Last.fm , along with a consortium of angel investors based in both London and Silicon Valley . We moved the company to east London in order to be at the heart of what was happening in Europe , and , since then , we 've hired four more engineers , two of whom moved from Hungary to join us in London . <p> If you speak with the founders of Songkick , Playfire , Conversocial , Brainient , Spoonfed , Smarkets or any of the other fast-growing London-based start-ups , you will hear similar stories of a maturing European ecosystem satisfying their needs . <p> There are also a couple of fantastic events that now take place each year for the founders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastminute.com , started the Founders Forum in 2007 , which takes place in June each year for 100 to 150 European founders , investors and select other guests . In 2010 , Irish entrepreneur Paddy Cosgrave started the " F.ounders " event that hosted over 120 ( mostly European ) technology company founders in Dublin , including the people behind Twitter , YouTube and Skype . <p> So when you see people write " Spotify ? Mendeley ? Huddle ? Mind Candy ? Moo ? Skimlinks ? Yeah , I 'll give you those -- but only those . If you can name 94 other promising young tech companies ... " it makes you wonder whether they 've been listening at all . Or is it that the invitations have dried up since they moved away ? <p> As well as the physical ingredients coming together , attitudes are also changing . Huddle founder Alastair Mitchell has said : " Historically in the UK , people built a business over 20 years , sold it and f***ed off to the Cotswolds to have a family . Whereas in Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and started investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs . " These patterns have led to a virtuous circle in Silicon Valley of more and more successful entrepreneurs , whereas in Europe , there 's been a vicious , repetitive cycle in which hardly any entrepreneurs mentor the next generation . <p> But a growing number of successful entrepreneurs in Europe are bucking that trend , and starting venture capital firms soon after their big exits . For example , Hoberman , who sold Lastminute.com to Travelocity for $1.01billion , and Michael Birch , who founded Bebo and sold it to AOL for $850million , together started PROfounders Capital in 2009 . Jos and Ben White , who together started MessageLabs and sold it to Symantec for $695million in 2008 , started Notion Capital later in 2008 . And Niklas Zennstr ? m and Janus Friis , who together founded Skype and sold it to eBay for $2.6 billion , started Atomico Ventures in 2006 . <p> The attitude change is n't just at the classic VC level either . In addition to a growing number of **26;405;TOOLONG investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein , Alex Hoye and William Reeve , the VCs are stepping down : Index Ventures launched a $10million seed fund last year and many others , such as Eden Ventures , Accel Partners and Atomico Ventures , are doing an increasing number of seed deals . <p> Further evidence of the promising European start-ups emerging is that more and more Silicon Valley angel investors are travelling over to Europe multiple times each year to do deals . Leading the charge is another Start-Up 100 guest columnist , Dave McClure , who has invested in four UK-based start-ups in the past year , including my own , through his new fund , 500 Startups . <p> Skype founder Niklas Zennstr ? m recently commented on the changes : " Now is the healthiest the European start-up market has ever been . When we were seeking funding for Skype in 2002 to 2003 , we went to 26 different VCs , asking for ? 1.5million in exchange for up to a third of the company , but no one in Europe wanted to invest and we had to bootstrap it ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , great technology , we wanted to go out and change the telecommunications industry - but they saw something they had n't seen before , and they did n't want to bet on that . Today , the whole culture in Europe - from talent to funding - is so much healthier : you have people who take risks , more entrepreneurs , and more investors who know what it takes to bet on people rather than on companies with cash flow . An ecosystem is being built . " <p> And if you 're an entrepreneur complaining about Europe not being a good place to build acompany , I have some simple advice for you : come to London , stop whinging and get on with it - because everything you need to build a billion dollar company is right here on your doorstep .

@@3987236 <h> Jones v Jones 2011 EWCA Civ 41 <p> Appeal by wife against ancillary relief order made by Charles J , in which he awarded her ? 5.4 million from a total asset pool of ? 25 million . Appeal allowed . <p> The parties married in 1996 and separated in 2006 . At the date of marriage the husband owned a business with a value at that time of ? 2 million . At the date of separation the business was worth ? 12 million , but by the date of sale of the business in 2007 the value had increased and the husband sold the business with a net profit to him of ? 25 million . The husband was 58 years old and the wife 44 years old , the marriage did not produce any children but the parties had treated the wife 's child from a previous marriage as a child of the family . The wife had received substantial financial support from her mother prior to the marriage and during it , including assistance with which she had purchased a home valued at ? 2.1 million which was not included in the list of assets for division . The evidence suggested that the wife would continue to benefit from this support into the future . At the date of the final hearing , having taken the legal costs of both parties into account , the total assets available for distribution amounted to approximately ? 25 million . <p> The appeal was heard by Wilson LJ ( who gave the lead judgment ) , Arden LJ and Wall LJ . The appeal allowed and the court held that Charles J had been right to include the increase in value of the business between 2006 and 2007 as part of the matrimonial acquest because that increase was due to the latent value of the business at the date of separation and not to a new venture . <p> The approach in GW v. RW ( Financial Provision : Departure from Equality ) 2003 EWHC 611 , 2003 2 FLR 108 which provided that a spouse 's established earning capacity at the date of the marriage falls to be capitalised , or otherwise brought into account , for the purpose of the sharing principle was formally overruled . <p> The court should take into account the value of the latent potential or ' springboard effect ' as well as passive economic growth when assessing the value of the company as at the date of the marriage . This was not reflected in the ? 2 million valuation . While this calculation was inevitably arbitrary , taking into account all the evidence , the fair value to ascribe was ? 9 million . ( Note that Wilson LJ and Arden LJ took different approaches to the valuation of passive economic growth in relation to a business that has been actively managed during the marriage . ) <p> On that basis the court found that ? 16 million of the proceeds of sale of the husband 's business should be treated as matrimonial property . Application of the sharing principle would give the wife an award of ? 8 million . There was no reason in this case to depart from equality in the application of the sharing principle and the appeal was therefore granted in that ? 8 million would be substituted for the sum of ? 5.4 million awarded by Charles J. <p> The court took the opportunity to state that first instance judges should endeavour to limit their judgments to a precise summary of the issues and their findings . <p> Lord Justice Wilson : 1 . The wife ( as it will be convenient to call her notwithstanding the grant of a decree absolute of divorce ) appeals against an order for ancillary relief made in her favour against the husband ( as it will be convenient to call him ) by Mr Justice Charles in the High Court , Family Division , on 23 February 2010 . In order to make my judgment as digestible as possible I propose to round all the judge 's figures up or down . The judge awarded to the wife a lump sum of ? 5.4m on a clean break basis . Of that sum ? 0.4m was designed as a further and final payment by the husband in respect of the wife 's costs of her application : for they amounted to ? 0.8m , in respect of which he had already reimbursed her to the extent only of ? 0.4m . The husband 's own costs amounted to ? 0.9m . In combination the parties ' costs of the proceedings were therefore ? 1.7m . The substantive hearing proceeded for ten days in June and July 2009 and followed a hearing , before the judge in March 2009 which , although expected on both sides to be the substantive hearing , had under his guidance become a protracted debate over three days about further disclosure . <p> 2 . Exclusive of the provision in respect of costs , the judge 's award to the wife was therefore in the sum of ? 5m . Her contention on this appeal is that , exclusive of , or if not inclusive of , the provision in respect of costs , it should have been in the sum of ? 10m . <p> 3 . The judge released his judgment for publication but on an anonymised basis , i.e. as J v. J. Its citation number is 2010 EWHC 2654 . It has 484 paragraphs . An article on the judgment , by Mr Ashley Murray of counsel , has recently been published in 2010 Family Law , Vol 40 , at 1111 . Mr Murray introduced his article as follows : <p> " There are certain challenges each of us should attempt in our lifetime and for most these involve a particular jump , a mountain climb , etc . Akin to these in the legal world would be reading from first to last a judgment of Charles J. One of his most recent is J v. J ... " <p> Mr Murray 's introductory sentences were witty and brave . In respect at any rate of the judgment in the present case , they were also , I am sorry to say , apposite . The judgment is a monument to the intellectual energy of the judge . Nevertheless , notwithstanding my extreme personal discomfort in saying so , I feel driven to describe it as far too long , too discursive and too unwieldy . I have devoted days to trying to understand it . So have the parties ' advisers , at substantial further cost to the parties themselves . With respect to a colleague whom I greatly admire , I refuse to accept that our modern principles of ancillary relief are as complex as the content of the judgment of Charles J implies . <p> 4 . The appeal raises a point which I formulate as follows : <p> When an asset of a spouse -- in this case a husband -- represents the proceeds of sale of a company which he brought into the marriage and built up during it , how is the attribution of part of the proceeds to the husband 's ownership of it at the date of the marriage to be conducted for the purposes of the sharing principle and , in particular , does the exercise of attribution permit focus not only on the value of the company at the date of the marriage but also on the husband 's personal capacity at that date to build it up in the future ? <p> 5 . The husband is aged 58 and the wife is aged 44 . They were married in June 1996 . There was no child of the marriage but , by an earlier marriage , the wife had a child who was treated as a child of the family . The parties separated in January 2006 . <p> 6 . The wife had wealthy and indulgent parents who made substantial provision for her prior to the marriage . Following her father 's death in 1994 and her marriage to the husband , her mother continued to make substantial provision for her and the judge found that in the future she was likely to continue to fund the wife 's lifestyle . He also found that neither the wife nor her mother had been frank about the financial dealings between them . <p> 7 . At the date of the marriage the husband was the sole owner of a company which supplied specialist gases and associated equipment to the oil industry in the North Sea and which later changed its name to Dominion Technology Gases Ltd ( " the company " ) . The husband , together with an investor who by the date of the marriage had dropped out , had acquired the company in 1988 . But the husband had started the business , unincorporated , in 1986 and had run it through another company from 1987 to 1988 . It follows that the business had been in operation for ten years before the marriage took place ; and in what follows I propose , albeit inaccurately , to refer to the company as having operated for that period . <p> 8 . On 25 May 2007 , when the proceedings for ancillary relief were under way , the husband sold the company for ? 32m . Following deductions in respect of expenses of sale , of ? 3m due to a co-director and of CGT , the proceeds of sale in his hands were ? 25m . By January 2007 he was in active negotiations for sale of the company and knew that he was on the point of achieving a price of at least ? 20m for it . But in his affidavit in Form E sworn in that month and in his answers to questionnaire given in March 2007 he dishonestly suppressed the existence of the negotiations and , in the affidavit , contended that the value of the company was ? 3m . <p> 9 . I will take the judge to have found the net assets of the parties at the date of the hearing to amount to ? 25m , which is therefore identical to the net sum which the husband had received for the company two years earlier . The judge set out the assets in tabular form at 267 and again , in what he intended to be only a re-arrangement referable to costs , at 277 . If in those tables he had included full totals as well as sub-totals , he would have discovered a discrepancy in the totals of the two tables amounting to ? 400,000 which , in that in any event I am rounding all his figures , I can ignore . In reaching his figure of ? 25m for the total assets the judge correctly made allowance for all the costs on both sides , including those not yet paid by each of them to their solicitors ; and it may broadly be said to have been the burden of ? 1.7m in costs which reduced the parties ' net assets to a sum equal to the net proceeds of the company . <p> 10 . In his table of assets the judge included a castle near Aberdeen owned and occupied by the husband and a house in Gerrards Cross owned and occupied by the wife . The wife had bought her home in Gerrards Cross during the marriage with funds which the judge found to have been provided to her at various stages by her mother , and during his lifetime by her father , in the form of interest-free loans . In the light of his finding the judge included in his table the total of the loans as a liability of the wife and , in that they equated to the current value of the home , namely ? 2.1m , he thereby in effect eliminated its value from his net calculations . In that the judge also found that the loans were so soft that , even were the wife to sell the home , her mother would during her life not demand their repayment and that she would by her will provide for their release , the judge was in my view generous to the wife in including them as a liability . Mr Pointer QC on behalf of the wife observes , however , that , even were the loans to have been ignored and the value of her home not thus to have been written off , it is most unlikely , in view of the origin of its funding , that the sharing principle would have operated to the husband 's advantage in respect of it ; and indeed the judge seems so to have recognised at 445 . <p> 11 . The wife 's claim , as presented to the judge as also to us , was for a lump sum payment by the husband of ? 10m . Mr Pointer contended that such reflected a proper application of the sharing principle . He conceded that the husband 's ownership of the company at the date of the marriage justified departure from equality within the principle and argued that the proper extent of the departure would be reflected in an award to the wife of only 40% of the parties ' net assets of ? 25m , which , as I have pointed out , represented no more and no less than the net proceeds of sale of the company received by the husband . <p> 12 . Before the judge the husband 's offer by way of response to the wife 's claim differed , at any rate in emphasis , between opening and closing . At the start of the hearing on 16 March 2009 , through Miss Stone QC , the husband offered to the wife a lump sum to be calculated first by taking the value of the company at the date of separation , i.e. January 2006 , then by deducting its value at the date of the marriage , i.e. June 1996 , and then by dividing the balance equally . The husband 's evidence about the value of the company at these two dates seems to have changed during the hearing ; and in effect the two figures became agreed . In the light of extraordinary buoyancy in the industry between January 2006 and May 2007 and of the particular position of the company in being able to profit by it , it was agreed that the value of the company at the date of separation was vastly less than the price achieved on the later date , namely only ? 12m net . It was also agreed that its value in June 1996 was ? 2m net . Thus the husband 's opening offer was seen to amount to ? 5m . <p> 13 . By the time , however , of her closing submissions on 6 July 2009 , Miss Stone seems to have considered that her opening offer might have been pitched too high . Perhaps she had already sensed that , however unusually , the judge was considering making an award to the wife based not on the higher , but on the lower , of the figures generated by application of the need principle and of the sharing principle . At all events , while not resiling from the offer of ? 5m , Miss Stone ventured calculations of the wife 's needs ; and , in that she was able to argue convincingly that the wife 's need for accommodation was already satisfied , she proffered a capitalisation of her needs in alternative sums of only ? 3m and ? 4m . Thus , submitted Miss Stone in closing , the range of the award should be between ? 3m and ? 5m . <p> 14 . It has proved a challenge for me to summarise the reasoning favoured by the judge in reaching his award to the wife of ? 5.4m . The following represents my best effort : <p> ( a ) Mr Pointer 's claim for a lump sum equal to 40% of the net assets was inappropriate . Such an approach was arbitrary : 388 . In any event the claimed proportion was too high : 452 . <p> ( b ) To the extent that the proposal made by Miss Stone in her closing submissions remained based on the sharing principle her computation was also flawed for two reasons . <p> ( c ) The first reason was that valuations at the two suggested dates were likely not to be accurate : 382(ii) . <p> ( d ) The second reason was that this was not a case in which , for the purposes of the sharing principle , it was appropriate to treat the vast increase in the value of the company between the date of separation and the date of its sale differently from its value at the date of separation : 383 and 425(xiv) . <p> ( e ) The proper conclusion from the evidence was that 60% of the value of the company at the date of separation represented what the husband had brought into the marriage : 457 . <p> ( f ) In the light of ( d ) above , however , it was proper to extend ( e ) above so as to become a conclusion that 60% of the net proceeds of the ultimate sale of the company represented what the husband had brought into the marriage : 460 to 464 . <p> ( g ) Thus only 40% of the proceeds represented matrimonial property . The sharing principle suggested its equal division , i.e. an award to the wife of 20% of the proceeds : 458 . <p> ( h ) Were one to take the net proceeds of sale at ? 24m ( did the judge perhaps consider that ? 1m had been spent ? ) and to take 21% rather than 20% thereof ( did he perhaps do so in the interests of arriving at a round sum ? ) one would arrive at ? 5m and , were one then to add ? 0.4m as being half of other matrimonial assets held by the husband and a further ? 0.4m in respect of the wife 's costs , one might conclude , subject to a further adjustment identified at ( j ) and ( k ) below , that , if calculated by reference to the sharing principle , the award would be ? 5.8m : 465 to 469 . <p> ( i ) If calculated by reference to the need principle , however , the award to the wife would be ? 4.6m inclusive of the provision in respect of costs : 434 . <p> ( j ) Where application of the need principle suggested an award lower than was suggested by that of the sharing principle , the lower award based on need might in some cases inform , and in others dictate , the extent of the departure from equality within the sharing principle : 414 and 416 . <p> ( k ) In the present case the lower award of ? 4.6m suggested by application of the need principle did not dictate , but did inform , the extent of the departure from equality within the sharing principle , with the result that , by application of that principle , the award should exceed ? 4.6m but should , on the other hand , be less than ? 5.8m and should be ? 5.4m : 473 . <p> 15 . Wisely the husband does not cross-appeal against the judge 's refusal to treat the increase in the value of the company between the date of separation and the date of its sale as a non-matrimonial asset . The evidence fully justified his finding that , apart from no more than 10% of it ( which he then chose to ignore : 463 -- 464 ) the soaring jump in value was attributable only to what at 383 he called the " spring-board " which was in place within the company by the date of the separation . <p> 16 . At the centre of the wife 's appeal is a challenge to the judge 's figure of 60% identified in 14(e) and ( f ) above . On what basis did he arrive at it ? Was it open to him to do so ? <p> 17 . A subsidiary ground of appeal was that the reasoning identified in 14(j) and ( k ) above by which the judge reduced the award from ? 5.8m to ? 5.4m was contrary to principle . On 24 June 2010 this court , constituted by my Lord , the President , Lord Justice Thorpe and Lady Justice Black , refused to grant permission to the wife to appeal on this ground ; it held that , in context , ? 0.4m was de minimis . I respectfully agree . Nevertheless in my view the judge 's reasoning identified at ( j ) and ( k ) can not be allowed to pass into our jurisprudence without comment : see 30 -- 31 below . <p> 18 . The judge 's finding that 60% of the net proceeds of the sale of the company represented what the husband had brought into the marriage was based not just on the fact that by the date of the marriage the company had been in existence for ten years but also , and in particular , on the nature of the husband 's employment prior to its inception . <p> 19 . The husband 's evidence was that : <p> ( a ) in 1967 , when aged 15 , he had begun a five-year apprenticeship in marine engineering with Brown Brothers ; ( b ) he had duly completed it ; ( c ) in 1976 he had taken employment with Seaforth Maritime , being the largest marine engineering company operative in the North Sea ; ( d ) he had there been placed in charge of 70 other employees ; ( e ) in 1979 Seaforth had appointed him the manager of a subsidiary business which had 147 employees ; ( f ) in 1984 he had moved to work for Gas Services Offshore Ltd , by which he had been appointed manager of the Oseberg Transport System project and had thereby come into contact with the leaders of the industry ; and(g) in 1985 , in the Court of Session in Edinburgh , he had been found to be the inventor of a helium gas meter which had become of standard use in the industry . <p> 20 . Miss Stone convincingly demonstrates to us that before the judge she laid much stress on the above evidence to the effect that , with increasing responsibility and distinction , the husband had been employed in the North Sea oil and gas service industry since age 15 , i.e. for 19 years prior to the inception of the company . In the light , however , of the approach to computation of the wife 's claim which Miss Stone commended to the judge , explained at 12 above , I am unclear how she sought to link the effect of that evidence with computation of the award . <p> 21 . By contrast , the nature of the link favoured by the judge is very clear . The judge found that ? 15m ( i.e. 60% ) of the ultimate net proceeds of sale of the company in 2007 represented what the husband had brought into the marriage in 1996 ; and he did so in the light of the agreed fact that the value of the company in 1996 was only ? 2m . Even were allowance to be made for any spring-board in place within the company in 1996 ( see 39 to 43 below ) and for passive growth in the value of the company from 1996 to 2007 ( see 44 to 50 below ) , it follows that the judge was placing a massive capital value on the personal capacity of the husband in 1996 to make money in his chosen field , born of the experience which he had gained during his employment in it since 1967 . The judge was therefore capitalising the husband 's earning capacity at the date of the marriage and was proceeding , of course , to treat such capital as a non-matrimonial asset . <p> 22 . Thus the judge said : <p> ( a ) that the " success and position of the company in the market was based on his early working life and the knowledge and experience he gained at that stage and then on his hard work ... over the years " : 79 ; <p> ( b ) that the husband had not disclosed the negotiations for sale because he considered it unjust to have to make payment to the wife out of the sale proceeds of a company which " represented the product of his working lifetime " : 155 ; and <p> ( c ) that the proceeds of sale of the company were " the product of his life 's work , skill and business decisions " : 425(iii) . <p> 23 . That for the purposes of the sharing principle it might be appropriate to capitalise the earning capacity brought by one spouse into the marriage was an approach first favoured by Mr Nicholas Mostyn QC , as he then was , when sitting as a deputy judge of the Division in GW v. RW ( Financial Provision : Departure from Equality ) 2003 EWHC 611 , 2003 2 FLR 108 . The husband was employed by an American bank in the City . At the date of the marriage he had assets of $500,000 and was earning $400,000 pa . Mr Mostyn said : <p> " 50 . H here brought into the marriage assets with a value in money today of $781,000 ... <p> 51 . H also brought to the marriage a developed career , existing high earnings and an established earning capacity . I can not see why this should not be treated as much as a non-marital asset as the provision of hard cash . In argument I suggested that H here was in terms of his career " fledged " at the time of the marriage , rather than being the fledgling , which is so often the case . Counsel for the husband stated that his client was far more than fledged : he was fully airborne . I tend to agree ... " <p> Thus , as a result of his choice of metaphor , Mr Mostyn 's approach became known as fledging : if at the date of the marriage the spouse was successfully launched in employment , or fledged , his earning capacity was somehow to be capitalised ; then , like the husband 's actual capital in GW ( which the deputy judge uprated from $500,000 to $781,000 ) , the figure was , I presume , to be uprated for inflation ; and then allowance was to be made for it , as a non-matrimonial asset justifying departure from equality , in the application of the sharing principle upon divorce . I am unclear how the earnings were thus to be capitalised ; still less how such allowance was thus to be made ; and in particular whether , if at the date when the financial proceedings were heard , the spouse still enjoyed an established earning capacity , such also fell to be capitalised and also in some way to be taken into account . <p> " 172 . A possible difficulty about this approach is that it reintroduces , at the commencement of the marriage , a requirement to attempt to assess and compare the value of the contributions which each party is or would be likely to make during or apart from the marriage . I am not very confident that an established earning capacity or very valuable acquired expertise and acumen would , if viewed as " assets " brought into a marriage , be easily or reliably measurable or comparable with other qualities , or indeed how far would one carry the enquiry into expertise and acumen . The concept of " fledging " is probably anyway one which would diminish in relevance , the longer the marriage ... <p> 173 . On the other hand , where at the beginning ( or end ) of the marriage an actual transaction is under way or in view which in due course yields a considerable new asset , there is no difficulty in principle ( even if there may be some difficulty in valuation ) in accepting that part of that asset may have to be excluded from any assessment of the matrimonial acquest or included in what the parties brought into the marriage . " <p> 25 . In 172 , quoted above , Lord Mance articulated three objections to the capitalisation of a spouse 's earning capacity at the date of the marriage . With respect , I agree with all of them . <p> ( a ) The capacity is not easily measurable in capital terms . The judgment of the judge in the present case is replete with objections to the adoption of arbitrary percentages in application of the sharing principle . In the end , however , without having canvassed such a percentage -- or in this context any other -- with counsel , the judge adopted 60% as the proportion of the company 's sale price in 2007 which was attributable to a mixture of its value in 1996 and the husband 's personal capacity to expand it ( or earning capacity ) established by 1996 . What could have been more arbitrary than that ? <p> ( b ) The proper depth of any enquiry into a spouse 's expertise and acumen is unclear . What contributed to the substantial capacity of this husband to generate earnings ( or profits ) in his chosen field ? The judge rightly laid stress on the knowledge which he had gained during employment in the field from 1967 to 1986 . But , without his having other qualities , whether inherited or acquired as a child at home or at school or otherwise , he would not have been able to put his knowledge to profitable use . In truth the judge was placing a substantial capital value on the husband as a person ; I am convinced that such is no function of the divorce court . I also consider that a dangerous degree of hindsight is likely to be deployed in analysing the extent of a person 's ( say a husband 's ) earning capacity at a date long past . If later ( as in this case ) he generated substantial earnings , the court would be likely to find that he had had a substantial earning capacity but , if later he failed to generate them , it would be likely to find that he had not had a substantial earning capacity . But neither of those obverse conclusions is necessarily valid . <p> ( c ) Above all , capitalisation of the earning capacity established by one spouse by the date of the marriage is likely to be unjustly discriminatory if the other had not by then established an earning capacity . In the present case the wife had no earning capacity at all in 1996 . What had she been doing in 1967 when the husband was apprenticed to Brown Brothers ? The answer is that she had been crawling around the floor aged one . She must have been at school until 1984 ; thereafter , as we know , she became a wife to her first husband and , ultimately , a mother . Although the generosity of her parents made her early adulthood financially comfortable , was it not discriminatory for the judge to write off , without any real analysis , whatever the wife had achieved by his ascription to the husband of a substantial capitalisation of his earning capacity without making any countervailing ascription to her in other respects ? <p> 26 . In my view the adoption and development of the doubts expressed by Lord Mance in Miller/McFarlane at 172 , quoted above , should lead this court today formally to overrule the decision of Mr Mostyn in GW that a spouse 's established earning capacity at the date of the marriage falls to be capitalised , or otherwise brought into account , for the purpose of the sharing principle . <p> 27 . In 23 above I questioned whether Mr Mostyn 's approach also required capitalisation of any such established earning capacity as still subsisted at the date when the financial proceedings were heard . Were we to overrule his decision , my question would not need to be answered . There is , however , a separate , wider question whether it is ever necessary or appropriate for the court to attempt to capitalise the earning capacity which a party has at the date of the hearing . There is no denying the extreme importance of an enquiry into the earning capacity of each party at that date : indeed s.25(2) ( a ) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 makes it mandatory . A spouse 's earning capacity will usually be a central foundation of an order for periodical payments , and thus of any order by way of capitalisation thereof , pursuant to the principles of need and/or of compensation . Even if , however , an earning capacity may also sometimes be relevant to a fair distribution of the assets pursuant to the sharing principle , it does not follow that the earning capacity should itself be treated as one of those assets , still less that an attempt should be made to capitalise it . Today I have as little appetite for such costly artificiality as when , in 2007 , I subscribed to the judgment of this court in Charman v. Charman ( No 4 ) 2007 EWCA Civ 503 , 2007 1 FLR 1246 , and thus to the reservations in this respect which the court expressed at the foot of 67 of it . <p> 28 . It follows that in my view the judge 's decision is flawed in that it ascribed a capital value to the earning capacity of the husband at the date of the marriage . The judge quoted , at 375 , the remarks which Lord Mance made in Miller/McFarlane at 172 . But he quoted them in a section of his judgment entitled " Post separation assets ... " ; and he may not have had them fully in mind when , at 457 , he alighted on the figure of 60% . <p> 29 . Since the judge 's reasoning was wrong irrespective of the percentage which he adopted , it is inappropriate for me to spend time in trying to discern from the judgment how he arrived at the figure of 60% , which , at 472(i) , he described as likely to be favourable to the wife . His crucial conclusion was in the opening words of 457 , as follows : <p> " In my view , on that basis around 60% of the company 's value ... should be attributed to the creative years before the marriage . " <p> There is lively dispute between counsel as to which of the numerous points made by the judge in preceding paragraphs represent the " basis " to which he there referred . Inevitably Mr Pointer also refers to the judge 's calculation , at 455 , that : <p> " In round terms the marriage lasted for one quarter of the husband 's working life and one third of the life of his business that he started in 1986 ... " <p> The judge 's calculation is wrong : for the marriage lasted for nine and a half years , which represents not one third but 45% of the 21-year life of the business . Surely ( says Mr Pointer ) this error conduced to the judge 's conclusion that only 40% of the value of the company was generated following the marriage . No ( counters Miss Stone ) , this was a mere slip by which the judge in no way misled himself and which , had it been noticed , should have been included in the fourteen pages of suggested corrections jointly submitted by counsel to him following dissemination of his judgment in draft . In my view Miss Stone may well be right ; it would be unsafe to hang any conclusion on this error . <p> 30 . I return to the separate part of the judge 's reasoning at the final stage of his calculations , which I have summarised at 14(j) and ( k ) above . His general proposition , which he applied to the facts of the case at 473 , was articulated as follows : <p> " 413. ... in my judgment , in a case such as this where a factor that can provide a good reason for departing from an equal division within the application of the sharing principle applies this can favour a conclusion that , in all the circumstances of the case the same result should as a matter of fairness be reached applying the need and sharing principles or provide a cross check or guide to the separate application of the principles . <p> 414 . So it seems to me that if in such a case an application of the need principle leads to a result that is less than an equal division of the assets this can in some cases inform or influence the extent of the departure ( for good reason ) from equality within the sharing principle , and in others dictate such departure and thereby found the same conclusion being reached on the application of both principles . " <p> 31 . Prior to this court 's pragmatic refusal of permission to the wife to appeal on this point , Miss Stone had in writing elected not " in this case " to express a view about the validity of the judge 's proposition . So at any rate the refusal of permission has not suppressed a defence of it which would otherwise have been forthcoming . In a decision of the Court of Final Appeal , Hong Kong , given as recently as 12 November 2010 , namely WLK v. TMC , FACV 21 of 2009 , I have discovered some support for the judge 's proposition : see the judgment of Mr Justice Ribiero PJ at 84 , although his remarks at 86 are arguably inconsistent with those at 84 . Notwithstanding its apparent endorsement from so distinguished a source , I feel emboldened to suggest obiter that the proposition of Charles J is confusing and unhelpful ; that , in applying the principles of need and of sharing , the court is engaged in two separate exercises , which require it to refer to different considerations ( Charman , cited above , at 70 and 72 ) ; and that the suggestion that the result of the assessment under the need principle can be introduced into the assessment under the sharing principle in order to identify the extent of departure from equality is inconsistent with the guidance given in Miller/McFarlane , as recognised in Charman at 73 and as noted by the judge himself at 410 , that in principle the higher assessment should found the award . <p> 32 . In the light of the flawed character of the judge 's assessment of the award to the wife and of the fact that , in the light of the forensic history , a re-hearing , not sought by either side , is out of the question , it falls to this court to exercise the discretion which was vested in him . In that regard this court should with fortitude anticipate the inevitable criticism that , by reason of deficiencies in the evidence available to it , its own approach to the assessment is even more arbitrary than it would usually be . <p> 33 . My view is that , in applying the sharing principle to this case , we should in the first instance adopt the approach commended to the judge by Miss Stone . We should therefore effect a division of the total assets of ? 25million into the part reflective of non-matrimonial assets and that reflective of matrimonial assets . But in doing so we should remember that , as Lord Nicholls stressed in Miller/McFarlane at 26 , we are unlikely to need , still less to achieve , a precise division . The remaining step to be taken pursuant to Miss Stone 's approach will be easy partly because in this case there is no ground for sharing the non-matrimonial assets other than 100% to the contributor and 0% to the other and partly because , by contrast , there is no ground for sharing the matrimonial assets other than equally . <p> 34 . My view however is that we should test the result suggested by the adoption of Miss Stone 's approach against application of Mr Pointer 's approach , namely by identifying , for allocation to the wife , such lesser percentage than 50% of the total assets as seems to make fair overall allowance for the husband 's introduction of his company into the marriage . <p> 35 . Criticism can easily be levelled at both approaches . In different ways they are both highly arbitrary . Application of the sharing principle is inherently arbitrary ; such is , I suggest , a fact which we should accept and by which we should cease to be disconcerted . Mr Pointer 's approach seems particularly by-and-large . But is the greater apparent specificity of Miss Stone 's approach an illusion ? Powerful voices are raised against the accuracy of the types of valuation which her approach often requires . For example in H v. H 2008 EWHC 935 ( Fam ) , 2008 2 FLR 2092 , Moylan J , at 5 , described valuations of private companies as particularly fragile and suggested that their ostensible accuracy was no more than a chimera and that their purpose was to assist the court " in testing the fairness of the proposed outcome " . We may infer that Moylan J would have preferred in the first instance to adopt Mr Pointer 's approach and , at most , only to test the suggested result against application of Miss Stone 's approach . The exercises , on the one hand , of adopting A and of testing against B and , on the other , of adopting B and of testing against A may indeed have subtly different consequences . At all events in this case , particularly in circumstances in which a central valuation mandated by it has been crystallised by sale , I prefer in the first instance to adopt Miss Stone 's approach . <p> 36 . Of course the adoption of Miss Stone 's approach in no way implies the adoption of the calculation which she pressed upon the judge . A major part of her calculation is no longer arguable . For the judge rejected her argument that the substantial increase in the value of the company following the date of separation was non-matrimonial : he found that , by that date , the company had developed the latent potential to generate the increase or , to use his metaphor , that in place within the company on that date was the spring-board from which it was generated . So our first step should be to take not the figure of ? 10m but the entire total of ? 25m . <p> 37 . Our second step should be to ascribe to the company , a value , as at the date of the marriage , which is both realistic and apt to the context in which it is required . In that regard our starting-point should be the valuation of the company at that date upon which the respective accountants were ultimately agreed , namely ? 2m net . Of course the figure reflects the exercise by the husband of his earning capacity during the previous ten years : so , to the extent that the earning capacity of a spouse has by the date of the marriage contributed to the creation of capital , it will thereby be taken into account in his or her favour ; but , for the reasons given above , such should in my view be the limit to which it is taken into account . <p> 38 . In my view , however , there are two reasons why the sum of ? 2m requires substantial adjustment . <p> 39 . The first reason for adjustment arises out of further consideration of the concept of latent potential or in the judge 's word , the spring-board . I am concerned lest our decision in this case were to be misunderstood as generally encouraging an enquiry into whether the professional valuation of a company at a specified date should be subject to increase by reference to the presence within it at that date of a spring-board . Mr Pointer correctly submits that a professional valuation calculated by reference to future maintainable earnings will generally reflect the value of any such spring-board . But there will be rare cases in which a judge may be persuaded that it has failed to do so ; and in the present case this court must work on what in my view are clear findings by the judge , not subject to appeal , that at each of two different dates there were spring-boards in place in the husband 's company which the respective professional valuations failed to reflect . <p> 40 . As I have explained , the judge made an express finding that , at the date of the separation , there was a spring-board in place in the husband 's company , not reflected in the valuation of ? 12m , to which in effect the entire increase in value up to the date of sale was attributable . Such was a finding vastly favourable to the wife in that it has precluded the husband from continuing to represent the increase as non-matrimonial . <p> 41 . But the judge also made a finding that , at the date of the marriage , there was a spring-board in place , not reflected in the valuation of ? 2m , to which a significant proportion of its subsequent increase in value was attributable . The arresting evidence that , in 1997 , i.e. only a year later , the husband received an offer to purchase the company for between ? 6m and ? 7m may reasonably have helped to precipitate the judge 's enquiry in this regard . At all events he referred , at 459 , to " the ' spring-board effect ' of the existing company at the time of the marriage . " And he said , at 456 : <p> " In my view , it is likely that if more evidence had been directed to the development of the business over all the years from its creation to its sale , it is unlikely that it would only have been possible to take anything other than a broad approach to the " spring-board effect " of this pre-acquired asset to its value as at separation , and thus to the attribution of its value as at that date between ( a ) its creation and the work done in its development prior to the marriage , and ( b ) its further development during the marriage . " <p> It is a difficult sentence ; as Mr Pointer suggests , it would become somewhat less difficult if the word " only " were to be omitted from it . At all events it is clear that , on the apparently limited evidence before him , the judge concluded that a spring-board of substantial significance was in place in the company at the date of the marriage . Indeed the quoted sentence immediately precedes his central conclusion that 60% of the proceeds of sale of the company , i.e. ? 15m , represented a non-matrimonial asset . <p> 42 . It would of course be wrong to follow the judge by increasing the figure of ? 2m to that of ? 15m for this first reason . The judge 's figure is substantially flawed by his allowance within it for the husband 's earning capacity at the date of the marriage . We are concerned only with the value to be attributed to the spring-board in place at that date , not with the value to be attributed to the subsequent activity of the diver or gymnast upon it . Indeed , even had the judge been right to allow for the husband 's earning capacity , his figure might well have remained substantially too high . Nevertheless , cautious though I am about allowance for spring-boards , I consider that , in circumstances in which the spring-board identified by the judge as being in place at the date of the separation has worked so severely against the husband , we must in fairness to him make some allowance for the spring-board identified as being in place at the date of the marriage . <p> 43 . By reference to its latent potential at the date of the marriage I propose to take the value of the company at that date as being ? 4m rather than ? 2m . The figure is , again , highly arbitrary : I make no apology for this but it reinforces the need to test against some other approach the conclusion ultimately reached by reference to it . In accordance with the sentiments expressed by the judge in the difficult passage quoted , I also consider that not even a judge at first instance , with access to all the evidence referable to the reasons for the company 's later success , could secure acquittal of a charge of having been arbitrary at this stage of conversion of such a feature into terms of money . <p> 44 . In my view the second reason for adjustment is the need to allow for passive economic growth in the company between the date of the marriage and the date of sale . This was not a subject canvassed before the judge or at the time of the hearing before us so , at our request , counsel have made short submissions in writing upon it . <p> " For the purposes of establishing the matrimonial property in respect of which the yardstick of equality will ' forcefully ' apply the value of assets brought into the marriage by gift and inheritance ( other than the former matrimonial home ) , together with passive economic growth on those assets , should be excluded as non-matrimonial property . " <p> 46 . Like Singer J in S v. S ( Ancillary Relief after Lengthy Separation ) , 2006 EWHC 2339 ( Fam ) , 2007 1 FLR 2120 , at 111 , I regard Mr Mostyn 's proposition as helpful and ( subject to the fact that the yardstick of equality has been subsumed within the sharing principle ) as accurate . Take a work of art or land with potential for development which a spouse has owned since prior to the marriage and which , without activity on his or her part , has substantially increased in value during it . The court would accept that the increase in its value during the marriage was as much non-matrimonial as its value at the date of the marriage : it would thereby allow for its passive growth . Passive growth is to be contrasted with growth as a result of contributions of one sort or another made during the marriage , i.e. of activity , irrespective of whether such is achieved with the assistance of a spring-board already in position . An analogous approach is apt in respect of assets inherited by , or given to , one spouse during the marriage . <p> 47 . Two decisions at first instance demonstrate allowance for passive growth . In H v. H ( Financial Provision : Special Contribution ) 2002 2 FLR 1021 the husband had during the marriage inherited in the U.S. assets worth ? 400,000 at the time of the hearing . In S v. S ( Non-Matrimonial Property : Conduct ) 2006 EWHC 2793 , 2007 1 FLR 1496 , the husband had owned since before the marriage a portfolio of commercial properties worth ? 1m at the time of the hearing . The judges ( Mr Hughes QC and Burton J respectively ) classified the assets as entirely non-matrimonial . Neither sought to afford different treatment to the increase in value of the assets since the inheritance and the date of the marriage respectively ; I doubt that it was even argued that they should do so . <p> 48 . It appears from the quotation in 23 above that in GW Mr Mostyn QC uprated assets of $500,000 at the date of the marriage to $781,000 in order to reflect their " value in money today " . Of course an increase reflective only of inflation would not be an allowance for growth in real terms at all ; but it would presumably be apt for application to assets kept only in liquid form . Mr Pointer argues , however , that it is also apt for application to the present case . In that he does not concede allowance for the spring-board in place at the date of the marriage , he adheres to the professional valuation of the company at that date in the sum only of ? 2m and concedes an increase only to ? 2.7m , being reflective of the increase of 35% in the Retail Prices Index between the date of the marriage and the date of its sale . <p> 49 . The crux of Mr Pointer 's argument in this respect is that a small industrial company , such as was owned by the husband in the present case , requires active management and , even if well managed , may fail for a variety of reasons . There is in truth profound difficulty about quantifying an allowance for passive economic growth in such a case . But should the difficulty preclude its attempt ? If at the date of the marriage the husband 's ? 4m ( or , as Mr Pointer says , his ? 2m ) had been invested in a portfolio of commercial properties , he , like the husband in S above , would have been the beneficiary of adjustment for any passive economic growth . If at the date of the marriage the husband 's ? 4m had represented the value of a minority holding in a company in which he was no more than an investor but which operated in a field identical to that in which his company actually operated , he would again have been the beneficiary of adjustment for any passive economic growth . I do not see how the law can logically decline to attempt to enquire into the existence and , if so , the amount of such growth by reference only to the nature of the husband 's investment . <p> 50 . Although I accept Mr Pointer 's warning about the dangers inherent in attributing the level of success of public companies to small private companies , I believe that , in the light of its limited access to the relevant facts , this court now can do no better than to apply to the sum of ? 4m an increase of 116% , being the percentage increase in the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas Producers Index between the date of the marriage and the date of the sale . Thus allowance for passive growth lifts the figure of ? 4m to ? 8.7m . <p> 51 . It is therefore my view that the best application of Miss Stone 's approach of which this court is capable would result in conclusions that the value of the non-matrimonial assets is ? 8.7m , say ? 9m ; that the value of the matrimonial assets is therefore ? 16m ; and that the award to the wife would be ? 8m . <p> 52 . As I have observed , the question-mark to be set against the above calculation is properly recognised by a resolution to test its suggested award to the wife of ? 8m by the application of Mr Pointer 's approach . The sum of ? 8m represents 32% of ? 25m . My view of overall fairness to both parties , developed at an early stage and not displaced in the course of protracted subsequent reflection , is that an award of 40% to the wife , for which Mr Pointer contends , would be unfair to the husband and that the bracket fair to both would be between 30% and 36% . So the suggested award , albeit not precisely in the middle of the bracket , survives the test . <p> 53 . I would allow the appeal and substitute the award to the wife of ? 8m for the judge 's award of ? 5.4m . I see no reason to require the husband to make any additional contribution in respect of the wife 's costs , other than ( subject to argument ) of this appeal . For application of the sharing principle would yield an award which of itself would amply enable the wife to meet her need referable to costs . <p> 54 . By way of postscript I add that , at 1 , the judge attributed the length of his judgment to the unsatisfactory way in which counsel on both sides had presented the dispute to him . He explained , at 476 to 483 , that they had failed properly -- in particular in writing -- to identify for his assistance the " building blocks " of their respective cases , by which he meant the issues which each of them raised for his determination , the findings for which each contended referable to each issue and the evidence upon which each relied as justification for each finding . Very properly counsel have not taken up our time in seeking to challenge the judge 's criticisms of them in this appeal . So his criticisms of them stand . In such circumstances , however , perhaps it is only fair for me to compliment all four counsel , leading and junior , on the sharp focus of their short skeleton arguments for the appeal and on the efficient economy of their oral submissions at the hearing before us , which proceeded for only four hours . <p> Lady Justice Arden : 55 . I agree and would express my gratitude to Wilson LJ for the succinct yet comprehensive way in which he has dealt with the issues on this appeal , a major achievement given the thoughtful but somewhat over-lengthy judgment of the judge . I have some reservations about what Wilson LJ calls passive growth , but subject to that agree with the order which Wilson LJ proposes for the reasons that he has so carefully and clearly given . <p> 56 . This is a case where the respondent 's company was extremely successful . Under the judge 's application of the sharing principle , the appellant received only about 20% of its value on sale , and she seeks a substantial increase of the amount of the award . This court draws no distinction between the homemaking/care-giving and breadwinning contributions of the parties to a marriage when it comes to the division of matrimonial assets , but it would be wrong for us in this case to give either party to the marriage a share of the non-matrimonial assets of the other . <p> 57 . What the respondent seeks is that the value of the business at the date of the marriage should be increased so as to reduce the size of the aggregate value of the matrimonial assets which have to be divided between them . Moreover there is the question whether that aggregate value should be further reduced by the capitalisation of a notional income obtained on his non-matrimonial assets . <p> 58 . I would have had great difficulty with the judgment of Wilson LJ had he proposed the valuation of the husband 's earning capacity at the date of marriage . He does not propose this , but concludes that the company 's value as at the date of the marriage can be increased by ? 2m . I am satisfied that the company can and should for present purposes be valued in the figure of ? 4m . The market value of an asset is after all what a person is willing to pay for it and we are told that in the following year there was an offer of ? 6/7m for it . In those circumstances , in my judgment , it is unfair to the respondent to value the company at ? 2m , even though this is the amount at which the experts valued the company as at the date of the marriage on the basis of p/e ratios . To clarify , in my judgment the sum of ? 4m represents a figure which can fairly be taken to be the value of the company as at the date of the marriage . The non-matrimonial asset is the company as it stood at the date of the marriage , and not the discounted present value of the future earnings of the respondent . <p> 59 . As to " passive growth " , I agree that in principle , in the circumstances of this case , an allowance should be made even though the asset is a private company the business of which has developed and expanded ( in this case exponentially ) during the marriage . It may be difficult to compute growth on such an asset , as opposed to an asset such as a painting or vintage car or portfolio of investments that has always been kept separate and distinct . I would take the same view about making an allowance for growth even if there had been an amalgamation of the company 's business with that of another company , though in such a case there may be even greater difficulties in practice in identifying the asset representing the original asset . But here there has been no change in company 's line of business and the original line of business continued to form part of the business as it developed . <p> 60 . However , I would query whether what Wilson LJ proposes in his judgment is really passive growth and reject the notion that the only growth that can be taken into account is passive growth . First , as a matter of principle , when valuing the non-matrimonial assets at the end of a marriage , the court should so far as it can look at what has actually happened and not at what might have happened . In parenthesis , I would add that , because of this principle of " reality " , I would reject the graphs provided by Miss Stone seeking to establish the values of the company at certain dates based on an artificial assumption of a straightline growth up to eventual sale . Secondly , if only passive growth is taken into account , the law rewards the spouse who buries her non-matrimonial assets in the ground rather than the spouse who actively manages them . The correct analysis in my judgment , in circumstances such as the present , is that , where a spouse has a non-matrimonial asset of the present kind , he is entitled to that element of the company at the end of the day which can fairly be taken to represent the fruits of the non-matrimonial assets that accrue during the marriage , even if the fruits are the product of activity by him or on his behalf . <p> 61 . Moreover , here there was undoubtedly activity by the respondent in building up his company with outstanding success . I have no reason to doubt that he worked extremely hard to achieve his success . It is not therefore appropriate to add an allowance for inflation , as Mr Pointer urges us to do , but to try to find a barometer apt to measure the growth that actually occurred in this case . As an aside , Wilson LJ suggests that inflation might be appropriate in the case of assets kept in liquid form . It seems to me that an allowance for inflation would not necessarily in my judgment be appropriate in that case . Cash is likely to have been deposited with a bank and to have earned interest during the period of the marriage . This interest can be calculated and an appropriate sum can be added to the value of the non-matrimonial asset . In the unlikely event that cash had been kept in coin or notes ( perhaps under the mattress ) , and in the likely event that it had then gone down in value , it is difficult to see why it is appropriate to make an allowance for the rate of inflation . <p> 62 . But how are such fruits to be ascertained when upon marriage the subsequent increase in value of the company becomes an asset that represents the matrimonial acquest ? There is no evidence as to the rate of return on the non-matrimonial asset as a separate asset and therefore as Wilson LJ states the only approach the court can take is to find a suitable index for equity investments . This does not of course record the performance of Dominion , but of other companies in the market . But which index ? Miss Stone suggests ( without giving any reasons as to why it was appropriate to use this index ) the FTSE Oil and Gas Producers Index . This index is based on the performance of a small number of listed companies in that sector , including BP and Shell . There is no evidence that that is the relevant index as Dominion is not an oil or gas producer ( or a listed company ) . It simply produces products for use in the drilling industry . But I am content to assume that Miss Stone 's preferred index is an appropriate index because the fortunes of a company like Dominion ( in particular , its turnover ) may well follow those of the oil and gas production sector generally . <p> 63 . I have above limited any statement of principle to circumstances such as the present . The company 's growth in this case was exponential , leaving a surplus even when allowance is made for indexed growth . An allowance for growth in the manner proposed by Wilson LJ in this case simply can not be used unless the company 's growth has far outstripped the index sought to be used . <p> 64 . That leads me to the point that , as Wilson LJ 's judgment fairly recognises , the methodology in this case can be described as arbitrary or ad hoc . However , the answer is a principled one when assessed by the cross-check of overall fairness ( see above , paragraph 52 ) . In my judgment , that cross-check is an essential part of the reasoning for my concurrence in the result in this case . Moreover , in my judgment , this court is entitled and bound to intervene in this case because the judge 's assessment , albeit reached after a long judgment , clearly results in an inadequate application of the sharing principle , and was thus clearly wrong . I would not expect this court to intervene simply because it would itself have come to a different view as to the result if it had tried the case or simply because it would have applied some different methodology . <p> 65 . For the reasons given above and ( subject thereto ) the reasons given by the President ( whose judgment I have read in draft ) and by Wilson LJ , I would make the order that Wilson LJ proposes . <p> Sir Nicholas Wall P : 66 . I too agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Wilson LJ , and I would like to associate myself entirely with the first sentence of Arden LJ 's judgment . Like him , I would overrule the decision in GW v. RW ( Financial Provision : Departure from Equality ) 2003 EWHC 611 , 2003 2 FLR 108 , and in this regard I specifically adopt the reasoning set out in paragraphs 23 to 26 of his judgment . <p> 67 . My Lord 's expertise in this area of the law is infinitely greater than my own , and I thus make no comment on the means whereby he has reached his conclusions . However , it was with a sense of some relief that I read ( in paragraph 52 of his judgment ) that his view of " overall fairness to both parties " resulted in an award to the wife in a bracket between 30% and 36% . My own , admittedly crude analysis results -- on the facts of this case and as a cross-check -- in an old-fashioned third . There is a liquid pot of ? 25 million . One third is ? 8.3 million , which rounds down to ? 8 million . <p> 68 . Mr. Pointer QC rightly concedes that , on the facts , equality would not be just . Any smaller proportion -- for example ? 5 million ( one fifth ) - would seem to me ( a ) to run the danger of being seen to adopt the judge 's reasoning and ( b ) to be too small in the light of the fact that this was a 10 year marriage . Any greater proportion would , in my judgment , inflate the wife 's claim and be unfair to the husband , although the wife may regard herself as fortunate ( 1 ) that in the computation of the parties ' assets the judge took into account the money loaned to her by her parents ( and in particular her mother ) for the acquisition of her house and ( 2 ) that this court , in reviewing the judge 's exercise of discretion , was not minded to interfere with that element of the judge 's calculation . <p> 69 . I can not , however , part from the case without making two points . The first is that it seems to me unfortunate that our law of ancillary relief should be largely dictated by cases which bear no resemblance to the ordinary lives of most divorcing couples and to the average case heard , day in and day out , by district judges up and down the country . The sums of money -- including the costs - involved in this case are well beyond the experience and even the contemplation of most people . Whether the wife has ? 5 or ? 8 million , she will still be a very rich woman and the application of the so called " sharing " and " needs " principles may look very different in cases where the latter predominates and the parties ' assets are a tiny percentage of those encountered here . <p> 70 . My second point is that there are aspects of this case which , as Head of the Family Division , I can not pass over without comment , and I think I owe it to the judge , the profession and , above all to the parties , to explain why that is so . <p> 71 . The case was commenced by the wife in 2007 . It occupied the time of a High Court judge for 10 days in June and July 2010 . ( I leave out of account interlocutory hearings and the abortive hearing in March 2010 ) . The judge then spent what must have been a substantial amount of the long vacation writing a judgment of prodigious length and complexity . We were told at the bar , and I accept , that it took leading counsel for the wife two days to read it and to prepare his editorial corrections . It was then handed down . The order finally emerged on 23 February 2010 . The wife has now successfully appealed to this court . We have substantially increased her award . Our order will apply on the date in 2011 when our judgments are handed down . <p> 72 . This time-table is deeply dispiriting . The costs are disproportionate . The judge 's judgment , I have to say , despite the judge 's defence of it , is over-long and over-complex . Everyone agreed that the essential issues could be reduced to a single sheet of paper , and for once the court was dealing with liquid assets - ? 25 million if not in cash then in readily realisable form . <p> 73 . When I was a puisne judge at first instance , I sat in this court as the third member of the constitution hearing the case of HM Customs and Excise and another v A and another 2002 EWCA Civ 1039 , 2003 2 All ER 736 . Schiemann LJ , who gave the leading judgment in the case said : <p> 81 . The judgment under appeal runs to some 223 paragraphs I interpolate that this was less than half of the length of the judgment in the instant case ...... <p> 82 . A judge 's task is not easy ....... One does often have to spend time absorbing arguments advanced by the parties which in the event turn out not to be central to the decision-making process . Moreover the experienced judge commonly has thoughts about avenues which it might be crucial to explore but which the parties have not themselves examined . It may be his duty to explore these privately in order to satisfy himself whether they are relevant . Having done the intellectual work there is an understandable temptation to which many of us occasionally succumb to record our thoughts for posterity in the judgment or to refrain from shortening a long first draft . <p> 83 . However , judges should bear in mind that the primary function of a first instance judgment is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way . The longer a judgment is and the more issues with which it deals the greater the likelihood that <p> i ) the losing party , the Court of Appeal and any future readers of the judgment will not be able to identify the crucial matters which swayed the judge ; ii ) the judgment will contain something with which the unsuccessful party can legitimately take issue and attempt to launch an appeal ; iii ) ............. iv ) reading the judgment will occupy a considerable amount of the time of legal advisers to other parties in future cases who again will have to sort out the status of the judicial observation in question . All this adds to the cost of obtaining legal advice . <p> 84 . Our system of full judgments has many advantages but one must also be conscious of the disadvantages . <p> 74 . I echo all the sentiments eloquently expressed by Wilson LJ in paragraphs 3 and 54 of his judgment . Speaking for myself , however , I do not think that the length of the judgment was justified by the judge 's laudable aim of ensuring that such cases are properly presented . I thus feel obliged to remind all judges who sit at first instance ( as I regularly now do myself ) of what I have extracted from what Schiemann LJ said in HM Customs and Excise and another v A and another , which , in my judgment applies directly to the judgment under appeal in the instant case .

@@3997230 <h> A bit of history repeated <p> If you mention the words " Ocarina of Time " around people of a certain age , who owned an N64 , the chances are you 'll see a little something light up in their eye . Amongst many , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is considered as one of the greatest games of all time . Following Link , a young boy on an epic quest to save his land from the evil Ganondorf , it won plaudits for its puzzling dungeons , strong story , and the sheer amount of things there were to see and do . <p> And much in the same way as Pilotwings Resort , which we looked at yesterday , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is also getting an outing on the 3DS . But while many may have been satisfied if Nintendo had simply crammed the N64 game onto a 3DS cartridge , the company have gone a lot further than that , as Ocarina of Time 3D is a complete remake . <p> In the same way as the Pilotwings and Kid Icarus demos , the Ocarina of Time demo we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split into three sections - the Kokiri Forest , the Deku Tree , and a boss fight against a scary spidery cyclops looking thing known as Queen Gohoma . <p> Thankfully , the version we played was in English , making the touch screen a lot easier to navigate ... <p> The Kokiri Forest was where we began our adventure - much in the same way to the full Ocarina of Time game - as we ran around the village of the small elvish people , chucking rocks , pulling up grass , slicing signs into tiny pieces , and generally causing trouble . Showing off the full potential of the 3DS 's 3D effect , the Kokiri Forest was an impressive demo of the technology , as the map and icons stayed right at the front of the screen , with the rest of the village stretching off into the distance . Whizzing around inbetween the fore- and background were little fairy things , that only added to the 3D effect . <p> A few minutes in , we were quickly introduced to our little fairy guide , Navi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible even over the crowds of journalists who 'd gathered to sample what the latest Zelda had to offer . Always on hand to offer pointers when you 're stuck , or simply yell at you , Navi acts as what 's effectively a walking and talking tutorial should you ever be unsure of what to do . After doing a bit of investigative journalism ( read : exploring the Kokiri Forest ) , we discovered a small passage which led to a maze , where a giant boulder lay waiting , seemingly patrolling its territory as it bounced off the walls , leaving you to simply pick your spot , and run , while praying you do nt find a dead end . Waiting at the end of the maze was a treasure chest , which contained a sword , which you needed to get past the annoying gatekeeper of the Kokiri Forest , Mido . A great example of how 3D can benefit the gameplay , with the 3D slider turned up , it was a lot easier to tell how close the boulder was to young Link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squishing . Luckily for us , there were also a number of recesses carved into the wall , which you could dive into while you waited for the boulder to roll past , which made getting from one end to the other a lot easier . In the scope of the demo , however , the Kokiri Forest was simply a hub for chatting to people , and demoing the 3D effects , with little else to do beyond simply attacking any signs that looked at you the wrong way . <p> Skulltulas - not the favourite enemy of people with arachnaphobia . <p> And so , having exhausted our options , we moved on to the next section of the demo - the Deku Tree . Zelda games have always been renowned for their dungeons , as they offer adventure in its truest form . With huge , sprawling series of interconnected rooms to explore , and puzzles to solve in practically each one , Zelda is far from a mindless hack and slash - it 's a game that asks you to think first , and slice later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you come face to face with a wall , covered in a giant spiders web . In fact , it 's a good job it 's there , as that web is your only way up , and into the further reaches of the dungeon - the problem is , there 's a chuffing huge spider half way up . And while he may move aside were we to ask him nicely , the terrifying skull that 's emblazoned on his back makes us think he may not be all that open to discussion . Our sword wo n't do the job , as we ca n't slice while halfway up a web - this is a job for the sligshot . <p> On the N64 , switching over to the slingshot always required you to open a menu , set the slingshot on one of the buttons , then quit the menu , and press the button to pull the slingshot out . With its dual screens , the 3DS makes things a heck of a lot easier . Now , if you ever want to change item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or equip your sword , all you have to do is touch the icon on the touch screen , and Link will follow suit - although you 'll probably have to have played the N64 game to appreciate how useful that is . <p> Ah , puzzles . Where would Zelda be without them . <p> With the slingshot armed , all we had to do then was to aim at the Skulltula , to give them their official name , and shoot - but again , the 3DS does things a tad differently . While you can certainly use the circle pad to aim , if you feel like doing things in a slightly less orthodox way , you can use the gyrosensors in the DS to simply point the DS where you want to shoot . Pointing your 3DS up , down , left and right will aim the slingshot up , down , left and right - the only problem is , if you 're trying to use the Cirlce Pad to aim , you 'll often find yourself tilting the 3DS slightly , which makes your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set-up at the moment , though we 're fairly sure it was only for the purpose of the demo - the full game , we 'd imagine , will let you choose either/or . <p> At the top of the web , we came across a ledge , a few more spiders , and , eventually , found ourselves in a room . Upon entering , the door slammed shut and locked behind us , with the **35;316;TOOLONG Zelda jingle letting us know we were in a room with a puzzle . On the one side , a torch burned brightly , while opposite there was a torch that was n't lit . While it was fairly obvious that the challenge was to light the other torch , it may not be immediately obvious how you 're meant to light it . The answer ? You use something that burns . Touching the Deku stick icon on the touch screen , we whipped out a stick ( God knows where we 'd been keeping it , seeing as it 's taller than us ) , and being the pyromaniacs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the other torch , and burning that , too . With a familiar jingle , the door unlocked , we were free to carry on into the temple . <p> The boss , Queen GOHMA in all her/its glory . Pretty scary . <p> And while we played a fair amount of the rest of the dungeon , it 's probably a good idea if we stopped here , as to say any more about what we did would be to spoil the game for yourself . And if the demo 's anything to go by , the last thing we 'd want to do is spoil the experience . From what we 've played , it looks like playing through those dungeons for the first time - solving the puzzles , finding your way through , and saving the kingdom of Hyrule is going to be every bit as enjoyable as it was the first time round . <p> Now all that 's left is for Nintendo to hurry up and set a release date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Instead of working to reduce CO2 levels , the now rotting trees release CO2 back into the atmosphere as they decay . <p> Rising CO2 levels are of major concern .

For both 2010 and 2011 , they do n't expect the forest to absorb the 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 it usually does .

However , this sort of study also benefits from ' blinding ' , when the participants are unaware of what intervention they are receiving . <p> In this study it was not possible to blind the children and their parents as they would have known which foods the children were restricted from eating . These results also can not tell us what the longer-term effects of a restricted diet would have on ADHD . In addition , although this study can tell us about the effect of diet on existing ADHD symptoms , it can not conclude that diet is the only cause of these children 's ADHD . <h> What did the research involve ? <p> This study , called the Impact of Nutrition on Children with ADHD ( INCA ) , recruited 100 children from health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met diagnostic criteria for ADHD , were aged four to eight years , and had families that were willing to follow a five-week restricted diet . Children who were already receiving drug , behavioural or diet treatment for ADHD were excluded . The trial was conducted in two phases . <p> In the first phase , 50 children were randomly assigned to what was described as ' an individually tailored ' restricted diet , and 50 were given advice to follow a healthy and balanced control diet . The children and parents knew which diet they were assigned to but in some cases , the researcher assessing the outcomes of the study was blinded to which diet the children had been on . <p> The restricted diet included only a small number of foods such as rice , turkey , lamb , a range of vegetables ( lettuce , carrots , cauliflower , cabbage and beet ) , pears and water . These foods were selected because they were hypoallergenic ( non-allergy producing ) . <p> The children 's diets were also supplemented with specific foods such as potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for them and their parents to comply with the restrictive diet . These additional foods were removed if the child showed no improvement after two weeks of the diet . The children were also given a non-dairy rice drink with added calcium to ensure that they did not develop calcium deficiency . <p> In the second four-week phase , the children who had responded to the restricted diet ( as demonstrated by at least a 40% decrease in symptoms ) were randomised to one of two dietary challenges . Each challenge involved a different set of foods : one group was given foods expected to induce a **25;229;TOOLONG response if the child was susceptible , and the other group were given foods that are not expected to induce allergic response . This section of the study was a crossover trial , where both groups started one set of foods then after two weeks they swapped over and received the other set of foods for the remaining two weeks . During this phase of the trial both parents , children and assessors did not know whether the food challenges being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children 's ADHD symptoms were assessed using two main questionnaires : the 18-item ADHD Rating Scale ( ARS , score range 0 to 54 ) and the 10-item Abbreviated Conners ' Scale ( ACS , score range 0 to 30 ) . These tests were conducted at study start ( baseline ) , after the eight-week diet , after the first two weeks of the food challenge phase , and then after the remaining two weeks of the food challenge ( when they had switched over to the other diet ) . <p> Due to the children 's young age , the ARS and ACS tests were completed by both parents and teachers ( rather than the child ) . The ARS test was conducted by a researcher who was blinded to the dietary groups , whereas the ACS was only conducted by a researcher who was aware which diet the child had been given . <p> The main outcomes of interest to the researchers were changes in ADHD symptoms from study start to the end of the first restricted diet phase , and differences between the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also assessed the effect of the food hypersensitivity challenge on the child 's immune system . This was assessed by measuring the children 's blood levels of antibodies ( IgG ) to specific foods at the start of the study and comparing them to measurements taken after the challenge phase when they could have been expected to have produced antibodies to any allergens . <h> What were the basic results ? <p> Most of the children in the study were male ( 86% ) with a mean ( average ) age of 6.9 years . Of the 50 children in the restricted diet group , 41 completed the first phase ( 82% ) . Of these , 32 ( 78% ) were found to respond to the restrictive diet ( show a reduction in their ADHD symptoms of at least 40% ) . <p> Between study start and the end of the first phase , the difference between the diet group and the control group in the mean ARS total symptom score was 23.7 points ( 95% confidence interval CI 18.6 to 28.8 ) . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean score 45.3 at study start to 21.1 post-diet ) , and a 2.7% reduction in the control group ( from mean score 47.6 at study start to 46.2 post-diet ) . <p> There was also a significant difference between the groups in mean ACS symptom score from study start to the end of the diet phase ( 11.8 point score difference between groups , 95% CI 9.2 to 14.5 ) , with a 50.7% score reduction in the diet group compared with 0.3% reduction in the control group . <p> Thirty children who responded to the restrictive diet took part in the food challenge phase , 29 of whom completed it . After the food challenge , which involved foods expected to induce an immune response or not , the ARS total score increased by an average of 20.8 points ( 95% CI 14.3 to 27.3 ) and the ACS score increased by an average of 11.6 points ( 95% CI 7.7 to 15.4 ) . In the challenge phase , relapse of ADHD symptoms occurred in 18 of 29 children tested ( 62% ) , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immune response or their IgG blood levels . <h> How did the researchers interpret the results ? <p> The researchers conclude that ' a strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food ' . <p> The second part of the study tested ADHD scores after foods that might be expected to produce a sensitivity/allergic reaction were introduced to the diet . This found some foods were associated with a significant rise in symptom scores . However , the extent to which symptoms returned was independent of blood antibody ( IgG ) levels . As such , the researchers say that prescribing diets according to the child 's specific IgG blood results ( i.e. being guided by which substances the child has blood antibodies against ) should be discouraged . <h> Conclusion <p> This well-designed trial aimed to examine the effect of a five-week food restriction diet on ADHD symptoms . The study had several strengths , including that all children met diagnostic criteria for ADHD and that their symptoms at the start of the study and afterwards were assessed using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents could not be blinded to the diet given , but some blinding was achieved because in some instances the assessors did not know which diet the children had been given . <p> However , as the assessments were largely based on parental reports of symptoms , the researchers acknowledge that ' expectations of the parents can not be fully ruled out as a possible cause of the behavioural improvements ' . In addition , though the study was larger than previous similar studies , it was still relatively small . Ideally , larger studies would confirm its findings . <p> The study found a clear reduction in ADHD symptom scores in children following the five-week restriction diet . In comparison , the control group assigned to being given healthy dietary advice showed no reduction . <p> It is difficult to answer from this study questions such as the longer-term effects of dietary change , ( for example , whether the foods would have to be permanently withdrawn and what effect this would have , or whether they could be gradually reintroduced ) . Although no adverse effects were seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet would need to be carefully monitored by dietitians and other health professionals to ensure that no nutrient deficiencies were occurring . <p> The causes of ADHD are not established and both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role . Although this study can tell us about the effect of diet on existing ADHD symptoms , it can not tell us for certain whether diet alone contributed to causing these children 's ADHD or if other causative factors were also having an effect . <p> It should also be noted that this study examined only young children with ADHD ( average age 6.9 ) , so the findings may not apply to adolescents or young adults with ADHD . It also excluded those who were being treated with medication or behavioural therapies for ADHD , who may have had different results . <p> The diets were described as individually tailored and full details of the individual diets followed are not provided in the main publication . As such , this study has not ' implicated ' particular foods or food substances . For now , it remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guided by the advice of their health-care providers , rather than trying to try to eliminate foods themselves . <p> if there is a clear link , healthcare professionals should advise parents or carers to keep a diary of food and drinks taken and ADHD behaviour <p> if the diary supports a relationship between specific foods and drinks and behaviour , then referral to a dietitian should be offered <p> further management ( for example , specific dietary elimination ) should be jointly undertaken by the dietitian , mental health specialist or paediatrician , and the parent or carer and child or young person

It 's unique external design , powerful hardware which promises to play anything you can throw at it , as well as software that many will have used before make this accessory the one to beat on paper , but how does it work in practice ? And can it stay ahead of its competition with a relatively small team of developers ? Let 's take a look ! <h> Hardware <p> The design of the Boxee Box is best described as ' quirky ' . If you 're looking for another modular , black box to hide discreetly next to your TV , then you may have to look past this particular one ! That 's not at all a bad thing , though . Looking at the press shots of the box , you 'd think it was a mile high , but it fits nicely underneath my TV without any problems . <p> Compared to a device such as the Apple TV , the Boxee Box has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect external storage via the SD card slot on the site , or through the two USB 2.0 ports which you 'll find on the back of the box with all of the other ports . <p> If you 're placing the box near to a router , you may want to take advantage of the 100Mbps ethernet port that 's present and save some wireless bandwidth for your other devices , but it 's just as convenient connecting to a Wi-Fi network thanks to the QWERTY keyboard on the back of the included remote ( more on that in a little while ) . <p> I was glad to see the presence of an SPDIF port for multichannel digital audio support on the box , although the HDMI 1.3a port will be just fine for most people connecting to their TV . You 'll also find two stereo audio ports , giving you a plethora of audio options for your setup . <p> The included remote looks deceptively simple upon first glance . It has 7 buttons , including the four navigational buttons , which allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have a large movie library , however , you will probably want to search for movies directly by typing instead of scrolling through thousands of choices . On devices such as the Apple TV , you would have to do this through using the four navigation buttons and selecting each key on an on-screen virtual keyboard , but not on the Boxee Box . <p> The ingenious remote turns over to reveal a QWERTY keyboard , complete with arrowed buttons , and even numbers and symbols accessible through holding down the Alt key whilst typing . Needless to say , using the remote is an awesome experience , and makes you wonder how manufacturers did n't think of this earlier . Text input is n't exactly a dream , but it 's an incredible improvement over manually navigating to each key and hitting the select button . Apple , screw minimalism and take note . <h> Software <p> The new Apple TV is based on iOS and Google TV is based on Android . Where does the company with no mobile operating system turn to ? Linux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lightweight Linux distribution , so there 's no unnecessary resource hogging from the operating system getting in the way of your media playback . The Boxee team has taken a completely different approach to Apple in terms of media consumption ; there are no walled gardens to be found here , just your content from as many sources as you like . <p> The box runs Boxee v1.0 , as opposed to the beta version of the software that continues to be available for computers running Windows , Mac OS X and Linux . We were lucky , as we received the unit around a month after it had been released , meaning that most of the early bugs were ironed out by the time I tested it out for myself . <p> When I received the unit , it was running the original firmware that shipped with the box , and it was really buggy in places . Playback would cease and crash out if I tried to switch audio tracks on a movie , Wi-Fi speeds were n't exactly stellar , and the performance was decidedly average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmware update makes the entire experience a more positive one . Since the update , I have n't had one single problem , my Wi-Fi connection on the device has been rock solid and I 've been switching audio tracks to my heart 's content without any issues . <p> The interface itself has received a facelift from the beta version , making it a lot more simple to view and navigate , with a clear emphasis on simplicity for the big screen experience . <p> The home screen now has 6 choices at the top : the ' Friends ' option has replaced the social network feed that was visible from the home screen in the beta , and the ' Watch Later ' option has replaced the queue of items waiting to be watched on your account . Featured items now occupy the bottom half of the screen , with three thumbnails directing you to various pieces of content on the web . <p> Some may argue that this adds an additional click to get where you want to go , but after using the software on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beta which I have used a few times since . <p> If you 've used the Boxee media center software before , you 'll be familiar with having all your content in the " Shows " and " Movies " section of the program . If you want to watch a movie that 's on a local hard drive , simply select the " Movies " icon on the home screen to be taken to your local library of content . If your files are named correctly , then they will have already been imported and tagged in Boxee . All you have to do is select the movie that you want to watch , sit back and relax ! <p> One drawback of the Boxee Box , however , is the lack of UK specific content . Our friends on the other side of the pond can enjoy Vudu movies , which delivers 1080p rentals over the net , as well as Netflix . Meanwhile , we 're stuck with , well , 4OD through YouTube and the odd free movie that not many people are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service such as TV Catchup or SeeSaw to deliver tailored content for the UK . Even LoveFilm rentals would be a start , although they are generally very few and far between . <h> Playback Capablities <p> One major gripe that I had with the new Apple TV and other media centres was that it could only handle 720p content . Well , that and you are locked in to Apple 's bubble of content . The situation with the Boxee Box could n't be more different . <p> I 've already mentioned that you can play all of your content from any source ( presuming it is n't protected by DRM ) , but exactly what can the box handle ? I 've tested it thoroughly , playing back a range of content from various sources . <p> Although there is no disc drive in the Boxee Box , it can handle . iso images of DVDs and Blu-Ray discs , albeit without the menu . This suits me fine , as I do n't generally watch additional content on a disc anyway ; I normally just watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to utilise MakeMKV to rip my Blu-Rays and DVDs on to an external hard drive , which I then connected to the box . This meant that all of my Blu-Ray files contain uncompressed video tracks , as they are on the disc itself , as well as a lossless audio track when given on the movie . <p> I played a variety of blu-rays encoded in both AVC and VC-1 -- my HTPC always struggled to play back VC-1 content so I was curious to see how the Boxee Box would handle it . Sure enough , every single thing I threw at it played absolutely flawlessly , with no skipping in the video track or drop in frame rate at all . To put it short , there is nothing that the box can not handle . <p> The only issues I ran into , in fact , were n't video related at all , they were audio related . When playing back movies with a lossless audio track , there were 2 or 3 occasions in the film when the audio track would go silent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought this was an issue with the movie itself and not the box , but it happened on a variety of films encoded in different formats . <h> Wrap-Up <p> There is no doubt in my mind that , quite frankly , the Boxee Box is the best media centre to be released so far . Its capabilities excel far beyond that of the Apple TV , and I could n't find a single thing that it would n't play back . <p> At ? 179 from Amazon , the Boxee Box is an absolute steal , although the lack of UK specific streaming options make it less viable to replace a full TV setup than , say , Apple 's rental system through the Apple TV . <p> Despite this , I ca n't praise Boxee and D-Link heavily enough for this wonderful product they 've created , so do yourself a favour -- buy one , check it out , and break out the popcorn .

We caught up with Bones to get more insight into the label 's aims and ambitions . <p> Tell us about the thinking behind starting Sub Lab . <p> Sub Lab strives to surfaced the hidden sounds of the underground bass music scene . We are about the deep , dark , meditative styles of dubstep/bass music . By connecting with artists ( both musical and visual ) on the same wavelength , we drive our passion to the hearts and minds of our audiences , worldwide . One of our main beliefs is that creativity should have no bounds , guidelines , or restrictions -- our minds are infinite . We have many visions and plans to channel our creativity and passion into all kinds of outlets , not limited to records or music . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , design , fashion , positivity and much more . Having support from the ones who 've inspired me the most pushes me harder to utilize my capabilities and make these visions a reality . <p> What 's the scene like for bass music where you 're located ? <p> The bass music scene here is saturated . I hate to say , but not one event in Dallas truly represents dubstep culture . Promoters and venue owners do not realize the significance of our culture and art . Events are catered to the youth and their demand for mainstream and trending artists . More efforts and money are being invested into lighting rather than sound , limiting the listener to properly listening to our sounds . Every event I have been a part here has either had **29;467;TOOLONG turntables or none available at all . Not many at all are aware of dubplate culture and the significance of playing vinyl . The scene has not been properly educated and is receiving a false representation of dubstep . <p> What do you have coming up ? <p> My dissatisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tension . This will be a new monthly encompassing strictly deep , dark , meditative styles of bass music . We have plans to press vinyl and launch our own store which will sell music , art and merch . Live broadcasts ( radio and video ) are in the works and will be put into play very soon . There are a lot of plans in the works and we do not limit ourselves to anything . We want to work with like-minded people to spread good vibes and creations to as many people as possible . 
@@4000232 <h> George Condo : Mental States , New Museum , New York <p> George Condo has the voices of other artists in his head , each braying for attention . There 's Picasso , commanding him to paint asymmetrical , torn-up figures ; de Kooning , soliciting sweeping , fleshy abstractions ; Goya , lusting for devilish monstrosities . Condo the visual ventriloquist channels them all , along with Pollock , Gorky , Bacon , Matta , Tiepolo and dozens of others . His paintings have the feel of cheerful exorcisms , cathartic forms of imitation that temporarily still the yammering inside his skull . <p> Condo , born in 1957 , had a golden moment in the 1980s , when painting surged back into public consciousness after a time in the post-pop wilderness . At the close of that decade he quixotically decamped to Paris and his reputation plummeted . Even as he continued to sell abroad , US audiences did not know quite what to make of the grotesque mash-ups of old and modern masters that rolled out of his studio . Back in New York in 1995 , he continued to produce prodigious numbers of paintings and a new generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the likes of John Currin , Lisa Yuskavage and Glenn Brown -- who joined Condo in his exuberant plundering of art history -- made his work seem prescient . Now , a selective survey at the New Museum , co-organised with the Hayward Gallery in London ( the show 's next destination ) , makes grand claims for his dexterity , vitality , and endurance . Condo has his virtues , but admirers have burdened him with praise that his art can not withstand . <p> The show opens with a titanic installation of his " portraits " of fictional people . Hung salon style , in uneven rows that start near the floor and climb almost to the ceiling , this one amazing wall , overflowing with stylistic bounty , displays the sweep of his ambition . He applies the modes and methods of his predecessors to further his own fantasies . <p> In the " Madonna " of 1982 , Condo used techniques of layering he had read about in a college art history course , and produced the mutant offspring of Titian and a perfume ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance piety , but her high cheekbones , plucked eyebrows , and resolute jaw have the glossy certitude of a magazine illustration . Condo blurred her face by scraping off the topmost layer of paint , and the result , a mask-like head attached to a stolid , columnar body , feels at once ancient and chic . <p> That painting pointed Condo towards more eclectic dabblings in religious and canonical art . On the same wall , a Magdalene bares her breasts while mushroom ears germinate from under her long red hair . Nearby , a cardinal 's face dissolves into a jumble of fleshy wedges and globular eyes beneath his great red hat . In a more secular vein , a Manet-like nude in fishnet stockings sprouts a werewolf 's head . Condo has married slickness with grotesquerie and thus anointed himself the heir to Velasquez , Manet , Duchamp , and Warhol . <p> " If my work were hanging in a museum , and it did n't look like it belonged with theirs , I 'd be heartbroken , " he told The New Yorker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs . It 's not about competition . It 's about coexistence with the artists you respect . " <p> Condo was raised in the Roman Catholic faith , but his patron saint is the pagan Picasso , whose spirit imbues all the flayed faces and skewed cubistic eyes . He haunts the core of Condo 's endeavour , having successfully flitted between cubist still-lives and neoclassical figures , between painting and pots , between comedy and tragedy . No single style corralled the Spaniard . He contained multitudes , rising above the tired categories that trapped others . And as he leapt from one mode to another , Picasso drew attention away from individual objects and toward his own protean mastery . <p> ' The stockbroker ' ( 2002 ) <p> Condo joins a long line of indebted heirs , artists who have mimed Picasso 's gifts or struggled to adapt his language to their own distinctive syntax . Jackson Pollock even painted like a parricide , obliterating Picassoid figures beneath a vengeful explosion of drips . Condo sees himself more as favoured son than Oedipal adversary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries in the " pictures generation " cut and paste , or " repaint " icons of the past , he leans more towards pastiche , dissecting and rejigging masterpieces , and leavening them with Mad Magazine and Muppets . Condo is more concerned with poaching Picasso 's persona than any of its formal manifestations . <p> The show continues one floor down , in galleries labelled " Melancholia " and " Manic Society " . Here Condo really unleashes his monsters . A pinhead stockbroker and his sow-eared wife look like they just stepped off the set of Todd Browning 's Freaks . A crazily bucktoothed " Executive " poses before a looming carrot that both tempts and threatens to impale him . The " Return of Client 9 " teeters between coarse and truly foul : a hairy fiend crouches over the ballooning buttocks of his prey . Bottles and knives pierce his body as he squeals in agony . She gazes over her shoulder at him with feral pleasure . Does Condo mean his nasty tableau as a critique of Eliot Spitzer , or does he see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's impossible to know , since the artist smears disgust as thickly as paint . <p> Much is made of Condo 's old-mastery way with materials . This skill should be regarded in purely relative terms . No doubt he is more competent than many of his peers in the contemporary art world , but then few of them betray much interest in studying the human figure or the painter 's craft . Condo 's abilities do not stray far outside the skillset of any academically trained illustrator . The myth of his " virtuosity " speaks more directly to critics ' lowered expectations than to his actual accomplishment . Condo invites us to compare his portraits to those of Bronzino and Manet but he does himself a disservice by trying to infiltrate that august company . The comparison bluntly reveals an artist who exploits gimmickry , vulgarity and other people 's ideas .

If more mass falls onto this disk than it can transport inwards , it becomes unstable and breaks into several fragments . <p> So instead of forming just one star at the centre , a group of several stars is formed . The distances between some of the stars can be as small as that between the Earth and the sun . <p> According to Dr Clark , this realisation opens up exciting new avenues for detecting the first stars in the universe . <p> In the final stages of their lives , binaries or multiple stellar systems can produce intense bursts of X-rays or gamma rays . <p> Future space missions are being planned specifically to investigate such bursts from the early universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stars may have been catapulted out of their birth group through collisions with their neighbours before they were able to accumulate a great deal of mass . <p> Unlike short-lived high-mass stars , low-mass stars may survive for billions of years . <p> Dr Clark said : ' Intriguingly , some low-mass primordial stars may even have survived to the present day , allowing us to probe the earliest stages of star and galaxy formation right in our own cosmic backyard .

@@4005238 <h> Animal kingdom gains phylum but loses link <p> A new rearrangement of the animal kingdom has expanded a little-known offshoot into a major branch , and opened a gap between relatively simple and highly complex life . <p> Ocean-dwelling flatworms called acoelomorphs were thought to represent one of life 's early stages , bridging primitive animals with radially symmetrical bodies , like jellyfish and sea anemones , and animals with bilaterally symmetrical bodies , from butterflies to humans . <p> " It was nice to have this intermediate group between jellyfish and the other complicated animals . We 've lost that , " said Max Telford , a University College London geneticist and co-author of the new analysis , published February 9 in Nature . <p> The identity of both worms is a matter of ongoing interpretation among scientists who map life 's tree . Until the early 1990s , both were lumped with the Platyhelmine , or " true flatworm , " phylum . Then genetic data reclassified Xenoturbella as molluscs and acoelomorphs as descended from that unknown , ur-complex animal . <p> Over the last decade , the Xenoturbella interpretation was revealed as a mistake . It was n't a mollusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shellfish prey with genes from Xenoturbella itself . Thus corrected , Xenoturbella was recognized as a phylum unto itself , clearly grouped with other bilaterally symmetrical animals . <p> Now Telford 's team has turned a corrective lens on the acoelomorphs . Like other phylogenists , the team analysed DNA from species in every phylum , searching for patterns of relationships and then constructing a tree to fit the data . But Telford and fellow researchers made one key adjustment , tweaking their algorithms to account for the unusually high mutation rates of acoelomorphs . <p> " They 've evolved much more quickly than other animals , " said Telford . " We suspected that this effect caused previous studies to put them a long way from animals with normal rates of evolution . " <p> This rate-adjusted analysis pulled the acoelomorphs out from the base of the tree of life , and set them down on a far branch alongside Xenoturbella . Together , the two Xenoturbella species and hundreds of acoelomorph species constitute a newly classified phylum , which the researchers named Xenacoelomorpha . <p> Xenacoelomorpha is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , sea cucumbers and acorn worms -- not the most complicated animals , but far more complex than what the acoelomorphs were thought to be . <p> As for what might replace acoelomorphs as a candidate for root-animal status , Telford does n't know . <p> Another question raised by the findings is how and why acoelomorphs evolved in such fashion . Their ancestors were likely creatures with guts , fluid-filled cavities and gill slits . Acoelomorphs have none of these features , and are so physically primitive as to resemble researchers ' notions of how an ancient animal ought to appear . <p> " Now we 've got these very simple worms nested right in the middle of the complex animals , " said Telford . " How did they end up so simple ? They must have lost a lot of complexity . "

@@4005240 <h> The Euro Dollar Market and Financial Crises <p> Eurodollars are time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks outside the United States , and thus are not under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve . Consequently , such deposits are subject to much less regulation than similar deposits within the U.S. , allowing for higher margins . The term was originally coined for U.S. dollars in European banks , but it expanded over the years to its present definition : a U.S. dollar-denominated deposit in Tokyo or Beijing would be likewise deemed a Eurodollar deposit . There is no connection with the euro currency or the euro zone . The first Eurodollars were created by deposits made by the Moscow Narodny bank in 1957 to its branch in London to protect Russian State foreign reserves during the cold war . <p> Eurodollar deposits are a cheaper source of funds because they are free of reserve requirements and deposit insurance assessments .

These instruments are in the main unregulated offshore bearer bonds . No record is kept of who owns them so they are perfect for tax evasion . Thus it is no shock to discover a great source of funds to the Eurobond market comes from The Isle of Man , Jersey , Guernsey , Malta , Cyprus , The Cayman Islands , Barbados , Bermuda , The Virgin Islands , Gibraltar , Monte Carlo , Lichtenstein , Luxembourg , the IFSC Dublin , Hong Kong , Panama and of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all linked to " The City " by a myriad of interconnected accountants , lawyers , financial advisors , consultants and " boutique " banks where secrecy is paramount .

By 1997 nearly 90% of all international loans were in this market .

It features special technology that filters out unwanted engine noises , while transmitting pleasing sounds straight inside the car for maximum driver enjoyment . <p> These three features give the EcoBoost the power and torque of a much larger engine without the size , weight and fuel economy penalties . There is , however , one slight downside to this technology . <p> Turbocharging inevitably muffles an engine 's natural voice , especially higher up the rev range . Floor the throttle in any turbocharged car and the whoosh of the turbo will overpower the more rewarding engine sound . <p> Ford 's engineers have overcome this aural obstacle in the new Focus by adding a small , but hugely effective gadget called a sound symposer to the 1.6-litre EcoBoost engine . The symposer is a sound box that harvests good , engine-generated frequencies from the air intake system and then sends these sound frequencies straight into the passenger compartment . <p> Ford engineer Ralf Heinrichs explained : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhaust and/or intake system which determines this character . Typically , the exhaust system determines engine sound at low revs whereas higher up the rev range the intake system gives the engine its unique voice . <p> " With turbocharged engines , the turbo is an integral part of the intake system and it masks the sound of induction because the whoosh noise becomes dominant when the turbo is spinning at speed . <p> " We needed to recapture or recreate that exciting induction noise so what we 've done with our sound symposer is capture engine oscillations in the intake system downstream from the turbo and then direct them straight into the cabin for a good sporty growl . " <p> The symposer measures just 60 x 50 x 40mm in size and has four internal chambers - two chambers on the engine side and two on the outlet side . The chambers are separated by a moveable flap . Under hard acceleration , the pulsations generated in the intake , or engine side , meet the pivoted flap , producing sound waves which are then transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the passenger compartment via a sound pipe which runs through the bulkhead and into the car 's cabin . <p> " The symposer rebuilds the engine note by revising the signal to noise ratio , " said Ralf . " Our sound symposer really comes alive when the oscillation frequency , the frequency of the sound waves , is between 250 to 450Hz . " <p> Ford 's sound symposer has huge tuning potential . It 's not just the frequency range that can be modified , the sensitivity of the sound feedback can also be adjusted . <p> " We originally developed this technology for the 2005 Focus ST , " said Ralf . " It is also a feature on the Focus RS and Focus RS500 . Both these vehicles have a very high sound feedback or large sound window due to aggressive symposer tuning .

These were originally recorded in 1971 as part of an entire reading of all the 13 stories of this collection for the Royal National Institute of Blind People 's ( RNIB ) Talking Book service . <p> Up till now , they have never been made commercially available in any form and were only made accessible to registered members of the RNIB . As such , they have become somewhat of a Holy Grail for Cushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , simply for finally making them available to a wider audience 40 years after they were originally recorded . <p> The stories that make up Doyle 's original collection were Holmes ' comeback stories when the public demanded more of the master sleuth , despite having apparently drowned in the Reichenbach Falls in The Adventure Of The Final Problem . <p> Choosing Peter Cushing as the narrator was a stroke of genius from RNIB 's side , as the actor was not just a genuine Sherlockian , but had also made quite an impact with his portrayal of the detective in Hammer 's version of The Hound Of The Baskervilles ( 1958 ) , followed by 16 episodes of the BBC series , in which he took over from Douglas Wilmer . In that TV series , he had also already interpreted some of the stories he would later record for the RNIB . <p> Following these audio recordings , he once more played an elderly Holmes in The Masks Of Death ( 1984 ) , and even played Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself for a US TV movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can bet that he was the right man to narrate those stories . <p> For his Holmes and Watson , Cushing mainly relied on his own natural speech , as usual , an utter delight to listen to with his rolling Rs , clipped voice and gentlemanly pronunciation .

In one case , he even seems to have taken a glimpse into the future and channelled Billy Connolly . <p> Though there are warnings that , due to the age of recordings " sound quality may vary " , I ca n't say that I noticed any blemishes .

Mobile banking and mobile payment apps are growing fast as banks and brands push mobile payments , or m-payments , to become more customer friendly . eBay has sold over 30million items via its mobile apps , Starbucks and other brands offer payment apps , Apple is releasing " wave and pay " and Google 's CEO has identified the development of mobile money platforms as a key strategic priority for the search engine giant in 2011 . <p> But identity fraud is on the rise . The National Fraud Authority estimates it costs the UK ? 2.7bn a year and affects 1.8million people . Retail and e-commerce consultants Javelin reckon it to be a $54billion crime worldwide .

Historically , Apple 's operating systems have n't been targeted for abuse , but the rising popularity of iPads , iPhones and apps in business means that cyber-criminals will start attacking that platform . We have already seen the Koobface worm which is a significant threat on the PC being ported to Mac . <p> As with PCs , cyber-criminals may try to access and control mobile devices through compromised apps , thereby raising the effectiveness of botnets to exfiltrate user data from targeted systems .

These can also identify instances of devices that were initially refused admission to a site and that have then changed their identity to try and regain access , a common tactic used by fraudsters . ( The dilemma is that extra security can lead to user dissatisfaction and slower customer experience . ) <p> Silicon Valley Bank is helping our clients improve security in transactions through a combination of improved processes and technological solutions . For example , we now offer Trusteer 's Rapport software as a free download for our online banking clients as part of a comprehensive security plan to minimize risk . Rapport creates a secure tunnel between the user 's keyboard and our online banking website , to minimize the risk of information being captured by an outside party . It validates the website really is hosted by Silicon Valley Bank , thereby reducing risk of sending information to phishing sites . <p> We also keep a close eye on other companies developing security application solutions for mobile devices . For example Vasco Data Security has recently launched Digipass Nano , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turns the phone into a secure device capable of generating one-time passwords and e-signatures . And Accumulate has launched the Safe Frame Library for secure authentication , which utilizes Public Key Infrastructure plus RSA tag key exchange and encrypted TCP/IP communication to the transaction server to provide multiple layers of security . <p> Giesecke &amp; Devrient has introduced a new Mobile Security Card to prevent tapping of mobile phones ( a hot topic among celebrities ) to enhance privacy and prevent phishing . The card fits into the microSD slot in mobiles and contains a controller which encrypts cell phone conversations and securely authenticates the user . <p> We expect to see many more mobile security solutions on show at Mobile World Congress this week , and as they combat the growing threat of m-crime , we would like to see them grow and flourish .

The changing fortunes of the elusive grey-bearded patriarch , now in his sixties , open and close this joint biography . In December 1990 at a festival in Kingston billed as " The Greatest One-Night Reggae Show on Earth " , Wailer was one of 40 bands billed , the main attraction being a showdown between ragamuffin DJ Shabba Ranks and his rival for title of King of Jamaican Music , aka .

" Bunny Wailer , the reclusive survivor , became his quarry , a riddle to be solved . Several trips to Jamaica failed to track him down . Grant is at last accorded an audience with the man - at Gatwick airport . It takes no more than the final three pages of the book to report a happy ending , of sorts .

The new car 's good-looking body has some unusually sharp creases , which present something of a contrast to the curvy organic shapes we see on most cars today ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are first-rate . <p> When it comes to cleverness , it 's a slightly more mixed picture , at least where the seat folding arrangements -- the core of the mini-MPV concept - are concerned . These are fairly standard , with few of the clever touches seen on some competitors ; for example , the rear seat does n't slide backwards and forwards . There is , though a neat false floor that can easily be folded away to increase the already generous boot space . Personally , I think the Verso-S 's outright roominess outweighs the absence of more complicated features ; the rear seat space and load area are both so generous , for example , that there 's less need for a sliding rear seat to juggle space between them . One piece of undoubted cleverness is the new Toyota Touch Multimedia System , a touch-screen interface for the car 's entertainment and other systems of the sort that is usually only found on more expensive models ; it will be upgradable to include sat-nav from May ( including retrospectively on early cars as well ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in clever , too , if you opt to pair its standard 1.33-litre petrol engine with the optional Multidrive automatic continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) . This is actually more economical on official fuel consumption tests than the standard manual because the infinitely variable gearing allows the car to use the correct ratio all the time . The theory is sometimes better than the practice , though . CVTs are very popular in Japan where they are ideal for driving in heavy traffic , and UK drivers who mainly stick to urban areas will probably find the CVT a good choice too . Where it all comes slightly unstuck is in open road work , where the constant engine note of a relatively slow CVT-equipped car can make things feel rather laboured , upsetting the sense of calm that otherwise characterises comfortable progress in the Verso-S . The CVT can also be shifted manually via steering-wheel mounted paddles . In this mode , it is artificially " stepped " and shifts between seven fixed ratios , which does improve things a bit . <p> The manual makes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long journeys , but it still has rather short gearing which makes it feel slightly busy at motorway speeds . If Toyota were to offer the Verso-S with a diesel ( available in some European markets ) or a small turbocharged petrol engine along the lines of Ford 's EcoBoost or VW 's TSI ranges , it would probably open up its appeal to a much wider range of customers . <p> Toyota argues that private owners of small cars who do n't cover large mileages will find it difficult to recoup the typical " diesel premium " it would have to charge of about ? 1,000 . The company is certainly right on the sums , but I ca n't help feeling that the torque , as much as the economy , of a diesel engine would make it an attractive choice for the Verso-S , which , because of its very roominess and practicality , is much more likely to be loaded up with people and stuff , and used on long journeys , than other small cars . And the Verso-S is pretty sharp dynamically , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway .

For further information please read our Cookie Policy . <h> Applicable principles for grant of injunctive relief confirmed <h> Newsletters <p> In a recent decision of the Competition List of the High Court , ( 1 ) Justice Cooke considered whether to grant a series of interlocutory injunctions , the essential purpose of which was to prevent the defendants , pending trial of the action , from selling or offering to sell certain products in the concrete and cement sector at allegedly below-cost prices in breach of Section 4 or 5 of the Competition Act 2002 and Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . <p> Background <p> The plaintiff was an unlimited company engaged in the manufacture and supply of materials -- particularly ready-mixed concrete and related products -- to the construction industry . The first defendant was the holding company of a major commercial group , many of whose subsidiaries were also engaged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a competitor of the plaintiff . For the purposes of the application , the court treated the first and second defendants as one entity . The third defendant was also engaged in this trade and was also a competitor of the plaintiff . The case primarily involved the production and supply of ready-mixed concrete for building construction . This concrete is supplied in various grades , but particularly in the grade known as ' 35 Newton ' ( 35N ) , on which the application focused . The geographic market for that particular product could be defined with some precision , since ready-mixed concrete has to be produced , delivered and used within approximately two hours of its manufacture . Accordingly , the geographic market was defined by a transportation radius from the point of production , which for the parties was effectively the greater Dublin area . <p> Relevant contentions <p> As the basis for the interlocutory relief sought , the plaintiff claimed that it was at imminent risk of having to cease as a competitor in the relevant market as a result of alleged anti-competitive conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% of sales , according to the plaintiff -- appeared to be based on supply contracts concluded through tendering processes . Although the defendants might not individually have held a dominant position based on their respective market shares , the plaintiff contended that together they occupied a position of dominance . First , the plaintiff claimed that the third defendant was in fact secretly owned or controlled by the first and second defendants . Second , it contended that a position of joint dominance between the defendants existed , founded on some unspecified form of financial interdependence or assistance between them , which resulted in collusive bidding . Finally , it was alleged that the defendants should be understood as having a ' collective dominance ' in tendering for contracts at prices which were anti-competitive because they were well below cost . It was contended that , as a consequence of the deliberate below-cost pricing and exclusionary strategies of the defendants , the plaintiff would be put out of business unless an injunction constraining the defendants from tendering for any new business at prices which were at least not below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants categorically denied the allegations , resisted the application and insisted that there was no relationship of ownership , financial interdependence or day-to-day cooperation between them . Rather , they asserted that they operated only as independent competitors or as supplier and customer . <p> Campus Oil test <p> Notwithstanding dispute between the parties on the issues of fact , the legal approach to be adopted by the court in considering the application was clear and involved the application of the well-established test for the granting of injunctions from Campus Oil Limited v Minister for Energy ( No 2 ) , ( 2 ) in the following terms : <p> whether the plaintiff has established the existence of a ' fair issue ' or ' serious question ' for determination by the court at the trial ; <p> whether , in the circumstances of the claim , the nature of the acts or conduct sought to be restrained and the losses which have been or will be incurred depending upon whether the injunction is granted or refused , damages will be an adequate remedy ; and <p> depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the injunction . <p> Consideration of issues <p> In terms of the first limb of the test , for obvious reasons , the court did not consider it necessary or appropriate to make a detailed determination of whether there was a fair issue to be tried . The court then acknowledged that the second criterion of the Campus Oil test has two aspects to it . First , should the plaintiff succeed at trial , would damages properly payable by the defendants adequately compensate it for any loss suffered in the interim ? Second , should the plaintiff fail in the action but have been awarded the injunction in the interim , would damages adequately compensate the defendants for any losses incurred arising from the injunction and would the plaintiff be able to make good its undertaking as to damages to that effect ? <p> The court recognised that the relations between all of the entities were commercial in character and the alleged losses were losses in the course of trade ; the damage arising therefrom was primarily , if not exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties in calculation , it was not an exercise which was impossible in the case at hand. ( 3 ) Nevertheless , the assertion was made that any such final damages would be inadequate as the plaintiff would have been put out of business by then . <p> However , the court felt that the affidavit evidence before it did not substantiate the current financial position of the plaintiff or the nature or extent of the financial difficulties it claimed to face . It commented that no explanation had been given to the court as to the alleged resulting drop in turnover , and there was no reference to particular losses incurred or to the overall results of the company in recent years . Moreover , it was not asserted that the plaintiff was , or was about to become , insolvent ; no company accounts were exhibited and no detailed affidavit filed by the company auditors or accountants . Ultimately , it found that there was no evidential basis for concluding that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff if the injunction were to be refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this criterion posed a difficulty for the plaintiff . Given the requirement to give an undertaking as to damages in the event that the injunction was wrongly awarded , and given the plaintiff 's own evidence as to its precarious financial position , it was not possible for the court to conclude that it would be in a position to make good its undertaking as to damages , in the absence of any indication as to how the undertaking would be secured . <p> Consequently , as well as noting the practical difficulties of awarding an injunction in the terms sought , the court refused the application for lack of adequate proof that the claimed loss from the alleged conduct of the defendants could not be adequately compensated by damages . As a result , the court did not need to go on to consider the third criterion of the Campus Oil test . <p> Comment <p> Although this decision does not represent a new departure or development in the law , it usefully serves to reiterate the well-established test applicable to the award of injunctions under Irish law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Irish courts , and confirms that a party seeking an injunction needs to put before the court detailed evidence on affidavit on each aspect of the applicable test . <p> ( 3 ) " Difficulty , as distinct from complete impossibility , in the assessment of such damages should not ... be a ground for characterising the awarding of damages as an inadequate remedy .

You get to a certain age when the obituary columns start to fill with characters who have populated your world . Hardly a month goes by now without someone passing away whose records I own , whose films I have seen , sporting triumphs I have admired , books I have read or even whose names and achievements I have just subliminally noted as part of the fabric of the times I have lived through . Such moments give pause to reflect on mortality , time , achievement , loss ... but even for my own particular heroes , I am rarely perturbed by the spectre of death , except on tragic occasions when someone is cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 . Not so old , perhaps , but not young ; older than my own father when he died . And the truth is , I knew little of her . Indeed , unless you were family or a friend , she is unlikely to have figured strongly in your life . She was an artist and political activist , but essentially a private person , who intersected with the wider world at only one moment in her life , aged 19 , hanging on the arm of a young , suede-jacketed folk singer , smiling happily on a cold New York morning , for the cover of the classic 1963 album , The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan . <p> It 's the singularity of this image that , I think , made her death register quite so intensely , framing her almost as the symbol of a passing era . For most people in pop culture , their visibility extends over a long period and a range of interactions with the world .

It is a snapshot , unplanned and authentic , that came at the end of a photo session in the Jones Street apartment they shared , when they walked out into a snow covered street , and Columbia records staff photographer Don Hunstein kept clicking away . They are walking towards an unknown future , protected by their togetherness . Dylan is the more private one , hunched shouldered , staring at the ground ( and obviously freezing in his thin suede jacket ) . It is Rotolo who welcomes the viewer into the image , looking out directly at the camera , smiling . <p> I was two years old when that album came out , and in my late teens before I discovered it for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then , a woman in her thirties . Dylan was a kind of rock God , a revolutionary wordsmith who had utterly transformed popular music and who had been cursed with near religious adoration for his troubles .

Its resonance is only enhanced when filtered through the bittersweet knowledge of what lies ahead : two young people , cuddling in the cold , happy just to be together , the last innocent moment before the Sixties unfolds full force . <p> Occasionally I have come across Suze Rotolo in a Dylan biography , although she was always a sketchy character . Their relationship lasted from the summer of 1961 , when they met at a folk music concert in a New York church , until a protracted and painful break-up in 1964 , when he became involved with Joan Baez . Rotolo was evidently a powerful influence on Dylan , introducing him to the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York .

Of the songs Dylan wrote when they were together , she once said , " I can recognise things . It 's like looking at a diary . It brings it all back .

She could be the girl remorsefully spurned in ' It Ai n't Me Babe ' and more cruelly turned down in ' Do n't Think Twice Its Alright ' ( " I once loved a woman , a child I 'm told " ) . The one song in which she undoubtedly features is the angry , vindictive ' Ballad In Plain D ' from 1964 's Another Side of Bob Dylan , a song Dylan later admitted , " was n't very good .

@@4031238 <h> The couple stopped by a court from fostering children tell Cassandra Jardine of their sense of injustice . <p> Eunice Johns greets me , a total stranger , with an embrace . " I like to hug , " she says . A minute later , when I am looking for a tissue to blow my nose , she hands me half her packet . These are the actions of a true Christian . And that 's the problem . Eunice lives according to the instruction she finds in the Bible -- and one of those instructions is that sex should be confined to marriage . For that reason , she and her equally beaming , gentle husband , Owen , have not been allowed to foster children . <p> Yesterday , two High Court judges upheld the decision of Derby City Council not to approve the Johns family as carers . There were no objections to them saying grace before meals or taking foster children to church on Sunday . The sticking point was their answer to the question : " Would you tell a child it was OK to be homosexual ? " The Johns replied that they would not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lifestyle . <p> Both Eunice , 62 and Owen , 65 , are born-again Christians . They came to Britain from Jamaica in their teens and found their " vibrant " form of worship -- clapping and gospel singing -- out of kilter with the Church of England . They joined The Church of the God of Prophesy , based in Tennessee ; Eunice teaches at Sunday school . <p> In the Eighties , when the last of their own four children was soon to leave home , the couple took up fostering in their four-bedroom house . " We love children and we wanted to give something back to society , " says Eunice , a retired nurse . Over the course of a decade or so , while Owen worked at Rolls-Royce , they had dozens of children to stay with them for three- or four-week spells , providing respite for their regular carers . <p> After a gap of a decade , during which they ran a catering business , they decided to return to fostering in 2007 , offering respite care for five- to eight-year-olds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even find out how much the money was , " says Eunice , even though foster carers can earn ? 250 per child per week .

Instead , to their surprise , they received a letter thanking them for withdrawing their application . <h> Related Articles <p> The problem ? Their views , they learnt , had disbarred them from caring for other people 's children under the 2007 Equalities and Sexual Orientation regulations . As interpreted by Derbyshire social workers , and now the law courts , this means that they have to endorse homosexuality . " I worked with homosexuals as a nurse and it was never a problem , " says Eunice . " The issue never arose with any of the children who came to stay with us . If it were to , I would ask social services for a professional to deal with it . " <p> She might have done better to fudge the issue when asked a direct question . " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just take on and off . It is our lifestyle . " Her husband adds that this ruling represents " the first stage of persecution " . <p> In the courtroom battle , Christianity has lost to equality rights . But the real losers here , say Eunice and Owen , are the children who wo n't have loving homes , because people like themselves will be put off from coming forward . Many Christians with strong Biblical objections to homosexuality are of Afro-Caribbean origin -- the very social group most in demand for fostering and adoption . <p> Several other members of their Pentecostal congregation are foster carers . The difference between them and the Johns is that they were n't scrutinised during the last three years . In other local authorities , Christians with similar views have been approved because the ruling has not been uniformly applied . This week 's judgment comes at a time when demand has never been greater : since the death of Baby P in 2007 , ever more children have been taken into care . <p> Social services like to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Eunice , " ca n't they match us with children from similar religious backgrounds ? Only this week Derbyshire social services were advertising for more black foster carers . Many people were waiting for this ruling to decide whether to apply . " Now they may not offer to share their homes . <p> A good thing , too , says Cathy Ashley , chief executive of the Family Rights Group . " It is unfortunate that this case is being portrayed as religion pitched against liberal human rights , " she insists . " But the state has to provide children with homes that are not just loving but supportive . Even if the children the Johns want to foster are too young to be concerned about their own sexuality , they might have a homosexual brother and this could be a problem . <p> " There is a danger of saying that anything is good enough because there is a shortage of carers , but these children have often been through hell . Instead , we need to encourage more people to come forward as potential carers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be carers , and to question whether so many children need to be taken into care at all . " <p> The new ruling has also met with approval from many Christians who do n't share the Johns 's views . " Christ himself said nothing about gay people , " says Michael Arditti , a gay Christian and author of Lourdes , a novel that debates Christian versus secular values . " The only aspect of personal relationships that Christ consistently condemned was divorce . People who propagate hatred are directly responsible for the huge number of homophobic attacks which continue to blight the lives of ordinary people . We can not stop such people injecting their poison in their own children , but we can stop them from doing so to other people 's . " <p> Eunice and Owen , however , do n't appear militant except when they quote the Bible . Indeed , they would never have taken their case through two lower courts to the High Court had Eunice not been watching the Revelation Channel three weeks after Derby turned them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline Matherick , whose 11-year-old foster child was removed from their care by Somerset social services after they , too , refused to endorse homosexuality . <p> The Mathericks ' case was fought by the Christian Legal Centre , which succeeded in getting them reinstated .

" We are n't focused on the homosexual issue , " she says , " but it 's the issue of our times . " <p> In some instances , the line between private belief and human rights is clearer . If a child were being cared for by Jehovah 's Witnesses who did not believe in blood transfusions , the state would intervene . " The rights of the child have to come first , " agrees Eunice , who is using the CLC 's central London offices as a base . <p> But many of the test cases taken up by the CLC deal with the fuzzy area between personal conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct same-sex civil ceremonies , B&amp;B owners who do n't want to take unmarried couples , a nurse suspended for offering to pray for a patient .

" In Italy and Germany , the Johns would not have this trouble . When the Italians were told that they could n't have crosses on classroom walls , they simply ignored it . In America , Christians would invoke the first amendment on the freedom to worship . This country is in the vanguard of legislation -- for better or worse , depending on your point of view .

For yesterday was a busy day for fishy news , in particular the issue of discards . Discards , as we explained very recently , are the unwanted fish caught , killed and thrown back over the side of fishing boats . <p> This is not a new issue of course , but there was an unprecedented event in Brussels yesterday that made sure that fish discards were high on the media agenda : namely , an EU-wide discussion to consider a ban on discarding fish . <p> The EU fisheries commissioner , Maria Damanaki , has started a much-needed discussion about possible ways to implement ban on catching and throwing away fish . Whilst no decisions have yet been made , there were a few options on the table ( in this document , which you 're not supposed to have seen , oops ! ) . As I mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to the many problems in Europe 's shared seas , but it is a vital first step . <p> Now there have been grumblings about discards over many years , including talk about instigating a ' ban ' similar to the Norwegian system , whereby all dead commercial fish species must be landed . There have also been many attempts to address the issue of discards with ' better ' fishing methods , and other laudable initiatives , like the Scottish fleet 's catch quota scheme . <p> But the issue of discards has become something that a growing number of people - including Damanki , UK fisheries minister Richard Benyon , Fearnley-Whittingstall and yours truly- agree needs urgent action . And that 's understandable . Everyone abhors discards , they make no sense , and are the most obviously insane product of a system of European fisheries legislation that is fundamentally flawed . <p> So , it is only right that this key issue is at the heart of discussions on what reform those regulations need . <p> There are some who think a discard ban is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vital . Our starting point needs to be : discards are wrong . Only by doing that will we get round to fixing the problem . If all the fish caught is brought back to land we will immediately have better scientific information on the make-up of catches . We will accurately be able to see where the biggest problems are , and then can take steps to eliminate them . <p> Lest we forget , the point is to stop the ' unwanted ' fish being caught in the first place , and to do that we will need to find ways of fishing better , set areas off-limits that are not fished , and also have a more realistic attitude as consumers when it comes to buying fish . <p> This is just the first step , but it 's a hugely important one .

One point that seems to have been overlooked in this debate is , the reason why Fishermen have to dump huge amounts of marketable fish they catch , which according to the Scientists are at very low levels and are n't there , this can only be due to the Science being wrong , as all Fishermen have always argued . When a marine Biologist who knows nothing about catching fish , charters a boat not suitable for conducting a survey , goes to an area which has always been baron of fish , puts unsuitable nets in the water and surprisingly catches no fish , this could never be considered as a credible survey and does not mean fish stocks are low , unfortunately all of the fisheries surveys are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information as if it had some form of credibility and completely ignore the only professional peoples opinions in the industry , the Fishermen .

But a museum spokesman said that under current proposals only three curatorial posts are to be lost out of a total of 27 . <p> " There is no plan , as Mary Beard writes , to make ' most ' of the pre-modern senior curators redundant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the museum has proposed losing one senior curator post out of the four existing senior curator posts in the pre-modern department , plus two senior curator posts out of the four existing history posts one of these posts is vacant and has been for the past two years .

Final decisions about job losses are expected in early June . <h> Comments <p> What does that tell us about the service/sector we work in ? It tells us that we are aware that negative comments in a public forum about the respective services we work for is probably something that breaches an employer 's policy , and that it could come back to haunt us in ways that we really do n't want it to .

You can only dumb down and cut so much before the visitor offer becomes stale , and even the managers figure that one out eventually . <p> The cuts and haeomorrhaging away of expertise are happening across the heritage sector . If the march of the managerial moronic philistines continues I think that no-one in the sector will be unaffected , which as already pointed out , will be a travesty , and everybody is the poorer . Probably there will be plenty more stories like this in the coming months . My service 's story ? A recent re-structure ( pre global financial meltdown ) saw curatorial capacity and authority reduced in favour of ...... wait for it ....... even more managers !

The teacher behaved badly and the boys reacted . Thackeray is furious with his pupils . <p> Another boy is outraged . The teacher was in the wrong , and had behaved badly first . He puffs out his chest shouting , " Just cause he 's a teacher ? ? " <p> Thackeray turns to Potter . " Do you think you behaved like an adult ? " <p> The boy slowly bows his head , shaking it slightly . But his friend is n't having it . " How about Mr Bell apologising ! " <p> So it goes on . It reminds me of Jamie 's Dream School , made in 2011 , on again tonight at 9pm . In last week 's episode , David Starkey called a pupil ' fat ' . No doubt he was remembering his own school days , and was trying to be cool . He clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher in the land watching that scene took a deep breath when he said it . We knew what was coming . The boy gets angry , insults Starkey , causes havoc in the lesson , and makes it clear that not only is he lost for the rest of that lesson , but he may be lost for good . <p> What is the result ? Jamie and John D'Abbro , the Head of Jamie 's school and a Head in real life discuss possible disciplinary for Starkey , and how his comment about the child being fat was unacceptable . Their discussion in the main revolves around who insulted who first . As it was recorded , they know for sure that it was Starkey who committed the first sin . What particularly disappointed me about Starkey was that he told Jamie Oliver that it was the boy who had insulted him first . You 'd think we were dealing with a bunch of five-year-olds in the playground . How utterly humiliating for Starkey not only to have called the boy ' fat ' , but then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starkey . I do n't care about him . It 's the boy that matters . When all is said and done , David Starkey will always be David Starkey . He 'll be fine . The boy , on the other hand , is depending on the adults and teachers in his life to do what is right by him . Does John D'Abbro call the boy in and explain that his reaction is out of order ? Does he get angry like Thackeray , and demand that his pupils rise above the petty behaviour of others , even that of their teachers , and teach him about the value of turning the other cheek , of respect , and dignity ? No . All he and Jamie talk about is possible consequences for Starkey . He insulted the boy first , and that 's all that matters . <p> Thackeray stares at his kids with dismay and revulsion at the idea that he should be backing the children against Mr Bell . <p> " My business is with YOU -- not with Mr Bell . " He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you a man , or a hoodlum ? " <p> I always used to ask my boys , " Are you a man , or a mouse ? " Men do n't hit back , I 'd say . Men are better than that . But Potter 's friend is n't having any of it . Just like the ' fat ' boy 's friend is n't having any of it . ' If teachers do n't respect us , we wo n't respect them . " <p> Potter 's friend tells him to apologise because he has to , because otherwise he wo n't get his reference , because after all , power lies with the teachers . Potter moves towards the door . Thackeray stops him . <p> " If you apologise because you 're afraid , then you 're a child , not a man . " <p> So the boy chooses to apologise , not because he has to , but because he wants to , because he wants to be a man . That 's how it was in 1967 . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , ( and the other children who are in desperate need of such a conversation ) not his Head , not his teacher , not his mother , not anyone . All we care about in 2011 is who said it first . David Starkey was in the wrong ; there is no question . But if this issue is n't addressed in tonight 's programme , then I 'm getting into a time machine and I 'm moving back to 1967 !

@@4052232 <p> MG is back with the new 6 hatchback and saloon , a sort of Focus/Golf/Octavia rival with a sporting bent and prices to make you look twice . The MG 6 1.8 Turbo TSE reviewed by CAR costs ? 18,995 , but you can have the same blown 1.8 in humbler S spec for ? 15,495 . <p> Those are pre VAT increase prices and will be held for the launch period , claims MG . Expect prices to nudge up in the next few months , as they were set before showroom tax crept up from 17.5% to 20% . <h> So we 'll buy the MG 6 because it 's cheap and built in China ? <p> Touch ? . The new MG is well priced with a strong spec ( our TSE packs leather , 18in alloys , sat-nav and electric everything ; all models have twin climate control , electric windows , alloys , tyre pressure sensors , four airbags ) , but we 're here to find out if the MG 6 is good enough to warrant the Morris Garages badge . <p> This is an important moment : until now , nothing 's changed since the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse in 2005 . Sure , we 've had the rebooted MG TF , but they 've only sold a couple of hundred roadsters a year while the masterplan was cooked up . There 's been much talk of the Chinese manufacturers assaulting the European market - and here 's the first visible proof . <p> They 're downplaying the launch , and initial launch aspirations are modest , but make no mistake : the launch of the MG 6 marks a watershed in China 's automotive industry . MG is owned by SAIC , which builds 80% of the 6 at home before shipping over for final assembly in Longbridge , Birmingham , and China 's biggest car maker has serious long-term ambitions for Europe . <h> The MG 6 is a harbinger of things to come ? <p> Yep . That svelte style , which somehow manages a fine balance of Euro sensibility with just a few suggestions of eastern promise ( those piercing headlamp details , a hint of Mazda 6 from the side ) , suggests that future MGs will possess style and competitive engineering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The front sub-frame is related to that in the old Rover 75 , since it means the same pick-up points can be used on the Longbridge line and in Shanghai ; and the fusebox is an old Rover unit , too . The K-series engine has been hugely fettled by the Chinese , but this 1.8 is essentially an upgraded , turbocharged K. Everything else is new . <h> MG 6 : the road test review bit <p> Once you 've stopped ogling the outside ( and you will , particularly in the burnt orange of our test car - see our full photoshoot in the May 2011 issue of CAR Magazine ) , you reach for a key and you 're immediately disappointed . It 's a cheap , shiny block that does n't have the heft of rivals from the Ford or Volkswagen empires . Almost immediately , you spot other fit and finish problems : the leather you sit on looks more related to chemicals than cows ; some of the cabin trim feels like it has n't a full grain ; and some of the switchgear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . The trip computer was barely usable . MG claims this is a late pre-production model ( do n't they all ? But we should allow this fledgling start-up some slack ) . <p> The MG 6 is an interesting half size , mimicking the Octavia 's neither-Focus-nor-Mondeo segmentation . Like the Skoda , there is consequently oodles of space inside . You really can fit four big grown-ups in here and those rear seats are comfy . The boot is big at 498 litres , trumping the 350 litres in a Golf or Focus ( 385 ) , though trailing the massive Czech 's 585 litres . <h> MG 6 Turbo : that brings back some memories ... <p> That badge does remind us of some well-known Maestros and Montegos , but we should manage your performance expectations here . The 6 is n't that fast . The raw figures say 120mph ( limited to lower the insurance rating ! ) and 0-60mph in 8.4sec , but the truth is the 6 Turbo feels slower than that . This is quite a heavy car . You 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable affair since the change is positive of action if a touch long of throw . <p> We suspect faster versions will be in the pipeline ( we know a V6 will fit under that bonnet ) , as well as cheaper ones to take the shine off the Octavia 's ? 13k starting price . But this is a good launch product : the dynamics feel really well resolved . I had an MG ZT 190 and there is a similar feel to the MG 6 - hardly surprising since many of the same chassis engineers developed the front MacPherson struts and multilink rear end . <p> The ride is well judged : there 's a Ford-like firm damping , with just enough pliancy to take the jag out of bumps , and body control is first rate . Traction is good too , with nary a flicker from the electronic aids . The steering is hardly alive with feel or laser turn-in , but it 's just as responsive and precise as buyers in this class would expect . <p> One black mark on the MG 6 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derv comes in 2012 , when left-hand drive production is scheduled . Until then you 'll have to put up with the 184g/km of CO2 produced by the 1.8 turbo . <h> Verdict <p> The MG 6 impressed us . Dynamically , it 's a big success . This is good news . If it had missed the spot , and trampled over the MG heritage of making accessibly priced sporting cars , that would be hard to fix . <p> As it is , the only question marks remain over the poor fit and finish in certain isolated areas , in particular the operation of cabin switchgear . If you excuse these details and believe MG when it promises to fix most glitches before launch , the 6 feels well made , precise and of competitive quality in this class . We 're inclined to believe them : the HVAC heating controls swivel and click with the best of them , so there 's no reason to believe they ca n't fix the wonky controls . <p> On that basis , it 's hard not to judge the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines nearly the space of an Octavia , with a drive comparable to a Focus or Golf , at prices to make you think twice . With that badge behind it , the MG is surely in a stronger position than a new Chinese start-up . This initial effort suggests the reborn MG could be a dark horse .

@@4052237 <h> The future of CRM <p> CRM used to be the flavour of the month , but of late it has fallen from grace . Richard Snow looks at the future of CRM and where it goes from here . <p> Before discussing the future of CRM , first you have to define what it is and , believe me , that is not as easy as it seems . In fact , if you follow some of the active discussions on LinkedIn , you might well come away more confused than when you started . <p> Two in particular grabbed my attention : " Who should own CRM ? " and " Why do Sales hate CRM ? " . <p> The first ended up going to the heart of my question -- " is CRM a philosophy , strategy , concept or just a system ? " Without giving full justice to the debate , the majority come down on the side that it is a system . <p> Why do Sales hate CRM ? <p> The second discussion stayed firmly on the side that CRM is a system , in fact leaning heavily towards salesforce automation , and Sales(people) hate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit ( oh and by the way , they do n't like the fact that managers use it to monitor how many calls they make ) . <p> Now there is no doubt that there are a lot of vendors out there selling what they term CRM products . The problem is that these range from systems to maintain a customer contact database up to fully integrated systems that include salesforce automation , marketing automation and functionality to record and manage customer cases , and everything in between . <p> As with any software product some will disappear , some will remain ( with the vendor adding functionality ) , and new ones will come to market . But above anything else what is likely to change the most is the supply models offered by vendors . <p> We are all used to the traditional model where you pay the vendor an upfront licence fee , you implement the product on a system housed in your own data centre , and you pay an ongoing support fee for new releases and product support . <p> Hosted CRM solutions <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies still prefer this model . But increasingly companies are moving to a mixed model where some applications are housed in-house and others are housed at a third-party site -- typically the product vendor 's , and accessed remotely -- typically over the Internet . <p> To help confuse the poor buyer , different vendors call this model " hosted " , " software as a service " , or the very latest " cloud-based " . These do have some subtle differences but no matter what the vendor calls it , the new model is not to have the application in-house but to access it remotely and pay a monthly access charge . <p> On-premises applications will be around for a long time <p> I 'd go along with most other analysts and say this is likely to become the model used by more and more companies , but I do stop short of saying it is the only model companies will use -- on-premises applications will be around for a long time yet . <p> But for me CRM should NOT be about a system . If anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ a much misused phrase , it is about being customer-centric -- putting the customer at the heart of everything a company does . That is not to say do anything at any cost to keep customers satisfied -- a proposition put forward by several contributors to a discussion on " what is more important , revenue or the customer ? " . <p> Business is about balance <p> Business is about balance ; a balance between keeping customers satisfied and making money . Imbalance often leads to bankruptcy . <p> The worst scenarios I see are companies run by numbers that are n't actually designed to achieve the overall business objective , for example , call centres run to drive down average handling time ( costs ) without regard to satisfying the customer . <p> To achieve this balance , companies need a strategy on how they want to treat different customer segments . I believe the old idea that you could do this by individual is not practical . <p> The strategy then needs to be executed through a series of best-practice processes , properly trained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver the desired business goal , and enabled by appropriate systems . <p> Old-style CRM strategies are outmoded <p> So at this point I have to own up and say that , for me , old-style CRM strategies are outmoded and companies need to move on . <p> I base this on two observations . Firstly , consumers increasingly do n't want relationships with companies and customer loyalty is on the decline . <p> This is illustrated by some consumer research I saw recently that showed just over 50% of consumers have in the last 12 months stopped doing business with a company simply because of one bad experience on a phone call to a contact centre . <p> My second observation is that what counts now is the customer experience in its broadest sense . If the buying process is good then customers will buy again ; if the website works well then customers will use it ; if agents resolve issues then customers will actually remain satisfied ; companies might even get IVR scripts right ! ! The list goes on . <p> Customer experience management ( CEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , customer experience management ( CEM ) is replacing CRM . The systems that companies use to support CEM might indeed include what we now think of as CRM , but they will include others such as a smart agent desktop and more natural language-based websites , many of which will be accessed in the cloud . <p> A major challenge for companies will therefore be keeping the customer experience consistent across all channels of communication and making sure customers get the same information no matter how it is delivered . <p> Get this right and I predict customers will actually come back and buy more , cost less to support , and recommend your company to others . <h> Comments on : The future of CRM <p> First I 'd like to say thank you for the insightful overview into the future of CRM ( CEM ) . <p> I agree that CRM is a mindset , rather than just a system or solution -- and companies usually rely on a series of SLA 's or KPI 's to ensure they get the balance right between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses are concerned , the means to deliver CRM is pretty much irrespective -- as long as the system is available , it does n't really matter to them where it is . <p> CRM has always appeared to be a reactive force for Customer Services -- problems arise and are dealt with as and when they happen . CRM for sales on the other hand is more about the opportunities being presented and tends to be more interactive . For CRM to make it 's way , I would expect there to be less reactive actions and more pro-active ones . The sheer amount of information that can be made available by the CRM " system " to the CRM " workforce " has , up to now , been utilized as supplemental information . Whilst sub-systems do exist to auto-respond to known queries , this aspect has yet to mature into a " self-serving " CRM across any Channel -- what I think is being referred to here as " CEM " . <p> The customer base is also much more tech savvy than it ever was -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a solution to their problem , you can bet they 've probably already been there before they contact the business . The " customer experience " at that point needs to be one of understanding and resolution , rather than referral and a " job number " . <p> For me , the future of CRM ( CEM ) is about convergence of the people , processes and technologies -- where the technology supplements and enhances the business , rather than being seen as a hinderence to the workforce . If you can get CRM ( CEM ) Systems to assist , rather than simply provide , it will truly be accepted as a useful tool to the workforce . <p> Thanks again for the insights ! <p> Tony <p> Posted by Tony Tillyer -- 17 Mar @ 12:54 pm <p> Great post . I completely agree that business is about balance ; a balance between keeping customers happy and still making a profit . For a customer call center , time is definitely money because most retail call centers have only a two-minute window to answer questions before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays , moving at " Internet speed " requires up to the second visibility into the business . Hence why CEM is replacing CRM , because CEM focuses on every customer interaction .

This is where Operational Intelligence , a real-time business analytics solution , comes into play , to give executives and functional business users visibility into their business processes , enabling insight decisions that will prevent customer experience problems before they occur .

@@4054233 <h> A prime example of when hard work and dedication pays off <p> Saturday , 21 January 2006 . Place -- Old Trafford . Occasion -- Manchester United are playing arch rivals Liverpool in a Premier League fixture . Situation -- the game is into the last minute . <p> There are seconds to go before the Referee blows his whistle to end the game . The score is 0-0 . United are attacking down the left hand side going towards the Stretford End . Giggs is fouled and the Referee awards a free kick mid-way between the touchline , and the Liverpool 18 yards line . Giggs stands on the ball -- he awaits the arrival of United 's big defenders , O'Shea , Ferdinand , and Brown in the box . Liverpool pull all ten men back inside their penalty area and mark man for man . Giggs takes three paces back from the ball , he looks up , and then he strides towards it , striking it perfectly . The ball is floated towards the area between the six yard line and the penalty spot . It seems to take an age .... But then there is a blur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool defenders . He meets the ball squarely with his forehead and thumps the ball ferociously towards the Liverpool goal . Dudek the Liverpool goalkeeper flies through the air and gets a hand to it ..... but he can not prevent it from entering the goal . Old Trafford erupts ..... the game is won . <p> United 's covering defender , captain Gary Neville , leaps into the air then turns and races down towards what was once the Old Trafford Paddock , now the area set aside for away supporters . 2000 or more Liverpool fans sit inside that paddock and are stunned and sickened by Ferdinand 's late goal . Standing immediately down in front of them , pumping both arms in celebration , Neville then grasps the Manchester United badge on his shirt and pulls it outward towards the Liverpool fans . His face is contorted with overwhelming joy and passion ... the victor over the vanquished . The Liverpool fans are not happy and show their annoyance . But for Neville it does not matter , he does not care , he is living the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than beating United 's arch rivals from down the East Lancashire Road in the final moments of what was a tough , and sometimes bitterly fought game . United fans seeing him in his moment of triumph , respond in unison ; <p> " Gary Neville is a Red , is a Red . Gary Neville is a Red , is a Red . He hates Scousers . " <p> The grasping of the Manchester United badge on his shirt comes naturally to him . Unlike the majority of Premiership players who grasp their shirt badge , and then kiss it as they run towards their own fans , only for them to later show that the badge , or club which the play for , means nothing at all -- Neville 's commitment to both , means everything to him . In his own words ; <p> " I always tell the young players here , if you look down at your shirt and see a Manchester United badge , you 're not having a bad day . You 're doing all right . The day I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad one for me . I do n't think I can ever have the same feeling playing for another football club .

That 's why I always say that the people within the club are just there to serve it . It 's the club and the badge that matters so much . The players are just adding their little bit to a massive depth of history . " <p> For his celebration in front of the Liverpool fans , Neville was later fined 5000 pounds by the FA . Churlish when you see players doing the same thing week in , and week out , in other stadiums throughout the country . But then again , Gary Neville is the Captain of Manchester United , and there is one rule for Manchester United , and another rule for everybody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originate from ? How did Manchester United become so ingrained in him that it consumes him and courses through his veins ? It has been a fascinating journey . <p> Gary Alexander Neville was the first born son of Neville , and Jill Neville , when he entered this world on 18 February 1975 . The Nevilles were to have two other children , twins , a son Philip , and daughter Tracey . The family lived in Bury , Lancashire . There was a strong sporting ethos in the family , and father Neville , had at one time been on the playing staff at Lancashire County Cricket Club . As their children grew , Neville and Jill encouraged them not only to pursue their academic abilities , but also their sporting abilities as well . Gary developed his love of football in primary school and surprisingly represented an under -- 11s team when he was just seven years of age . <p> Gary 's favourite team was Manchester United and as a youngster , he followed them fervently , so he was overjoyed when one of his schoolteachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Excellence . Training at the School of Excellence was held every Thursday and it was the first time that Neville came under the influence of Eric Harrison , the coach who would be so influential in his development as a young player . As a youngster , the coaches concentrated on the more technical aspects of the game ; passing drills , building up touch , and 4 and 5 a side games . For the youngsters it made the hours spent training a lot of fun , but it did produce an end product . However , things did n't just fall into his lap . Gary had to work extremely hard to progress especially in those formative years at United . The level of competition that he faced from other youngsters was immense . In his own words ; <p> " I still remember my shock at being one of the 16 picked out of 200 kids in the under-11s . That letter through the post was the most unbelievable thing I had ever seen . I still wonder why I was invited back every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training started at 5pm , I would be there at 4.15 , passing against a wall . I knew I had to do that when I saw the skills of local lads like Paul Scholes , and Nicky Butt at aged 13 . Then the out-of-town kids joined us , like David Beckham , Keith Gillespie and Robbie Savage . I was a central midfield player and I thought , ' I 'm not as good as this lot , nowhere near ' . " <p> His progression in those early years came from his sheer determination , desire , and will to make it as a professional footballer . Even Harrison in Neville 's first two years was not entirely convinced that the lad had what it takes . In his autobiography " The View from the Dugout " he said ; <p> " I am the first to admit that , for those first two years , I did not think that he would make the grade . He had the basic skills , but was not technically good enough . " <p> However , those first early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that it could all end in tears , and so he became tunnel -- visioned , with a single focus of achieving his dream of becoming a professional footballer . There were many things that he sacrificed along his journey . As he said , he put in an unbelievable amount of time concentrating on extra training and fitness work . He made the decision to alienate himself from his young friends , and he put a ruthless curb on any social life during his teenage years . It was a major decision , especially for one so young , but it showed how single minded , mature , and determined he could be . He describes those years in an interview he gave to the Daily Mail in December 2006 ; <p> " People assume that a career in football falls into your lap , that you were always going to play for Manchester United . They do n't see the challenges you have to overcome and they forget the dozens of players who never quite make it . <p> If you are n't the most talented player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . You have to make sacrifices . When I left school at 16 , I made the conscious decision that I would cut myself off from all of my mates . It sounds brutal , and it was selfish , but I knew that they would be doing all sorts of teenage things that I could n't get involved with , even if that was just having a few drinks . <p> Your very best is the least you should give , but we 've all seen players who have fallen short because they have n't applied themselves . Many players who had much more talent than me . And if ever I thought I 'd cracked it , that would probably have been the end of me . " <p> Gary was eventually taken on as an apprentice after Eric Harrison saw significant improvement in his abilities which was mainly down to his work ethic . So much so , that even as a 16 years old , he was given the captaincy of the Manchester United Youth team ahead of the 17 and 18 years old youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . Neville will always be grateful for Harrison 's impact on his young life . Without his guidance he would be the first to admit that he would not have made it in the professional game . It was Harrison who converted him from a midfield player to a defender , and it was Harrison and his coaches who put in hours of work teaching him to tackle , and on the art of defending . <p> The exploits and achievements of the famous ' Class of ' 92 ' are well chronicled . But for the staff at the United School of Excellence , it must have been a pure joy working with , and watching so many gifted , and talented young players emerge . That crop of youngsters that emerged in the early 90 's are now deeply entrenched into Manchester United 's rich history , and quite rightly stand alongside the famous ' Busby Babes ' who came through in the early to mid 1950 's . The period of 1991-1995 produced such a rich vein of talent . Not only young Gary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butt , David Beckham , Robbie Savage , Keith Gillespie , Chris Casper , John O'Kane , Kevin Pilkington , Ben Thornley , Phil Neville , Ronnie Wallwork , David Johnson , Philip Mulryne , Terry Cooke , and John Curtis . <p> There was a bonding between them all , similar to the way that the ' Babes ' had done all those years before . Even outside of the club , they were all friends and would spend time together . Harrison highlighted this again in his book ; <p> " The dressing room on training days was their second home . I very rarely went into it from Monday to Friday because they grow up together in there . " <p> The natural talent that was developing within the club at that time was not lost on the senior players either . They could see the threat that was going to be mounted for their places in the future years and as Roy Keane recalled in his autobiography ' Keane ' ; <p> " Another source of pressure in 1994/95 was the talent in the reserve e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1992 and 1993 had been the talk of the club for a couple of years . Ryan Giggs had graduated to the first team straight away . Others were now ready to join him . People within the club -- and fans who had followed the progress of the youth and reserve teams , real fans , not the prawn sandwich merchants -- differed as to which of the young United players would go all the way . <p> Paul Scholes was a superb footballer , a beautiful passer of the ball , a free-scoring midfield player , a tough resilient lad who never shirked a tackle . Nicky Butt was another touted for a big future . Another midfield player who could dig and play . And score goals . David Beckham was a Londoner -- the rest were mostly local lads -- who 'd been a United fanatic all his life . Becks was a great striker of the ball who could play wide on the right or in midfield . <p> The Neville brothers , Gary and Phil , caused much argument about which of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad -- nineteen going on ninety -- who could play right back or central defence . Phil was more technically accomplished , able to play in either full back position . Keith Gillespie from Northern Ireland was a brilliant winger . <p> Sometimes there are doubts about whether gifted young players will train on . But we knew from the beginning that these guys would make it . They trained with the first team and never looked out of place . They were not only very good footballers , they were very confident lads . As a group they were inseparable , hanging out together off the field , very obviously a unit when they played against us in the practice matches the gaffer used to sharpen us from time to time . Those games were fiercely competitive . The tackles flew , the quality of the football was unbelievable . Both sides had something to prove . They were just desperate to show that they were ready . We were just as keen to say -- ' not yet ' . To claim that the test provided by United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier League opponents were capable of putting up was no exaggeration . The feeling that it was only a matter of time before the names of Beckham , Neville , Butt , Scholes , and Gillespie would be on the first team sheet was soon borne out . The identity of the first team players who 'd be out to make way for the youngsters remained a matter of speculation . " <p> Even though Gary was younger than most of his contemporaries , he was looked upon as the one with the sensible head upon his shoulders -- the one who was more mature . In his autobiography ' My Side ' , David Beckham recalled ; <p> ' We had Gary with us , who 's one of the most paranoid people ever . He 'd drive us mad sometimes .. We 'd walk into a place , then turn around and see Gary , standing there bolt upright . " No lads . I 'm not comfortable here . We 've got to get out . " All it would take would be for one funny look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we never had a whiff of trouble . ' <p> Neville 's first team debut came out of the blue for him when he was named as substitute in a UEFA Cup first round tie against the Russian club , Torpedo Moscow in September 1992 . It was a rather subdued Old Trafford that was to witness his first appearance as only 19,998 turned out to see a rather dour game that ended in a 0-0 draw . Nevertheless , it did not dampen the experience for him when he entered the field of play in the second half . <p> ' I achieved my dream that night and no one could ever take it away from me . The experience of playing at Old Trafford was unbelievable and just gave me the hunger and desire to go on and on . ' <p> Although that experience whetted his appetite , it was going to be a long time before he got a sniff of a first team experience again . <h> 4 thoughts on " A prime example of when hard work and dedication pays off " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing toward the away LFC fans but i have just seen an annihalation of Man U at the hands of LFC ? ? ? 3 -- 1 , one of us must be dreaming ! i wonder who it is . <p> Sir Ryan Giggs 5 years ago <p> Yes Loserfool just beat us 3 1 , enjoy it coz it was your cup final .

He was a lovely man and he will be very much missed . " <p> Mr Nettleship also gave talks and created a pamphlet -- Harry Potter 's Chepstow -- about the local landmarks that are heavily connected to many of the series ' locations . <p> He told reporters at the time : " Authors can only build on their own experiences so characters to some extent are bound to be based on people they 've met . <p> " Quite a lot of my ex-pupils recognise the original character when they see the film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the movie , sir ' .

" <p> Mr Nettleship remembered his former pupil as a quiet but smart child . <p> He was yesterday remembered by those who knew him as a highly-regarded community member throughout his life , through his profession as a teacher , Labour Party activist , Caerwent community councillor , and family man . <p> Labour councillor Armand Watts was 15 years old when they first met at a party meeting . The Chepstow councillor said Mr Nettleship told him of requests to do tours in America due to his Rowling connection . <p> He said : " I think he was genuinely proud of the Harry Potter connection . I think it was a bit of a novelty at first , but then the books began to reach a global market . It must have been overwhelming .

@@4054239 <p> Amplifier are something of a conundrum . A three piece consisting of Sel Balamir , Matt Brobin and Neil Mahony , the band has a dedicated , but disparate fan base who can count NASA scientists and Homo DJs amongst their number , and they all sing the same refrain , " It 's fun to take a trip , but why are Amplifier not bigger than they are ? " <p> It 's a good question too so I put it , and others , to the band . <p> Why are you not the Overlords of Rock ? <p> Sel Balamir : Actually I think that we are . It 's just that nobody else knows it . Apart from us , our fans , you and now your readers ... Or maybe we are the Uberlords . I 'm not sure . <p> Neil Mahony : Who actually decides who gets to be Overlords of Rock anyway ? Is it voted on ? Does it just last a year because I would want it for a full lifetime . So I could make some changes .... <p> Seven years have passed since the amazing critical reception to Amplifier 's self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene should have been long trampled beneath the crunching Brett Ewins boots , and rebuilt by the glittering eye beams , of the mighty renewer from Asteroid X unleashed by the sheer power and innovation of the young trio . That 's if the reviews were to be believed of course , but reviews are a load of old bollocks . Undoubtedly the album deserved to be heaped with praise but to be acclaimed as the new face of British rock and responsible for redefining a genre is surely to be doomed to failure . Should anything less than total submission to our gleaming masters from beyond time and space within three years follow then Amplifier could never live up to the hype . <p> Your self-titled debut was critically acclaimed and hyped-up as ' genre defining ' and ' the future of British rock ' . What impact did this have on your perception of your own material , and your egos ? <p> SB : Personally , I think that that record is a bit rubbish . One thing though- no matter how much press you get - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it definitely does n't mean you 'll get paid .... <p> NM : I thought we were going to take over the planet . I believed everything that was written about us I was so convinced we would become rock royalty I even started to wear a crown . <p> Amplifier was released on the Music For Nations label shortly before it was bought by Sony . Perhaps sensing clouds on the horizon the band bravely purchased the rights to the record back from the giant and sought a new deal , eventually signing with SPV and recording the EP The Astronaut Dismantles Hal in 2005 . Hal provided some bite-size satisfaction to those who had embraced the debut album and was followed in 2006 by Insider , the band 's second full-length album and one which they feel was rushed to completion . Once again they made the decision to change path and left SPV . <p> You seem from the outside to have no problems taking your destiny in your own hands but after such critical approval how difficult was it to depart from MFN/Sony , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NM : MFN was a bit like a family so when they went it was hard . Not least because our record had only been released the week before ! The others , well they were just like particularly difficult banks . No sub-prime mortgages for Amplifier ! <p> In October 2007 Amplifier debuted a new set at the Barfly as part of The Electric Proms and were championed by Lord Iffy Boatrace author Bruce Dickinson . Once again the critical reception was glowing and Amplifier gained new kudos and respect for not only their awesome sounds ( going down ) , but also for being a tight and highly accomplished live act . Despite this the band continue to play their fare share of Anvil-esque shows , melting the faces of two dozen ecstatic hardcore fans in Leeds Rio 's . Amplifier as a live act are unafraid of cutting loose with soaring , lengthy epics like ' Interstellar ' and ' Planet of Insects ' , even at the risk of alienating the more conventional , ADHD afflicted listener . <p> Your live performances at venues large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing live and touring ? <p> SB : It 's a balance between having fun and being serious . It should be a kind of teetering balancing act between a christian mission and The Happy Mondays on tour . <p> NM : On an early tour , two nights in a row we made someone faint . We 've been striving to better that ever since . <p> Back in March 2008 Amplifier announced that they had embarked upon the recording of their next two albums , Mystoria and The Octopus , back to back . In December 2010 , the two albums having become one , The Octopus was made available to the group 's dedicated fans , a full two years after the first reveal of early session recordings via their website and the result of much blood sweat and tears . <p> Originally you announced two separate albums before confirming the one double album for release in 2009 . Later that year you made the limited edition release Eternity available to fans in order to support your self-financing of the production . Was there a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? <p> SB : No . To be honest , it took up so much effort and planning that there was n't enough time or room to think about the possibility that it might not happen . This is not bravado - it was just impractical and time consuming to think about failure . <p> After four years in the making the third Amplifier album was released on 31st January 2011 . A sprawling suite of 16 tracks spread across two discs ( three on vinyl , spoiling the symmetry somewhat ) , The Octopus is the product of a band free of interference and corporate restrictions . It would be too easy to suggest ( and it has been suggested ) that at times it meanders and is just , well , too long . But that would be a reflection on the attention span of the reviewer . Like Crippled Black Phoenix 's expansive , themed double disc The Resurrectionists/ Night Raider it does n't outstay its welcome for one moment , provided of course you have a couple of spare hours to stick on your ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonisphere . <p> Music journalist 's toolboxes are littered with clich ? s about disappointing sophomore efforts and difficult third albums . How do you view your own musical progression since your first album ? <p> SB : First album - Naively optimistic , yet nostalgic too . HAL EP - like this although there 's one song I hate - took about a week in our room - good fun . Second album - worked under the cosh - tried too hard to not be rubbish - generally pretty good - a couple of weaker songs in hindsight - but we were put under pressure by SPV . Eternity EP - love it - all demos from the early days , pure - no effort . The Octopus - Just great , a good balance between playing , improvising and song writing and with something for everyone . If it holds your attention for 2 hours it 's got to be ok - surely - it held our attention for 4 years . <p> NM : I think when we 're left to our own devices we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time things go awry . <p> Perhaps fifteen years after heavy rock and metal became fashionable again it appears that progressive rock is also experiencing something of a renaissance and Amplifier are riding the wave . Great timing for The Octopus then . Being a concept album packed with ideas it certainly bears all the hallmarks of a weighty prog epic and the themes contained within do nothing to dispel the idea ; interstellar travel , ancient empires collapsing beneath the weight of their own contempt for humanity , and the overriding theme of the suffocation of being ' driven ' by a presence not your own towards a joyous , cosmic climax . This is not a package of half a dozen great songs padded with fluff . <p> Self-indulgent ... perhaps . But why not ? Art is after all about indulging one 's own sense of creativity in one 's chosen medium . Unfettered by restrictions and the artificiality of target demographics , The Octopus is the ( Tarkovsky 's ) Solaris of rock music , long , deep , challenging , cosmic , and every minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it fucking well rocks too , which is a great result . <p> Speaking of progression the ' prog ' community have embraced Amplifier as a strong proponent of the ' New Wave of Prog ' . How easily do the comparisons to Rush , Pink Floyd and the epic concept albums of the seventies sit with you ? <p> SB : Well - we think that Dark Side Of The Moon is a good comparison - but only in zeitgeist - not in material or style . To be honest we do n't really care what label we 're tagged with - at the end of the day as far as we are concerned - we are Amplifier . We rock . I like most of those prog bands - so I 'm ok with that . At the end of the day - I accept that we are not cool . And that is why a lot of people feel physically repulsed by us . Good stuff too . <p> NM : I fuckin ' hate it . I think it 's lazy and disingenuous . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an agenda - whether that is to sell a magazine or make themselves look clever . I like well written critique as much as the next man but as soon as labels start to get thrown about I just switch off . Comparison is fine but trying create a scene around a new label is just lame . If people like it then that is great - if they do n't then that 's OK too . <p> How would you describe The Octopus to the uninitiated ? <p> SB : If Quentin Tarantino and Stanley Kubrick made a heavy rock album - this is what it would be like , although essentially they would have endured some kind of Apocalypse Now ! /Heart Of Darkness odyssey along the way .

Their genuinely heart-warming film that charts the rise of a band of disabled , homeless musicians called Staff Benda Bilili who rehearse in the gardens of the zoo in Kinshasa , to improbable stardom in Europe , opens this week in Britain . The film , Benda Bilili !

After all , even if the subject matter is unconventional , the story of a group following their dreams and triumphing against the odds is a classic Hollywood archetype . <p> Yet they are the first to admit that when they conceived the idea , as Barret puts it : " We had n't got a clue , neither of us were film-makers .

There 's a new energy bursting from these new cities in Africa . Kinshasa is a cauldron of 400 ethnicities all with their own rhythms and some amazing music . " <p> Barret invited De La Tullaye to join him in the Congo and they ran into Staff Benda Bilili . " Begging outside a posh restaurant . We immediately fell in love with their music , " Barret recalls . The band , mostly paraplegics , propelled themselves around by customised tricycles and looked like extras from a Mad Max movie .

" <p> While most of the band are middle-aged , the most extraordinary character is Roger , a teenager who plays , with great musicality , a basic home-made instrument which he calls a satonge , a guitar string attached to a tin can . Roger , says the film-makers , who was 12 when they first met : " Said with total conviction that he would use this simple instrument to feed his mother and his extended family , which as it turns out , was prophetic .

When one clip they uploaded to YouTube got 300,000 hits , that began to persuade sceptical record companies that the duo might have stumbled on a great world-beating new band . <p> It only dawned on them slowly that they could use their videos as the basis for a feature film . The band began to get bookings in Europe and the album Tres Tres Fort was released last year to critical acclaim . The film follows them every step of their way to success . <p> Getting funding for the film was a continual battle , as the duo often ran out of money . They recall going to the Montreal Film Festival : " Totally broke . We had to stock up with bread rolls from the hotel to eat for the rest of the day . " At Cannes last year , they were sharing a room with seven sleeping in it , even as they were being feted for their film at glitzy receptions . <p> If Cannes was nerve-racking -- " we had no idea what the critical response would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open air show in Kinshasa last summer .

" <p> In the past month Barret and De La Tullaye have been back to the Congo to film what may be an epilogue for a new version of the film . " The band now all have houses , they have started little businesses and are paying for their kids to go to school with the money they made from being on tour . " The film itself is about to go into profit and they are starting work on their new film Pygmy Blues , a story of some pygmies who return from the city to the forest . <p> " The band taught us above all about tenacity , about not losing your cool , about never giving up .

But while it is currently at the peak of its hype , it is only just getting started and will continue to keep the industry on its toes . <p> Ovum predicts that a host of new trends will emerge this year that enterprises of all sizes need to be aware of so they can use cloud computing to best effect . <p> The next big growth area in cloud computing will be the rise of platform-as-a-service ( PaaS ) technology , which will step out from the shadow of **27;792;TOOLONG ( IaaS ) . IaaS has become an important cloud success story in the past three years , spearheaded by Amazon and the uptake of virtualisation technology , which has given rise to an army of Amazon clones . <p> However , this year PaaS will make its mark , not just because of the efforts by Microsoft , Google and Salesforce.com but also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched by VMware and Red Hat in late 2010 and IBM is expected to enter the fray in 2011 .

So far , its offerings have been different from that of IaaS . PaaS pioneers Google , Microsoft and Salesfore.com adopted the PaaS as fabric approach . The next wave of PaaS offerings will be IaaS-like , with a compute instance-based approach , rather than a compute fabric one . <p> While the debate goes on about the nature , scope and impact of cloud computing , attention has shifted from how to define it , to how to make the best of it .

Until now , relatively few large enterprises have started to create their own private clouds , but that is set to change . Companies wary of public cloud limitations and constraints will adopt public cloud technologies , designs and best practices in their own data centres .

Marlborough Special Situations , which invests heavily in AIM , is the 15th best-performing among all unit trusts over the past decade , with a return of almost 300% , beating many of the racy emerging markets and commodities funds . <p> Manager Giles Hargreaves says : " There are lots of good companies on AIM . But , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get much more appreciation than you would with a larger company . " <p> They also tend to be under-researched - indeed , many companies on AIM have no independent analysts following them - and are largely ignored by the City pages . Spotting a company with potential requires intensive due diligence and research but those who find it may be able to exploit the potential on their own for a time before the attractions are more widely noticed . <p> " As long as you have your eyes open and are prepared to put the work in , there is a good reason to invest in funds that specialise in AIM , " says Hargreaves . He has a team of around a dozen managers and researchers analysing shares , helping to uncover interesting opportunities . <p> But he has recently taken some profit because of the strength of the market . " A lot of companies have reached levels that we think are fully valued . " That is particularly so among resources shares because , he says , " once the cycle turns , the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell when they are going up : you could miss 10% , but you could also avoid being locked in as the price falls " . <p> That need to be nimble and to research the market carefully means that , for most investors , buying through a fund is the most sensible way in . Indeed , AIM shares are specifically excluded from ISAs unless they are also quoted on another recognised exchange , which few are , so buying through a fund is the only way to get these tax benefits . <p> For private investors , tax is one of the biggest reasons for investing in AIM . One of the most common schemes is to avoid inheritance tax through the use of business property relief . <p> These schemes involve buying shares in qualifying AIM-listed companies , which provided they are held for at least two years , will be exempt from inheritance tax when the owner dies . Given that inheritance tax is charged at 40% on assets over ? 325,000 , that is a significant exemption . <p> Close Asset Management has been offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now has ? 65 million invested in the schemes . Deryck Noble-Nesbitt , who runs them , points out that the risks are high . " It depends on the timing of when you put your money in , " he says . <p> The worst-case scenario is an investor dying before the qualifying two-year period before the relief has kicked in , and where their shares have also fallen in value . But Noble-Nesbitt says that , if managed properly , the relief can be extremely valuable . <p> Patrick Connolly at AWD Chase de Vere says : " Any actions here need to be carefully thought through as the risks involved may outweigh any potential tax benefits . " <p> He thinks the same holds true for the other key tax-planning vehicle involving AIM : venture capital trusts ( VCTs ) . <p> These give 30% tax relief if the investment is held for five years but , he says : " Some highly respected investment companies launched AIM VCTs when VCTs were offering 40% initial income tax relief and investments only had to be held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and many have since regretted doing so . <p> " Over the past five years , Invesco Perpetual AIM VCT has made a loss of 54% , Framlington AIM VCT a loss of 46% and the Artemis AIM VCT a loss of 19% . However , the Unicorn AIM VCT has made a staggering gain of 72% . These performance figures demonstrate the potential volatility of returns in this high-risk area . " <p> Anyone wanting to get out of the poor VCTs will suffer even greater losses as their shares trade at big discounts - 27% for Framlington , for example - even assuming a buyer could be found . <p> As such , Connolly warns that it is essential that investors fully understand the risks involved before taking any action . <p> This article is for information and discussion purposes only and does not form a recommendation to invest or otherwise .

Most are reluctant to divulge the fee size , as it often depends on the size of the retailer and volume of transaction they do . Large supermarkets , for example , will be able to negotiate smaller merchant fees . In addition credit card payments cost more to process than debit card payments , due to the costs associated with borrowing . <p> There may also be extra security costs borne by the retailer in processing online card transactions .

@@4082233 <h> Ian Stewart 's face did n't fit the band 's image but his contribution to their success is at last being celebrated , says Maureen Paton <p> He was a member of the coolest band in the world , yet he was never scared to be square . It 's one of life 's great ironies that those card-carrying rock and roll outlaws , the Rolling Stones , would have got nowhere without the " vision " , as Keith Richards puts it , of the unlikely looking Sixth Stone . The Fife-born Ian Stewart was not your usual skinny , pouting rock star but a stocky , Neanderthal-jawed , one-time ICI shipping clerk in cardigans , polo shirts and Hush Puppies who nailed down brilliant boogie-woogie piano and became the group 's musical conscience and reality check . Always known as Stu , he was one for golf rather than groupies , a real-ale enthusiast and a rhythm and blues purist with a jazz background and a no-nonsense , headmasterly air who joshingly put the other Stones in their place as " three-chord wonders " . The epitome of the musician 's musician , he played on every Stones album , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 Dirty Work , released the year after his death . <p> Ian Stewart died at the age of 47 in December 1985 from a heart attack while waiting to be examined for breathing difficulties by a Harley Street doctor . It 's another irony that the unstoned Stewart , despite being drug-free through all the band 's well-documented years of debauchery , should die young . According to Brian Jones 's replacement , Mick Taylor : " Stu looked on it drug-taking as a load of silliness . " Stewart 's lifestyle mistake was a much more mundane one , according to Ben Waters , the man who is now effectively his musical heir on the rhythm and blues circuit : " By all accounts , Stu had a terrible diet -- that 's what let him down . " <p> Stewart was closest to his fellow hardcore jazz nut Charlie Watts and Keith Richards , who admired his ability to be his own man as much as his musicianship . And Richards 's recent memoir Life describes the " shattering " news of Stewart 's death as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son Tara dying of cot death . " Two months later , in February 1986 , the Stones played a tribute gig with Stewart 's other band , Rocket 88 , at London 's 100 Club , and in 1989 they asked for his name to be included when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . <p> But Stewart 's chequered story proves the marketing power of the manager to demote someone whose face did n't fit the image : such enthusiastic blueshounds as the young Rolling Stones were no different in this respect from the manufactured pretty-boy bands of today . In 1963 , a year after Stewart had booked the band 's first rehearsal in a Soho pub , the Stones ' manager , Andrew Loog Oldham , decided to drop the Scotsman from the line-up . With a large undershot jaw , the result of a childhood illness , Stewart was judged too ugly and , with four years ' advantage on Mick Jagger , too old for a band that was being marketed as the leather-clad , bad-boy alternative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rock-steady Sixth Stone decided to stay on to become a session musician and road manager in his own band . The new role enabled the image-averse Stewart to avoid all the hassle of the spotlight while hanging on to his cherished role as musical guru , a shrewd strategy from the man who never wanted the baggage of stardom . <p> It has taken just over 25 years since Stewart 's death for an album tribute to emerge to this backroom powerhouse , put together by another boogie-woogie man from a younger generation . The 37-year-old Ben Waters was just eight when he saw Stewart play live at a West Country gig arranged by his aunt and uncle , Eva and Ray Harvey , the parents of the singer PJ Harvey and old friends of Stewart 's . Waters , a fan of Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis from childhood , became obsessed with imitating Stewart 's style , so much so that he was asked to play piano in Rocket 88 after his death . <p> " A lot of pianists are quite staccato , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full sound . That 's why he was so good in bands , because he brought it all together , and the Stones were always at their best when he played with them . " <p> As Mick Jagger put it : " When Stu was playing , the band swung a lot harder than when he was n't . " <p> Towards the end of last year , Waters decided to try to fulfil his long-held dream of making an album in memory of Stewart . In what he calls " a combination of luck and coincidence " within the tight-knit world of rhythm and blues enthusiasts , he persuaded the Stones to guest-star on Boogie 4 Stu ( a title borrowed from a track Stewart played on for the Led Zeppelin album Physical Graffiti ) alongside Waters 's cousin P J Harvey , jazz saxophonists Willy and Alex Garnett and Don Weller and 76-year-old blues shouter Hamish Maxwell . <p> Although Waters , who has worked with Jagger 's brother Chris for years , had played piano for parties at Mick and Jerry Hall 's Richmond house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who plays drums in his band , the ABC&amp;D of Boogie Woogie . " Charlie came on board and then told me , ' You 've got to ask Keith too ' , " says Waters , recalling how he went on to recruit Ronnie Wood , Bill Wyman and Mick Jagger in what became a kind of domino effect . <p> Jools Holland , Waters 's long-term mentor who also guests on the album , offered his Deptford recording studio free of charge , although Waters had to fly to New York with the hard drive to record Richards 's guitar and vocals while Jagger emailed back his contribution -- characteristically snarling vocals and harmonica on Bob Dylan 's Watching the River Flow -- from the South of France . With proceeds going to the British Heart Foundation , the album can boast the first Wyman recording with his former fellow Stones since 1992 -- something that perhaps only the ghost of Ian Stewart could have pulled off . As Wyman acknowledged in a London concert last month to launch the album : " We would n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower of shits , you 're on ' . " <p> There was , Waters says , a potentially sticky moment when Richards wanted to do the vocals on the same song , Worried Life Blues , that Wood had just recorded . " So I asked Keith how he would feel if he and Ronnie alternated verses . And Keith said , ' Fine ' . " <p> The album has clearly been a labour of love for Waters , who looks a little like his role model and is equally happy to chase the music rather than the fame . " Stu was so grounded that he probably propelled the band to a higher level , because they could always rely on him . " Which is not a bad epitaph for anyone .

@@4082239 <h> Genetic testing is ' ethically sound ' <p> The UK 's Human Genetics Commission has today published a report stating that there are no ethical barriers preventing the use of genetic testing in couples before they conceive . <p> The new report compiled by the Human Genetics Commission ( HGC ) , the government 's advisors on genetics , has concluded that there are " no specific social , ethical or legal principles " that would rule out the use of ' preconception genetic testing ' as part of a population-wide screening programme . This type of genetic testing would look at the DNA of prospective parents before they conceive in order to assess the risk of their children inheriting a range of hereditary conditions . <p> The report looked at a number of ethical and social issues surrounding genetic testing , such as the need to educate the public so that it could make informed choices if offered screening . Crucially , this report does not mean that a screening programme will be set up in the future , only that it appears be ethically acceptable to do so . Before a screening programme of this type could be launched , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the project might not be feasible or of overall benefit to the public . <h> What is the HGC ? <p> The HGC is an independent body that advises the UK government about new developments in human genetics and how they might impact on individuals . The Commission has 21 members , who are experts in genetics , ethics , law and consumer affairs . They also consult with a panel of people who have direct experience of living with genetic disorders . <h> Why was the report compiled ? <p> In recent years , genetic testing and diagnosis have improved technologically , become cheaper and broadened in their potential use . Given the possibilities presented by these rapid changes , the HGC was asked to examine the issue by the UK National Screening Committee ( NSC ) . The UK NSC is a government-funded agency that reviews the evidence regarding screening programmes , and it advises ministers and the NHS on how appropriate they would be for introduction in the UK population . <p> The HGC was initially asked to provide advice on " the social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening " . However , the HGC was not asked to look at the logistics of implementing a national screening programme , and the publication of their report does not mean that such a programme would necessarily be introduced . In effect , the HGC has examined whether a national genetic screening programme would be ethically acceptable ; other bodies , such as the NSC and the government , would now need to examine whether such a programme would be desirable , feasible or cost effective . <p> However , the HGC makes some recommendations on the structure of any potential screening programmes , such as stipulating that individuals are given adequate advice and time to consider their options so that they can make informed choices on the matter . <h> What does the report cover ? <p> Although originally asked to examine the social , ethical and legal implications of a national screening programme , the HGC 's final report is broader in scope . The report focused on : <p> the ethics of preconception screening - for example , how to avoid discrimination and negative eugenics ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> people 's right to reproductive choice <p> how people should be educated to enable them to make an informed decision on whether to be tested <p> ways that a preconception screening programme could be implemented , given the ethical issues involved . <p> Some news sources , such as the Daily Mail , have suggested that the report actively calls for children to be screened before becoming sexually active . This is not the case . The report only sets out the ethical considerations that must be addressed if voluntary screening were to be offered to older children . The report also states that young people should be given mandatory education on the matter before any voluntary testing is performed , and that genetic carrier testing is not normally offered to people under 15-16 years old . <h> What did the report recommend ? <p> The HGC developed and reported a set of principles to ensure that preconception genetic screening could be implemented in a safe and equitable manner . Among these recommendations were that : <p> Preconception testing should be available to all who may benefit from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the options available to them . <p> For genetic conditions where antenatal carrier screening is offered , prospective parents should be offered preconception screening where technically feasible . <p> Children and young people should learn about preconception screening in the final years of compulsory schooling .

It primarily looked at whether it would be possible to provide an ethical , equitable voluntary population screening programme .

He 'll have ten feet or so for birdie at the famous Golden Bell . <p> 10.08 Two superb long-range putts from Englishmen bring birdies , one for Rose on 12 , and one for Casey on 13 . <p> 10.07 Augusta erupts for the first real time today as Mickelson sinks a ten-footer for par on 11 . The patrons sure liked that one ! <p> We 've seen this before ! Mickelson hits from the pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiros , the Spanish slugger hitting another great shot into 10 , before sinking a big breaker for another birdie and a fabulous four-under total . He 's the one to watch right now . <p> 10.00 Yang ! The South Korean gives his putt a good whack up the hill on the 16th green and the ball rolls willingly into the cup . He 's tied McIlroy at the top of the leaderboard at seven-under par ! <p> 9.58 Poulter misses a birdie putt on 17 - he 's level but has probably played rather better than that . Fellow Englishman Rose misses a short par putt after doing all the hard work with a delightful and delicate pitch into the 11th . He 's one-over . <p> 9.55 The world No 1 , Martin Kaymer , has had a stinker today with his 78 , and world No 4 Luke Donald is n't faring well either . The Englishman is three-over par but hsa hit a sensational approach to about five feet at 13 . Looks like that curse of the par-three competition-winner could strike again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got an uphill 15-footer for a tie of the lead . <p> 9.48 Yikes ! Yang looks to have judged the break on his eagle putt to perfection but the ball stubbornly refuses to drop as it shaves the hole . Still , he 's now six under , just one shot off McIlroy 's lead . <p> 9.46 Poulter drops another shot at 16 , scene of Tiger 's miracle in 2005 , after a fine tee shot , but an aggressive putt left him with a tester coming back . <p> The best seat in the house : The green at Augusta 's famous finishing hole , Holly <p> 9.42 Quiros 's birdie putt at nine is a bit of a duffer and does n't even reach the hole , but he 's gone out in 33 . <p> 9.39 Terrific hit from Yang from the 15th fairway travels high over the water guarding the green and lands softly to leave the South Korean a 20-footer for eagle and a share of the lead with McIlroy . <p> 9.35 Monty 's excited gasps are getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest one comes after Mickelson pushes his drive on 10 a little too straight down the hill and Lefty finds the trees . <p> 9.32 Schwartzel 's mind gets the better of him on 18 as he pushes a tiddler past the cup . That 'll be a bogey to finish - he will sign for a 69 . <p> 9.30 Oh , and Quiros 's eagle putt on eight was a beauty , curving and breaking from left to right and flowing toward the hole from 50 feet . The ball clips the edge of the cup and lips out but the Spaniard still makes birdie and is now flying along at three-under . <p> 9.24 Uh oh . Poulter fluffs his chip to the right of the 15th green straight into the bunker in between him and his target . <p> Picture perfect : Sergio Garcia hits his tee shot on the 16th hole <p> 9.22 Monty , Monty , Monty ... it must be said that Ryder Cup legend Colin Montgomerie is proving to be something of a revelation in the commentary box for Sky - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the team and making the whole thing seem as easy as that fluid , effortless swing of his . I can imagine certain observers being rather less kind , however ... <p> 9.19 Alvaro Quiros is going great guns - he 's two-under through seven and has now bombed a huge drive up the par-five eighth . 341 yards . Uphill . Makes you wince just thinking about that poor ball . His second flies over the pin , he 'll have a long eagle putt . <p> 9.17 Clumsy chip from Garcia on 18 sends the ball way past the pin - he 's looking at a tough par putt for a 68 . <p> 9.14 A word on poor old Henrik Stenson - he 's still propping up the rest of the field - nine over through 10 . <p> 9.09 Yang is right back in the picture after his bogey on 11 - an eagle on 13 puts him clear in second at five-under . <p> 9.04 : Schwartzel narrowly misses a putt at 17 to move to five-under . Mickelson holds his first birdie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one-under through eight . <p> Surprise package : Y.E . Yang of South Korea was in fine form in the first round <p> 9.02 Tiger pulls his birdie attempt on the 18th to finish on one-under . A poor putt in truth , and Woods will be disappointed with that . Nevertheless he 's still very much in the hunt for another green jacket . And he 's never broken 70 in his opening round at Augusta , so he 's still following in his own fine traditions . <p> 9.00 A disappointing day for G-Mac . He taps-in for par at 18 to finish on two-over for the day . Quite a bit of work to do for the Ryder Cup hero on Friday . <p> 8.56 : Good approach shot from Poulter at 14 to leave him with a fantastic opportunity to go to three-under . The Englishman in good touch today . Countryman Rose , rolls one in from 10 feet at the eighth to move to two-under . <p> 8.50 Now to Tiger at 18 . His tee shot is wayward - just short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thing of beauty , pitching the ball withing inches of the pin , and rolling to about eight feet . That should be a tap-in for Tiger to finish at two-under through his first 18 . <p> 8.46 Els taps in a par to finish at three-over for the day . Meanwhile Mickelson misses his birdie putt at 7 to stay at even-par . <p> What a tees : Woods ( right ) and Robert Allenby share a joke at Augusta <p> 8.43 That 's a nice shot from Ogilvy at 7 , who hits his approach to within eight-foot , as Woods taps in for a par after his stunning chip . Who says Tiger 's struggling with his short game ? <p> 8.41 Yang makes a bogey at 11 to drop back to three-under , four shots behind Rory Mac , who to remind you , is sitting pretty in the clubhouse after shooting a seven-under 65 . <p> 8.40 Gorgeous recovery chip from Tiger at the 17th after blazing his second through the green . He 'll have a three-footer , or so to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson at the 10th , who sinks a beautiful bird , to go to three-over . <p> Day to forget : Martin Kaymer shot six-over par on day one <p> 8.36 Casey has the chance to make a birdie at the eighth , but slides his 12-footer past the right-side of the hole . Garcia meanwhile makes a 3 at the 16th to stay at four-under . A welcome return to form for the likable Spaniard . <p> 8.30 More agony on the 18th , this time for Westwood who pushes his par attempt past the cup . That 'll be an opening 72 for the Worksop wonder - not brilliant but you can still win from there . <p> 8.28 And Kaymer 's day gets even worse . His par putt on the last drifts to the left of the hole and he holes out for a six-over 78 . <p> 8.27 Kuchar 's chip from the 18th fringe slows and stops just short of the hole , but the American taps in for an opening 68 . He 's right in the mix . <p> 8.24 Another surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and has signed for a five-over 77 . <p> 8.20 Another bogey for Kaymer on 17 - nightmare round for the world No 1 . He 's five-over and tied for 93rd spot . Kaymer has never made the cut in three attempts at Augusta . Westwood pars . <p> 8.16 Mickelson misses his second birdie putt in succession after his glorious approach - both putts sliding past the right-hand edge of the cup . <p> No such mistake from Paul Casey . The Englishman hits an equally good approach to the seventh and holes out to go to one-under . <p> Watch the golf , Andy ! America 's top tennis player Roddick ( left ) at Augusta <p> 8.13 McIlroy after his splendid effort today says the round was ' more solid than spectaular . ' <p> He also says ' I stuck to my game plan very well - that 's what you need to do round this place . ' <p> He adds : ' it 's a great round to build on . ' <p> Well if that was just a solid round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ! <p> 8.09 Looks like Mickelson 's Masters magic is back - he smashes a mid-iron from the bottom of the slope on the fifth fairway straight down the throat of the pin , and the ball checks and stops just ten feet or less from the hole . <p> 8.02 Two familiar names on the charge : Sergio Garcia is now four-under through 14 , while the 2009 US PGA Champion YE Yang is also four-under par - he 's taken 32 shots to the turn - and in a tie for second spot after Kuchar 's bogey at 16 . <p> A bit of needle : Tiger Woods hits from the pines on the 11th hole <p> 7.59 Westwood sends his putt on the 16th green almost 90 degrees to the left of the hole from around 15 feet and watches as the ball curls down the slope and slowly , slowly runs towards the hole ... and drops . The world No 2 is now in the red . <p> Not such good news for fellow Ryder Cup hero McDowell , who has bogeyed the 14th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot - he 's now all alone in second after a birdie streak through 14 and 15 . <p> 7.51 The Goose hits a birdie putt on 18 , but that lips out . He 'll have to settle for a three-under 69 . <p> Tiger meanwhile has birdied 14 to move to one-under . <p> 7.48 Westwood is back at level par after a birdie on the par-five 15th . He 's not out of it by a long shot . <p> 7.45 Rory tickles his putt on 18 towards the hole ... but misses to the left . He taps in for par and a first round of 65 . Simply sensational start for the Northern Irish youngster , who is an immediate favourite to claim the green jacket . But he 'll be haunted by memories of his second-round collapse at St Andrews last year where he shot 80 after an opening 63 . Surely he 'll have learned his lessons and can exorcise those demons . It 's sure to be a thrilling ride whatever the answer . <p> Philing good : Defending champion Mickelson made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he 's seven-over after just five holes . That 's thanks to a horror show at the par-three fourth , where the Swede took an eight . Stenson 's probably wondering why he even bothered getting out of bed this morning ; but amateur golfers all around the world rejoice - it does happen to the pros too ! <p> 7.39 Look away , Martin Kaymer fans : the German world No 1 has dropped another shot at 14 . He 's five-over , which is almost as incredible a score as McIlroy 's . What a strange game golf is . <p> 7.34 Tiger 's on the prowl - a superb second shot at the par-five 13th finds the green , and his putt curls away from the hole but within range of a simple birdie attempt . <p> 7.33 McIlroy does indeed attack the pin , and sends the patrons gathered around the 18th green wild with whoops of delight . The Northern Irishman 's seven-iron grips and spins at the back of the green and settles eight or so feet from the pin . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow , tree-lined drive down the 18th is one of the most awesome sights in golf , and McIlroy crunches his tee shot 300 yards and more straight down the middle - he 's in prime position to attack the pin on the last . <p> 7.26 Kuchar birdies 14 to move into joint second at four-under - and that is because Goosen has dropped a shot at the 16th . <p> Green fingers : Jason Day ( right ) chips on at the 12th as McIlroy ( centre ) and Fowler ( left ) watch on <p> 7.23 Colin Montgomerie reckons that the course today is set up for low scoring , with the pins cut in accessible areas of the greens , and with the undulations of the putting surfaces providing natural run-off towards the holes . Not much evidence of that scoring potential on the course , however , with the honourable exception of Rory Mac . But there will be no course-record score today after McIlroy pars the 17th . <p> 7.20 Kaymer is still struggling at four-over , and is languishing in tied-89th after 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Azalea . And that 's another disappointment for the Worksop man , who needs to capitalise on the risk-reward holes like these . <p> 7.18 Tiger is now one-over through 12 after going bogey-par through 11 and 12 . Playing partner G-Mac recovers from his setback at 10 to par the same holes . <p> 7.12 Phil Mickelson , the defending champion and in superlative form after a win in Houston last week , opens with a par at the tricky first . <p> 7.08 So , McIlroy is seven-under with two to play - he needs to finish birdie-birdie to equal the course record score of 63 , set by Nick Price . Watch this space ! <p> 7.04 Some movement near the top of the leaderboard - Schwartzel drops a shot at the fiendish 10th and is now in the group of five other players at three-under par . Goosen is on his own in second at five-under after birdie at 15 , and has three to play . <p> 6.58 Would you believe it , McIlroy stands over another birdie putt on the 16th ... but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? <p> Playing for Japan : Ryo Ishikawa is donating all his tournament winnings this year to the earthquake relief fund <p> 6.55 And speaking of Kim , the 22-year-old US Amateur Public Links champion , Lion Kim , is holding his own at level par through four . What a great name . A bit like a popular west end musical , but a great name nonetheless . Let 's hope he roars this week . <p> 6.50 Not a good start for Anthony Kim , who finished third here last year . Bogeys at the first two holes for the gifted but out of form American . <p> 6.47 But it 's pain for Rory 's fellow countryman on 10 , G-Mac carding a double-bogey six to undo his good work on the front nine and slip to one-over . Tiger 's impressive round hits the buffers with a bogey at Camellia . He 's level for the day . <p> 6.29 ANOTHER birdie for Rory Mac ! He leads the field by two now on six-under after taming the 14th , Chinese Fir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a bunker . Sensational stuff . Shades of his opening 63 in the Open at St Andrews last year . <p> 6.25 And after two straight bogeys on 11 and 12 , the Goose flies back into contention with a birdie at 13 . Second spot on the leaderboard is now an all-South African affair . <p> 6.22 Many pundits have tipped Charl Schwartzel for success this week , and the South African has not disappointed them by storming onto the leaderboard with an eagle at the eighth . He 's now all on his own in second spot , one behind McIlroy . <p> 6.17 G-Mac moves into the red for the first time today by picking up a shot at the ninth , and the Northern Irishman draws level with playing partner Woods , who pars . <p> 6.14 Well , well , well . Kaymer 's day goes from bad to worse . The world No 1 double-bogeys 10 to slip to four-over . Who 'd have thunk it ? Westwood stays at level with another par . <p> That 's rough : Trevor Immelman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole <p> 6.10 Rory Mac pars Golden Bell - probably the most famous par-three in all of golf to stay two shots clear at the top . <p> 6.06 Poulter birdies the short par-four third to make an early move . The US-based Hertfordshire native was flying here last year before dropping off in the final round . <p> 6.04 I 've just heard that the Goose became just the fifth player in history to eagle the first at Augusta - he holed his approach at the daunting 445-yard par-four opener . <p> Roaring Rory : Mcillroy raced to five-under par to take an early lead at Augusta <p> 6.01 Goosen suffers a setback at 11 , carding a five for a bogey on White Dogwood . And he 's still got the rest of Amen Corner to come . And that means that McIlroy leads the Masters at five-under par . <p> 5.58 Tom Watson , a two-time winner at Augusta , opens with a bogey . This course is surely too long for the old gentleman to repeat his heroics at the Open at Turnberry . <p> 5.55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in 33 . And he 's still overshadowing playing partners Kaymer ( two-over ) and Westwood ( level ) after the world 's No 1 and 2 hit par fours on Carolina Cherry - who would have predicted that ? <p> 5.52 That fund for the victims of the Japan earthquake swells with each birdie that Ishikawa makes and the popular young man has made three on the front nine today . He stands at two-under and in a tie for seventh place . <p> 5.49 Woodsand McDowell share pars at the seventh to stay at one-under and level-par respectively . <p> 5.46 McIlroy ties for the lead at the Masters . The par-four 11th is a monster at 505 yards but the 21-year-old Northern Irishman hits the ball prodigiously long and makes a terrific three to join the Goose at five-under . <p> 5.43 Villegas is in the clubhouse with a 70 after a bogey on 17 . <p> 5.41 Kaymer has stopped the rot with a birdie four at the eighth . <p> 5.40 Ian Poulter has stared his day with two pars . <p> 5.37 Westwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to level-par . It may be long and uphill , but whoever wins this tournament will make the most of the longest holes . Just look at Phil Mickelson 's scorecard from last year for all the evidence you need . <p> The one to watch : Woods smashes away his tee shot at the third hole <p> 5.33 Pure schadenfreude I know ( look it up ) , but here 's a list of the fancied Americans struggling so far : Watney ( one-over ) , Mahan ( one-over ) , Fowler ( one-over ) , Dustin ( two-over ) . But just to show we 're not really biased , home hopes Sean O'Hair ( two-under ) and Brandt Snedeker ( three-under ) are going great guns . <p> And best of all is Kuchar , who has picked up shots at seven and eight to storm into joint second alongside McIlroy , four strokes on the right side of par . <p> 5.30 Fisher , out in the first group this morning , pars the 18th to set the clubhouse lead at three-under . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be many who better that today . <p> 5.28 Dustin Johnson 's frustrating start to the tournament continues with a bogey at 12 , followed by a birdie at 13 . The slugger is three-over and way down the field - probably the shock score of the day so far . <p> Treesy does it : Sergio Garcia found trouble on the first hole <p> 5.25 Woods roars into life with a birdie at six , at 180 yards usually one of the more straightforward par threes on the course . Watch out , Augusta , Tiger 's coming ! <p> 5.20 Colombia 's Camilo Villegas , he of the green-side yoga poses , has leaped onto the leaderboard with a birdie streak through holes 13-15 . The hunky housewives ' favourite , who has been rather quiet on tour in recent months , is three-under par . <p> 5.15 Another par for Tiger at five . That 'll be music to his ears after his hot-and-cold performance at Bay Hill a few weeks back and what with all the fuss over the merits ( or otherwise ) of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bad to worse for playing partner Kaymer , who drops another shot at the seventh . Last year 's US PGA champion is three-over already and way down in a tie for 60th . And there 's only 66 out on the course . <p> The Goose is cooking : Retief Goosen flew into the lead after a five-under par front nine <p> 5.12 Steady as she goes for Westwood - a par at seven is his third in a row . <p> 5.10 Fisher 's run of pars comes to an end with a bogey at 17 . He slips to three-under par , two behind the Goose . <p> 5.06 Hiroyuki Fujita . Heard of him ? Well , he may sound a bit like a tasty Mexican snack , but he 's actually a 41-year-old , ten-time winner on the Japanese Tour . And he 's in a share for third after taking four at the par-five eighth . Well played , sir . <p> 5.04 McIlroy goes out in 32 after he picks up a shot at the 460-yard par-four ninth . Four birdies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On top of the world : Westwood ( left ) and Martin Kaymer ( right ) , ranked Nos 1 and 2 in the world <p> 5.01 We have a new leader . And he just happens to be the 2001 and 2004 US Open champion . Goosen sinks another birdie putt at eight - he 's five-under already . The Goose is flying . <p> 4.59 One man who has slipped under the radar somewhat heading into this tournament is Sergio Garcia . The Spaniard has been consistently inconsistent all season , but has the talent - if not the temperament - to land the big one . Still , Sergio is off to a flayer after birdies on two and three . <p> 4.56 Tiger and G-Mac each card their fourth straight par with fours at Flowering Crab Apple , the 455-yard fourth . Four-some . <p> 4.55 Apologies but certain leaderboards are showing different scores , which has led to some confusion over the state of play in some instances . We 're sticking with the PGA 's official leaderboard , which you can view by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4.50 Leading amateur Chung is having a day to remember - a birdie at 13 and then another at 15 takes him into a tie for fourth at two-under . <p> 4.44 Easy Lee-sy for our man Westwood . Another par at Magnolia , the par-four fifth , keeps him at one-under . This leaderboard is gaining a distinctly British - or , to be precise , non-American , feel . That 's got ta hurt in the Land of the Brave . <p> 4.40 Fisher 's gone back into his shell somewhat , three straight pars for the leader after his birdie blitz - five in seven holes from the fifth . The same goes for co-leader Goosen and McIlroy , who remains one shot back . <p> 4.36 Kuchar , playing alongside Kaymer and Westwood , has made the best start of the three . Birdies at two and four for the surprisingly bald star , last year 's PGA Tour money leader . <p> In the Hunt : A really rather green Hunter Mahan holds up his ball after his birdie on the second hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the Atlantic - unlike the previous incumbent of the position I might add - but Kaymer is struggling . He bogeys the fourth , a straight but tricky par-three , and is now sitting on a disappointing two-over . But , as Watney has proven already today , things can change remarkably quickly around this track , and it 's a tough opening stretch at Augusta . <p> Woods and G-Mac share pars again on the same hole . <p> 4.29 Westwood is in the swing now - birdie two at the fourth takes Worksop 's finest under par for the first time today . <p> 4.27 Fisher , our leader , has safely negotiated Amen Corner , birdieing 11 and parring 12 and 13 to play the famous old stretch at one under . <p> 4.25 Hunter Mahan has made an early move - he 's one under after a birdie at two . <p> 4.22 Woods and McDowell have emerged unscathed from the par-five second - but it ; ' s been a bit of a birdie-hole today and they might regard pars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacts after missing a putt on the first green <p> But Kaymer , the world No 1 , has taken six at Pink Dogwood , dropping to one-over . <p> 4.20 Laird , another man in tip-top shape driving down Magnolia Lane , has dropped one at six and parred seven . Level par overall . <p> 4.17 Watney has mounted a storming comeback , birdieing seven , eight and nine for an outward nine of 35 . He finished in seventh last year and is in hot form . <p> 4.12 McDowell , playing alongside Tiger , also opened with a par , by the way . <p> 4.10 Larry Mize , the 1987 winner and he of that famous chip-in to deny Greg Norman a green jacket ( you 've heard that before , have n't you ? ) , has birdied the second but dropped a shot at the fourth . A decent start nonetheless for the Augusta-born 52-year-old . <p> 4.08 Westwood bounces back from his dropped shot at the first with a birdie four on the second . Surely he will be in contention come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his four-round total last year would have been good enough to win 14 of the last 17 Masters . Oh , Phil - why 'd you have to go and spoil it all ? ! <p> 4.05 The Japanese Earthquake Relief Fund has just got ? 750 better off as Ryo Ishikawa birdies four . One under for the charismatic and thoroughly decent young man from the Far East . <p> 4.03 Watney has also steadied the ship - a birdie at seven brings him down to one-over <p> 4.00 The Goose is cooking . The two-time major winner holes for two on the par-three fourth and ties with Fisher again at the top . <p> 3.57 Some Dustbin Johnson-related confusion on the leaderboard earlier on - to clarify , he made bogey at seven , his third in four holes , to drop to two over , but has now turned things around somewhat with a birdie at the par-five eighth . Back to plain old Dustin then , I think . <p> 3.55 A solid start for Tiger - par four on the notoriously difficult opening hole <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . Sensational stuff . <p> 3.52 That Dustbin Johnson tag just might stick - the big American slugger is having a bit of a nightmare at a tournament where he was hotly-tipped to challenge . A bogey at the seventh drops him to two over through seven . Ouch . <p> 3.48 Fisher 's on fire . Another birdie , this time on the 505-yard 11th , White Dogwood , takes him clear again at the top . The Wentworth man has certainly got the game for this track - he hits it long , high and true - but missed the cut last year . Can he hold it togather ? <p> 3.45 Watch out - Tiger 's on the prowl . The four-time green jacket winner has teed off alongside Graeme McDowell and Australia 's Robert Allenby in one of the round 's premier groups - we 'll keep you right up to date with that trio . <p> On the prowl : Tiger Woods tees off at the first hole <p> 3.44 The Goose picks up another shot at three to join Fisher at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with an inauspicious bogey at the devillishly tricky 10th . The Scot heads towards Amen Corner at one over . <p> 3.38 Westwood drops a shot on the first as playing partners Kaymer and Kuchar open with pars . <p> 3.35 Dustin 's game is in the dustbin - he drops another and the huge hitter drops to one-over . <p> 3.30 McIlroy birdies the par-four third - that 's Flowering Peach do n't you know - to go to two-under and give us a welcome British feel at the top of the leaderboard with the Northern Irishman just a shot behind England 's Fisher . <p> Scotland 's Martin Laird 's solid start turns into a very good one as he birdies three and pars four to move to one-under . <p> Nice approach : Colombia 's Camilo Villegas hits into the green during the first round <p> 3.28 Chung , the amateur , is still holding his own among the big boys , going out in 36 to stay level-par . <p> 3.24 Johnson is n't the only oneof the much-fancied American new breed to struggle early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral , is now two-over through five . <p> 3.22 Dustin Johnson drops two shots in as many holes with bogeys at four and five to go back to one over and four behind Fisher 's lead . <p> 3.21 Harrington is safely away with a par at the first and Ishikawa also manages a four . <p> 3.13 McIlroy takes full advantage of the generous second to birdie and go to one under . <p> 3.11 Fisher is on a birdie blitz . Another one at nine sees him out in 33 and at the top of the leaderboard on three under . <p> 3.07 Lyle is back to level after a birdie-four at the eighth . World No 1 Kaymer is about 10 minutes away from starting his round with Westwood . <p> No fear : Youngsters Fowler ( left ) and McIlroy share a joke on the first tee <p> 3.00 Fisher joins Goosen at two under after his third birdie in four holes and his fourth of the day . <p> 2.53 Rory McIlroy draws first blood in the battle of the youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason Day . <p> 2.50 What an entrance from Retief Goosen . The South African , with two runner-up and two third-placed finishes here , holes his second shot at the opening hole to lead on his own at two under . <p> 2.46 Dustin Johnson goes to one under with a birdie at the third while Aaron Baddeley hits the same mark with a birdie on two . The Aussie has the putting skills to do well here and has been playing well . <p> Flying start for the Goose : South African Retief Goosen is all smiles after an eagle at the first hole <p> 2.41 From Laird to the only other Scot in the field . Lyle gets back to one over with a birdie at the sixth . <p> 2.38 Martin Laird starts with a par . The US-based Glaswegian has the game to suit Augusta and is playing well . But no debutant has won here since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 . Can Laird make the headlines come Sunday ?

@@4092235 @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzuki 's latest sports bike-based streetfighter , the GSR750 . <p> There are already many aggressive-looking " streetfighter " naked bikes on sale . One glance at Suzuki 's new , GSX-R750-based GSR750 would convince most people that the streetfighter sector is where it belongs . <p> It has all the trademark styling : a front-heavy look featuring a striking headlight , with a stripped-away rear section exposing a fat tyre and exhaust plumbing , while edges , swage lines and angles all lead the eye relentlessly forward and down to the front wheel . It shouts power , speed and attitude , and if you were making a buying decision on looks alone then a GSR would be on your shopping list . <p> Yet despite the engine originating in the 2005 GSX-R750 -- for many , the perfect sports bike of its time -- the GSR750 is more aligned with a range of softer , entry-level middleweights .

Around town and on enjoyable back roads , thrust from lower revs is much more useful . <p> That 's great in theory , but with the GSR the character and excitement of the GSX-R has been diluted along with the horsepower , while the potential gains in lower-rev torque are n't striking . <p> It works very well : the fuelling , for example , is flawless , with a smooth and dependable response to the throttle that 's in stark contrast to the GSR600 , which the 750 replaces . The new , 750cc version pulls far more convincingly , too , although there 's some buzzing vibration when the revs rise , so long stretches of motorway might numb a finger or two . <p> Hustling the bike along more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , because the motor gives the impression of merely doing the job rather than revelling in the fun of it . The mid-range feels quite strong rather than muscley , the top end is fast but not wild , while the exhaust note is bland and safe . <p> The chassis is built in the same vein , designed to inspire confidence in less experienced riders -- which it undoubtedly will -- rather than live on the edge and encourage the rider to exploit its agility . The steering is gentle and the bike sweeps through turns assuredly , but you 'll not be wrenching the bars , shifting your weight and feeling the bike shimmy and shake beneath you because it does n't do that sort of thing , even if it looks like it might . <p> Of course , this is a good thing if the GSR is the biggest bike you 've yet ridden . It 's still pretty fast , it wo n't run out of ground clearance if you start experimenting with lean angles on a hot and grippy summer 's day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels might lock if you 're ham-fisted with the lever . It 's a shame that British riders ca n't have ABS anti-lock braking , which is available in some other markets . <p> For getting you about town and Sunday runs into the country , the GSR does the job efficiently but not spiritedly .

Having just set a remarkable nine-year unbeaten home league record -- which spanned 150 matches and four clubs in four different countries -- the Portuguese manager is eyeing yet another remarkable record . <p> As he leads his Real side in the quarterfinal second leg against Tottenham Hotspur tonight , Mourinho is on the trail of becoming the first coach to win three European Cups with three different clubs .

He is is a young , ambitious , disciplined football lunatic , who has soaked up as much knowledge as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It is impossible not to draw comparisons between the two men . Mourinho learned his trade working as an interpreter for Bobby Robson at both Porto and Barcelona , picking up tips from the legendary English coach before eventually impressing with his own coaching acumen . <p> Villas Boas was also at Porto in the mid 1990s . <p> At the tender age of 17 , and with no football apprenticeship behind him , his mastery of English and attention to detail impressed Robson so much that the veteran coach hired the teenager to work as part of his scouting and statistics team -- sending him to Scotland to achieve his first coaching badges . <p> And when Mourinho returned to Porto , after cutting his managerial teeth at Uniao Leiria , he took Villas Boas under his wing , going on to employ the willing student at both Chelsea and Inter Milan in exactly the same manner as Robson had done with him . <p> Like Mourinho , Villas Boas started his coaching career at a small club . <p> Leaving his mentor behind in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academica last season , performing a minor miracle to steer a club , without a win before his arrival , to mid-table respectability . <p> Porto , looking for a coach after sacking Jesualdo Ferreira following their failure to retain the league title and qualify for the Champions League , quickly came a-calling -- and Villas Boas has more than justified the decision to make him the youngest coach in the Portuguese top flight , with the club suffering just one defeat in all competitions . <p> " He has had a very strong impact at the club , in the city and in the region , " continued Orlando . " He came in after a disappointing season and immediately asserted himself with a positive and confident attitude . <p> " His philosophy is similar to Mourinho when he was at Porto .

He spends countless hours in his office sourcing information to give to his players .

" <p> Even within the pantheon of great football coaches , there are few who have won titles before their 40th birthday ; even Mourinho fails to make the grade .

A year later he was granted a two year Norad scholarship to study a Masters of philosophy in international health with a bias towards health systems and epidemiology in Bergen university in Norway . <p> Doctor Zyaambo returned to Zambia in 2007 and is now employed by the same medical school in the department of community medicine .

@@4094239 <h> Enhancing the air travel experience for PRMs <p> OCS has introduced the Resource Allocation System to improve responsiveness to PRM requests . <p> The Regulation was introduced in July 2008 with the purpose of improving accessibility to air travel for disabled persons and PRMs , ranging from the stage of booking through to arrival at the final destination . <p> " There have been improvements in most places -- at most airports and at most airlines , " said Maria Nyman , policy officer , European Disability Forum . " Passengers are more aware of their rights and because of this they are more likely to see where there are gaps in the service they receive . It 's very positive that passengers with reduced mobility know they have these rights . <p> Nyman : " The training is not only essential but it 's also the most cost-effective means of ensuring the non-discrimination of passengers with reduced mobility .

There are some gaps that need to be addressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new Regulation is always a process and it 's bound to take time to get it right . " <p> One area of contention , she explained , is the fact that when mobility equipment is damaged in transit , the passenger is not necessarily entitled to compensation , while passengers with respiratory equipment are also not protected by the regulation . <p> " Also , the national enforcement bodies in governments often lack resources , such as office personnel , to deal with these specific issues and that 's a problem at the national level , " Nyman added . <h> Providing assistance <p> EU Regulation 1107/2006 was introduced in July 2008 to improve accessibility to air travel for disabled persons and PRMs . <p> In line with the Regulation , in Europe , services for the assistance of PRMs are contracted to the airport operator , where as outside of the EU , services are contracted directly with airlines . <p> In the UK and Ireland , OCS currently works as a contractor providing mobility assistance to passengers with reduced mobility at 10 airports , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services include meeting and assisting PRMs upon arrival at the airport , agreeing their needs and providing the necessary assistance , ranging from wheelchair or buggy assistance , to personal assistance for hearing or visually impaired passengers . <p> Steven Wheeler , OCS aviation director , explained : " There is no question that the introduction of EU Regulation 1107/2006 has resulted in a general improvement in service for PRMs . From a contractor perspective it has improved coherence in providing services and facilities at the airport , with opportunities to improve the passenger experience that were not previously available under airline contracts . It has enabled us to provide host desks , while staff planning is more efficient and responsive . <p> " The minimum quality of service is laid down by EU legislation and the clear requirements -- in terms of responsiveness and wait times -- means that the service can be easily understood and catered for .

" This training must also involve the disability organisations to ensure that it 's reflective of the needs of the passengers . " <p> While there is little doubt that the introduction of the EU legislation has positively impacted on the air travel experience for passengers with reduced mobility , both Nyman and Wheeler noted that there is scope for further improvement . <p> Nyman said : " From the airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lack of accessible information and the booking system is complicated because you have to book assistance at a separate stage to booking your tickets . " Furthermore , ensuring that PRMs have the opportunity to make use of all airport facilities is also important to ensuring non-discrimination . <p> Wheeler added : " We can certainly be satisfied as an industry with the strides we have taken over a relatively short time in the provision of service to PRMs . There is , of course , still room for improvement , in communications , notification and understanding the needs of PRMs . However , considering that airports had limited knowledge of PRM operations prior to 2008 and no-one had faced the unique challenge of running such an operation across a whole airport , the development to-date has been exceptional .

Even after working for less than a minute , many of the men complained of nosebleeds , exhaustion and a metallic taste . <p> The second threat is the long-term impact , in the shape of additional cancers -- such as the estimated 1,900 extra cancers seen over the years in those exposed to the blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki , some of whom received significantly more radiation than those around Chernobyl . <p> In the Ukraine , two people died immediately after the blast and another 29 died in hospital over during the next few days , but the longer-term impact was far harder to measure . Hot spots were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fallout : even today , Welsh sheep farmers are still dealing with the problem . And studies of the impact were hindered by the reluctance of the Soviet Union to release details of the calamity : it was only in 1989 that official contamination maps were released . <p> Two decades ago , Prof John Gittus of the Royal Academy of Engineering advised the Government that there could be around 10,000 fatalities . Today , some environmental groups put the toll well into six figures . However , Professor Wade Allison of Oxford University is adamant that " the only deaths that have been firmly established , either individually or statistically , are the 28 victims of Acute Radiation Syndrome and 15 cases of fatal child thyroid cancer " . <p> The mainstream view lies between these extremes . Dr Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth prefers to cite a 2006 study by Dr Elisabeth Cardis of the International Agency for Research on Cancer , which predicted that by 2065 , about 16,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 25,000 cases of other cancers may be expected , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer in particular is treatable , so the latest estimate of the death toll from the UN 's Chernobyl Forum puts the death toll among the most exposed populations at around 4,000 . <p> When it comes to Fukishima , the earthquake and tsunami killed two workers and injured many more . There were further casualties from the hydrogen explosions , and at least one worker was sent to hospital after an overdose of radiation . But as Prof Richard Wakeford of the University of Manchester explains , there will be difficulty getting reliable estimates of radiation doses , which are crucial for predictions of excess cancers . <p> As far as the workers are concerned , a dose at the emergency limit of 250 mSv would produce a lifetime risk of serious cancer of around 1 or 2 per cent . Therefore , if 100 workers received this dose then one or two additional serious cancers would be expected , in addition to the 20-25 which would develop in the normal course of things . For those further away , the risk would be negligible : " if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the various countermeasures , " says Prof Wakeford , " I doubt whether any effect could be detected " . <p> An editorial published in Lancet Oncology to mark the anniversary argues that the accident at Fukushima will at the very least offer a much better opportunity than Chernobyl to study the health consequences of a major nuclear accident -- not just from radiation , but from psychological factors such as stress . <p> There is also growing evidence that the effects of radiation can be passed to future generations . Studies of mice by Prof Yuri Dubrova , of the University of Leicester , reveal that large doses of radiation can make the genetic code more likely to suffer mutations , and that this propensity can be passed down the generations in the " germ line " , the genes contained in sperm and eggs . <p> Although there have been claims that these effects have been seen in the families of Chernobyl clean-up workers , the jury is still out on whether people react in the same way -- after all , such effects were not observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just medical , however . The Tokyo Electric Power Company hopes to shut down the Fukushima reactors completely within nine months , but experience at Chernobyl suggests that the subsequent cleanup could take decades . There , efforts are still under way to raise just over a billion dollars to complete the construction of a huge long-term shelter to replace the so-called sarcophagus , a crumbling protective structure which was hastily thrown up over the reactor in the months after the accident . The replacement will be the largest of its kind in the world , more than 100 metres high , 250m wide and 160m long . The great hanger will serve as an enduring monument to the world 's worst civil nuclear accident , and to our remarkable state of ignorance about the impact of nuclear fallout. 
@@4109235 <p> Emily Bick looks at the similarities between Lady Gaga 's ' Judas ' shtick , subversive Swedish pop group Army Of Lovers and the affiliated Alexander Bard 's Netocracy to argue that the star 's glamourous facade is a " prophylactic barrier to two-way engagement " <p> Lady Gaga 's ' Judas ' is n't much of a song , but that does n't matter , because Gaga 's songs are never about the music . It 's her ' Oops I did it Again ' , riffing on ' Bad Romance ' with its " Ju-das ! Jud-a-a ! " breaks . You could sub the last line of the " I 'm just a holy fool / baby he 's so cruel " bit with " caught in a bad romance " and it would totally scan . For variety Gaga 's got an ' ew ' and a little dancehall verse added for flavour , maybe because Britney 's collaborating with Rihanna ( and Nicki Minaj ) , but that 's about it . <p> It 's out on single now , for Easter weekend , to cash in on maximum outrage and symbiotic publicity from the usual Christian suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Glee . But whither ' Judas ' ? ' Born This Way ' sounds like a rehash of ' Express Yourself ' . The accompanying video , meanwhile , smashes together the intro to David Lynch 's Dune , Superman 's crystal fortress of solitude and that two-dimensional prison Terence Stamp and co were cast into by Marlo Brando and Planet Krypton 's finest , and the good/evil Mystics/Skeksis personality splitting scene at the beginning of The Dark Crystal . This is followed by zombie skull makeup from ' Thriller ' and Madonna-style crotchgrabs that are about as sexy as a Canesten advert . Casting herself as Madonna , Michael Jackson , Cal-El , some freaky muppets and the heir to the house of Atreides is going to be hard to top . <p> One source of inspiration might come from Swedish disco sex fiends Army of Lovers . They had a huge international dance hit with ' Crucified ' in May 1991 . The video featured the Lovers ' Alexander Bard , Jean-Pierre Barda and La Camilla all dressed as day-glo disco-kitsch French Aristocrats , pre-Revolution . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while singing lyrics like : <p> I 've seen the deepest darkness And wrestled with gods Ride the noble harness Raining cats and dogs I stand before my Maker Like Moses on the hill My Guinness record breaker I abide your will <p> Contrast with Gaga 's lyrics , from ' Judas ' : <p> When he comes to me , I am ready I 'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain Even after three times , he betrays me <p> I 'll bring him down , bring him down , down A king with no crown , king with no crown <p> Chorus I 'm just a Holy fool , oh baby he 's so cruel But I 'm still in love with Judas , baby I 'm just a Holy fool , oh baby he 's so cruel But I 'm still in love with Judas , baby <p> Hmmm . Army of Lovers had a lot of fun with camped up crucifixion themes : besides ' Crucified ' , there 's ' Judgment Day ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least the parts of ' Alejandro ' that are n't ripped from Ace of Base 's ' All That She Wants ' . ) The video quality is pixelated to shreds , but it features staples of the ' Alejandro ' video : a gothic abbey setting , most of the group dressed like pregnant nuns , Alexander Bard and Jean-Pierre Barda chasing each other until Bard gives birth to a dog ( God backwards , yeah ? ) . <p> In other Army of Lovers videos , Jean-Pierre Barda runs around with a three-foot gold strap-on , La Camilla struts in police/dominatrix gear , beating up guys in the men 's room with a riding crop , then dancing in a cage . No echoes of a certain women-in-prison-themed video there then . And if you want offence , Army of Lovers were equal opportunity religious pisstakers ; their 1993 hit ' Israelism ' was banned in Germany for antisemitism , even though singer and co-lyricist Barda is of Algerian Jewish descent , and the lyrics were more bratty than hateful . Anyone can piss off the pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the incestuous production family tree : Army of Lovers ' later songs were produced by Max Martin , the Scandipop wizard responsible for too many pop hits of the last decade to mention , including Britney 's ' Oops ... ' . RedOne , the producer behind almost every other pop hit of the last decade Max Martin did n't touch , is Lady Gaga 's co-writer ( for ' Poker Face ' , and many other hits , including ' Alejandro ' ) . He 's also a good friend of Alexander Bard . <p> But this is all part of the game , surely ? Everything with Gaga is designed to keep discussion going until the next release , the next event , and she 's got the slickest marketing touch strategy going . This is why it does n't matter if she does anything new or not . It 's not about content , just linking , just surface . A comparison between Gaga and Army of Lovers would be more of this kind of play , except that Bard is also an internet theorist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a judge on Swedish Idol ) . He 's a philosophy obsessive who studied social theory and economics , and started writing pop songs to make money on the side . ' Army of Lovers ' itself refers to a 1970s gay-themed film that takes its name from a reference to a platoon of soldiers made up of same-sex couples in Plato 's Symposium , that existed in ancient Thebes . A later Bard group , ' Bodies Without Organs ' , takes its name from an idea of philosopher Gilles Deleuze : a virtual dimension of the body , interestingly described by Deleuze as a Gaga-like egg . <p> Bard 's book , Netocracy , written with Jan Soderqvist , was first published in Sweden in 2000 , where it became notorious for predicting an Al-Qaeda-style terrorist spectacular before September 11 . It was later translated into 14 languages and launched Bard on the tech culture lecture circuit . Netocracy 's more important contribution may have been its definitions of a ' netocracy ' and a ' consumtariat ' . <p> At the time - before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't yet taken for granted ; the internet was still - just - discussed as a flat , interconnected utopian space where everyone could participate equally with everyone else . But what the internet actually did was create a structure of superconnected nodes of powerful people - communities of netizens , interacting like gated communities - and people outside , unable to contact them , but able to receive their output . <p> " Netocracy presents the local groups of the new informational elite almost as islands of non-alienated utopian communities : a description of the life of the new " symbolic class " for which life style , access to exclusive informations and social circles , matters more than money - top academics , journalists , designers , programmers , etc. , effectively live in that way . However , are the authors of Netocracy fully aware of the ultimate irony of their notion of " nomadic " subjects and thought as opposed to the traditional hierarchic thought ? What they are effectively claiming is that the netocrats , today 's elite , realizes the dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nietzsche and Deleuze ) - in short , even more pointedly , that the thought of Foucault , Deleuze and Guattari , the ultimate philosophers of resistance , of the marginal positions crushed by the hegemonic power network , is effectively the ideology of the newly emerging ruling class . " <p> So the strategies of repurposing culture , creating subcultures and communities and so on are now no longer oppositional to capitalism , but the means for information , power - and , indirectly , capital - to flow through networks online . Bard takes capitalism as a given and Zizek is annoyed at Bard and Soderqvist 's description of Netocracy because of this . <p> Nothing wrong with that either . Zizek , Bard , and Gaga are all high-powered nodes in the netocracy model , and that 's how their influence works . But it can be subverted , too . Maybe this is why the Deterritorial Support Group 's hoax blazed through Twitter earlier this year . The hoax was a blogpost which claimed to be written by Zizek , announcing that Gaga and Zizek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in support of the London anti-cuts protests the following weekend . Did anyone believe it ? Did it matter ? People talked , people RT 'd , and the DSG sneakily scooped up hits . It was node-hijacking on a masterful scale . <p> I 'd almost argue that a real test of whether someone is a high-ranking node in Bard 's netocracy model - powerful enough to speak without needing to respond - is whether they have fan-created content designed around them . Somebody has made a video of their ZIzek photo file and set it to Stevie Wonder 's ' Part Time Lover ' . <p> Very , very few fans who make fannish tribute content , whether it 's slash fiction , song parodies , mash-ups or videos like the film above , ever get to participate in popular culture at large , in a way that means they can become stars themselves - with the possible exception of a Weird Al Yankovic . The story about Gaga 's hesitance to approve Al 's parody of ' Born This Way ' is telling here . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is star , he is fan , end of . <p> Fan-producers , fan-reappropriators of culture , they 're stuck in the consumtariat mire - unless they are Lady Gaga . ( Did Madonna make Gaga beg for permission before ' Born This Way ' became a hit ? ) The interesting thing about the early Gaga videos , when she 's playing piano underneath curtains of dark hair , wearing the kind of t-shirt and shorts you 'd see on anyone walking down the street , is how good her voice is , how well-structured her early songs like ' Wonderful ' feature=related are , in the Elton John vein . <p> Yet performing in this traditional singer-songwriter sense is too close to the craft of your average Idol-wannabe : ie , fan , not star . But then anyone who parodies or remixes is just a fan on the sidelines too . It 's supersaturated with imagery and references , but what 's the real difference between fannish pastiche/tribute and what Gaga does besides access to a platoon of collaborators--producers , songwriters , choreographers , stylists--and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in Bard 's view , that is the defining feature of a netocratic supernode ? <p> The other thing Gaga goes on about in interview after interview is how much she loves all her fans , lives on their energy and would do anything for them . But this love is vampiric , and only works as long as fans are kept at a distance : little monsters to the mother monster , paws up on command . Gaga presents a facade of all glamour , all the time , and that 's a prophylactic barrier to two-way engagement ( even more so than the ' ear condom ' she suggests to haters in the lyrics for ' Judas ' ) . Gaga has her photograph taken at yoga class , in full wigs and makeup . Gaga appears on American Idol , but Gaga could never exist as she does now if she had ever competed on that show . What traces of pre-stardom Gaga exist online were presented only after the fact of her stardom had been well-established as inevitable , and she herself does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her YouTube Gagavision series , she does n't respond to comments either . <p> There 's also a Facebook and Twitter campaign running by a fan asking Gaga to be his prom date . Will she go to his prom ? I 'd love to see it happen , but really : will Bill Gates send a personal response to your email ? <p> ' Born This Way ' is kind of offensive , not for Gaga 's birthing a machine gun or any camera tricks or fun with corpsepaint , not even for her presumptions to a place in pop 's Olympus . It 's offensive because she uses all the new technologies that break down barriers between star and public , that expose the fragile human behind the glamour , to reinforce those barriers . No one is born with silicone polygons stuck to their cheeks except for Kryten out of Red Dwarf , and he 's an android that was n't even born anyway but came off some intergalactic assembly line . As for loving her gay fans or being bi herself , fine - but ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stars . Sexuality 's a red herring : everyone is born naked and vulnerable and unaware of symbols or hierarchies or who they will eventually want to fuck . Stefani Germanotta included . <p> Bard explains this in his lecture , when he explains how each new technological stage of human development also creates reactionaries , who use the new technological structures to reinforce ways of thinking that have been supplanted by those technologies . Bard talks about jihadists who use globally networked systems to promote tribalist codes of ethics . Gaga is reactionary in the same way as she uses-and dismisses others ' use of-online DIY comment and remix culture to remold herself as a 20th century popstar . <p> Bard is a deliberately provocative , obnoxious speaker . He 's sharp and entertaining , but if you 're inclined to sit through all six parts of his lecture , be prepared for him to say at least one thing that will annoy you . He talks about nomadic , pre-written language tribes not caring so much if their children died , because the children did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe would have stored up . He mocks Swedish bourgeois nationalists who want to stop immigration , but then , speaking in their voice , uses the n-word . He tells one questioner to shut up in the Q&amp;A in part six , before responding to his question . Still , It 's worth watching if you can handle all that , if you have a spare couple of hours , and it makes Gaga make more sense . Or you could just watch some Army Of Lovers videos instead . <p> So much talk . Did you enjoy talking ? It 's nice to talk on the internet . Why do n't you walk up to her and say it to her face ? O wait maybe because you 're sitting behind your computer screen . It feels good criticizing behind the computer screen does n't it ? It 's nice to talk a lot about how Lady GaGa is a complete waste of human life and how all of her fans are obsessed over her . It 's easy to talk about all of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? She totally does because you said she does . Talk talk talk . <p> How about you shut the fuck up , lighten up , and enjoy life for a fucking change in the sunlight .

About a quarter into the article I realized I did n't care . <p> But the notion of a superstar depriving her ' fans ' of genuine interaction while feverishly confessing her love for them is hardly revelation or peculiar to Gaga . Bowie ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Madonna , Jackson all aped and stole and instilled fanatical devotion while keeping that very fanbase at arms length . You can intellectualize and the reference &amp; connection to Bard is an interesting one , but essentially gaga is quite an old fashioned entity entity , it 's just she 's operating in a slightly more desperate , transparent and laboured pop cultural universe . Bolan once said that ' pop is a spell ' ( or something like that ) but in these hyper aware easy access downloadable times , that spell has been broken . For better or worse , gaga is the embodiment of that malaise . Neither as awful as her detractors claim ( Speechless is a superbly crafted song , a solo composition which bears the hallmarks of ( sorry ) genuine talent ) nor as immaculate as the hype suggests ( an admittedly breathtaking surfeit of video gimmicks veils a paucity of musical development ( Born This Way ) . <p> This is honestly the article I 've been waiting for . Unable and without the resources needed I was n't able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Gaga far beyond my distaste for vapid pop and sensationalism .

I remember early on in the emergence of the Gaga and her first few spectacles wondering just who was behind it all because it was so executed with such precision . <p> From the constant yet veiled references to a myriad of ( sub ) cultures and internet phenoms as well as parasitic use of the latest ' under the radar ' artists in her videos and live show , it all connects.

@@4111240 <h> William Craig <h> William Craig , who died on April 25 aged 86 , was the leader of the militant Ulster Vanguard movement and was Vanguard Unionist MP for East Belfast from 1973 to 1979 . <p> During the early years of direct rule in the province , Craig earned a reputation as a Protestant firebrand and launched his Vanguard Party in demagogic style , demanding a return to Protestant majority rule in Stormont and no " sell-out " to the Roman Catholic minority in the province . <p> William Craig <p> In 1974 Craig was the main organiser with the Rev Ian Paisley of the Loyalist strike which brought down the five-month-old power-sharing assembly on which the British government had pinned so much hope . Craig was regarded as the link with the paramilitary groups , the UDA and the UVF , which gave the strike its muscle . <p> But the next three years saw a dramatic shift in his position . In 1975 he split fellow Unionists over their refusal to continue talks over power sharing with the mainly Catholic SDLP . He condemned the second Loyalist strike of May 1977 and worked with considerable effect behind the scenes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larne and to get Larne harbour reopened . <p> Craig 's change of heart won him little credit in the Unionist community and he promptly lost more than half his followers . After winding up Ulster Vanguard in 1978 , he won the Official Unionist nomination for his constituency , but was defeated at the 1979 general election by the Democratic Unionist Peter Robinson . <p> There was , though , an underlying consistency in Craig 's change of heart : unlike politicians such as Paisley , he had been prepared to negotiate with Roman Catholics provided they shared his belief that Northern Ireland could be governed effectively only by local politicians , either through independence or some form of devolution within the United Kingdom . A strong pro-European , he saw the German federal model as offering the best hope of a lasting solution . <h> Related Articles <p> William Craig was born on December 2 1924 at Cookstown , Co Tyrone , the son of a bank manager , and educated at Dungannon Royal School and Larne Grammar School . <p> When war was declared he volunteered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command . After the war he studied Law at Queen 's University , Belfast , and was articled to a solicitors ' firm , qualifying in 1952 . With a bank loan he bought into a small practice at Lurgan . <p> In 1960 he was returned to the Stormont Parliament as Unionist member for Larne . Appointed chief whip in 1962 , he became Minister for Home Affairs in 1963 , Minister for Health and Local Government in 1964 , Minister for Development in 1965 and Minister for Home Affairs again in 1966 . <p> But as the Unionist leadership , under Captain Terence O'Neill , came under pressure from the British government to respond to Catholic demands for civil rights , Craig became increasingly outspoken in his opposition to any concessions . <p> His biggest political decision during this time was to ban the civil rights march in Londonderry in October 1968 because he believed it was a " Nationalist/Republican parade " . The march went ahead , but the police stopped it and rioting ensued .

After O'Neill 's resignation , he fought both James Chichester Clark and later Brian Faulkner for the Unionist leadership . <p> Craig 's rhetoric during this period became increasingly uncompromising . In 1969 he prophesied civil war if the government 's proposals to restructure the Ulster Special Constabulary were accepted ; as the prospect of direct rule came nearer , he called on the people of Northern Ireland to " use every means to defend their constitutional rights " . <p> After direct rule was imposed in 1972 , he resigned from the Unionist Party because it had accepted the government 's white paper proposals on power sharing . In October 1972 he survived an attack by a Provisional IRA gunman who fired at him while he was driving to his solicitors ' practice at Lurgan . <p> Soon afterwards he announced that he and his followers were prepared to " go out and kill " in defence of their British heritage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ulster Loyalist Association in 1969 which in 1972 became the Vanguard movement , a non-party association of Loyalist organisations committed to the preservation of the Northern Irish constitution .

By the time Craig entered Parliament at the February 1974 general election , however , he was beginning to have second thoughts . <p> As the province teetered on the brink of civil war , he began to recoil from the plans of Loyalist paramilitary groups to take control of the province and declare independence .

The following month , nine out of 13 Vanguard colleagues on the Constitutional Convention resigned , and Craig and his followers were expelled from the UUUC . <p> After losing his seat in the 1979 general election , in 1982 Craig stood unsuccessfully for election to the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole representative of a revived Vanguard Party . <p> Despite his erstwhile reputation as a rabble rouser , in private Craig was a humorous and tolerant man , able to get on with politicians of every political hue . <p> He married , in 1960 , Doris Hilgendorff , a German woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two sons .

Highlights will be shown on this website and the red button on BBC television in the UK . <p> Barrichello 's selection of races cover his life both before and during his F1 career . He has chosen three grands prix from his childhood , and two from his time in F1 . <p> He gave his choices in chronological order , and his first is a particularly fascinating one . <p> It is an event that wraps up in one pretty much all the many aspects that make the sport such a compelling spectacle for millions of fans around the world - from the thrills of the world 's greatest drivers battling for supremacy in the fastest cars , to the tragedy that inevitably occasionally visits an activity from which danger can never be fully removed . <p> The race in question is the 1978 Italian Grand Prix . It is notorious for a terrible crash at the start which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also featured a thrilling fight for the lead between world champion elect Mario Andretti of Lotus ( Peterson 's team-mate ) and Ferrari 's Gilles Villeneuve . Brabham 's Niki Lauda , who finished third on the road , was classified as the winner after Andretti and Villeneuve , first and second across the line , were penalised a minute for jumping the start . <p> This is Barrichello 's reason for choosing that race : " The one that I remember from a very long time ago is the very first one I saw in Monza where Ronnie Peterson died in a big accident in 1978 . It was the very first race that I saw on television , it 's a very sad one but a classic one for me . " <p> In chronological order , his other choices are as follows , in his own words : <p> " When Ayrton Senna won his first race in Portugal in 1985 , it was also special for me .

Compared to other crashes , it appears no worse but more importantly , it clearly shows who is to blame - the starter who does n't wait for all the cars to stop before changing the lights to green . Because the cars at the back were still rolling , it meant they all bunched up as they caught up with the leaders at the first bend . I also believe the viewers have missed out on watching James Hunt and other drivers , heroic attemps to pull Peterson from the flaming car .

He suffered badly broken legs only succumbing to his injuries after emergency operations in hospital . Thats why his death was such a shock at the time.The reaction to the crash was very controversial with Hunt being extremely vocal over the driving of Ricardo Patrese and demanding he be banned.Yet whenever I watched the footage I felt the blame lay with Hunt himself although it was difficult to be 100% sure . <p> The treatment of Patrese at the time though was incredibly unfair . I was very pleased he overcame this setback and went on to be such a successful driver in the sport . <h> Comment number 6 . <p> Good choices from Rubens , hopefully the nay sayers will pipe down this weekend ! <p> I have n't seen the 1978 Italian GP before , so I 'm split on whether the choice to edit was a good one or not . However I trust the judgement that in the interests of tact , editing it was probably the correct decision , especially as anyone who wants to view the crash itself can find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice Rubens . Nice to see a selection over a widespread timeframe . Never seen the Peterson crash but agree with Flash that it is part of the sport 's history and should not be overlooked - especially as Rubens himself explains what affec it had on him . Dependin on its severity - like I say I have n't sen it - would not a strapline saying it contains potentially upsetting images etc not be enough ? It was by the sound of things shown back in 1978 highlights . Anyway they are my thoughts and if there is any doubt then porbably best to play safe . Lovign this feature this year as it gives a nice insight in drivers pre-F1 . <p> While on the subject of Williams : The Chequered Flag : " Williams reshuffle after worst start " - Coughlan in ; Michael out : http : //tinyurl.com/4y5yrmu <h> Comment number 8 . <p> I agree with other posts that say we should show Peterson 's crash . After all , as Andrew himself says in the blog , the event wraps up all aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edit it out and pretend this great driver never competed in the race ? The scenes themselves are harrowing but not graphic , and if ever you needed evidence of how far the sport has come , this is a prime example . Pleeeease have a rethink . It could be shown after the watershed perhaps , and/or preceded by a warning that some viewers might find the scenes disturbing . <h> Comment number 9 . <h> Comment number 10 . <p> It 's arguable that Peterson 's injuries , whilst serious , were n't even life-threatening if he 'd received prompt medical attention . Hunt 's quick action ensured he only sustained very minor burns . However , poor organisation meant that treament of his leg fractures was delayed ( medical staff + the ambulance took forever to reach him and then get him to the hospital due to the crowds ) and that allowed serious complications to develop that ultimately claimed his life . <p> His death was not in vain though . The lessons learned led to much improved medical response times , particularly in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical car lined up at the back of the grid on all F1 starts these days ? ) . <h> Comment number 11 . <p> Rubens is one of the most popular drivers on the Grid and does great work for communities behind the scenes.his career seems to have taken off after leaving ferrari.I think his success at Brazil and silverstone must be his favourite races.Hope Williams can give him a car that he deserves ..... Do n't forget he did beat the stigg ? ? ? <h> Comment number 12 . <p> Great choices from Rubens , agree that is was daft not to show Ronnie Peterson 's crash considering you can watch it free on YouTube . I 'm just pleased that this fantastic feature of the BBC 's coverage has continued for this year . Thanks Andrew ! <h> Comment number 13 . <p> I agree with those that say the crash at the first start should have been included . From what I have seen before it was n't overly graphic , although obviously shocking in terms of the fire , and knowing what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era where , although much improved since the 50 's and 60 's , the threat of death or major injury was so much higher than today . Indeed for those whose experience of F1 is fairly recent it may serve as an education of where the sport has come from , and I think it 's important for people to appreciate just why such importance is placed on safety these days . <p> Someone mentioned Patrese being unfairly treated . Hunt was the most vocal in blaming him , possibly because Hunt himself was thought by some to be at fault initially . There was support for his view though , and I seem to recall that Patrese was banned from the next race , although this was a knee-jerk reaction from the authorities rather than being based on actual evidence . Patrese was new to F1 at that time so it was easy to blame the new guy . I do n't think the blame for the accident has ever really been proven . Some say Patrese , some say Hunt ( who continued to bad-mouth Patrese for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starter failing to make sure all cars had come to a halt before starting the race would have been a contribution ( and that certainly would n't occur these days ) , but cars still moving as the race started was n't exactly rare in those days ( I have seen a few clips of starts in the 60 's and 70 's where some cars are clearly still moving as the green flag is waved , or lights turn green ) . Most likely it was multiple factors and it was never possible to put the blame simply one person . <p> Anyway , nice choice of races from Rubens . Hope other drivers keep up the standard by choosing some older races as well as ones that featured themselves . <h> Comment number 14 . <p> 1978 Italian Grand Prix.Just exactly who are we ' protecting ' by editing out the first start ? Most viewers are aware of the history of deaths in F1.This was a start line accident which is historically relevant to any fan , young or old , of F1.If a future driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Is the 1st start going to be edited because Jacques Laffitte ( like Ronnie ) broke both his legs ? Like #10 wrote , It was because of this crash that drivers received better attention after a crash at the start ( Palletti sadly , In 82 did not though ) . So , wrong and patronising to new and old fans not to include the first start ! The 60 second penalty passed down to messers Andretti and Villeneuve totally made a mockery of the result also , a 10 second stop and go would have been fairer and would have created a much closer finish . <h> Comment number 15 . <p> Ronnie is one of the true legends for me - I was sure he would have been champion if he had not been #2 to Mario . <p> Rubens has made some wonderful choices , the best yet ! <p> On the idea of a 10 second stop go , I do n't think it existed as a penalty in those days . But they could have been called in for a chat with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a white square ? ) . Used very occasionally and a heck of a lot longer than 10 secs ! But you have to remember that the jump start was adjudged by people on the pit wall in those days and it took time to collate and review the evidence . The sport was so much more raw in those days - we tend to forget the dangers are still there , mostly it seems from debris these days . A reminder of which was how close the loose wheel was to hitting people in the last race . <h> Comment number 16 . <p> While I do feel Peterson 's death should be known for the sake of history , I can fully understand it 's removal . As I sit here on a sunny Wednesday , seeing an accident that resulted in a death would make me uncomfortable . By mentioning it , if people want to see it , it is not hard to track down on Youtube etc . <p> Anyway , great list from Ruby , I 'm enjoying all the races from before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starting to watch F1 ( Suzuka 96 ) . I 'll definitely watch these when I get a free moment . <h> Comment number 18 . <p> I agree that some of the Petersen coverage might need to be edited but the crash itself is an important part of F1 history . <p> Petersen died ( as other comments have said ) as a result of deficiencies in the medical arrangements . His accident ( amongst other tragedies ) shaped the future of F1 in terms of medical provision and safety regulations . <p> Complaint finished ... well done Rubens for picking such a fine spread of races ! <h> Comment number 19 . <p> I do n't see what exactly is ' inappropriate ' in showing a racing incident . If Peterson had n't died as a result , would it have been shown .... ? Of course it would . But to suggest what elements of a race are ' appropriate ' or not is a tad patronising , especially when ( in this case ) the actual incident has been a talking point for F1 fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to see what happened makes no sense to me , especially if ( as other have pointed out ) the ' notorious ' incident is readily available to view on YouTube . <h> Comment number 20 . <h> Comment number 21 . <p> I am with those who say the crash should have been shown . The footage is n't graphic , the heroism of the drivers pulling Peterson from the wreckage should be shown and it is a major talking point in F1 . The crash itself would n't have been fatal had the stewards not formed a ring around the crash preventing the F1 surgeon from reaching Peterson , had the ambulance arrived sooner and taken him to hospital quicker . Peterson died because marrow from his broken bones in his legs got into his blood causing him to die ( do n't know the technical term ) . As this can not be seen in the footage I think it should have been shown , though if you really want to see it you can youtube it so maybe for those of a sensitive nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see it can easily access it . <p> As for where the blame lies , personally I would blame the starter . You can see the front row are not expecting the start and those lower down the grid got a jump start on those in front . Coupled with Peterson 's poor start this meant the cars were bunched at the end of the straight meaning contact was inevitable . At the end of the day though , the two charged ( a driver whose name escapes me and the starter ) were both cleared so the authorities obviously do n't hold any one person responsible . <p> I would say to Rubens , great choice . Look at the discussion it has started ! <h> Comment number 22 . <h> Comment number 23 . <p> A good selection from Rubens spoilt by the editors . As other people have said , the Peterson accident is readily available to see elsewhere so why hide away from it ? <p> Whilst it is one of the darker moments in F1 history , it was an event that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you did n't want to show the whole Monza programme , Portugal ' 85 should have been given the full treatment . That has only been shown in condensed format to date and would have given us an opportunity to see one of the sport 's other great drivers winning his first Grand Prix . <h> Comment number 24 . <p> Good choices from a Driver who 's proved over the years he 's just in the sport because he loves Driving rather than being in it only to win or make money . <p> Regarding Monza , as others have said , whilst i do n't mind anything too gruesome being removed for the general public ( eg , Bandini being burnt alive at Monaco ) i think it is important to show actual crash footage because it gives us all a wake up call to just how brutal F1 used to be and how far we 've come , and also the heroics of the Drivers at the time , in this case Hunt running towards the car to help . Its as important as showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the footage is n't shown , some younger fans may think all F1 crashes used to result in something like Turkey from last year with Webber &amp; Vettel . <p> Its also a shame Monza is n't being shown on the red button ( assuming i 've read the above correctly ) . <p> Other than that , great choices and glad we 've got them on the red button . Many Thanks <h> Comment number 25 . <p> Very good selection , Rubens drive from the back in Hockenhiem was excellent , I guess I 'm perplexed at the editing decision , after watching the excellent BBC 4 documentary Grand Prix The Killing Years , which has far more horrific scenes ( albeit in context and the point of the documentary ) , but this was viewable by anyone , anytime on iplayer for 30 days . It was an extremely sad documentary but it explained why Formula 1 needed to change so much during Jackie Stewards era . Given however the BBC were happy to show this documentary , editing the Peterson crash out makes little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the documentary I can not recommend it enough , it 's heartbreaking and difficult to watch in places but it 's really does help understand how we got to the safety measures which are taken for granted today . It also shows just how well respected amongst his peers Jim Clark was , it 's rare to see any GP driver accept someone is just better than them , Clark was a rare driver , a pure genius behind the wheel . <h> Comment number 26 . <p> Andrew - Please can you explain why the bbc F1 team have conveniently left out another pivitol part in the the Turkish GP highlights - The part in question for the radio message between Lewis &amp; his engineer about ' jenson gaining on Lewis and if Lewis slows down will jenson pass him ' . <p> This was another major talking point of the race and the bbc have edited it out ! <p> I think it was a major failure on the part of the beeb to just leave it out altogether. -So basically as far as Im concerned , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital parts of this race . <h> Comment number 27 . <p> 1 ) Thanks again for this feature . It would be great if some of your historical knowledge could make its way into the BBC1 broadcasts . I know there are other people on the team who also have historical knowledge ( most of the talent , Mark W , Mark H , Steve ) , but it rarely shows on screen . <p> For example , could the team on site film the drivers talking about their Classic GP choices . You could then show that with snippets of the races in the qualifying/pre-race shows , with a " see the full footage online or on the red button " call to action.It could help drive traffic to this section of the site , and make those new viewers who are becoming interested in F1 for the first time more aware of its history . <p> 2 ) Thank you Rubens for some great choices . Nice that they are not all from his career . <p> 3 ) I can understand why you edited the Monza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown the whole programme ( maybe with just minor cuts of the post-crash footage ) with a slate and voiceover at the end explaining what happended to Ronnie Peterson . These thing happen in motor racing - thankfully less frequently now than previously , but it 's a part of motor racing history . <p> As has been mentioned , the excellent BBC4 documentary about F1 in the 60s and 70s showed some pretty harrowing scenes ( although very much justified and in context . ) <p> Finally , to the person criticising Andrew/the BBC for editing the McLaren radio out of the Turkey highlights : as far as I can recall , those transmissions only came to light in the week after the race , so the BBC have not edited them out of the highlights programme they showed on the evening of last year 's race . <h> Comment number 28 . <p> Can understand why the footage was edited , but really thats a slippery slope to be on . It 's interesting to note that you cant get Seb Vettel to stop swearing on national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after race forums so far this season ) , yet you choose to doctor an event from 1978 for fear of offending someone ? <h> Comment number 29 . <h> Comment number 30 . <p> Great choices from Rubens especially the Estoril race , and I have wonderful memories of his first win at Hockenheim . <p> My problem with the 1978 Italian GP is not the editing of the race to cut out the first start but that Villeneuve and Andretti were n't pulled into the pits to serve their stop-go penalties for jumping the start , but it was added later ! <h> Comment number 31 . <p> This is the bonus of the older drivers such as Schumacher and Barrichello , we get some really brilliant choices from them . <p> I have to agree with the previous comments regarding Peterson 's crash , why edit it out ? There was a program on recently called " GP racing- the killer years " on BBC 4 , which was promoted on the BBC F1 website , which showed the very graphic footage of Bandini trapped in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purley tried to save him . You 'll say it was broadcast after the watershed but this was featured on the iplayer and so was available to be seen at anytime of the day so why was that any different ? <p> As harrowing as it is to know Peterson died from the injuries he sustained in that accident , it was sadly a landmark moment in F1 safety . Personally , I am disappointed it was edited out . I 'm 22 and was n't alive to watch it happen but I have seen it before . As an F1 fan I am aware of the colossal impact it had . I feel it needed to be left to show people who are new to the sport the tragedies that took place before we reached the point the sport is at now . <h> Comment number 32 . <p> That was a great choice Rubens ! ! But a difficult point re Ronnie - he was n't killed in the crash but from a thrombosis/embolism later on . So personally I think it could have been shown but appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! RIP Ronnie ... <h> Comment number 33 . <p> Thank you for your comments so far -- I 'll respond to the two main points that have come up . <p> On the subject of the decision to edit out the Peterson crash from the Monza ' 78 highlights , I can completely understand the views of those of you who disagree with this . However , there is a very big difference between watching ( illegally ) a fatal crash you have actively sought out on the internet and coming across one perhaps unawares when you were expecting to watch some racing . <p> It is true that James Hunt was heroic in pulling Peterson out of the burning car -- the footage of which was part of the reason why we cut it -- and it is also true that Peterson died from surgical complications arising from his injuries , which should in theory have been survivable . <p> But the fact is he did die as a result of the accident and having watched it there is no doubt in my mind that people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that we have to consider all of our audience , not just a select few . The comparison with the BBC4 documentary about the 1960s and ' 70s is invalid -- that was a documentary , broadcast after the watershed , about fatalities in grand prix racing . Anyone turning it on would have had no doubt what to expect -- and even then some of the footage was pretty harrowing . This blog and accompanying videos are a completely different matter . <p> Equally invalid , for obvious reasons , is the comparison between Sebastian Vettel 's risque comments in the Forum recently and the Monza video . One was on live television , when we have no control over what comes out of a driver 's mouth . The other is a choice to re-broadcast footage of an accident that led to a man 's death , 33 years after the event . It 's a completely different issue . <p> As for our decision to " edit out " the McLaren radio transmissions from Turkey last year , when Lewis Hamilton asked his team whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was told no , we have done no such thing . <h> Comment number 35 . <p> I fail to see how you can argue against removing the clip of the crash , and the heroic actions of the other driver , entirely.Surely you could simply put up a graphic images warning and give a point in the video a user can skip to in order to avoid the clips ... ? There are people who were not around at the time of the accident , as above comments elaborated on , the youngerviewers may not apreciate what the sport was like back then . Indeed , I only have any sort of ( limited ) understanding because of good old Youtube.I fail to see how you can argue against removing the clip of the crash , and the heroic actions of the other driver , entirely.Surely you could simply put up a graphic images warning and give a point in the video a user can skip to in order to avoid the clips ... ? There are people who were not around at the time of the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apreciate what the sport was like back then . Indeed , I only have any sort of ( limited ) understanding because of good old Youtube . <h> Comment number 36 . <p> Firstly , excellent choices from Rubens ( knew he would deliver on this feature ) <p> Andrew , I have to agree with almost all the previous comments ( except your own ) . I was not born in 1978 and until today had no idea about the Peterson / the crash or the amazing selfless bravery of James Hunt on that day . Youtube is wonderful historical tool in times like these ( sad that the BBC is forcing fans to use it for these reasons ) . <p> You also refer to the " GP racing- the killer years " documentary on BBC 4 being shown after the watershed . I would also like to add " The Deadliest Crash : the Le Mans 1955 Disaster " from 16-Jan-2011 to this list ( also shown post watershed ) . <p> I am currently watching Classic GP on freesat &amp; guess what the time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also please point out that we are not asking for the full race , we are asking for the full highlights program that the BBC edited and considered fit for evening broadcast in 1978 . <p> Please can you explain:a ) Why Italy 1978 is not being shown on Freesat at all at the moment ? b ) Why an already edited program which was deemed ok for broadcast in 1978 is not appropriate anymore.c ) Since the Freesat coverage broadcasts all through the night why ca n't you show the full program then ? ( i.e. after the watershed ) <p> I also notice that this accident was the reason that Rubens remembers &amp; chose this race in the first place . <p> I would love to support you &amp; the BBC in this decision but I can not . Whist this was a big accident it is not graphic . From the pictures I have seen , all the concern was about Vittorio Brambilla ( not Peterson ) as his injuries appeared far worse , but he survived and raced again the next year . <p> Pease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Comment number 37 . <p> At last , a driver who is aware that F1 existed before 1990 ! Ca n't comment on the editing of the 1978 Italian Grand Prix , as I 've yet to watch the footage , but I just wanted to comment on the choices that Rubens has made . I 'm looking forward to watching some real classic Grand Prix . Thanks Rubinho ! <h> Comment number 38 . <p> Why the hell would you edit the Peterson crash . For god 's sake . What about ' The Deadliest Crash like Ninja Hedgehog said . Just warn people at the start of the video that some scenes may upset people . It 's that simple . <h> Comment number 39 . <p> Huge appreciation for Rubens for selecting a race before the 1980 's . Apart from Webber and Nico Rosberg , I doubt we will see another race prior to the 1980 's with this format .... so enjoy this one as much as possible . <h> Comment number 40 . <p> Eager anticipation , an almost full broadcast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freesat ( that was so promoted by the BBC ) . Why has this oganisation that has stood up for-free-to view broadcasting for so many years now taken to favour Sky and cable subscribers . Will Monza 78 be shown on Freeview on Friday 6th ? <h> Comment number 43 . <p> Firstly read Andrew 's comment above and explains why it was left out , secondly read Rubens reasons for choosing the race and the crash was no a part of it . <p> What this blog does is gives us highlights of past grand prix 's chosen by drivers , it is not a tool to look at F1 history which can be done on better suited web sites or in books . I ca n't see why you are all so upset , if you really want to see the footage it is freely available on youtube , so just watch it there &amp; do n't blame the BBC for their choices . <h> Comment number 44 . <p> " Highlights of past grand prix 's " I think not if the main event of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for choosing the race and the crash was no a part of it . " Actually , I think you will find Rubens said : " The one that I remember from a very long time ago is the very first one I saw in Monza where Ronnie Peterson died in a big accident in 1978 . It was the very first race that I saw on television , it 's a very sad one but a classic one for me . " It is the ONLY EVENT of the race he even mentioned , far from not mentioning it at all ... <p> If there is a fear that people may be offended by a video , place a warning on it so they know not to watch it , simple . <p> Also , in my previous post on here , the first line is supposed to read " how you can argue FOR " rather than " how you can argue against " . <h> Comment number 45 . <p> I read the quotation wrong , fair enough . Even if it was an event in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tv is why he put it in his selection . <p> I ca n't see why it was cut out either , I have seen dead bodies and even a man getting shot on BBC news at 6 in the evening with no warnings ! But my main point was simply ment to be - why all the uproar when the footage is available elsewhere , anyone interested in watching it can simply see it on another site . <h> Comment number 46 . <p> Just had something very interesting pointed out to me on the subject of Peterson 's accident - footage of it was used , very much pre-watershed , in the build up to the 2010 Monza GP , along with several other fatal crashes : Senna , Von Trips &amp; Rindt.The clip can be found here on youtube http : //youtu.be/ehmIHyXCEWM <p> Why was it ok to show these crashes then but not on this particular highlight video . <p> I 'm not saying that I think the editing of Peterson 's accident in this instance was right or wrong , just that a little consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seems to be an enormous sense of entitlement coming from the majority of people who comment on this blog . It 's astonishing . <p> What amazes me is that people are complaining that footage of a man being severely injured in a car crash was edited out from a video on the BBC website . The BBC ca n't control who watches this video and , as the parents out there will attest , kids are only going to be attracted by a strapline warning of disturbing images . I would n't want my son to see it . /I/ do n't want to see it , no matter if it 's part of F1 's history . <p> From the BBCs point of view , it 's the correct decision . Stop complaining . <p> No one is being " forced " to hunt the footage down on Youtube - that 's a decision you 've made yourself , do n't blame others . <p> @46 <p> The difference is that those are very short clips that do not focus on the man inside the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to get the man out of it . <h> Comment number 48 . <p> Andrew : your defence of the edit is fair enough I suppose , but it makes the inclusion of Barrichello 's reasons for picking the race completely redundant : " The one that I remember from a very long time ago is the very first one I saw in Monza where Ronnie Peterson died in a big accident in 1978 . It was the very first race that I saw on television , it 's a very sad one but a classic one for me . " <p> To the uninitiated viewer ( which I am not ) , there 's no connection between Barrichello 's reason for this choice , and the resulting footage . One other thing occurs to me - if you 've expended the time and effort in editing the highlights programme , why not offer the edit and unedited versions on this blog , with a " WARNING : GRAPHIC FOOTAGE " on the unedited version ? <h> Comment number 50 . <p> With Peterson 's crash well I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably just stunned at such an accident . I certainly ca n't judge who 's at fault because for better or worse , the Beeb have cut the highlights . <p> As for the race itself , well I ca n't believe the stewards made the decision they did regarding Andretti and Villeneuve . Either you bung the drivers in the pits for a stop go or you save the decision till after the race . <p> Would have been an impressive win for a fading Lauda though and fun to see Murray describing a young Bernie as one of the slyest operators in F1 at the time ! <h> Comment number 51 . <p> Have to agree with 95% of the comments on here , the decision to edit out the Italy ' 78 crash footage is ill-judged . People are interested in the Classic F1 entries for the historical aspect of the sport , and the ' 78 Italian Grand Prix is an ( unfortunate and tragic ) historical event for F1 enthusiasts due to the events the BBC wo n't show ! ! It 's patronising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redundant . <p> In addition , what possible reason can there be for missing out this race on the red button ? Who is actually watching the reruns of last year 's GP ? anyone into the sport enough ( who else will be watching the Classic entries ? ) will probably already have the highlights on DVD . <p> The format this year is deeply flawed - what happens now that the two most experienced drivers have done their bit , back to highlights for the past 3 to 5 years ? What 's wrong with asking F1 figures from the past ? Mansell , Piquet , Watson , Lauda etc would probably all have very interesting contributions .. <p> You ca n't keep all the people happy all the time but it seems pretty obvious what the majority of " Classic F1 " fans want to see from the regular postings on this section , there are still plenty of races to show from the archives over 10 years old , and that 's not including showing full highlights after short ones have been previously shown . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for providing this service , but let 's see the content the majority of us want , otherwise I 'm sure many others like me will simply not be interested in seeing re-runs of GPs from the previous few years . <h> Comment number 52 . <p> Firstly , well done Rubens . Good choices , and your Hockenheim drive I still remember from the time . One of the great wins for anyone starting at the back . <p> Secondly , I do not mean to offend anyone , but do people realise how morbid their combined posts make this article ? I have been watching F1 avidly since the early 80 's . I have seen a lot of nasty crashes and I have seen most of the fatal accidents at some point over the years . Anyone interested in F1 , whether young or old will quickly become aware through the extensive written coverage that there is of F1 , how dangerous a sport it has been over the years . The legacy 's of those that have sadly lost their lives to this sport are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to avoid repeat occurances and the improvements in safety over the years are amazing . We do n't need the actual footage to be aware of the incident . If the BBC choose not to show Petersons accident , then fair play to them . I suspect it was done to ensure that this article was a family friendly and enjoyable one rather than a traumatiser.As mentioned , regardless of legality , it is easy enough to find all the historical and often frightening clips you so desire elsewhere . <p> Regarding ' The Killing Years ' documentary , it was excellent , disturbing and very interesting . However , I do seem to recall watching it at lunchtime so I feel the watershed argument is a bit out of place . <p> Again , I do n't mean to offend anyone , I have read all posts up to the point where Andrew adds a comment and I think its a real shame that very few are posting positively about their memories or views on Rubens selection , and instead are dwelling on the exclusion of footage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborted and restarted ) and ultimately resulted in a fatal accident . I would also guess that Rubens did not choose this race because of the crash . <h> BBC links <p> This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets ( CSS ) enabled .

@@4119238 <h> Sony KDL-32CX523 <h> For <h> Against <p> Sony is back with one of its first offerings for 2011 , and it 's a budget belter . Lacking any kind of upmarket panel tech , you 'll have to make do with regular LCD ( no sign of any LED backlighting here ) , but elsewhere there are plenty of features to wow the average budget TV buyer . <p> Probably the most useful are Bravia Internet Video , USB recording , a built-in Freeview HD tuner and a smartphone app . <p> Let 's start with the latter - and our favourite new feature - smartphone control . Download the free MediaRemote app from iTunes or the Android Market and full mastery of the set is yours . It was actually available late last year to control some of the brand 's Blu-ray players . After activating the app , it finds the KDL-32CX523 in seconds and starts a simple pairing operation that basically gives you 20 seconds to press " OK " on the Sony remote . And that 's the last time you may ever use the ( otherwise reasonably well designed and spaced ) supplied remote . <p> MediaRemote first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to customise various aspects of the app , such as " shake to control " . A simple wave of your hand can then be programmed to perform one of six functions : change the input , bring-up subtitles , change the audio mode , increase the volume , change channel or activate the TrackID feature ( see below for more on this ) . <p> " Flip operation " is also possible ; the TV can be set to got to mute if you place your phone face down on a table . More usefully is " Keyboard sync " , whereby the smartphone displays a virtual keyboard every time the text input screen would normally appear on the KDL-32CX523 . This applies largely to Bravia Internet Video content , and it 's a massive time saver . <p> After the wizard has done its stuff its on to the central screen , where gestures are used to operate the KDL-32CX523 's main menu trees onscreen . As well as a " home " button beneath the gesture pad , there are also " return " and " options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though having to switch between the gesture pad and the virtual remote - which happily has a " guide " button up top to swiftly bring-up the Freeview HD EPG - does take a bit of getting used to . <p> The only aspects that confused us was that ( a ) we were n't able to call-up the Xross Media Bar ( slightly re-designed for 2011 ) at all , and ( b ) the MediaRemote app itself has banner adverts across the top tenth of the screen . This is not acceptable on a product that 's been paid for already . DVD and Blu-ray discs may routinely come with movie trailers and adverts , and Panasonic 's Freeview EPG may also be scarred with an advert , but that does n't make it OK . <p> By the way , the app only works if both the KDL-32CX523 and the smartphone are on your home network , and therein lies a small problem : the KDL-32CX523 has a wired Ethernet LAN port , but no built-in Wi-Fi . We would n't expect it to at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's best you know that a USB dongle from Sony costs around ? 69.00 . <p> Making Skype video calls will also necessitate buying an add-on camera-cum-microphone from Sony , though the rest of the online features within Bravia Internet Video are free . <p> They 're actually unchanged from last year except for a minor interface tweak , and number over 20 - including Demand 5 , BBC iPlayer , Eurosport and YouTube . Open web surfing is also available as an Application along the revamped Xross Media Bar user interface , but it 's far to slow to actually consider useful . Better is file support over DLNA and from USB ( we managed most major formats ) , while it 's even possible to record to a hard disk straight from the pitch perfect Freeview HD 7-day electronic programme guide ( this does n't work on USB sticks ) . Another feature , TrackID , is meant to identify track details for songs playing on your TV , but it produced only a " server error " message during our review . <p> Happily , picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an overriding - and highly watchable - smoothness introduced where noisy , dotty stretched video used to be . It 's clever stuff , but not as half as nifty as the detail in 2D Blu-ray discs . Colour is also excellent , though contrast less so . There 's an issue with motion blur , but it 's not endemic . Sound is almost always underwhelming on TVs this size , but the built-in stereo speakers actually do a half-decent job . <h> Verdict <p> Well-specified LCD TV that makes up for its lack of LED backlighting by piling on the features . Smartphone control is worth considering while the presence of BBC iPlayer and DLNA streaming make this a thoroughly modern effort - and one that punches above its weight enough to redefine the " my first flatscreen " category .

Today , the only news we hear about Iran 's opposition is of a steady procession of activists sent to the gallows on trumped-up charges of treason . <p> Not surprisingly , Iran 's expertise in the suppression of anti-government movements is now greatly in demand , particularly in Syria , another dictatorial regime that will brook no opposition . Iranian officials are reported to have been advising President Bashar al-Assad on the uncompromising measures employed by his security forces , which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of anti-government protesters and the detention of thousands of others . <p> Were it not for the antipathy between Tehran and Tripoli , Colonel Gaddafi would no doubt have appealed for similar help , although his locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at sowing fear and terror among those sections of the civilian population that have lent their support to the rebels . <p> Iran can , at least , take credit for undermining Bahrain 's pro-democracy movement , where evidence of its meddling in the otherwise legitimate campaign by the Shia majority for greater political representation prompted a dramatic intervention from neighbouring Saudi Arabia , which has effectively ended the protests . <p> In general , however , Iran 's attempts to exploit the " Arab Spring " for its own ends are mainly confined to like-minded regimes such as Syria . Of more concern is the unravelling of the pro-democracy movements in more secular , pro-Western states such as Egypt and Tunisia .

For further information please read our Cookie Policy . <h> Court confirms net neutrality rule on discriminatory pricing plan <h> Newsletters <p> On March 15 2011 the Taipei High Administrative Court upheld the National Communications Commission ( NCC ) decision to force Chunghwa Telecom to remove certain restrictions on its fibre-to-the-home ( FTTx ) high-speed internet service , Hinet FTTx . The case related to a price plan which enabled subscribers to download at speeds of 20 megabytes per second ( Mpbs ) and upload at speeds of 2 Mpbs . In the ruling , the NCC prohibited Chunghwa from imposing a restriction whereby it would lower the download/upload speed to 10 Mpbs/2 Mpbs for subscribers whose download volume exceeded 200 gigabytes in a given month for the remainder of the month in question . <p> This was the first court case in Taiwan in which a concept similar to the ' net neutrality ' principle -- which was developed by US scholars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) -- has been applied . <p> Facts <p> In June 2009 Chunghwa proposed several new rate plans for its Hinet FTTx services , including the fees for fixed and non-fixed types of Hinet FTTx with download/upload speeds of 20Mpbs/2Mpbs and the fixed type of asymmetric digital subscriber line ( ADSL ) services with download/upload speeds of 256K/64K . However , Chunghwa added a condition whereby the speed of its 20Mpbs/2Mpbs FTTx service could be automatically downgraded to 10Mpbs/2Mpbs when the subscriber 's download volume exceeded 200GB . The NCC approved Chunghwa 's proposed rate , but removed the aforementioned condition on the grounds of the principles of net neutrality and non-discriminatory treatment , the fact that there was no guarantee on assured transmission speed and efficiency , and for reasons of consumer protection . <p> Arguments <p> Chunghwa argued that the NCC had abused its regulatory power in amending the proposed rate plan . Chunghwa claimed that pricing plans are inseparable from service operations , and that this included download/upload speed adjustments based on volume . In order to balance the constitutional freedom of business and public policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed only to : <p> turn down the proposed plan ; <p> order Chunghwa to withdraw the plan ; or <p> persuade Chunghwa to revise the plan by itself . <p> Chungwa argued that by arbitrarily amending the proposed rate plan , the NCC not only upset the operator 's evaluation of the service according to future economies of scale , but also affected its profit and loss predictions relating to the overall business . <p> In addition , Chungwa alleged that its downgrading measure was implemented to prevent high-volume users from consuming the limited bandwidth , thereby squeezing other users ' opportunities to use the Internet at the same rate and causing unfairness related to the network cost burden . <p> In terms of the concept of net neutrality , Chunghwa argued that the contentious service was intended to gather statistics on network usage volume , and would not influence the free flow of information . Further , the plan did not involve the control of users ' behaviour . The speed adjustment established a better model for users fairly to use the Internet and upgraded the efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan did not violate the principle of net neutrality , which holds that Internet access should be kept open and free . Chunghwa pointed out that in general , most communications regulators in other countries have adopted a light touch with regard to the regulation of internet services and have allowed more room for market competition . <p> On the other hand , the NCC argued that it was empowered to add any terms and conditions to the administrative act , according to Article 9 of the Regulations Governing Tariffs of Type I Telecommunications Businesses ( the Tariff Regulations ) . After reviewing the proposed plan , the NCC decided to remove the restriction on the following grounds : <p> The tariff of the plan was higher than other FTTx services with different speed and Chunghwa imposes no similar restrictions on download volume in any of its other plans ; <p> Chunghwa provided no assurances on internet access bandwidth and transmission speed ; and <p> The restriction on heavy-volume downloading could easily cause consumer disputes and increase the social cost of dealing with disputes . <p> The NCC asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service plan after removing the restriction . In addition , the NCC held that consumers could have been harmed by the discriminatory nature of the rate , since Chunghwa intended to continue to collect the 20Mpbs/2Mpbs service rates even after the download/upload speed had been downgraded to 10Mpbs/2Mpbs . The NCC argued that Chunghwa should design another rate plan based on transmission volume if it believed that high-volume users were using too much bandwidth . <p> Decision <p> The court held that the NCC has the authority to add certain conditions or remove unfeasible operational measures in specific cases because the telecommunications market is highly regulated and , specifically , the pricing plans proposed by dominant market players should be critically reviewed under the Tariff Regulations . Telecommunications operators , according to Article 21 of the Telecommunications Act , must provide services in a fair and non-discriminatory manner unless otherwise provided . <p> In the case of Chungwa 's Hinet FTTx 20Mpbs/2Mpbs service , the court found that the service tariff and the restriction on the download volume were not inseparable . It noted that no restrictions applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 50Mpbs/3Mpbs , 10Mpbs/2Mpbs and 3Mpbs/768K ) . The downgrading of high-volume user 's download/upload speeds could harm the benefits enjoyed by users who had specifically chosen the 20Mpbs/2Mpbs connection speed . The court noted that Chunghwa did not reward low-volume users by cutting their service fees . As a result , the plan compromised the principle of fairness and thus violated the net neutrality principle . <p> In conclusion , the court found that the NCC 's regulation of the service tariff was intended to safeguard consumer rights and prevent unfair competition . As such , the court held that the NCC 's imposition of adequate conditions on Chungwa 's rate plan did not exceed the NCC 's administrative discretion . <p> Comment <p> The term ' net neutrality ' is applied broadly to describe a principle relating to users ' access to networks and participation on the Internet . The principle advocates that no restrictions be imposed by internet service providers or governments on content , sites , platforms , equipment and modes of communication. ( 1 ) Extreme care should be taken in the interpretation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to prevent misunderstandings . <p> In the case at hand , the purpose of tariff regulation was to safeguard users and maintain sustainable competition ; discriminatory pricing without reasonable cause is condemnable .

The Earps , particularly Wyatt , followed a couple of years later with dreams of cashing in on the silver boom . <p> In a series of movies - starting in 1934 with Frontier Marshal , based on Stuart N. Lake 's flattering and deeply flawed biography of the same title , continuing with John Ford 's My Darling Clementine in 1946 and Kevin Costner 's Wyatt Earp in 1994 - the Earps have come across as straight-shooting , law-and-order types . <p> Even 1993 's Tombstone - in which Kurt Russell 's Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer 's Doc Holliday show glimmers of the seemier side of their nature - eventually portrays the Earps as righteous men , and eventual victims . <p> Making a legend : Despite the prodigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frontier Marshal is a heavily romanticised account of the shootout ( Doc Holliday is killed before the gunfight even starts ) <p> Romantic ideal : Even in modern films - such as Wyatt Earp ( 1994 ) , starring Kevin Costner , and Tombstone ( 1993 ) , starring Kurt Russell - the Earps are law-abiding folk while the Clantons and McLaurys are unhinged <p> But Mr Guinn says it was n't that simple . Never mentioned are Wyatt 's own brushes with horse theft and misappropriation of funds , or his time working in the floating brothels in Peoria , Illinois . <p> Also omitted is the fact that Wyatt 's and at least one of his brothers ' ' wives ' were convicted prostitutes . <p> Mr Guinn says : ' Wyatt broke jail on a charge of horse theft back in Indian territory as a young man .

And it is widely believed that the brothers were fencing rustled Mexican cattle for the Clantons and others . <p> But Messrs Guinn and Johnson argue they were no worse than other local ranchers trying to feed the insatiable appetites of the U.S. Army and Tombstone 's burgeoning population . <p> The Earps were Republicans , while Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and members of the cowboy faction were members of the Democratic Party , the one more closely aligned with former Confederates . <p> Wyatt desperately wanted Behan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a crackdown on the lawless cowboys as a way to achieve that goal , Mr Guinn says . <p> Most historians agree that Ike Clanton was the fight 's chief instigator .

The only men not injured were Wyatt and Ike Clanton , who fled as the shooting started . <p> It is unclear who fired first . Initially , public opinion sided with the Earps .

The day after the shootout , three open caskets sat in the funeral parlor window under a sign that read ' Murdered in the streets of Tombstone ' . <p> More than 300 mourners on foot , 22 carriages , and dozens of riders on horseback accompanied the bodies to Boothill , while another 2,000 citizens lined the route , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder warrants , and there was a month-long preliminary hearing in which Sheriff Behan testified for the prosecution . <p> While Justice Wells Spicer agreed there was credible evidence that at least one of the dead - Tom McLaury - was unarmed , he concluded that the killings were ' a necessary act , done in the discharge of an official duty ' . <p> The Earps and Holliday , Spicer ruled , ' saw at once the dire necessity of giving the first shot to save themselves from certain death . They acted ; their shots were effective , and this alone saved all the Earp party from being slain ' . <p> This was not the end of the saga of the Earps . <p> When Virgil Earp was partially crippled in a December 1881 assassination attempt , Wyatt took his place as deputy U.S. marshal .

@@4152230 's Rock air crash <p> The Celtic cross at Eagle 's Rock which bears the names of those who died while on a ' special mission ' . <p> CAITHNESS Field Club will be guiding a four-hour hike across the moors to the Duke of Kent 's Memorial , near Berriedale , on Sunday . The event is part of a week-long programme of organised walks being staged in this , the eighth , Caithness and Sutherland Walking Festival . <p> The memorial itself is a tall , simple Celtic cross which stands in the remote foothills of the Scarabens , just north of the Berriedale River . It serves as the only tangible reminder of an unsolved World War Two mystery . <p> The official enquiry into the crash of Flight W-4206 on August 25 , 1942 , concluded a " serious mistake in airmanship " was to blame . However , when the accident investigators reached Eagle 's Rock , the crash site , there was little remaining evidence on which they could base their conclusions . <p> The aircraft , an RAF Sunderland flying boat on a flight to Iceland , had not long taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cromarty Firth . The crash had ignited the aircraft 's newly topped-up fuel tanks and the subsequent fireball had virtually destroyed everything . Such incidents , apparently , were not rare . The north Highlands , with its mountainous terrain and challenging weather systems , had claimed numerous other victims during the war years . <p> What singled out this accident , above all others , was the identity of one of the aircraft 's passengers . <p> Once described by Prime Minister Winston Churchill as a " gallant and handsome prince " , George Edward Alexander Edmund , the popular Duke of Kent , was the youngest brother of the reigning monarch , King George VI . Fifth in line to the throne , the duke had much to live for ; he and his wife , Princess Marina , had just celebrated the birth of their son , Michael , only seven weeks previously . <p> In his position as an air commodore he had responsibility of the welfare of RAF personnel and , as the inscription on the memorial at Eagle 's Rock records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sir Archibald Sinclair , then secretary for air , reported to the House of Commons the official investigations had revealed : " First , that the accident had occurred because the aircraft was flown on a track other than that indicated on the flight plan given to the pilot and at too low an altitude to clear the rising ground on the track ; secondly , that the responsibility for this serious mistake in airmanship lies with the captain of the aircraft ; thirdly , that the weather encountered should have presented no difficulties to an experienced pilot ; fourthly , that the examination of the propellers showed that the engines were under power when the aircraft struck the ground ; and fifthly , that all the occupants of the aircraft were on duty at the time of the accident " . <p> Yet a number of issues remained unresolved . <p> The flight crew , for example , were all hand-picked and vastly experienced aviators . Why , at such an early stage in the flight and in such poor visibility , did they veer away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A lack of official documentation , much of which went missing , together with denied access to the , albeit limited royal archives , has fuelled speculation and conspiracy theorists . <p> Although of the establishment , the " gallant and handsome prince " was far from conventional . By numerous accounts including Wikipedia , the online encyclopaedia , he had a string of relationships with both men and women . It 's recorded he had drug addictions ( notably morphine and cocaine ) . Various reports consistently allege he had a long-standing affair with the playwright , Noel Coward . <p> Bizarre theories about the air crash have emerged down the years . One alleges Rudolph Hess , Hitler 's deputy who had flown to Britain in 1941 to negotiate peace , was on board . ( Who then was that individual prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials who served out the rest of his life in Spandau Prison ? ) <p> Had enemy infiltrators , as others have suggested , tampered with the flight W-4026 before it took off from Invergordon ? A secret report received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1942 , claimed the Duke of Kent was apparently sympathetic to a peaceful understanding with Germany and an internal sabotage plot had been carried out as a last resort to avoid a potentially embarrassing " problem " for Britain ... <p> Incredibly , one of the members of the flight crew survived the crash : Flight Sergeant Andrew Jack was in the tail turret which had broken off on impact with the remote Caithness hillside . Miraculously he had survived the fireball which engulfed Eagle 's Rock . Confused , disorientated and suffering from burns to his face and body he had wandered aimlessly in the misty conditions before his discovery by the Sutherland family at their remote croft at Rinsary , the following day . <p> Flt Sgt Jack had claimed to have crossed many bridges there are four footbridges in the area so the family concluded he must have been going around in circles . <p> It is known while in hospital in Wick , Flt Sgt Jack was visited privately by two senior RAF officers .

He did allude to personal belief , though , the crash was not due to pilot error at least no " serious mistake in airmanship " that could be attributed to the aircraft 's official captain .

In the last minutes before take off the crew had been joined by Wing Commander Thomas Mosley , 228 Squadron 's commanding officer . And the duke , of course , held the rank of air commodore . <p> It is said friends of the duke were known to be staying at Langwell House very close to the crash site and the last known message heard from the flight deck was " Let 's go down and have a look ...

The Celtic cross , bearing the names of those who died , records how they had died while on a " special mission " a mission that ended in disaster . <p> And now , in the days before another walking group makes its own poignant pilgrimage , it 's worth reflecting on an unsolved mystery and the views of those who , having studied the facts as they are known to them , still insist that whatever caused the ill-fated flight to crash , it was not pilot error ... <p> * Caithness Field Club 's four-hour guided walk to the Duke of Kent 's Memorial takes place on Sunday .

@@4152238 <h> Only Time Will Tell by Jeffrey Archer : review <p> Grave news from Grantchester : Only Time Will Tell , Jeffrey Archer 's 16th novel , is the first in a new three-volume cycle the master is calling The Clifton Chronicles . <p> The sequence will chart the life of one Harry Clifton , whom we first meet as the orphaned son of a Bristol stevedore at the start of the 20th century , and where it will leave him -- oh , Lord -- only time will tell . <p> Harry is Archer 's stock character : the unassuming chap from a modest background in whom predatory well-wishers divine some grand potential they conspire to make him fulfil . In this case it 's -- well -- it 's pretty vague actually but it hardly matters . He could be a gifted frogman . <p> Harry is plucked from obscurity and put up for a scholarship to a fancy prep school . Will he be bullied ? Will he see off the bully ? Will he make various lifelong friends ? Will he get a scholarship to Bristol Grammar School ? Will he meet a pig-tailed girl with her nose in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she can pay the fees ? <p> Harry 's path is inevitably barred by those who have reason to be jealous of him or to fear him , but each reversal is met with fortitude and overcome with selfless grind and a dash of talent . <p> For long stretches Only Time Will Tell reads like a misery memoir , albeit one written by an accomplished narcissistic fantasist with a penchant for genealogical mysteries . Because at its heart , you see , there is a conundrum : is Harry his father 's son ? Or is he the illegitimate son of a shipping magnate ? <p> There are one or two surprises along the way : a couple of legal niggles and a curious wrinkle in the plotting . Instead of a cracking showdown as the baddie is unmasked there is only a letter of apology and promise to be better in future . <p> As ever a little too much of the author creeps in , to sometimes comical result . <p> Here is a housemaster talking to a 12-year-old boy : " ' By the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen , and I was fascinated by your suggestion that if Miss Austen had been able to go to university , she might never have written a novel , and even if she had , her work probably would n't have been so insightful .

@@4152239 <h> Are Finnish schools the best in the world ? <p> They have no uniforms , no selection , no fee-paying and no league tables . Yet Finland 's education system consistently tops global rankings . Richard Garner finds out what we can learn from them <p> Wednesday 25 May 2011 23:00 BST <p> The task is as hard as weeding out the brightest youngsters for places on Oxford and Cambridge Universities ' most popular courses . There are 16 candidates for every vacancy and somehow the 2,000 applicants have to be whittled down to 120 by the time the course starts . We are not talking about law and medicine at Britain 's most prestigious universities , though . This is Finland and the applicants are desperate for a job in what is the most sought-after profession in their country : teaching . <p> Finland is the country that has topped the international league table of the developed world 's education systems for almost all of the past decade . And England 's Education Secretary , Michael Gove , has been taking a close look at its policies to see if there is anything he can glean from them to improve standards over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance in the PISA ( Programme for International Student Assessment ) tests of 15-year-olds around the globe in reading , maths and science . It is published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . <p> Professor Jari Lavonen , the head of the Department of Teacher Education at the University of Helsinki , is the man with the enviable task , in some eyes , of whittling down the pack . He is in no doubt as to how Finland has got to this position . " We decided all teachers should have a master 's degree -- putting teaching on an equal footing with law and medicine , " he says . " Teacher education is therefore very attractive . " Figures showed that the highest-flying youngsters then started flocking to the profession because of its new-found prestige . <p> The applicants are all given a book to read before being grilled on their understanding of it . Then the 300 top performers are interviewed before the remaining 120 are offered places . " We want to find out how suitable a person is for teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to come on to a primary-education programme than to go to medical school . The competition was more heavy . " <p> Mr Gove has already said he would like to go down the Finnish path . A common theme among three of the top-performing nations -- Singapore , South Korea and Finland -- is that they all attract the best talent into the profession by setting high standards for recruitment . Mr Gove 's answer to this is to limit entrance to the profession to those who have better than a third-class degree . He has come in for a fair amount of criticism here , with teachers ' leaders arguing that it would prohibit people such as the Conservatives ' own maths guru , Carol Vorderman , from entering the profession . The brightest people in their subject area may not always be the best communicators in the classroom , so the argument goes . <p> Professor Lavonen is wary of the idea that foreign governments can " cherry pick " parts of the Finnish education system and ignore the rest . There is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of a free compulsory education system for all , which goes hand in glove with the recruitment process to create a successful education system . It is illegal to charge fees in the Finnish education system , so even those schools that are run privately take their funding from the state . Its schools are comprehensive in that there is no selection of pupils . <p> They are less formal and more relaxed than schools in the UK . The man in jeans and an open-necked shirt who greets us at the Taivallahti comprehensive school in Helsinki ( an all-in school for seven to 16-year-olds ) turns out to be the principal , Hannu Kosonen . His pupils -- in common with those in the rest of Finland -- do not wear a uniform . Discipline appears good . No one is photographing the teacher to put her picture on YouTube . <p> The teachers are not beset by targets , in fear of inspections or how well their schools do in league tables . There are simply no league tables or inspections . " They are academics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Lavonen . " This is an important feeling : they do n't need any inspection . Also , we do n't have a system of national testing . The teachers are trusted to assess their own pupils . " This is presumably because there is no pressure to tweak the results to do well in league tables . <p> Class sizes are smaller than in the UK . Mr Kosonen limits them to 20 in the first two years of schooling and the sixth and seventh year ( 12 and 13-year-olds ) . They are also mixed ability , with educators believing the teachers are well-enough trained to cope with a wider range of ability in their classes . If pupils fall behind , a second teacher can be sent in to help them to catch up . <p> Of course , it may help that Finland as a country does not have the vast gap in household incomes of the UK , and so social mobility is not such an issue over there . The gap is just beginning to widen , though , so it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosonen also points to another feature of Finnish life for producing the country 's brilliant reading results : the Government 's decision to ban the dubbing of all foreign films and television shows . This means youngsters can watch shows such as Dalziel and Pascoe and Anne Robinson 's The Weakest Link in all their English glory in their homes of an evening and get to grips better with the language . <p> A visit to last month 's teachers ' union conferences in the UK showed a flurry of concerns about headteachers " dropping in " to classrooms to check on their teachers ' standards . Mr Kosonen does this , too , and has asked each member of his staff to come up with an idea for developing their teaching . He does not see himself as an inquisitor , though . <p> Nina Koskinen , a primary-class teacher at the school , says : " Teachers do like to get feedback on what they do , but it is totally different over here to the UK . One of the things here is that principals should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of testing and inspection : " What would be the advantage of that ? It really seems to be something that gives you pressure in terms of paperwork and all that . " <p> The differences between Finland and the English system do not stop with compulsory schooling , though . After the age of 16 , youngsters decide whether they opt for an academic or vocational schooling . There is also still a divide at university level between the academic universities and the polytechnics ( as the government calls them ) or the universities of applied science , as they style themselves . Oh , and there is the little matter that university tuition is still free for home and EU students . A UK youngster would not have to spend a penny on tuition fees in Finland . The country is experimenting with charges for overseas students but only a handful of universities are taking part in this pilot . <p> Thomas Wilhelmsson , the rector of Helsinki University , ranked in the world 's top 100 universities , says : " The most that has been discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free education is seen as a very central part of the Finnish welfare-state system . The British example is a scary example . If you take tuition fees from students , you will withdraw some amount of basic funding for the system . " <p> This is a very different system to England 's , and it would be fair to point out Finland has to deal with a school population of just under 600,000 , compared with the seven million in England and Wales . But Finland 's schools and universities have been besieged by Germans , Chinese , Thais , Spaniards and Austrians desperate to find out the system 's recipe for success . It remains to be seen how much of the Finnish education system we will seek to ape ( teachers over here would love Mr Gove to adopt the whole package ) . <p> A passing thought occurs , though , as a documentary about how Finland coped with last winter 's snow flashes on to the television screen .

@@4154234 <h> You are here : <h> Where does Disney animation go post-Tangled ? <h> Tangled may prove to be a threshold of sorts in the future of Disney 's animated movies . And Simon 's been pondering just where the studio can and should go next ... <p> There 's an awful lot to love in Disney 's Tangled . Its long-in-gestation take on the Rapunzel story , the film carefully trod the line between traditional fairy tale and modern day family movie . Helped by a smart script , some lovely animation , and characters who did n't fall into the trap of being either the usual stereotypes , or straight reversals of them , it 's something of a treat . <p> It also struck me as a movie that gave Disney Animation a sense of real identity again . I enjoyed Bolt , its previous release , but few would have been surprised to see a DreamWorks logo at the end of it , had they watched it without knowing its Disney background . The same could also be argued for Chicken Little . <p> The underrated Meet The Robinsons had hinted at a fresh , modern direction that Disney could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did cover many of the studio 's roots , while again finding a tale to tell in quite a modern way . Tangled ? That seemed to be the icing on that particular proverbial cake . <p> And yet , we learn that Tangled was , in financial terms , a disappointment . More than that , last November , Disney seemed to be indicating that it would n't be making any more ' princess ' movies , citing the fact that the box office returns for both The Princess And The Frog and Tangled were below expectations . <p> While the studio has n't ruled out future princess flicks , it does n't have any more lined up , and is reportedly fearful of not being able to attract young boys to its films . <p> So , let 's take a look , for a second , at the numbers . <p> The Princess And The Frog reportedly cost around $105m to make , and took in $104m at the US box office . Elsewhere , it added $162m to its total , meaning from cinemas alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarier . Because , on face value , it did well . It took in $199m in the States , $389m elsewhere , and before it hit DVD and Blu-ray , it had grossed $588m from cinemas alone . The problem ? The negative cost , before marketing and distribution , was apparently a staggering $260m . You read that right . <p> Let 's put that into context , too . Two animated breakout hits of the past year have been Despicable Me and Gnomeo &amp; Juliet . Despicable Me brought in $543m worldwide and it cost $69m to make . Gnomeo &amp; Juliet stands at takings of $177m and that , too , cost in the $70m region . <p> Can you see the problem here ? Animation at Disney , where the full infrastructure of the studio has to be supported , is getting more and more expensive to make . It 's something we 've talked about at length in a forthcoming interview with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet director , Kelly Asbury , but it 's an unavoidable truth . <p> Disney 's big animated films now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd wager , and that means the appeal has to be broader . Although , how a film that brought in $588m worldwide , as Tangled has so far , can in any way be described as a disappointment is an indictment of modern times . <p> Disney , to be fair , has a willingness to pursue more modest projects , as its delightful hand-drawn Winnie The Pooh feature has proven . That 's not out in the US until July , but it 's so far opened across Europe , to very modest numbers . Its UK take , and the film opened in April , just about scrapes over $0.5m . So , while there 's plans for a full-length Mickey Mouse feature , Disney is n't likely to follow a similar path to its Winnie movie with it . And that inevitably leads to the fear that hand-drawn animation is going back into hibernation at the studio ( although there are reports of more hand-drawn projects ) . <p> The upcoming slate for Disney , then , has a different feel to it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Meet The Robinsons . But , as it turns out , that may not be cause for despair . Our primary reason for thinking this is what Disney has lined up for us in 2013 , as it tackled the Philip K Dick story , The King Of The Elves . <p> Chris Williams , the co-director of Bolt , is calling the shots on the film , which has hit a few delays to date ( including the replacement of its original directors ) . That means we 're currently expecting the movie at the end of 2012 , although 2013 is more likely . <p> It 's a bold project to be tackling , and that , for our money , is what Disney should be doing . For it 's in a world now where Pixar ( part of the same company , but perceived as a different entity ) is setting the standards of what stories animation can tell . <p> Meanwhile , DreamWorks has cornered itself a part of the market in animation blockbusters , and the likes of Universal ( Despicable Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Fox ( the Ice Age films , Rio , Horton Hears A Who ) are enjoying considerable successes . <p> And this has left Disney seemingly lacking the kind of identity that it had of old . No longer perceived as the pathfinder in animation , it lived within its comfort zone for a while , until it rediscovered the stories that it could tell best , and started telling them again . <p> The next movie out of Disney Animation , though , is Reboot Ralph , and it 's hard to see just where it 'll fit in . The film was originally set for release in March 2013 , but when Disney delayed Pixar 's Monsters University to the summer of 2013 , Reboot Ralph moved to November 2012 . <p> Originally known as Joe Jump , there 's not a great deal known about the film . The rumour mill suggests that it 's a movie about an 80s videogame character , who tries to make his way through more modern games , which sounds like an intriguing idea , just not necessarily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Disney animated film is are changing , and perhaps they need to do so . I 'm not alone in longing for the exquisite storytelling of the likes of The Little Mermaid and Beauty And The Beast , and certainly the likes of Pixar have learned lots of lessons from them . Yet , this is a different time , arguably a second golden age of animation , just one that 's less reliant on one company to provide it . <p> And it 's an exciting time , too . The fear we have comes back to what defines success and failure . There 's an argument that the end audience should n't worry about box office takings and such like , yet we all know the game . <p> It 's money , ultimately , that shapes the films we get , and for those who love the heritage of Disney 's animation , to hear Tangled in any way regarded as a financial disappointment is a real eye-opener . <p> There 's certainly a case for budgets to be tighter , as the $190m production budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , surely , hold its nerve , find the stories that it 's good at telling , and continue to tell them better than anyone else . <p> In the meantime , Tangled arrives on Blu-ray and DVD in the UK this week , and is well worth picking up .

@@4154235 <h> Contractors ' Questions : Can I beat IR35 by being a sole trader ? <p> Contractor 's Question : I 've read that IR35 deals with relevant engagements , and that no occupation automatically falls outside IR35 . But is n't it also true that IR35 can only ever apply to a person under a limited company , meaning an individual can entirely avoid IR35 by simply NOT being a limited company , but by being a sole trader instead ? Though if this is the case , why are n't most contractors looking to become sole traders ? <p> Expert 's Answer : Technically , IR35 also applies when trading through a partnership , but as partnerships are the least used trading vehicle generally , let alone in the freelancing arena , we will concentrate on the difference between trading through a limited company or as a sole trader . <p> Sole traders are n't ' IR35-caught ' <p> Your question focuses on tax status . While you are absolutely correct that you can not be ' caught ' by IR35 if you are a sole trader , there are wider legal and commercial issues that need to be considered as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may begin to explain why there a smaller proportion of contractors/freelancers operate as sole traders . <p> Let us assume that an end-client engages an individual operating as a sole trader to undertake a project over a relatively long time . At some point while work is underway , HM Revenue &amp; Customs undertake a review of the engager 's records from a PAYE perspective . The Revenue notes that there are regular payments to that individual , and so asks about the nature of the work . The taxman then determines that based on the standard tests , referred to in the article you cite , of personal service , control and mutuality of obligations -- that the relationship between engager and sole trader has all the hallmarks of an employer/employee relationship . <p> Sole traders are n't immune to employee tax demands <p> HMRC 's view will be that the sole trader is in reality an employee for tax purposes of the engager and that the engager has failed to operate Pay As You Earn upon the payments made to that individual . Assuming that the sole trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has made , then at the very least HMRC will be looking to recover the employer 's National Insurance Contributions ( which currently would be calculated as 13.8% of the sums paid ) , plus interest because the NIC was not paid over at the correct time . Add on a penalty of at least 15% of the NIC due if HMRC can show that the engager did not take " reasonable care " to establish the correct status of that individual . The final tax demand could run to several thousand pounds and comes on top of the accountancy fees and internal costs of dealing with the matter , let alone what might happen if the individual tries to subsequently sue for employment rights ! <p> So , from this example , it is clear that engaging a sole trader is not necessarily an attractive option for an end user unless there can be confidence that the relationship is genuinely one of independent contractor and client . Of course , with there being so much subjectivity involved in a status dispute , there are no absolute guarantees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might not necessarily be completely straightforward for the sole trader either ; apart from the fact that a successful HMRC review might lead to the work being lost ; many contracts with sole trader subcontractors include clauses which state that any costs and tax liabilities incurred by the engager as a result of a status dispute will be met by the sub-contractor ; you . Leaving aside whether such clauses are enforceable , there is a potential liability hanging over the sole trader from day one . <p> The status issue is actually turned on its head when the end-user engages a worker through a limited company ; you can not " employ " a limited company and so in simplistic terms , there can be no tax liability arising for the engager from any status challenge . Let us consider the relationship that now exists : <p> Engaging Organisation -- Limited Company Service Provider -- The Worker <p> In this relationship , the worker is typically the shareholder/director of his/her own limited company , often referred to as a Personal Services Company ( PSC ) . <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may not have a written contract ) <p> Notional contract under IR35 <p> However , HMRC have to determine as follows : if there had been a direct contract between the End Client Engager and Worker , would it have been a contract ofservice ( employment ) or a contract for services ( self-employment ) ? <p> The tests used will still be those referred to , previously , and HMRC will still be seeking to argue that the Worker is an employee , albeit this time , a ' deemed employee . ' But because the Engager is engaging a limited company ( the PSC ) , the Engager can not be the deemed employer and so the employment taxes burden falls upon the PSC . <p> As some have found out to their cost , the transfer of any status liability falls on the PSC and so , in reality , a liability for its shareholders - a very good reason why the Engager would prefer to engage with a limited company and another reason why it might be hard to get work as a sole trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should now come on to the subject of agencies to answer your final question . There may be one or more agencies in the chain between the End Client and the PSC . Due to the Agency Regulations , a recruitment agency can only supply staff and pay them as employees or engage with a limited company . The Income Tax ( Earnings &amp; Pensions ) Act ( ITEPA ) 2003 ( at s44-47 ) effectively prohibits agencies paying self-employed staff ' gross , ' so the agency must account for PAYE where it engages with sole traders , which is of no benefit to that sole trader . As most of the work in the freelance marketplace is only available through agencies , a sole trader is effectively closing the door on a great many opportunities , since recruiters wo n't touch sole traders . <p> Even where agencies are not involved , there are many contracts from both national and local government sources where tenders will only be considered if the bidder has a limited company owing to the perceived protection offered to the engager by dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ways and many people have set up limited companies as a means of limiting personal liability in the event that disaster befalls the business . <p> Limited company : more pros than cons ? <p> The final reason why many freelancers prefer the limited company option brings us back to where we started -- the tax benefits . Whilst the accountancy compliance costs of running a company may be higher , the opportunities for the shareholders to be remunerated by paying less tax and NIC are greater than the potential tax savings afforded to a sole trader . <p> So yes , if you trade through a limited company , you do have to ask yourself if IR35 applies to each and every engagement , which , of course , a sole trader does not . But if you look at the matter on the basis of risk versus reward , it does seem that a contractor operating through a limited company suits the key players in the market - engagers and agencies alike - and in very many circumstances it may be the only way to get work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@4154236 <h> UK legal profession cetain of uncertainties of Indian data protection law <p> The Indian Data protection law , which was introduced last month , has created uncertainty in the outsourcing sector and clarification is needed on a rule that could create a burdensome business process . <p> Although it is being welcomed , the outsourcing industry wants clarification on the finer details . <p> The law , the Information Technology ( Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information ) Rules , 2011 , was introduced last month . There have been fears that an article within it , that states that processors of data must gain consent from the person the data is about , will be over burdensome . <p> The new rule is section 43A of the Indian IT Act . According to the Times of India it states " that a corporate shall have to obtain permission through letter or fax or email from each client before collection of sensitive information . Thus , BPOs will have to inform the client regarding purpose of usage before collection of such information , if they go by the new IT rules 2011 . " <p> This would create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the customers of their clients . <p> Peter Brudenall , lawyer at UK law firm Lawrence Graham , says businesses are worried about the new rules on obtaining consent . He said the Indian government seems to have gone further but he added that there needs to be some clarification . <p> Katherine Ollerhead , lawyer at Berwin Leighton Paisner , says the rules suggest that any company that processes data needs to get consent . This is because the rules do not seem to differentiate between the controller of the data ( the client of the service provider ) and the processor ( the service provider ) . If true it would mean service providers in India having to seek consent from all the customers of a client to process the data . <p> But she says there is a waiting game to see the clarification from the Indian government . She agrees with Brudenall that the Indian law appears to go further than the law in the UK . <p> If you want to see the new rules in full see click on the image below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their clients ' customers . For example if an Indian company provides BPO services to a bank it will have the details of customers on its systems . Until last month India did not really have data protection laws that matched the levels of protection of the law in the US or Europe . <p> Not surprisingly this was always seen as a risk with offshoring to India . UK corporates have got around this problem because most companies providing outsourcing services from places such as India sign up to standard EU-approved contractual clauses to govern the security arrangements for the data processing . <p> Burden at DLP Piper says there has been a lot of panic , mainly from the US , about the new law because it requires businesses to gain consent from people who have their data stored or processed by an outsourcer . <p> Burden says he has been through the legislation and it actually means that consent only has to be given once . This would be given by the controller of the data , who would be the client of the service provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Europe accepts it as being as strict as its own it would negate the need to put workarounds in contracts . <p> Phil Lee , a lawyer at Field Fisher Waterhouse , is an expert in this area . He gave me his thoughts . <p> " There 's uncertainty as to when and how the new rules apply . On a narrow reading , they might apply only where no contract exists between the outsourcer and its service provider - seldom the case in international outsourcing ( generally only in on-shore , intra-group outsourcing ) . <p> It 's also unclear what the rules are for processing " sensitive personal data " ( such as medical records and financial data ) . Service providers need consent before processing " sensitive personal data " , but clarity is missing as to whether it can rely on consents already obtained by its client - if not , this could have a significant impact on outsourced operations . <p> The Indian data privacy rules bear strong resemblance to European rules in terms of data access , data retention and purpose limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected of service providers . In effect , they impose certain mandatory data privacy standards that outsourcers would normally impose contractually . By doing so , they give outsourcers greater confidence that , when sending data to India , they will fulfil European data export rules to ensure " adquate " protection for their data . <p> However , there are key differences between Indian and European standards . Outsourcers should not assume that their service provider 's compliance with Indian data privacy rules will meet European requirements - it wo n't . The outsourcer will still need to perform an appropriate level of due diligence and impose suitable contractual terms on its service provider in order to protect data . "

@@4162239 <h> Captain 's Log : Gale prickly over Jimmy 's Roses verbals <p> It is time for our first ' Captains ' Log ' of the season where we canvass the views of three leaders in the county game on the hot topics from the domestic circuit . Yorkshire 's Andrew Gale and Kent 's Rob Key return , and we welcome James Foster of Essex to our panel . <p> PAUL NEWMAN : Gentlemen , we are almost two months into the season already and the biggest development seems to be the high number of young English players making their mark . That must be exciting . <p> ANDREW GALE : A lot of Kolpaks have gone from the game and that has given young players the opportunity to step up . <p> Our financial problems have been well documented and we have gone without overseas players , but we have always supported a home-grown policy at Yorkshire . <p> We have regularly been fielding nine or 10 this season born and brought up here . It means that they wear the White Rose with particular pride . <p> The only thing is , you do need a balance and we have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Anthony McGrath and Richard Pyrah , which has led to inconsistency . It does n't do youngsters any good being beaten every week . <p> JAMES FOSTER : There 's no secret that for most counties money has been a problem and we 've all had to be smarter . So you think : ' Why not give the young lads a crack ? ' <p> But the key is not to pick them just because they are young . They have to be able to progress and succeed . We try to pick the best team to win a game , whether the players are 18 or 35 . <p> ROB KEY : In the past a lot of these guys would n't have got a look in because counties had bigger squads but someone like Matt Coles , for instance , has had a year-and-a-half 's first-class experience already with us and he 's only just 21 . That would have been denied him in the past . <p> NEWMAN : Tell us about the Roses match , Andrew . I gather it got a bit feisty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchanges . <p> GALE : It was very competitive as you would expect but Jimmy probably overstepped the mark with his verbal abuse . The umpires had to intervene and to be honest it was n't the way I want my players to conduct themselves . Everyone knows how competitive I am , but Jimmy overdid it . <p> NEWMAN : Which young cricketers have caught your eye ? <p> GALE : Jonny Bairstow has made an outstanding start , particularly with the bat . We took the decision that he should keep wicket in the Championship this year and he is getting better and better . <p> And Joe Root is out of the same club in Sheffield as Michael Vaughan and is easy on the eye to watch like Vaughany too . <p> NEWMAN : What about your 15-year-old wicketkeeper Barney Gibson , Andrew ? He seemed to come from nowhere to play in the first team but I noticed you then brought Simon Guy back to keep when Bairstow and Gerard Brophy were injured ? <p> GALE : We wanted to give Barney experience against Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the Roses match might have been a bit much for him at this stage . Anyway , he had his GCSEs at the time ! <p> Outstanding talent : Jonny Bairstow of Yorkshire is one to watch for the future <p> FOSTER : Jaik Mickleburgh , Adam Wheater and Reece Topley are three who stand out for us . Reece is only 17 , is 6ft 6in already and can swing the ball with control . He has had a lot of attention but he 's level-headed and can cope with it . <p> We just have to make sure we do n't get too excited about Reece because he needs to keep progressing and it has been good to see him asking top left-armers like John Lever and Chaminda Vaas for advice this year . <p> KEY : Coles got his first five-for the other day and Adam Ball was our only fit bowler at one stage but he had to do his A levels ! <p> Looking further afield , James Taylor has again looked a good player against us this week and Ben Stokes is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this column last year and he has kicked on now . They say his bowling is better too . It 's a great shame he seems to have picked up an injury because he should definitely be in the England one-day squad this year . <p> NEWMAN : What about the financial picture , Rob ? Kent have been as hard hit as any . <p> KEY : It 's been tough . I think the boom days are over for county cricket and salaries will come back into line more with what the counties want rather than what the players want . <p> A lot of counties are at breaking point but from our point of view I think we are on an upward curve now . We have even been able to sign an overseas player in Charl Langeveldt for Twenty20 . <p> NEWMAN : What happened to your overseas bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe , James ? He left the club early having been dropped . <p> FOSTER : There are no guarantees with overseas players and the disappointing thing is he came under-prepared , which he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rusty , bowled a lot of no-balls and wides and his work ethic was n't where we needed it to be . You have to put your best team out and others had performed better . <p> NEWMAN : You have completed half of the Championship programme and now it 's Twenty20 time . Sixteen group matches each again ! <p> FOSTER : We are one of the counties who want 16 games because we sell them out and financially they are very important for us . We have a good one-day record and I think this has come at a good time for us . <p> The only problem is that we have n't had time to practise specific skills for the format . We are going straight from the Championship in Bristol to Twenty20 in Hove and we have just had to sneak our preparation in . <p> GALE : We have been on the road for 18 days and we have n't been able to prepare properly either . It 's such a busy schedule and we think 16 games are too many . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good Twenty20 will give us the lift our season has needed . I 'm looking forward to all those games now but come back to me in the middle of it all and I might feel a bit differently ! <h> Newman 's talking point <p> Jonathan Trott has not always got the credit he has deserved but the fact he was voted England 's player of the year by the cricket media this week suggests he has finally won acceptance as the extraordinary batsman he is becoming . <p> It is time for us all to stop nit-picking over his scoring rate and his idiosyncrasies and enjoy the fact that an England batsman is so hungry for big hundreds . <p> Mind you , old habits die hard . I voted for Alastair Cook ... <p> Player of the year : England 's prolific batsman Jonathan Trott poses with his prize

@@4169238 <h> New drug for malignant skin cancer <p> The development of a new drug called vemurafenib heralds " a new era in the treatment of skin cancer " , according to The Independent . <p> Several newspapers have written about the drug , which has been tested in a trial involving 675 adult patients with previously untreated advanced skin cancer ( melanoma ) . Patients were given either the new vemurafenib pill or injections of dacarbazine , the only licensed chemotherapy drug for advanced melanoma . Scientists found that vemurafenib reduced the risk of a person 's disease progressing and improved overall short-term survival . At six months , 84% of those who took vemurafenib were still alive , compared to 64% of those who took dacarbazine . The average survival with vemurafenib was estimated to be 5.3 months , compared to 1.6 months with dacarbazine . <p> As with all drugs , there were some side effects associated with vemurafenib , such as joint pain and skin complaints , with 18% of people taking the drug developing less aggressive skin tumours that could be removed by simple surgery . Longer-term follow-up will be needed to monitor the risk of such tumours and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results represent an advance in cancer treatment , vemurafenib is not a cure for melanoma as some newspapers have suggested . Instead , the drug has shown promising results in slowing the progression of melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body , rather than curing it . <h> Where did the story come from ? <p> The study was carried out by researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and other research centres in the US , Europe and Australia . It was funded by Hoffmann-La Roche , the manufacturer of vemurafenib . <p> The study was published in the peer-reviewedNew England Journal of Medicine . <p> The newspapers generally reported this study appropriately , though some of them presented overly high expectations of this treatment . The Daily Mail 's headline said that the drugs " could offer years more life " , but the current study results do not demonstrate this . In this study , vemurafenib was found to improve average ( median ) survival by 3.7 months , rather than years . The BBC reported the proportions of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months , rather than only reporting the relative changes in survival . This helps readers to better understand the drug 's impact . <h> What kind of research was this ? <p> This randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) assessed the effects of a new drug called vemurafenib for advanced ( metastatic ) melanoma . The drug was compared to the treatment currently used , the chemotherapy drug dacarbazine . An RCT is the best type of study for assessing the effects of new treatments compared to current treatments . <p> Metastatic melanoma ( called stage IV cancer ) , where cancer has spread to other organs in the body , has a poor prognosis . Patients live for an average ( median ) of 8 to 18 months after diagnosis . In the UK and US , dacarbazine is the only chemotherapy drug licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma . This study also included patients whose cancer was at the stage just below this ( stage IIIC ) , defined as having either an ulcerated melanoma that has spread to one to three lymph nodes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or without ulceration . <p> About 40 -- 60% of melanomas are reported to carry mutations in a gene called BRAF . These mutations cause the BRAF enzyme to be active all the time , which can contribute to uncontrolled cell division seen in cancerous cells . Vemurafenib inhibits the action of the mutant BRAF enzyme , and is being tested in people who carry BRAF mutations . <h> What did the research involve ? <p> The researchers enrolled 675 adult patients with previously untreated stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma ( the most advanced stages ) that could not be removed surgically and that carried a BRAF mutation . To be eligible , they had to have a life expectancy of more than three months . They were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either vemurafenib or dacarbazine , and were followed up over time to see whether there were any differences between the drugs in outcomes of overall survival , tumour response or adverse events . <p> As vemurafenib is an oral treatment and dacarbazine an intravenous treatment , patients would have known which treatment they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not subjective measures , the lack of blinding should not have influenced the recording of these events . Vemurafenib was given as a pill at a dose of 960mg twice a day . Dacarbazine was given intravenously at a dose of 1,000mg per square metre of body-surface area every three weeks . Doses could be reduced according to a set protocol if there were intolerable adverse effects . Treatment was stopped once the disease progressed . <p> Participants were assessed at the start of the study and every three weeks for tumour response , which was defined according to standard criteria . Researchers also monitored the participants for adverse events , the severity of which was graded according to a standard grading system . The main outcomes that the researchers were interested in were overall survival and being free of disease progression . <p> The researchers compared overall survival and the other outcomes of interest between the two groups . The current report comes from the interim analysis of the study , which was planned to take place after 98 deaths had occurred . <h> What were the basic results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vemurafenib were alive , compared to 64% in the dacarbazine group . Vemurafenib reduced the risk of dying during the study by 63% compared to dacarbazine ( hazard ratio HR 0.37 , 95% confidence interval CI 0.26 to 0.55 ) . The average ( median ) survival in the vemurafenib group was estimated to be 5.3 months , compared to 1.6 months with dacarbazine . <p> Vemurafenib also reduced the risk of a person 's tumour progressing by 74% ( HR 0.26 , 95% CI 0.20 to 0.33 ) . Because of the improved results with vemurafenib , the board overseeing the study recommended that patients receiving dacarbazine should be treated with vemurafenib . <p> Adverse events that were more common with vemurafenib than dacarbazine included painful joints ( arthralgia ) , rash , alopecia , keratoacanthoma ( a fairly non-aggressive tumour of the hair follicle ) and squamous-cell carcinoma ( another type of skin cancer which rarely spreads to the body and can usually be completely cured using surgical removal ) .

They suggest that future research could look at the effects of combining vemurafenib with other treatments . <h> Conclusion <p> This study used a good design to assess the effects of vemurafenib in people with advanced malignant melanoma . The study has shown that treatment with the drug is associated with a greater overall survival rate than treatment with dacarbazine , the only licensed chemotherapy drug for treating this stage of disease . As well as improving overall survival , vemurafenib reduced the risk of the disease progressing . As an oral treatment , some people may prefer vemurafenib to the intravenous dacarbazine . <p> There are a few points to note : <p> Vemurafenib is only used in people who carry a BRAF mutation in their tumour .

Soon , the people were to decide which of the two would become president . <p> It was in the early Nineties , under the government of Keiko 's father , Alberto Fujimori , that the biggest gold rush of modern times got under way in Cajamarca .

@@4176235 <h> When deporting foreign criminals is in the public interest <p> Further to our recent post on the deportation of foreign criminals , the matter has once again come to the attention of the Court of Appeal.This case determines how the First-tier Tribunal , the first court of call for challenges to threatened deportations , should consider and weigh the issue of deterrence when deciding whether to deport a single offender . <p> The court made some interesting statements about the " public interest " aspect of deporting foreign criminals , and how the logic of a deterrence system must work . <p> Over Thirty Years in the UK <p> RU , a national of Bangladesh had resided in the UK from the age of 14 in 1976 , having been granted indefinite leave to remain ' ILR ' in 1986 . In 1991 he married and a daughter born in 1992 . He subsequently divorced his wife in 1998 . <p> Following the divorce , RU " s former brother-in-law was shot three times in the arm by a Bangladeshi male . RU had been complicit in this crime and was convicted in 27 October 1999 of causing grievous bodily harm with intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Person Act 1861 . RU was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment . The trial judge did not make any recommendation for deportation . In January 2009 the appellant was released on parole . <p> In July 2008 the Secretary of State for the Home Department ' SSHD ' notified RU that she had noted RU 's conviction and that she took a very serious view of the offence and was therefore considering RU 's immigration status and his liability to deportation . RU replied asserting that removal by a deportation order would infringe his rights to private and family life under Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights " ECHR " and that a deportation order would not be proportionate under Article 8(2) . <p> In her decision letter of 20 January 2009 , the Secretary of State noted that section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007'UKBA 2007 ' applied to RU because he was a " foreign criminal " within the definition of section 32(1) of UKBA ; that is , he is a non-British citizen who had been convicted in the UK of an offence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 12 months . The SSHD was therefore obliged by section 32(5) , to make a deportation order against RU . The SSHD stated she had taken account of the UK 's obligations under the ECHR , particularly Article 8 , and whilst accepting that RU had a private life in the UK , concluded that removal of RU by deportation to Bangladesh would not interfere with RU 's Article 8 rights in a manner which was disproportionate to the exercise of the legitimate interests of the UK government in the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . Accordingly , the SSHD had decided to make a deportation order against RU , pursuant tosection 32(5) of the UKBA andsection 3(5)and section 5of theImmigration Act 1971 . <p> On 22nd April the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ' AIT ' reached promulgated its decision ' the First Determination ' . The AIT concluded that RU should not be deported inter alia because , in respect of deterrence : <p> 56. ... we do not accept that his deportation would act in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appellant is an individual and there is no reason why any other prospective offender would have any knowledge whatsoever of his deportation . Nevertheless , we bear in mind that the appellant 's offence , some 10 years ago , was an extremely serious one and one which , on its own , might well justify deportation . " emphasis added <p> The SSHD sought reconsideration of that decision . On 18th August 2009 Senior Immigration Judges Storey and Mather ordered that the case should be adjourned to a ' second stage reconsideration ' on the grounds that the AIT had materially erred in law in ? 56 of the First Decision in the way it dealt with the concept of the public good and public interest in deciding whether RU 's deportation would be disproportionate to his Article 8 rights : <p> It seems to us that this paragraph betrays an erroneous grasp of the concept of public good and the public interest . The guidance given by the Court of Appeal in cases such as OH ( Serbia ) and DS ( India ) is binding on AIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIT judges must have regard to the significance of deportation as a deterrent . As stated by Rix LJ at para 37 of DS ( India ) : <p> " The public interest in deportation of those who commit serious crime does well beyond depriving the offender in question from the chance to re-offend in this country ; it extends to deterring and prevent serious crime generally and to upholding public abhorrence of such offending . " <p> The notion of deterrence is this context is not one that depends on examining whether deportation of the individual who is the subject of a decision to deport would be a deterrent , but on the policy of deportation as a deterrent " <p> On 5th February 2010 at the ' second stage reconsideration ' , the First-Tier Tribunal reached a Second Decision that , although it was " a finely balanced assessment " the SSHD 's decision to make a deportation order was proportionate and lawful . <p> The Appeal <p> RU appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that there was no error of law in the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important ' public interest ' factors to be considered in deportation cases per OH ( Serbia ) v SSHD , namely ( a ) the risk of re-offending , ( b ) the need for possible deportation to be seen as a means of deterrence , and ( c ) the role of using deportation orders as an expression of the public 's revulsion at serious crimes and the need to build public confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who have committed serious crimes . RU submitted that paragraph 56 had not dismissed the important public interest of deterrence and the AIT was entitled to comment on whether the deportation of RU would act in a meaningful way as a deterrent to others . <p> The Court set out the law on deportation of ' foreign criminals ' under the UKBA 2007 explained in our previous post . Under section 32(5) of the UKBA 2007 the SSHD " must make a deportation order " in respect of a ' foreign criminal ' unless one of the statutory exceptions under section 33 of the UKBA 2007 apply . The Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to make the deportation order for a foreign criminal on the ground that such deportation would be in breach of the criminal 's rights under the ECHR Exception 1 of Section 33 of the UKBA 2007 , the SSHD is not prevented from making such an order and in such circumstances the statutory provision that the " deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good " still applies . Lord Justice Aikens noted that : <p> ... I therefore agree with Sedley LJ 's statement ( when sitting in the Upper Tribunal ) in SSHD v MKthat what was in the field of " executive policy " ( because it was for the SSHD to decide whether it was conducive to the public good to deport a foreign criminal ) has now become " legislative policy " . Parliament has stated that it is conducive to the public good to deport " foreign criminals ... " . ? 34 <p> The Court considered that both the SSHD and any reviewing tribunal must be obliged to take into account the ' public interest ' factors set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionality ' balancing exercise required . The Court considered however : <p> ... that still leaves open two questions : first , what weight is generally to be attached to those public interest factors in the proportionality exercise ; is it the same or more than was accorded under the pre-UKBA regime ? Secondly , should any separate or additional weight be given to the SSHD 's own judgment on the weight of those factors in a particular case , as expressed in his Decision Letter ? <p> Both questions were raised , but not answered , by Sedley LJ , sitting in the Upper Tribunal , in his judgment in SSHD v BK.The questions were also raised by this court in its recent decision in AP ( Trindad and Tobago ) v SSHD.In that case counsel for the SSHD had not argued that the effect of the 2007 Act was that greater weight had to be given to the public interest factors in cases where a " foreign criminal " resisted a deportation order on grounds that removal would infringe his Article 8 rights under the ECHR . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public interest factors in favour of deportation summarised inOH(Serbia)were now less important in such cases " . ? 37 <p> The Court went on to cite Lord Justice Carnwath in AP ( Trinidad and Tobago ) that : <p> " ... Although the executive 's policy as such has been superseded , it is readily inferred that the policy factors identified in OH(Serbia) were impliedly endorsed and if anything reinforced , by Parliament 's intervention . Indeed , as I have said , Parliamentary endorsement is arguably a matter which should be taken into account in giving greaterweight to such factors when drawing the balance of proportionality under Article 8 . Although counsel for the SSHD did not so argue , it seems a little surprising ( if she is right ) that this apparently definitive statement by Parliament has made no difference in practice , at least where any form of private or family life is involved " . ? 44 of AP ( Trinidad and Tobago ) v SSHD <p> Noting that counsel in the instant case had taken the same stance as counsel in AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that : <p> Although , in my view , it is not necessary to resolve the questions on this appeal I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Carnwath LJ as set out above . But these questions will be open for argument if relevant in future cases . " ? 39 . <p> The Court 's Decision on the First Determination <p> The Court of Appeal decided that the AIT had " clearly erred in law " in stating that : " we do not accept that his deportation would act in any meaningful way as a deterrent to others , as the appellant is an individual and there is no reason why any other prospective offender would have any knowledge whatsoever of his deportation " . <p> The Court considered that : <p> The point about " deterrence " is not whether the deportation of a particular " foreign criminal " may or may not have a deterrent effect on other prospective offenders . It concerns a much more fundamental concept which is explained by Judge LJ at 83 of his judgment in N(Kenya) . The UK operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens who enter and remain in the UK . The operation of that system must take account of broad issues of social cohesion in the UK . Moreover , the public has to have confidence in its operation . Those requirements are for the " public good " or are in the " public interest " . For both of those to requirements to be fulfilled , the operation of the system must contain an element of deterrence to non-British citizens who are either already in the UK ( even if refugees ) or who are thinking of coming to the UK , " so as to ensure that they clearly understand that , whatever the circumstances , one of the consequences of serious crime may well be deportation " . That element of " public interest " or " public good " is a part of the legislative policy , declared by Parliament in section 32(4)of the UKBA , that the deportation of " foreign criminals " is conducive to the public good . <p> As there was nothing in the remainder of the First Determination that demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AIT must have followed the direction in law it had given itself in paragraph 56 . The AIT had therefore failed to give appropriate weight to that facet of the ' public interest " , the error of law must have been material and that made the First Determination unlawful . <p> Deterrence <p> There is a clear logic to the Court of Appeal 's decision . Arguably , if the AIT 's position in the First Decision was adopted it could be said of every foreign offender that their deportation would not act as a deterrent as every such offender would be " an individual and there is no reason why any other prospective offender would have any knowledge whatsoever of his deportation " . Such an approach would undoubtedly defeat any prospect of deportation amounting to a deterrent . <p> Barely a day passes without a foreign criminal escaping deportation on the risible grounds that he has a girlfriend , child or even a pet living in the UK .

" <p> Immigration practitioners representing parties in such cases in the future may wish to consider the arguments commented on by Lord Justice Carnwarth in AP ( Trinidad and Tobago ) and concurred with by Lord Justice Aikens in RU ( Bangladesh ) that " Parliamentary endorsement in section 32(4) of the UKBA 2007 is arguably a matter which should be taken into account in giving greaterweight " to the public interest factors in deportation . <p> Sign up to free human rights updates by email , Facebook , Twitter or RSS <h> 2 thoughts on " When deporting foreign criminals is in the public interest " <p> " We will not accept foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offences should be removed at the earliest possible opportunity.We will do all we can to protect the public from those who abuse their right to be here .

@@4185235 <h> Are we losing our minds ? <p> There is growing unease about the effects of modern technology on society and , in particular , on the way our minds work , says Sheila Keegan . Is this fear overblown or could we really be losing our minds ? <p> Where would we be without tools ? From pickaxe to iPad , tools have transformed our world and made the societies we are today . And now there is the internet , so firmly entrenched within our lives we often wonder how we would survive without email and Google and all the rest of it . <p> But just as tools shape our world so they might reshape us . There is growing evidence that digital media , the internet , social networking and online recreation are having dramatic effects on our thinking and the way our minds work , both physiologically and psychologically . Back in 1964 , Marshall McLuhan coined the famous and now prophetic phrase " the medium is the message " . He pointed out that media are not just passive channels for information ; they also shape our processes of thought . Half a century later , neuroscience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain was viewed as a mechanical contraption , ' hard-wired ' and immutable after childhood . But neuroscientists are now revealing the brain to be dynamic , connected and adaptive throughout life , with an extraordinary degree of plasticity . A brain contains some 100 billion neurons and , on average , each neuron has 1000 connections , so we have trillions of neural pathways in a state of dynamic equilibrium . Use these neural pathways regularly and they grow stronger . Ignore them and they atrophy . It 's the survival of the busiest . <p> " In a predominantly power-browsing world , perhaps the most important skill of a researcher is to be a contrarian , to step back , to think deeply , reflectively , analytically " <p> Sheila Keegan <p> The plasticity of our brains means that they are quickly re-shaped by new stimuli , particularly when it is repetitive . Anecdotal evidence from psychologists , educationalists , neuroscientists , web designers and others suggests that intensive internet usage disrupts certain kinds of thinking ; we lose the ability to concentrate , reading becomes cursory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , author of ' The Shallows : How the internet is changing the way we think , read and remember ' , the internet " delivers precisely the kind of sensory and cognitive stimuli -- repetitive , intensive , interactive , addictive -- that have been shown to result in strong and rapid alterations in brain circuits and functions ... the net commands our attention with far greater insistency than our television or morning newspaper ever did . " Watching teenagers -- or indeed ourselves -- compulsively tweeting , texting and checking emails , you can see his point , especially when you consider that most of us spend more time each day in front of a screen than we spend sleeping . <p> But what of the scientific evidence ? In 2008 Gary Small , professor of psychiatry at UCLA and director of its Memory and Ageing Centre , carried out the first experiment that showed how people 's brains change in response to internet usage . He scanned the brains of the ' internet-naive ' and ' experienced Googlers ' as they searched online . After only five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated the same brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as he found among experienced Gogglers -- a dramatic demonstration of the brain 's plasticity . <p> Further studies demonstrate how internet usage strengthens some mental capabilities and weakens others . Cognitive skills , such as hand-eye co-ordination , reflexes and processing visual cues can be improved , sometimes substantially . Focusing on older adults , the UCLA team discovered that internet usage can enhance brain circuitry " in a way that is similar to solving crossword puzzles " . A more bizarre study , reported in Scientific American Mind , revealed that surgeons who played videogames made fewer mistakes in the operating theatre than those who did n't . Supposedly , videogames quickened spatial intelligence and improved collaborative problem solving skills . <p> However , the picture is not all rosy . Although we might claim otherwise , our brains are not good at multi-tasking , which is central to most internet usage . Switching between just two tasks can add substantially to our cognitive load -- and our performance suffers . There is a strong correlation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorientation or cognitive overload . Contrary to predictions , disorientation does n't diminish with familiarity . Readers of hypertext often click haphazardly through pages rather than reading content thoroughly , and their recall is low . University students were found to skim academic articles , reading just one or two pages ; they power-browsed for quick wins . These studies , and others , support the hypothesis that the internet promotes shallow , distracted thinking , in spite of delivering some cognitive benefits . Heavy internet usage seems to chip away at our ability to concentrate , to reflect , to make connections and to develop new thinking . <p> Neuroscientist Professor Susan Greenfield believes that " spending so much time in cyberspace will inevitably lead to minds very different from any others in human history " . In the future , ' power-browsing ' may become ' normal ' thinking . We might perfect fast data-gathering at the cost of deep , reflective thinking . <p> And then , what will all this mean for market research ?

But arguably , in a predominantly power-browsing world , perhaps the most important skill of a researcher is to be a contrarian , to step back , to think deeply , reflectively , analytically , to make connections , to view problems from different perspectives , to contextualise , to synthesise , to formulate our thinking in ways that are relevant to our clients ' problems . <p> This takes time , incubation and experience . And to do it effectively we must remember to regularly turn off our laptops , go outside , smell the roses and revel in the joys of our humanness . We do not need to lose our minds -- even if those around us lose theirs .

Maybe instead the internet and the way it works was developed this way because it fit the structure of how our own brains process information , hence the fast learning times . <p> This article is interesting , but seems to miss one of the key points about internet usage and its mental effects - that people interact with the net in many different ways and for many different purposes . The word ' search ' is frequently used , but it definitely is n't all about searching , or even ' researching ' . This is bound to have different effects on the brain as they use the internet . Some other examples are that people use the internet as a reference as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for and where the information is , and they simply look the information up .

Others still surf and browse , which are different techniques of use , requiring different levels of attention and involvement from that of the committed researcher . The internet is in one real sense a mirror of the thoughts of its accessors , as well as of their questions , and surely the variety of thoughts people have will necessarily mean that the internet changes brains in different ways . Even questions take a wide variety of aspects , so it is n't as simple as one might think .

One other point is that those who use it as a bureaucratic convenience might click frequently on the word ' Submit ' , which probably has its own mental correspondence . <p> Ca n't agree more with Sheila 's conclusions and points made in the article . I have a twitter account , following certain people and companies and you can feel how easily you can be sucked by tweets and develop Twitter Compulsive Disorder ( TCD ) . I have noticed that a lot of CEOs , directors and similar high managerial positions use Twitter and you can sense that they have a need to Tweet something even though it is completely irrelevant in regard to their position , job or company they work for .

It is vitally important for people to take a break every hour from the screen , if only to look out the window . This article has some very good points , Namely that humans are unable to multitask effectively . I challenge anyone to complete one task more effectively , while being subjected to onslaughts of other media , than if they were only focusing on the job at hand .

As our life span is limited , it is a great advantage that we have all the knowledge at hand though web i.e. wikipedia.org . The next stage is to find a way to implant all the knowledge into our brain , or to connect them with our neural cells directly . The more we know or possess , the more we could think or create .

@@4185237 <p> Guernsey 's position as a stepping stone between England and northern France has lent it an agreeable idiosyncrasy for visitors , no matter which direction they sail from . You 're as likely to find a Rue du Pre as a pillar box among its medieval forts , Elizabethan castles , eccentric neo-gothic experiments and German occupation bunkers . Such a curious mish-mash of styles and times , perspectives and peoples , makes the island a perfect spot from which to explore the idea of identity , as this year 's Festival of Photography does with some aplomb and the tiniest dash of oversight . <p> The theme of ' identity ' is an obligingly elastic one that has prompted a broad range of interpretations . Notions of self and place , community , affiliation within those communities , and landscapes both social and physical combine to form something nearing a portrait of the ways in which we see ourselves in the 20th and 21st centuries . <p> At its core are five shows from Richard Billingham , Carolyn Drake , Samuel Fosso , Martin Parr and Tony Ray-Jones - a softer pitch than the previous year 's fare , which was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a series of smaller , satellite offerings - Nellie Palomaki , Adam Patterson and Dana Popa for example , which add a chorus of emerging talent . This is often the exciting area of any festival , where we see the genre swell and reinvigorate , and Guernsey 's selection does n't disappoint . <p> The festival plays out over a number of venues across St Peter Port . A sunken garden and the library lawns , which slope down toward the sea are two of the most captivating , but the curators have also made use of bus shelters and vacated shops , to varying degrees of success . The homespun nature and small size can lend a fresh , bespoke flavour , but it 's hard not to feel faintly depressed in premises that only recently provided someone 's living , and the bus-shelter 's lure as a convenient space for dozing off a Special Brew is potent the world over . I could n't help thinking how brilliant the castle would be for an exhibition , or a night-time slideshow , as would some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the festival organisers , who must battle with the lack of purpose built venues in the town , and whose determination to let their public stumble upon rather than be prescribed their photographic treats is rare and admirable indeed . <p> Two shows stand out above the rest , both in terms of content and execution . ' Paradise Rivers ' by Carolyn Drake is the fruit of four years ' foray into Central Asia - Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan - once part of the Soviet Union and now a site where a constellation of cultures , histories and identities must play out . <p> The project takes its name from the rivers Amu and Syr Daryra , which according to Medieval Islamic texts were two of the Rivers of Paradise . Their path from their source in the Pamir and Tien Shen mountains downstream to the Aral Sea basin , takes them through each of the five countries , where their water has sustained human life for more almost 50,000 years . <p> Sustained , that is , until Soviet rule damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals , to fuel a monolithic cotton industry . Once the world 's fourth largest lake , the Aral Sea is now little more than salt deposits and a dust storms , and these nascent Central Asian nations , whose 1991 independence is still within recent memory , have struggled to cope with its after-effects . <p> Post-soviet photography can sometimes rely too heavily on the regime 's edifices and totems , but Drake wanted her work to describe and pay homage to an earlier history rather than a brief interlude . She studied Mongol and Persian creation myths , and tried to dovetail the pertinent images of each into the images she produced . Rather than a figurative approach , her images are more lyrical and supple . In a region that has experienced such cultural and political drift -- China and Russia and Britain and America all fought to add this piece of territory to their retinue -- it is apt to see detail and sometimes colour wash in and out . The sense of flow is immense ; the space for our imaginings vast . The issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have been transformed into something quietly and mysteriously seductive . <p> The second standout series of the festival is Dana Popa , a young Romanian photographer exhibiting as part of a show titled ' The Return Journey ' . Her project - ' Our Father Ceausescu ' - focuses on a generation of Romanians who have lived the majority of their lives under a capitalist system in a love/hate relationship with its communist past . <p> Now in her thirties , Popa is able to portion her life into before and after Ceaucescu . As a 12-year-old in 1989 , she remembers that " television happened " . Programmes from all over the world replaced state broadcasts showing Ceaucescu visiting factories and cornfields , " spreading his benevolence to his subjects " . It brought the West into the small screen in people 's homes , and left today 's teenagers locked in the acquisitive embrace of capitalism . <p> " Without the right connections one can not usually get a good job here " says Ciprian , one of her subjects , who is 24 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a desire to migrate . But living with this huge fear that I might not have a chance to a decent life in my own country can be depressing . " <p> Popa 's storytelling is flawless . Seen side by side her images perform a rich visual fugue , intertwining story and colour and light and shade in such a way that it is impossible not to be drawn in . I was particularly taken with her captions , which rather than being straight descriptions were extracts from interviews , the voices strident and sad . " Now I can see how poor I am " says one . " A sensation of emptiness and fear slid from under my ribs towards my knees " says another " I felt how my father 's pain settled in my soul " . <p> ' Our Father Ceausescu ' is shown alongside the work of Adam Patterson , who also deserves high praise . His journey back home mirrors Popa 's in its pivot on profound political change . Like Romanians , the Northern Irish have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes they struggle with the consequences . ' Men and my Daddy ' -- a title Patterson took from a handwritten caption on the back of a photograph of a child 's father in prison with his fellow inmates - confronts a generation of paramilitary members struggling to find purpose now that the Troubles are ostensibly over . Patterson 's tightrope walk through the rhetoric of heroism and saviours , brutality and barbarism is mesmerising . The project is unfinished , and I ca n't wait to see how it fleshes out . <p> Both Samuel Fosso and Richard Billingham were solid , if small shows -- it 's wonderful though to see Billingham 's influential serious ' Ray 's a Laugh ' printed at their original , snapshot size and the video footage of his mother and father playing out the petty dramas of domestic life adds immeasurably . <p> My final mention goes to the young photographer who won last year 's discovery award , Jocelyn Allen . Her series ' One is Not Like the Other ' , produced with funding by sponsors of the Festival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allen sets up a number of diptychs where she appears next to and mimicking her family members . In each , the setting is carefully chosen -- her and her sisters move between their respective bedrooms for example -- as is the dress , which is perfectly matched . It 's a beautifully able portrait of kinship : for every moment of delight at the craft of her mimicry , comes an equal moment of wonder at the affinities and sometimes confusing discrepancies we experience in our own families .

An unbelievable game which saw play halted by snow -- in June ! <p> Few remember the three-day match at The Park , between Derbyshire and Lancashire , for being one of the biggest defeats in County Championship history , instead for the unseasonal and unexpected influx of the dreaded white stuff . <p> " It was a real experience , " explained Bird , 77 . " I 've never known anything like it during my 50-year involvement in cricket . I 've seen plenty of games affected by rain and bad light in my time , but never snow . " <p> Glorious sunshine had greeted the crowds at The Park on Saturday May 31 , 1975 , as Lancashire won the toss and elected to bat , before racking up 477-5 . Frank Haynes ( 104 ) and power-hitter Clive Lloyd ( 167no ) both struck centuries - Lloyd 's unbeaten knock took ironically 167 minutes ! <p> Derbyshire reached 25-2 off 15 overs in reply by the close of play on day one , still trailing Lancashire by more than 450 runs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buxton hosted a John Player League game , witnessing Derbyshire inflict defeat on Glamorgan . <p> Bird continued : " We planned to recommence the county game on the Monday morning .

But now there was snow everywhere , six inches in some places . I could hardly believe my eyes . I thought ' good God ' . " <p> Bird left his Buxton hotel and struggled to make his way to the The Park , only to be greeted by a thick layer of snow covering the entire ground , the cause of which , the Meteorological Office would later reveal , had been a depression bringing cold air down from the Arctic . <p> " It was impossible to play , and the match was abandoned for the day , " the umpire recalled . " It was amazing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on the Tuesday , the sun shone , and we went on to have the best summer we had ever had . " <p> An overnight thaw enabled play to continue on the Tuesday , but for Derbyshire the damage had already been done , with the drying , soggy wicket virtually unplayable . The hosts were skittled out for just 42 and forced to follow-on . <p> Bird said : " The pitches in those days were uncovered and left to the elements , so Derbyshire had to bat on a snow-affected pitch and they collapsed . The ball was just flying all over the place . I had never seen anything like it in my life . <p> " Ashley Harvey-Walker , who in those days batted for Derbyshire , came in to bat at number five and he said to me ' just hold onto my false teeth for me , because I wo n't be here long ' , and he was n't , as a couple of balls later he was out .

" The food was excellent , all the lunches and the teas were excellent , and they always made sure we had coffee and biscuits when we arrived at the ground . <p> " It is a very pleasant ground , set in beautiful countryside , and I think Derbyshire should return there to play a match .

@@4187239 <h> Do n't have sex with a time-travelling sea monkey <p> Evolutionary ecologists have discovered that having sex with a male sea monkey from the future can be hazardous to a female sea monkey 's health . <p> Nicolas Rode from the Centre for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology took advantage of sea monkeys ' ability to weather droughts by remaining in their eggs for years before hatching once the water returns . He gathered eggs from layers of dirt formed in 1985 , 1996 and 2007 , and then reared them in their lab -- having females mate with males from their own time , as well as from other years . <p> The conclusion was disturbing . The further away in time the male sea monkey was from , the sooner his female sexual partner died . A male from 22 years away ( about 160 generations ) cut short the life of his baby-mother on average by 12 percent . <p> The reason is that male sea monkeys , like the males of many animal species , compete violently over who gets to mate with a particular female . The males evolve all kinds of weaponry to achieve this , from scoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection of " anti-aphrodisiacs " to stop the ladies having any desire to mate further . <p> That 's not good news for the females . From an evolutionary perspective , the health of a single female is completely unimportant to a male , so long as they live long enough to birth another generation of offspring . As a result , some of the weaponry developed by the males can be downright toxic . <p> But the females fight back , evolving antidotes to the males ' weaponry , which then force the males to evolve countermeasures , which in turn makes the females evolve more antidotes , culminating in an escalating arms race of sexual conflict , at least in theory . <p> Unfortunately the data from Rode 's experiment was n't clear-cut enough to determine whether that conflict does indeed escalate indefinitely or whether -- as some evolutionary ecologists suggest -- different sexual weaponry goes in and out of fashion over time , like an evolutionary merry-go-round . <p> Interestingly , too , is that the time-shifting did n't have any measurable impact on the sea monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs at a faster rate to make up for it . <p> But either way , be warned : sex with time travellers appears to be far more dangerous than anyone had previously realised .

Well , I nearly lost a lot more than my shirt to three of them earlier this week -- and that was before I went to Royal Ascot and started betting on also-rans . <p> In all seriousness , I do n't think I 've ever been quite so frightened as I was last Saturday while out walking with our two dogs , Billy ( the Doberman ) and Walter ( the Heinz 57 varieties ) . Batting as a nightwatchman against quick bowlers trying to knock your block off ? Forget it . <p> We were on a footpath , crossing a field , and the dogs were on their leads when these three horses came trotting up . I gave one a friendly pat on the nose to say hello and the next thing I knew he bit my T-shirt on the shoulder , ripping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him over and started going for him with his front legs . I shouted at the horse to try to get him to stop -- and , with that , he kicked out his back legs with his hooves whistling past my nose . Then one of the other horses tried to attack Walter but I had let him off his lead by that stage . He legged it across the field , all three of them decided to chase after him and , thankfully , that gave me and Billy our chance to get out quick . There was a five-foot stile -- and the dog went under while I went over . <p> Fortunately , Walter is a particularly quick runner so he got away as well , leaping straight over the fence without even hesitating , but I can tell you I was still shaking a couple of hours later . <p> I know cows can be tricky , but I 've never before had a problem with horses while out walking , and people I 've spoken to since have told me it is very unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume it was the dogs that upset these three , although we had done nothing whatsoever to spook them . I can tell you I will not forget that Saturday stroll in a hurry , though . <p> If any of those flying hooves had made contact with Billy , I 'm sure he would have been brown bread . And the same probably goes for me . I 'm just thankful I did not have my son , Ernie , or wife , Sarah , with me at the time . <p> 2 . Here 's a tip : do n't take Michael Vaughan 's advice at the races <p> After one close encounter with horses , you might think I should have steered clear of Royal Ascot on Wednesday . But the invitation for Sarah and me to go to the meeting as guests of my old Yorkshire and England team-mate Michael Vaughan was far too good to turn down . <p> Michael was presenting a prize after one of the races , but I have to say that was as close as either of us got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips , I 'd picked up a few but none of them came in . <p> It was all great fun , though -- and , come to think of it , there was a first for me : as far as I can remember it was the first time I had been to a race meeting and actually seen horses . I mean , my previous visits were for stag dos and the like when you tend to make for the bar before the first race and stay there until after the last one . <p> This time , though , we wandered around the parade ring ( with me in my top hat and tails ) , went to the winners ' enclosure and generally enjoyed ourselves mixing with the posh set . We even met Princess Anne , although to be fair she did n't have a huge amount to say to me other than a bit of polite chit-chat . <p> 3 . Aussie whinging is music to my ears but Indians are out of tune <p> And what of cricket , I hear you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as I was telling Princess Anne the other day , we 've hardly played since last week 's column , thanks to some pretty dreadful weather , Still , before we get to Leicestershire 's frustrations , there are a couple of international matters worth mentioning . <p> For a start , how encouraging to hear the Australians ripping into each other , with Simon Katich being particularly scathing about their selectors after they failed to give him another central contract . Something about paying peanuts and getting monkeys , was n't it ? Music to English ears , I reckon , after all those years when all you could hear from Down Under was the sound of Aussie back-slapping . <p> A lot less welcome , though , was India 's announcement that they wo n't allow the Decision Review System to be used when they play in England later this summer . Excuse me , I must be missing something here . I thought it was an International Cricket Council decision to use DRS in all Test cricket , so how can India go against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As far as I 'm concerned , any system that means fewer mistakes are made , and more correct decisions are reached , must be good .

Plenty of rain means Twenty20 campaign is a bit pointless <p> It would be nice at this point to be able to review our home T20 Cup matches against Notts and Warwickshire , but there is not a great deal to talk about . Both of them fell foul of the rain with not even a single ball bowled in the Warwickshire match . <p> Thanks to insurance cover , the financial cost of losing those games to the weather should not be too great .

They have spent a lot of money on the ground but it has been used to produce a terrific venue which is a credit to Hampshire and to their chairman , Rod Bransgrove . And from a player 's point of view , you can not fault it , what with the excellent practice facilities and terrific changing rooms . I do realise that not everyone will welcome the fact that there are now nine Test match venues spread across England and Wales . And I appreciate it can be difficult for the ECB to decide who gets what games and when . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fairly simple and certainly not come down to any kind of bidding war .

I 'm a class act at interviewing as Ernie 's school eye director of sport <p> Apart from the experiences , both good and scary , already mentioned , I chalked up another first this week -- and that was through being asked to sit on an interview panel at Ernie 's school , Ratcliffe College . <p> They are looking to fill the post of acting director of sport . Now I reckon I 'm a tougher interviewee than interviewer but candidates for the Ratcliffe job must have found the atmosphere quite intense because there were seven of us on the panel with plenty of awkward questions being fired . <p> And our verdict ?

Talking about the futures of people who are your friends and your team-mates is perhaps the trickiest part of the captain 's job , but you have to accept it goes with the territory . <p> The way I rationalise it is by reminding myself that I have to make decisions based on cricketing matters while leaving financial affairs to those responsible for money matters .

@@4188234 <h> Britain : The most indebted nation on Earth <p> Lord Stevenson of Balmacara tells Julian Knight that the Consumer Credit Counselling Service expects to see lots more families in trouble <p> Saturday 18 June 2011 23:00 BST <p> A trillion and a half is such a big a number that most people probably would n't even try getting their heads around it . <p> But that is the total level of personal debt owed by the 50 million or so British adults . Per head of population , it qualifies us for the dubious honour of the most indebted nation on earth . Most think it 's a mess , two decades at least in the gestation that we have n't even come close to tackling yet . But who is meant to be clearing up this mess ? Step forward Lord Stevenson of Balmacara , the new chairman of the country 's biggest debt charity , the Consumer Credit Counselling Service ( CCCS ) . <p> A quick glance at Lord Stevenson 's CV meets the old Denis Healey test that all public figures should have a " hinterland " . The 64-year-old Oxford-educated life peer was director of the British Film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progressive think tank the Smith Institute . He is governor of his local school as well as Chiltern Way , a Buckinghamshire federation of secondary schools for boys with special educational needs . And from 2008 he was an adviser to the former prime minister , Gordon Brown . <p> In his new role at the CCCS , the lord certainly has his work cut out . " From the moment I walked into our call centre I could sense a real buzz of advisers helping people make big changes with their lives . On one call , I listened to someone with ? 46,000 of debt spread across 12 different lenders , " he says . " Such multiple debt problems create real crisis points ; the lenders do n't know about each other and go shouting for their debt . People need someone to draw all these creditors together and act as a free , impartial intermediary with the creditors and that 's our role . " <p> And it 's busy work : the CCCS gets a staggering 416,000 cries for help with debts each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You come to us with your debt problem and then we recommend a course of action to the creditors , whom we have dealt with for many years , like a hospital referral . It tends to be the case that you get better treatment if you have someone working on your behalf than if you take a case-by-case approach to the lenders . " <p> Meanwhile , the fee-charging debt management industry is being radically overhauled by the Office of Fair Trading . " The OFT is doing a terrific job with its guidelines ( issued last Tuesday ) to these firms and for getting rid of some firms which were acting to the detriment of consumers . " <p> But with interest rate rises likely later this year , if not next , the CCCS could be getting a lot busier and Lord Stevenson 's prognosis is not a happy one . " I am relatively gloomy for the prospects two years down the line . This recession is proving a real grind and it 's too early to say if we have entered a Japanese style ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates rise . The first is families with small children , and then there are parts of the north that are struggling . " <p> As for Ed Miliband 's " squeezed middle " , this is a reality . " Our research shows a lot of people coming to us who are in their late forties or fifties who would normally be in a decent position as they 're homeowners . But for any number of reasons -- ill health , relationship breakdown , job loss -- this is the group struggling with debt often for the first time . " <p> One area of increasing concern to the CCCS is the number of enquiries relating to energy prices , what with the announcement that Scottish Power was to raise its gas prices by a shocking 18 per cent . " You ai n't seen anything yet in terms of gas and electricity rises . It 's yet another pressure we are seeing reflected through our debt calls . The role it plays in debt is only going to increase . " The other hot debt topic is student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought through the implications of loading such huge debts on to the shoulders of the young . <p> But all is not doom and gloom ; there are signs that after the credit splurge of the past decade or so , Britons are taking a more sensible approach . " The average debt of a CCCS client was ? 28,000 a couple of years ago . Now it 's ? 21,000 , which shows that slowly but surely people are paying down what they owe . People do learn lessons . If you get into difficulty , you 're not going to go out the instant you 're free and pile the credit back on . Credit is actually a good thing . It allows us to live our lives to the full . " However , credit at rates in the hundreds or even thousands of per cent is not such a good thing . " Government has to decide whether or not there should be a cap on interest rates , while also ensuring that the more unsavoury elements such as the illegal money lenders are put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of which charge over 4,000 per cent APR ) there are better ways of financing yourself than them . " <p> But what about that ? 1.5trn pile of debt ? As a former Brown adviser , does Lord Stevenson feel that New Labour got it badly wrong ? " No one saw this thing coming . It 's all very good to be wise after the event . Firstly the seeds of the credit boom were sown long before the Brown or Blair premierships and this is not a British problem . This is something that happened worldwide . " Whoever is to blame , the likes of the CCCS and Lord Stevenson are now left picking up the pieces .

For others , it 's not : it 's the result of a campaign to create a word . The distinction -- however subtle -- has sparked weeks of controversy among the core contributors to Wikipedia , the " free encyclopedia anyone can edit " . If you find this hard to believe , you 've never been to Wikiland -- and you 've never Googled " Rick Santorum " . <p> Famously , Rick Santorum -- the former Pennsylvania Senator and a Republican candidate for president of the United States -- has a Google problem . But he also has a Wikipedia problem . And the two go hand-in-hand . <h> Spreading Santorum <p> In 2003 , against the backdrop of a landmark Supreme Court case concerning a state sodomy law , Santorum told the Associated Press that gay sex could " undermine the fabric of our society " , comparing it to polygamy , incest , and adultery .

The winning entry was none too subtle , equating the Senator 's name with " the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex " . Savage promoted the definition at spreadingsantorum.com , and as an army of supporters clicked on and linked to the site , it soon rose to the top of Google 's results page for searches on " Rick Santorum " . <p> The senator had been " Google bombed " -- and quite successfully .

It was part of the campaign . Santorum was n't just Google bombed . He was Wikibombed . And since Google affords such high rankings to Wikipedia articles , one played into the other . <p> Over the years , many Wikifiddlers objected to the article , but it survived . And in recent weeks , as the satirical American news program The Daily Showrevisited Santorum 's Google problem and the article was significantly expanded to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a boil . <h> Neologism ? Or coatrack ? <p> For some , the article was nothing more than a political stunt . " We have , I think , a novel problem , " said one fiddler .

" <p> Wikipedia watcher and former Guardian columnist Seth Finkelstein agrees . " It 's the next level of Google-bombing , " he tells The Register . " Earlier attempts were exploiting weaknesses in search algorithms . This tactic is finding a site with a very high Google rank , such as Wikipedia , and manipulating its rules . " In Wikiland , there 's even a word for it : a ' ' coatrack ' ' . <p> Dan Savage <p> " A coatrack article is a Wikipedia article that ostensibly discusses the nominal subject , but in reality is a cover for a tangentially related biased subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an empty coat-rack , which ends up being mostly obscured by the ' coats ' .

" <p> But for others , the " Santorum ( neologism ) " article was n't a coatrack . They argued that over the years , santorum had indeed morphed into a word and that the Savage campaign itself was noteworthy enough to merit its own Wikipedia article . In addition to coverage in various news outlets , the American Dialect Society selected santorum as the Most Outrageous Word of the Year ( PDF ) for 2004 , and it had turned up in multiple works of fiction . <p> " Any residents not burned alive in the fires or drowned in the flood will be made to drink a mixture of bodily fluids typically deposited in on the streets during Mardi Gras until death , " reads Austen James ' Hate Starve Curse ( Broken Science Press ) .

" This will mean that we - again properly - retitle the article even while keeping a well-sourced description of the incident , making it clear to the reader that this is *not* a genuine word that has come up organically from people 's speech patterns , but a google-bomb attack that worked .

Very little has changed . The article is still just as high on Google 's results pages ( under an earlier title , " Santorum Google problem " ) . And it 's still very much a part of Rick Santorum 's Google problem . <p> Seth Finkelstein argues that despite his own personal views , such articles should be squashed . " I should disclaim that I find Rick Santorum 's political positions to be reprehensible , and I sympathize with the feelings behind the actions against him .

@@4190239 <h> Pure by Andrew Miller : review <h> A Paris cemetery is the perfect setting for the Gothic delights of Andrew Miller 's Pure , says Freya Johnston . <p> By the end of the 14th century Les Innocents , the oldest Christian burial ground in central Paris , was full . All four sides were lined with galleried charnel-houses , storing the bones of cadavers removed from the soil . Once emptied , a pit with room for 1,500 bodies would be filled up again . In a single month , 50,000 plague victims were buried there . <p> Pure by Andrew Miller <p> Over the years , the cemetery metamorphosed into a series of greasy , rancid tussocks , the ground incapable of further decomposition . Sanitary conditions in the surrounding area were intolerable . In 1763 , locals reported to inspectors that their meat rotted in minutes , tapestries changed colour when exposed to the air and wine left in cellars turned to vinegar . The city was being poisoned . <p> A series of decrees limiting use of the cemetery did little to alleviate the situation . In 1780 , a cellar wall in a house bordering Les Innocents collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putrid , infected mud . A royal edict finally put a stop to all interments . It was determined that three large burial grounds would be created on the outskirts of the city : Montmartre , P ? re Lachaise , and Passy ( Montparnasse was a later addition ) . All existing parish cemeteries within city limits were condemned . In 1785 , the king declared Les Innocents the site of a future herb and vegetable market . <p> It is at this point , more or less , that the action of Andrew Miller 's latest novel begins . A young engineer from the provinces , Jean-Baptiste Baratte -- well educated , ambitious , socially raw and with uncertain leadership qualities -- is summoned to Versailles and offered a commission he can not refuse . He must eliminate Les Innocents : dismantle the church , destroy the cemetery , dispose of its jumbled , anonymous , piecemeal occupants . As he and his team of Flemish miners uncover the nameless dead , Baratte 's identity is itself almost snuffed out by the gruesome realities of his task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead are appallingly different from us , the true horror lies in their proximity to the living . Just as he thinks walls and boundaries have been secured , they give way ; as edifices fall down , characters disintegrate ; words vanish and friendships dissolve . <p> Sex and death are close relations ; Baratte visits a brothel and marvels at a prostitute displayed in a translucent shroud . In one of the most vividly realised of many Gothic moments , the bodies of two beautiful young women are discovered in a mass grave , perfectly intact , " like a pair of dried flowers " . The onlookers ' initial reactions of fear and awe give way to scientific curiosity and then something more prurient , with terrible consequences . <p> Pure is mercifully free of franglais ; in fact , other than the names of places and people , there is barely any French in this book .

@@4192231 and None , By Clare Morgan <p> The art of parallel narratives is one that thrives on juxtaposition , but here 's a trio I would never have expected to see : Virginia Woolf , stumbling on the inspiration for To the Lighthouse in a Pembrokeshire village in 1908 ; the violence of the post-war insurgency in Iraq ; and Friedrich Nietzsche in Orta in Italy in 1882 , goatishly stroking his moustaches over Louise von Salom ? , the young Russian with whom he became briefly infatuated . <p> What links these disparate events is a pair of academics : middle-aged Beatrice Kopus ( a Woolf scholar ) and the older Raymond Greatorex ( Nietzsche ) . Beatrice seeks out Raymond for help substantiating her hunch that Salom ? , who danced a little around the fringes of the Bloomsbury Group , might have instilled some Nietzschean philosophy in her subject .

@@4201230 <h> Against <p> The Sony Ericsson Neo ( and QWERTY packing Pro ) models did n't get nearly the attention that was afforded to the Xperia Arc and the Xperia Play upon launch . While those other models are more distinct in their offering , the Xperia Neo lands on our review desk as something of A N Other Android device . It packs in some respectable specs , but with Sony Ericsson continuing to expand their line-up of Android handsets , are they now spreading themselves too thin ? <h> Design <p> Part of the reason that Sony Ericsson have so many phones is probably down to the move from feature phones to Android smartphones . The Xperia Neo is every bit the evolution of the Vivaz , which Sony Ericsson pushed as a video device back in early 2010 . The same ethos of " human design " can be found in the Neo , and like the Vivaz , we found it 's curved back great for placing down on a table and spinning the phone . <p> Aside from the opportunity this presents to play spin the bottle , it means it nestles down nicely into the palm of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xperia Neo feels decidedly compact , easily fitting into smaller hands . It still offers you a 3.7-inch screen in a body that measures 116 x 57 x 13mm , although it is n't the slimmest or most elegant phone around . <p> It is finished in plastics , so lacks the wow factor of something like the HTC Desire S , which might be a natural rival to the Neo , but it feels solid enough . The glossy plastic finish means that it is prone to fingerprints . Sony Ericsson have chosen to cover the micro HDMI and Mini-USB ports on the top of the device with little flaps . It helps keep them free from debris , but the USB cover soon becomes irritating each time you want to plug it in to charge . We managed to get through most days on a single charge , which is better than some phones . <p> Otherwise you have the common arrangement of three hard buttons beneath the screen offering back , home and menu options , whilst the remainder of the hard controls run down the right-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standby button , volume and a dedicated camera key . <h> What 's inside ? <p> In terms of positioning , the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo rolls out with a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8255 chipset and 512MB RAM , meaning this is a relatively powerful device , sitting just under the latest single and dual core devices we 've seen this year . It 's the same configuration as the Xperia Arc , so the experience is comparable . <p> That means that in use the Xperia Neo is slick and fast in its handling of the Android 2.3.3 ( at the time of writing ) , although as with other Sony Ericsson devices , it has been heavily skinned , so much of the Android look and feel has been tinkered with . You also do n't quite get the snap that the dual core devices now offer , however a touch of lag opening apps is acceptable as the experience seems stable enough throughout . <p> In the grand scheme of things , Sony Ericsson 's customisation sits somewhere between HTC and Samsung . Superficially Sony Ericsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as encompassing , or accomplished , as HTC Sense . At the same time , it goes further than Samsung 's TouchWiz interface which is a relatively light touch , and as a result it sits in a sort of user interface wilderness , with many of the changes seemingly made to continue the look and feel found in Sony Ericsson 's phones of old . It does n't always feel as sophisticated as some rivals , but it works well enough , with the odd nice feature , like the widget overview . <p> In terms of calling , we had no problem with the Xperia Neo : calls came across loud and clear and the external speaker offers up plenty of volume . Storage comes in on the light side , with the reported 1GB of internal memory mostly used up , offering you 320MB spare . The microSD card slot will support cards up to 32GB , pretty much essential if you plan to carry any media around with you . <h> Facebook inside your Xperia <p> Sony Ericsson recently made a point of highlighting the integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adds functionality to their social network aggregating Timescape app that we 've been calling for from its first inception on the Xperia X10 . On another plane , it adds a range of functions that make Facebook more deeply integrated . <p> Overall we like the new additions in this area , including your Facebook albums slotting into the Gallery , lock screen Facebook notifications , the ability to Like music or photos and more Facebook information in your contacts . In a way it 's as much a reaction to the deeper Facebook integration of the INQ Cloud Touch or HTC Salsa as anything else . <p> One new and unique app is a Media Discovery app , which scours Facebook for " media " shared by your friends . It 's an interesting time-filler , giving you neat links to the sharing source for that media . In our case we found that everything had come from Spotify or YouTube , with the respective app opening to play ( Spotify you 'd have to install and have a subscription for ) . <p> If Facebook is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then things are better now . But if you 're a Twitter user then you still have a gaping black hole : although Timescape will feed you Twitter updates in tiles , when you press to read the whole of the update , it takes you through to the Twitter mobile site . We 'll bet our shirts that Sony Ericsson soon announces that Twitter is living inside your Xperia too . <p> A quick dive into the Android Market , which will supply you with an increasingly competitive run of apps , and you 'll find that Sony Ericsson have some of their own available . One is the LinkedIn integration for Timescape , adding an extra string to its bow . Another worth looking at is their Life Contacts beta , which creates a neat people widget around common contacts . <h> Media madness <p> Sony have n't had a great time of things recently following the high-profile hacks on their PlayStation Network . One of the affected services was their music service Qriocity , a link for which can be found in the menu , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique to Sony Ericsson as you can download it on other Android devices too . <p> Sony Ericsson 's Music player is reasonable but feels as though it misses out on the more important features . It offers you a content search ( via the infinity button , also found elsewhere in the phone ) , which will let you find related content online , essentially on YouTube . However , you do n't get lockscreen controls for music , or controls from the notification bar , surprising from a company that made such great Walkman phones in the past . <p> Videos are served up in the Gallery and Facebook videos are pulled down if you have any . Ironically , the phone wo n't play Facebook videos out of the box , which feels like something of an oversight . Video format support is n't that wide either , struggling to tackle many of our regular test videos . It had no problem with common SD MPEG4 files , but the likes of DivX are n't catered for from the off . <p> There is a Media Server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no streaming option , so you ca n't collect content you might have sitting on a PC or home server . We easily stepped round this using Skifta , but it 's a feature we 'd expect Sony Ericsson to build in : after all , HTC , Samsung and LG all do , and this phone is powerful enough to handle it . <p> The display sees the Mobile Bravia Engine option which claims to enhance performance . In our tests we could see little real difference , but one thing we did notice was that the Neo misses out on auto brightness option common on Android phones and a power-saving favourite . <p> But that 's not the biggest problem we have with the display . As mentioned it is 3.7-inches , with a resolution of 854 x 480 , giving it a 16:9 aspect and a pixel density of 264ppi . This is all great , but the display does look a little yellow to our eyes , not giving you the brilliant white clarity you 'll find elsewhere . When displaying whites the pixel lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 'd want it to be . <p> The screen does n't give you as much space for browsing the Internet , but it 's a respectable enough browser overall . The keyboard in portrait feels a little cramped and the run of alternative characters accessed through a long press of each key are a little too exotic : we ca n't see many native English users needing many of these accented key options . A third party keyboard , such as SwiftKey , will give you a much more convenient solution . <h> Caught on film <p> Having mentioned the Vivaz earlier - one of the first mobile phones to offer 720p video capture - we 're expecting a lot from the Xperia Neo when it comes to the cameras . Around the back there is an 8-megapixel camera with a single LED " flash " and on the front there is the typical camera offering VGA video from a fixed focus unit . <p> Sony Ericsson have completely restyled the camera interface and added a couple of nice features into the mix . There are touch controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dedicated button on top ) although the majority of options are accessed via the menu button . These options cover major settings , but Sony Ericsson have n't stepped out and added any fun features , which this camera is crying out for . <p> But what you do get is good . The Exmor R sensor that Sony Ericsson headline is capable of capturing some cracking daylight shots . Low light shooting is marred by noise as you 'd expect and the flash does n't effectively give you any range in low light . With autofocus and auto scene selection it will do everything for you , but occasionally we found that the scene selection makes an odd choice , resulting in a photo that does n't quite look authentic . <p> But outside of that , detail is good and it is capable of offering some great colours . There is a smile shot option - great for kids - and a touch focusing option which helps get things just so when it comes to composition . <p> Video maxes out at 1280 x 720 pixel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't match your camcorder , but we found the results look good enough when played back through that HDMI port ( which mirrors the phone on the connected screen ) . Focusing in-video is continuous but is slow , which has both pros and cons - someone walking in front of the camera wo n't shift the focus , but point it at something new and it takes a while to sharpen up again . <h> Verdict <p> Sony Ericsson struggled with Android devices in 2010 , but their 2011 efforts look more promising . But we step away from the Xperia Neo thinking that things have moved on a little too fast . We like the Xperia Arc a lot , but it wo n't compete with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S II or the HTC Sensation at the top of the pile . We like the Xperia Neo , but it does n't feel as sophisticated as the HTC Desire S or , more worryingly , phones like last year 's original Samsung Galaxy S. <p> It 's a powerful enough handset , slotting somewhere into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will serve many well , but given the huge number of phones on offer , you have to be drawn to the features it offers : HDMI output , an up-to-date version of Android , a capable camera and reasonable battery life . <p> But we 'd choose the larger Xperia Arc every time when opting for a Sony Ericsson handset . The larger , better , screen makes it a better browsing device , and the design is something to be admired . That leaves the Xperia Neo somewhere in the wilderness . It is n't a bad phone , but it does n't scream out to us either . <p> Chris sits in the Editor 's chair , guiding the good ship Pocket-lint through the tumultuous seas of an ever-changing world of tech .

Amid glossy ads and countless images of women in varying degrees of Japanese attire and undress ( plus one of Puccini at his dapper Italian best ) there appears Manet 's 1868 painting of Emile Zola . The eminent author , surrounded by references to all things japonais , could hardly look more French , from ample moustache to striped trouser . It 's a subtle illustration of nineteenth-century French art 's relationship to its favourite Other : East meets West in a gilded frame .

The basic elements of Christian Fenouillat 's set designs -- screens for walls , mostly bare interior , a low table , the odd floor cushion -- are also familiar . Except that here the screens wind up and down as though setting up a Powerpoint presentation , and reveal a series of changing vistas , some more successful than others . <p> The opening antique photo of Nagasaki Bay provided the most thought-provoking moment ; but the revelation of florist 's arrangements for Suzuki 's and Cio-Cio-San 's Act II petal-gathering -- with screens rising and falling furiously ( and noisily ) to let the two women in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably unintentional ) visual comedy . Even Christophe Forey 's lighting designs , attractive enough in the big love duet and for Butterfly 's vigil ( who , after all , can resist a starlit backdrop ? ) , nonetheless failed to provide either imaginative visual spectacle or intelligently ironic comment . <p> In places the musical performance suffered from a similar malaise . Small but all-too-frequent divergences between stage and pit were symptomatic of a more general lack of commitment from the ROH Orchestra under Andris Nelsons . Sheer richness of tone could n't disguise ragged phrasing and imprecise woodwind tuning . Adding to the orchestra 's problems was the miscasting of James Valenti in the great mouth-and-trousers role of Pinkerton : he certainly wore his suit with the all-American panache of an ex-high-school jock , but his voice was puny by comparison . Even with the orchestra ramped down -- providing a cold shower for some of Puccini 's most passionate outpourings -- Valenti 's light and otherwise enjoyable tenor struggled to be heard . <p> The other singers generally fared better .

She demonstrated huge stamina and extraordinary control over the extremes of dynamics and tone ; but some of those extremes were nonetheless pushed too far -- perhaps the product of the same vein of directorial ambivalence towards the positioning of Japan .

This is Phlomis russeliana -- a herbaceous perennial form of the more familiar shrubby Phlomis fruticosa , which is also known as Jerusalem sage ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pom-poms " ( known in the trade as " whorls " -- in case Margaret feels the need to sound horticultural ) , will open into lovely creamy yellow flowers . <p> If not cut down in autumn the flower stems and seed-heads make wonderful winter garden " structure " , particularly when tinged with frost . <p> This is a plant that sometimes takes two or three years to get into full swing ( which may be why Margaret 's plant has only just started to flower this year ) and then it becomes a bit of a spreader . <p> Future maintenance ? At the end of the winter the old flower stems can be cut down and handfuls of the disintegrating foliage from the previous year gently yanked out . This is a plant that needs no staking or feeding and , apart from the spring cleanup , thrives on neglect . In smaller spaces it will need to be split every three years or so to limit its spread . <p> June Stapleton asks if it is appropriate to apply the " Chelsea chop " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely plant ( also known as Russian sage , but like the Phlomis above , not a true sage ) , is best cut back hard to a low woody framework just above its lowest buds in late spring . It is quite a good idea , also , to have another go at it later . It will then go on to produce more numerous , although somewhat less majestic , flower spires on a more compact plant . <p> This is a sub-shrub whose natural habitat is the arid hillsides of Asia Minor , and it has a tendency to become unattractively floppy in our rich soil and cool , relatively short summers . If cut back as late as this , rather than at the traditional Chelsea chop time of late May , it is best not to be too radical , or it will simply not have time to produce enough regrowth to flower before early autumn .

@@4201236 best-known gay porn producer and director in the United States and a columnist for The Advocate . Now a US citizen , he was born in Russia to Jewish parents and has written before about gay rights in Israel . <p> England loves its monuments . There is Stonehenge , the great cathedrals , the pubs , the Queen -- and there is Peter Tatchell . He bestrides the world like an ancient colonialist , telling other countries and people how they ought to behave . He goes to Moscow and protests the government for forbidding Gay Pride . And then he does n't go to Israel , which just held yet another of the world 's most vibrant and festive Gay Pride celebrations , but protests if people want to hold a meeting there . Logic and consistency are n't his strong suit . <p> Peter 's latest target is IGLYO -- the International Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender and Queer Lesbian Youth and Student Organization , which decided to accept an invitation from its Israeli chapter to hold its general assembly in Tel Aviv . IGLYO is an international umbrella organisation of youth and student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter to deal with specific issues around the emancipation of gay youth . The decision to meet in Israel was ratified by a vote of IGLYO 's members ( something Peter does n't not tell us ) -- 55 per cent of member organisations in favour , 25 per cent abstains and only 20 per cent against . If that is n't a clear democratic decision I do n't know what is . <p> But Peter , and the usual gaggle of anti-Israel fanatics , disagree . <p> Peter fears that Israel may not be accessible to delegations from Arab countries . But the General Assembly is a meeting of representatives of IGLYO 's member organisations and there is not a single member from the Arab world -- and only one from a Muslim country , Pakistan . ( Short exercise in independent thinking : Why might that be ? ) I have it on good authority that the Israeli government ( and of course the entire Israeli gay community ) will bend over backwards to facilitate the attendance of of any member who wants to attend . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is a mantra of anti-Israel activists : " Human rights are universal and indivisible . " On the surface , that 's hard to argue with . But the way he and the anti-Israel lobby use this argument is manipulative and insidious . They deploy it as a smokescreen behind which everything that 's good about Israel and everything that 's problematic about Middle Eastern ( and particularly Palestinian ) society disappears into some mushy notion of " universal solidarity " . And so any praise of Israel and any criticism of other Middle Eastern countries is branded " politically incorrect " . <p> The anti-Israel clique has developed a completely new use of the concepts of human rights and universal solidarity : Only for them does " solidarity " require complete blackwashing of one party and whitewashing of the other . Think the unthinkable -- an imaginary Iranian youth organisation would invite IGLYO for a meeting in Tehran . Would you call for a boycott ? No , you would n't ? Of course you would n't . There , you see -- you are developing a canon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsavoury regimes get a hallpass . <p> Peter tries to deepen his point by linking it to an argument that 's become another calling card of anti-Israeli activists : the analogy between Israel and South Africa under apartheid . It 's an accusation that the anti-Israel lobby constantly repeats -- but it does n't become any truer by repetition . Anybody who compares the situation of Arab citizens of Israel to SA apartheid -- or , even more stupidly , the situation in the occupied territories to the systematic exploitation of the majority by a small white elite -- is simply whitewashing the horrors of apartheid . Peter was there . He should know . It 's particularly disappointing to hear him of all people spout this non-sense . <p> He undermines his own point from another direction . He presents the alliance between the ANC and local and international LGBT groups during the fight for SA liberation as an example of how , in the good old days , LGBT groups respected the indivisibility of human rights . He conveniently forgets to mention that the white SA regime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to eight years and the SA army practised conversion therapy with gay recruits well into the eighties . LGBT South Africans joined the resistance because they , too , were oppressed and shared objective interests with the ANC and others in the broader emancipation of all SA . And international LGBT groups , correctly , supported them . That 's quite different from the situation around Israel and Palestine where mostly outside activists without any direct connection to either side of the conflict try to bully the world into following a Palestinian agenda ( we all know that " the " Palestinian agenda does n't exist ) . That 's not solidarity , that 's pure colonialism . And , for our community , a betrayal of who should be our closest friends an allies -- Israeli LGBT activists . <p> Israel has created a uniquely nurturing environment for its LGBT community . If you portray this as a propaganda trick , you forget how difficult it has been and still is to establish true LGBT equality -- anywhere in the world . No , the achievements of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Israel was pink long before this term entered the vocabulary . The full emancipation of its LGBT community is a major achievement of Israeli civil society . <p> Obviously , that 's an inconvenient fact for Peter and co in their relentless drive to delegitimise Israel . But it 's a fact nonetheless and Peter betrays the international gay community by once gain deploying the smoke screen . Israeli activists are rightly proud of their achievements -- and international LGBT activists must respect and celebrate these achievements , quite separate from any concerns they might have about other aspects of Israeli policies . Israel is a beacon of LGBT emancipation in an area that 's a very dark corner for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters . If we care about gays and lesbians in the Middle East , we must let this beacon shine as a vibrant example of how their life could be and as an inspiration for them to fight for change in their own societies . <p> I salute IGLYO for its decision to meet in Tel Aviv and I admire it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Speaking on BBC News , Grant said McMullen , a former NOTW journalist , confessed to him over a pint in the pub about phone hacking at the paper after he confronted him , complaining that his voicemail had been accessed . He said the interview formed the basis of an article he wrote for the New Statesman . <p> Asked what McMullen said , Grant replied : <p> How extensive and what an industrial scale it went on at the News of the World , particularly under Andy Coulson How money regularly passed hands between News International and officers at the Metropolitan police . I asked him , ' do you think the News of the World hacked the phones of family and friends of the little girls murdered in Soham ' , and he said ' yes , I think that almost certainly happened ' . <p> 16.59 Hugh Grant says he has been called as a witness by police in the hacking scandal . <p> 16.57 Paul Dadge , the firefighter who was on the front page of most newspapers in the aftermath of 7/7 after he was photographed helping a wounded woman , is the latest figure alleged to have had his voicemail hacked by the News of the World . He said : <p> I 'm disappointed , very very disappointed on a personal level to be honest . I have always co-operated with the media in anything they wanted and now to find they might have violated my personal life , it 's not nice . <p> We started off with the allegations that celebrities had had their phones hacked and when we started talking about Milly Dowler 's family having their phones hacked , in the back of my head I did start to think if they 're looking at Milly Dowler 's phone they could be looking at people who were involved in 7/7 . <p> As soon as I heard said last night that those involved in 7/7 were involved I started to get paranoid . I suddenly thought they might have got my phone , it 's not a nice feeling . <p> I know the kind of media pressure that was around making stories about 7/7 and the difficulties of getting hold of relatives of people who were classed as missing at that point . <p> The girl in the photo , Davinia Turrell , because she was n't talking to the press , they tried to get at her through me . I would n't say I 'm worried as there were n't any emotional messages for me on my phone . <p> 16.48 Geoffrey Robertson QC suggests that claiming the PCC is a useful and impartial regulator a " fraud on the public " . " What justification can there be for tapping the phone of a murdered girl 's father ? " he asks . " It 's filthy , filthy behaviour . " <p> Former NotW journalist Paul McMullen , continuing his efforts to defend the indefensible , says that phone tapping has only been illegal since 1998 . " Twelve years is long enough for journalists to learn the law " , sniffs Robertson . <p> 16.47 Christopher Hope writes from the Houses of Parliament : <p> Key question from afternoon lobby to the Prime Minister 's spokesman . What assurances did Andy Coulson give David Cameron when he was hired to be his communications chief ? Prime Minister 's official spokesman says : " The Prime Minister was given assurances that he accepted . He did a very good job . " Yes , but now Mr Coulson is accused of criminality . The spokesman added : " There is now a police investigation under way -- we should let the police get on with it . " <p> 16.41 On the BBC , Geoffrey Robertson QC haughtily points out to those who have said otherwise that not only is paying a police officer for information illegal , it has been so for 110 years . He describes the police inquiry of 2003 as " totally incompetent " . He says that a public inquiry is needed , because otherwise it would be the police investigating police , and " if there 's one thing we know does n't work , it 's the police investigating the police " . He says that the various MPs arguing that a public inquiry can not get under way while the police investigation is in progress are simply wrong . <p> " We have to be careful about saying it only happened in the 1980s " , he goes on , in response to another interviewee who suggests that the industry has cleaned itself up in recent years . " That 's what the Catholic Church said about paedophile priests . " <p> 16.39 Here 's Mr Murdoch 's statement in full : <p> Recent allegations of phone hacking and making payments to police with respect to the News of the World are deplorable and unacceptable . <p> I have made clear that our company must fully and proactively cooperate with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah Brooks ' leadership . <p> We are committed to addressing these issues fully and have taken a number of important steps to prevent them from happening again . <p> I have also appointed Joel Klein to provide important oversight and guidance and Joel and Viet Dinh , an independent director , are keeping News Corporation 's board fully advised as well . <p> 16.30 Paul McMullen , former NOTW reporter , tells BBC news it is offensive that the paper 's former editor and deputy editor ( Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson ) are denying any knowledge of phone hacking on their watch . <p> 16.28 News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch has given a statement saying allegations that staff at the News of the World hacked phones and paid police were " deplorable and unacceptable " . He backed Rebekah Brooks to continue as News International chief executive . <p> Rupert Murdoch <p> 16.23 Hugh Grant is on BBC News engaging in an on-air scrap with Paul McMullen , a former News of the World journalist from whom the actor claims he learned the extent of phone hacking at the NOTW . More on this very soon . Suffice to say , the exchanges are heated and really quite entertaining . <p> 16.16 Paul Farrelly has joined in , saying that the allegations are " likely to be the tip of an iceberg " and that the former DPP , Ken Macdonald ( now Lord Macdonald ) should examine his conscience now that he has gone to work for News International . <p> 16.12 Adrian Sanders , a backbencher talking in the Commons debate , describes the PCC as " about as much use as a fishnet condom or a chocolate teapot " and says " when Andy Hayman was chief of the Met , there was an air of Inspector Clouseau about it " . <p> 15.49 One of the most amusing quotes of the day , at the expense of News International , came from Labour MP Frank Dobson during the Commons debate - all made possible by Parliamentary Privilege . <p> Were News International , with their record of wrongdoing they have admitted so far , to apply to run a minicab firm in London they would not receive a licence . If they 're not fit and proper people to run a minicab firm , how can they be a fit and proper outfit to take over a whole television company ? <p> 15.47 We now have some video footage of Chris Bryant 's demands for Rebekah Brooks to resign . See below : <p> Labour MP Tom Watson calls for the head of Rupert Murdoch 's son James , who is now based in New York . He tells MPs in the House of Commons : <p> The whole board of News International is responsible for this company . I believe that Mr James Murdoch should be suspended from office while the police now investigate what I believe was his personal authorisation to plan a cover-up of this scandal . James Murdoch is the chairman . It is clear now that he personally and without board approval authorised money to be paid by his company to silence people who have been hacked and to cover up criminal behaviour within his organisation . This is nothing short of an attempt to pervert the course of justice . <p> 15.38 Harry Wallop , our Consumer Affairs Editor , raises the interesting point that a number of companies who advertise in News International publications appear to be using the scandal to garner good publicity , without incurring any costs . <p> Debenhams , for instance , has said : " We have no immediate plans to advertise with the News of the World " . But on closer questioning the department store company said it was not going to advertise with the paper this weekend in any case , and had nothing planned for a month or two . <p> Butlins , too , said : " We review all our sources of advertising regularly and we will not be advertising in the News of the World this weekend " . But a spokesman refused to say whether the holiday company had any adverts booked in the paper or not . <p> 15.31 BSkyB shares recorded a drop during Prime Minister 's Questions , hitting 830p as Ed Miliband pushed for the Competition Commission to examine the News Corp bid . <p> 15.24 Tom Watson has been vitriolic about the phone hacking saga from the outset and showed no sign of letting up when he joined the Commons debate . He dismissed Rebekah Brooks 's pleas of ignorance : <p> News International has entered the criminal underworld . Rebekah Brooks was not only responsible for wrongdoing , but I believe she knew about it . The story of Rebekah Brooks being far from events is simply not believable . Her culpability goes beyond blame , it is about direct knowledge of unlawful behaviour . Yet the chief suspect has become the chief investigator . MPs have an over-familiar relationship with Rupert Murdoch 's newspaper group and that has to stop . <p> 15.18 If the numbers are anything to go by , then the hacking scandal is hurting News Corporation . Shares were down 2.4 per cent on NASDAQ opening , following the latest claims . <p> 15.12The Guardian is reporting that News International intends to try to take the heat off Rebekah Brooks by claiming that the then editor of the NOTW was on holiday when Milly Dowler 's mobile phone was hacked . <p> The Guardian understands that the company has established that Brooks , News of the World editor from May 2000 until January 2003 , was on holiday in Italy when the paper ran a story which referred to a message that had been left on the teenager 's phone . News International also believes Brooks was also away in the two weeks following the murder of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham . That is likely to focus attention on Andy Coulson , who was Brook 's deputy at the time , and would normally have edited the paper in her absence . <p> Rebekah Brooks <p> 15.07 Chris Bryant said earlier in his Commons speech that the police and press had become too close . He said of the Met : <p> It pains me to say this but I think the honest truth is a lot of lies have been told to a lot of people . When police officers tell lies , or at least half-truths to ministers of the Crown and then Parliament ends up being misled , I think that is a major constitutional issue for us to face . I hope there will end up being a full investigation into that element and we will come to the truth . But at the moment what hangs around is a very dirty smell and we need the Metropolitan Police to be trusted , not just in London but across the whole of the United Kingdom and that 's why we need to fight for this . <p> Time for a third inquiry into the hacking claims . Keith Vaz , the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs select committee , tells MPs in the Commons that he has discussed with John Whittingdale , the Tory chairman of the Culture , Media and Sport committee , about organising a joint committee into the hacking allegations . <p> 14.55 Chris Hope has been to a Downing Street briefing , where he has learned that David Cameron feels two new inquiries into phone hacking are needed . <p> So what 's next ? Downing sources say that , by lunchtime today , Prime Minister David Cameron has only spoken to his deputy Nick Clegg and the attorney general Dominic Grieve about the plans for two inquiries . Apparently he felt the need to order two new inquiries into phone hacking after learning , in the British Embassy on Monday , that the mobile phone of Milly Dowler had been hacked . " This took it to a new level , " one official said . He has not yet taken up Ed Miliband 's request for a private meeting to discuss further . Officials say that the terms of reference of any wider inquiry - such as whether any evidence will be sworn , whether witnesses will be forced to attend , its scope and who will chair it - are yet to be agreed . Despite the ongoing police inquiry , Mr Cameron is going to want to do something sooner rather than later -- such is the public appetite for some action . <p> 14.51Yvette Cooper , the Shadow Home Secretary , is speaking in the Commons debate . She is calling for an impartial inquiry , saying that it " goes to the heart of our democracy " . She said : <p> The very idea of targeting victims and their families is shameful , sickening and cruel . People are rightly angry . Why were these allegations not investigated sufficiently at an earlier stage ? The current Metropolitan Police criminal investigation needs to be forensic and furious in the pursuit of truth . We need to know whether the actions of journalists or private investigators have interfered with police inquiries - not just in Milly Dowler 's case , not just in Daniel Morgan 's case , but more widely . <p> 14.43 A spokesman for the McCann 's has confirmed that police have been in touch over allegations that their phones were hacked by the NOTW . See the video below : <p> 14.34 We mentioned earlier that The Times ran a leader today entitled The Practice of Journalism , about the phone hacking scandal . The piece said : <p> cBefore today ... we have sought to report the story the issue of phone hacking straight , in good faith , without taking any editorial view . <p> However , Telegraph Blogs editorDamian Thompson comments that the paper ignores the hacking story and then blames ' journalism ' for the techniques employed by the NOTW . He notes : <p> ' The Practice of Journalism ' . That 's a brazen choice of title , given that follows is one of the most dishonest , misleading and badly written pieces of journalism I 've read in a long time . <p> The Times has reported the story " straight , in good faith " ? That 's news to me . I ca n't find very much reporting of the News International phone hacking scandals , and neither can the Guardian 's Roy Greenslade . <p> He wrote on his blog in March " For months , The Times ( which used to claim it was " the paper of record " ) has failed to report on the many revelations about the phone-hacking scandal at its sister publication , the News of the World . It has ignored a string of stories that have totally undermined the NoW 's previous defence that hacking was restricted to a single ' rogue reporter ' There has been no mention of the many victims of hacking who have started legal actions against its parent company , News International . Nor has it reported on the court pressure on the private investigator , Glenn Mulcaire , to reveal the names of NoW executives who ordered him to hack into people 's phones . " <p> 14.29 Chris Bryant alleged in the Commons earlier that the NOTW hacked into a phone or phones connected to Danielle Jones , a 15-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered by her uncle Stuart Campbell in 2001 . The teenager 's body was never found - instead , Campbell 's conviction in 2002 relied on forensic authorship analysis of text messages sent from her mobile phone . Danielle was last seen walking to a bus stop near her home in East Tilbury , Essex , on June 18 , 2001 . Following his conviction , Campbell was jailed for life . <p> Stuart Campbell ( left ) and Danielle Jones . <p> 14.23 The announcement that Lord Macdonald has been appointed as a legal adviser to News Corporation comes in a statement just released from News International . It says : <p> The appointment , which was made in May , is one of a series of measures to address these issues since January 2011 when information was voluntarily disclosed by News International that re-opened the investigation into illegal voicemail interception known as Operation Weeting . <p> The statement adds : <p> We also welcome today 's cross-party calls for a broad public inquiry into standards and practices in the industry . <p> News International have hired the former Director of Public Prosecutions , Ken Macdonald QC . It was while MacDonald was the DPP that Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman were charged . <p> 14.16 Chris Hope reports : <p> Chris Bryant MP says : " I know that the News of the World is hanging Andy Coulson out to dry but the buck has to stop at the top . " On Rupert Murdoch 's stewardship of his media empire , he adds : " At least Berlusconi lives in Italy -- but he Rupert Murdoch does not even live in this country . " <p> 14.13 The officer in charge of the original phone hacking inquiry has been called to give further evidence to MPs . Former Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman will be questioned over " who knew what at which point " , Keith Vaz , chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said . Mr Hayman , who was in charge of the 2006 investigation , will give evidence on Tuesday with Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers , who is in charge of the current probe , Operation Weeting . <p> 14.10 Dominic Grieve , the Attorney General , is now speaking in the Commons : <p> I 'm sure the whole house shares the concern over the allegations of phone hacking and the many other matters that he raised during his ( Chris Bryant 's ) powerful speech this afternoon . <p> The suggestion that Milly Dowler and the phones of 7/7 victims were hacked must fill any right thinking person with revulsion . <p> Phone hacking is a serious crime . The courts have previously upheld custodial sentences . It is precisely because of the gravity of the allegations that the Prime Minster announced that there would be a fully independent inquiry or inquiries into the matter . However they must not jeopardise any crmiiinal investigations . <p> 14.04 Chris Bryant says the culprits at the NOTW should be jailed . He tells MPs : <p> My hope is that people who have committed criminality at the NOTW end up going to prison . The last thing I would want is for this debate to interfere with a cirminal investigation . I noted the Prime Minister 's rather vacillating response earlier . But I believe it is perfcetly possible to hold a public inquiry at the same time as a police investigation - in fact I think it is essential that the investigation is supplemented by an inquiry . I worry that the police investigation may have the rug pulled from under it , if people involved shred the evidence . <p> 13.56 News just in from Chris Hope : <p> Chris Byrant MP says News of the World targeted the case of murder victim Danielle Jones . Danielle was last seen on 18 June 2001 . Her uncle Stuart Campbell was convicted of her abduction and murder on 19 December 2001 . He tells a hushed House of Commons : " The private voicemail mail of victims should never be a commodity for a quick story . " <p> 13.49 More from Chris Bryant in the Commons : <p> Tomorrow it will be six years since the 7/7 bombings . Today we hear that several people involved in the bombings had their phones hacked by the NotW , as well as the phone of Milly Dowler , and phones related to Madeleine McCann . <p> These are not just the amoral actions of private investigator tied to a rogue News of the World reporter . These are the immoral actions of a bankrupt culture . Private voicemails should never ever be used for a cheap story . <p> Journalists and investigators should be ashamed , as should the people who ran the paper . Editorial negligence is tantamount to compliciity . If Brooks has a single shred of decency , she would resign : and were it a minister she would be demanding their head on a plate . <p> 13.47 Watching the Commons debate , it 's worth noting that the chamber looks to be half full , at best . <p> 13.42 Chris Bryant , the Labour MP , is on his feet in the Commons as the debate on phone hacking gets under way . He claims that the NOTW also hacked into the phones of Madeleine McCann 's family and even police officers in charge of investigating hacking by the newspaper . These were the " immoral and criminal deeds of organisation that was appallingly led , " he said . <p> In additon , Mumsnet has pulled out of an online campaign with Sky , as it 's part of the Murdoch empire . <p> There are also unconfirmed reports that Debenhams and Aldi have abandoned advertising at the NOTW . <p> 13.27 David Willetts has gone on BBC Radio 4 's The World at One . Asked whether appointing Andy Coulson was a " huge error of judgment " as Ed Miliband suggested , he said : <p> We have to wait and see what the police investigations reveal . I do n't think we can presume things while the investigations are under way . <p> 13.20 Vauxhall has also announced it has stopped placing adverts in the NOTW . A spokeswoman for the car manufacturer said : <p> Vauxhall has suspended advertising in the News of the World . It will reconsider its position pending the outcome of investigations into the allegations of phone hacking . <p> 13.14 At this rate , there wo n't be many adverts in the next issue of the NOTW . It seems that Debenhams have followed suit with numerous other major firms . Sunny Hundal of the Left-wing website Liberal Conspiracy tweets : <p> Lloyds TSB said today that the decision was a direct response to the growing backlash against the paper , which is also said to have intercepted voicemails of the parents of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman . <p> The most uncomfortable point of today 's PMQs for David Cameron was when the News of the World phone hacking scandal came closest to home . The paper in question was , of course , once edited by Andy Coulson . Mr Coulson later went to work for Mr Cameron , first in Opposition and then in Downing Street , quitting No 10 in January . Mr Coulson has always denied any wrongdoing in his previous journalistic roles , and Mr Cameron has always said he accepts that . That position now exposes Mr Cameron to significant political risk . <p> 12.59 Britain 's top police officer has admitted that News International gave Scotland Yard documents indicating " inappropriate " payments were made to officers . Sir Paul Stephenson , the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , said evidence handed over by the newspaper publisher last month suggested a " small number " of officers were involved . Sir Paul said in a statement : <p> I can confirm that on 20 June 2011 the MPS was handed a number of documents by News International , through their barrister , Lord Macdonald QC . Our initial assessment shows that these documents include information relating to alleged inappropriate payments to a small number of MPS officers . <p> 12.44 While all that was going on , there was another blow to the News of the World 's commercial team . Harry Wallop , our reporter , writes to say : <p> Co-operative group -- both bank and supermarket -- has reversed yesterday 's " considering " approach to deciding to termporarily pull all advertising and promotions in News of the World . Said it was forced to act after it received flood of complaints from its members . <p> 12.36 Simon Greenberg 's performance in defending News International has been ridiculed by commentators . The interview being billed as his biggest " car crash " moment so far was on Channel 4 News last night : <p> 12.24 Ed Miliband is laying into Cameron . After the Prime Minister 's response on whether Brooks should resign . Miliband says : <p> I do n't know from that answer whether he wants her to resign or not . He has shown no leadership on News International , he has shown no leadership on BskyB , and the British public needs him to show leadership following the biggest press scandal of modern times . This was not the actions of some rogue reporter : Rebekah Brooks should take responsibility and resign . The Prime Minister made catastrophic error of judgment in bringing Andy Coulson into the heart of his Downing Street team . <p> Mr Cameron replies : <p> I take full responsibility for who I employ and what government does . I feel so appalled , that 's why important full police investigation . <p> The mention of Andy Coulson brings uproar - Labour MPs shout " resign " , forcing the speaker to call for order , saying that " the Prime Minister should not have to shout to be heard , and nor for that matter should the leader of the opposition " . <p> Ed Miliband : We also believe that the BSkyB bid should be reviewed by the competition commission , not simply by the culture secretary , and that it should not take place until after the major criminal investigations are complete . Does the Prime Minister agree ? <p> David Cameron : Believe me I want to get on with this issue . What we have done here is follow absolutely to the letter the correct methods . The culture secretary is in a quasi-judicial role . What I would say is that these processes must be followed , and that Ofcom must make recommendations on whether BSkyB is fit and proper . <p> Ed Miliband : I 'm afraid that answer is out of touch with millions of people in this country . I know it is difficult for him , but I strongly urge him to put this through the competition commision , and act in a proper and legal way . <p> David Cameron : I think there are two issues here , one of a police investigation , and morality and ethics , . The other is of plurality in the media . We shouild follow the legal processes , as ( Miliband ) said yesterday . Now he 's done a U-turn . <p> Ed Miliband : This is not the time for technicalities or low blows . I hope the Prime Minister goes away from this PMQs and thinks hard and changes his mind . No-one is denying that this scandal took place on the watch of the current CEO of News International . Will he call for her to consider her position ? <p> David Cameron : This is a time for technicalities , because there is such a thing as due process , and any government should follow it . As regards News International , there is a police investigation , and if it finds that anyone has been guilty of wrongdoing , they should of course resign . Everyone at News International needs to ask themselves searching questions . <p> 12.07 PMQs are under way and the phone hacking saga is the second item , after tributes to the British soldier killed recently in Afghanistan . David Cameron has said there will be a public inquiry . <p> Ed Miliband : The whole country has been appalled by the allegations of phone hacking - the Soham murders , 7/7 , and of course Milly Dowler . That anyone could have hacked into her mobile phone is a disgrace . Will the Prime Minister support calls for an inquiry ? <p> David Cameron : Yes . Let us be clear . There will be an inquiry , perhaps inquiries , into events . It is no longer just celrebrities and politiicans , but murder victims . The whole country is appalled . There is a huge police investigation , one of the biggest under way in the country , and involves police officers who were not invovled in the original investigagion . There will be an inquiry , and while it can not get fully under way until after the police investigaation is completed , we can make a start on other elements . I want us to get this right and reavaluate journalistic ethics in this country . <p> 12.03 Not sure if this is a hoax or not , but the Guardian 's Laura Oliver tweets that some changes have been made ( and it would appear swiftly corrected - having done a quick check ) on Rebekah Brooks 's Wikipedia entry . See the screen grab here . <p> 11.59 The BBC 's Robert Peston reports that News Corp 's bid for BSkyB has been jeopardised by the phone hacking scandal : <p> I do n't see how News Corporation , owner of News International , can pursue its takeover of British Sky Broadcasting at this juncture . <p> On this last issue , and as I 've pointed out before , Ofcom is under a legal obligation to ensure that the owners of broadcasters such as BSkyB are fit and proper . <p> But pending the results of the police enquiry into alleged illegal behaviour by the News of the World , and pending a public disclosure by News International of the way that it has changed its structures and practices to ensure such abuses never happen again , Ofcom is not in a position to adjudicate whether News Corporation is fit and proper . <p> 11.53 Paul Waugh , the editor of PoliticsHome , says that the Government is leaning towards starting an inquiry , and asks : " Who will be Cameron 's Hutton ? " <p> I get the strong feeling that the PM is going to announce that once the police have done their business , a full inquiry can begin . Maybe he will announce it in PMQs to spike the guns of Ed Miliband , with the Attorney General following up in the formal response to the debate later . <p> 11.49 Halifax has joined Ford and Mumsnet in pulling advertising at the NOTW . Harry Wallop , our Consumer Affairs Editor , has this : <p> Momentum is building among News of the World advertisers to actively pull out of spending money with the paper , rather than just get some good headlines by saying they are " considering " their options . <p> Last night it was Ford and Mumsnet ( who pulled a deal with Sky ) . This morning the Halifax bank said it has pulled an advert planned for this Sunday . Its statement said : " In recognising and responding to consumer reaction , Halifax has cancelled an advertisement in this Sunday 's News of the World . " Renault too said that " as a result of these allegations " it had no plans to advertise in the future . <p> The real test will be with the supermarkets , who spend millions upon millions in taking out full-page adverts in the tabloids every year . Tesco has said it is considering its position , but Asda -- which likes to make a stand when it can -- has so far remained silent . Its decision will be crucial . <p> 11.45Simon Greenberg also told Radio 5 Live that News International was " very close " to finding out who commissioned the hacking of Milly Dowler 's phone . <p> We are very close to , we believe , identifying an individual or individuals who potentially commissioned this act . <p> Asked whether he was clear that the hacking was not commissioned by Rebekah Brooks , who was editor of the NOTW at the time , Mr Greenberg said : " We are clear . " <p> 11.37 The NOTW is considering running a front page apology on the phone hacking scandal . Simon Greenberg failed to rule out the idea just now in an interview on the Victoria Derbyshire show on Radio 5 Live : <p> We 're considering many things at this stage , and things are happening very fast , but I ca n't say that there will be . <p> Greenberg added : <p> Anything that we find in our investigations we will pass on to the families . <p> Greenberg asked for Mr Cassidy 's details to be passed on to him . " Surely you already have my phone number ? " says Sean , who says he has already had contact with the newspaper . <p> 11.26Simon Greenberg is being confronted on Radio 5 Live by a Sean Cassidy , whose son Ciaran Cassidy was killed in the 7/7 bombings . Mr Cassidy said : <p> It 's disgraceful . You do n't deserve to be publishing the news . <p> 11.20This letter , from Rebekah Brooks to the chairman of thr Commons culture , media and sport select committee in 2009 makes interesting reading . Brooks , who was editor of The Sun at the time , says News International refuted claims that illegal phone tapping was a widespread practice at the NOTW . <p> 11.04 Chris Hope has the following update on the private investigator at the centre of the phone hacking scandal : <p> Glenn Mulcaire , doorstepped by the BBC this morning , is asked what is your message to the victims affected by the hacking scandal ? He says : " I made a statement yesterday and due to legal constraints unfortunately at this stage I can make no more comment , thank you very much . " <p> 10.59 The Guardianpoints out that the handover of emails detailing payments to police coincided with Andy Coulson 's resignation as David Cameron 's director of communications . <p> The timing of the handover of the emails is significant since Coulson resigned as David Cameron 's director of communications at Number 10 in January , giving no exact reason for his resignation except the accumulation of the media pressure over his alleged role in the phone hacking during his editorship . <p> 10.50 Nick Robinsonis blogging that News International executives believe they have uncovered evidence of who at the News of the World commissioned and sanctioned the hacking of Milly Dowler 's phone . <p> The evidence is said to have emerged in a document trawl carried out in the immediate aftermath of the revelation by the Guardian of the hacking of the murdered girl 's phone . I am told that the evidential jigsaw is not yet complete but executives believe they know who was responsible . Rebekah Brooks - now chief executive of News International , the News of the World 's publisher - was editor of the paper at the time Milly Dowler went missing in 2002 and has said it was " inconceivable " that she knew . The newly uncovered evidence is said not to contradict that . <p> 10.42 Crispin Blunt , the justice minister , has told the BBC that Dominic Grieve , the attorney general , will be presenting the Government 's side of things in the Commons debate later today . He will be addressing calls for a public inquiry into the phone hacking claims , Mr Blunt said . <p> 10.35 Damian Thompson wonders whether the " rabbit-in-the-headlights " Simon Greenberg is really the best spokesman News International could find : <p> News International is facing the most serious allegations in the history of tabloid journalism , and who does it wheel out to represent it on television ? Simon Greenberg , " director of corporate affairs " and -- judging by his performance on Channel 4 News last night -- someone who 'd go to pieces defending South West Trains on a regional news bulletin . <p> 10.31 We told you last night that Mumsnet had pulled ads with News International over the hacking scandal . Chris Blackhurst , editor of The Independent said he believes their withdrawal is " bigger than Ford or Tesco " , who are also questioning their advertising policies with the NOTW . PR Weekhave more on the Mumsnet story . <p> 10.25 Cristina Odonewrites that " the News of the World disgrace has made me ashamed to be a journalist " : <p> I ca n't imagine what it 's like to be Sienna Miller and I do n't aspire to political office . As a result , my sympathy for celebrities and politicians whose phones have been hacked is limited . But Milly Dowler 's parents , or Holly 's and Jessica 's parents ? As the mother of an eight-year-old girl , I can imagine all too well what it must be like to have a beloved daughter disappear . <p> 10.18Rebekah Brooks , editor of the NOTW at the time of the alleged hacking of Milly Dowler 's phone , is chief among those facing pressure to resign . The Independent reports on its front pagetoday that Brooks faces questions over claims that she personally commissioned searches by one of the private investigators who was later used by the NOTW to trace the family of Milly Dowler . Its report says : <p> Ms Brooks , while editor of NOTW , used Steve Whittamore , a private detective who specialised in obtaining illegal information , to " convert " a mobile phone number to find its registered owner . Mr Whittamore also provided the paper with the Dowlers ' ex-directory home phone number . The Information Commissioner 's Office , which successfully prosecuted Whittamore for breaches of the Data Protection Act in 2005 , said last night it would have been illegal to obtain the mobile conversion if the details had been " blagged " from a phone company . <p> Senior managers at the UK subsidiary should be held responsible for what happened on their watch . The idea -- assiduously peddled for a long time by News Corp -- that the hacking was the work of a " lone wolf " was never credible . Indeed as the allegations mount up , what is emerging is an industrial-scale operation where , in many cases , it was the first resort of journalists pursuing a story to engage the so-called " dark arts " of the private investigator and phone hacker . In these circumstances , the idea that bosses did not know what went on would be a poor excuse even if one accepted it . <p> Update : I obtained this story in a circuitous route , when I heard that Vanity Fair was planning to publish a story on alleged payments to police . <p> As it happens , Vanity Fair had n't published by the time I went live on the Ten O'Clock News . <p> He claims that he only obtained a statement from News International about the story after it was given to Vanity Fair . <p> Labour MP Tom Watson ( left ) and Robert Peston <p> 09.44 Robert Peston , the BBC 's business editor , has taken a lot of flak in the last couple of days from commentators suggesting he is doing a better job of PR for News International than Simon Greenberg , its director of corporate affairs . Tom Watson , the Labour MP , is now claiming that Peston is being fed his information from Will Lewis , former editor-in-chief of The Daily Telegraph and now group general manager of News Intenational . Paul Waugh , editor of Politics Home tweets : <p> 09.31 While we wait for the Commons debate on phone hacking this afternoon , here is a video of the request by Labour MP Chris Bryant , which led to it being arranged . <p> 09.22Graham Foulkes said earlier that he would " very much like to meet face to face " with Rupert Murdoch to discuss the phone hacking allegations . Simon Greenbeg has now said that News International may set up a meeting between pair . Greenberg said : " That 's certainly something we would consider . " <p> 09.17Simon Greenberg , News International 's PR chief , has admitted that if proved true , the allegations of that the NOTW hacked into the phones of Milly Dowler and 7/7 victims ' families would constitute " wrongdoing " in the eyes of News International . <p> 09.13 Phone hacking will come under the spotlight in the House of Commons again today as MPs hold an emergency debate on the topic shortly after PMQs . The debate is expected to start around 13.30 and will last about three hours . We 'll keep you posted as more on this emerges . <p> 09.00 Graham Foulkes has been speaking about his anguish after police contacted him yesterday to warn him that his phone may have been hacked by the NOTW in 2005 after his son , David , was killed in the 7/7 bombings . He said : <p> I just felt really upset and sad and sickened that some people would go to those extremes given the distress of 52 families at that time . I 'm waiting to hear from police but we 're still quite numb that somebody could have been so cold and hard to have listened to our phone conversations at a moment of such intense distress . <p> 08.53 Although a News International stablemate , James Harding , editor of The Times , has rounded on the NOTW describing hacking as " disgusting and indefensible " . In the Times 's leader , the paper says : <p> Anyone who has serious faith in the public purpose of journalism has to record his or her dissent from the behaviour that has now been alleged . <p> 08.45Benedict Brogan , our Deputy Editor , predicts in his Morning Briefing that the blame game is likely to continue higher up the food chain in News International . <p> The problem with a strategy of throwing former colleagues to the wolves is that you soon run out of colleagues . And it might encourage them to say more than they might have otherwise . The buck has n't stopped yet , it 's still moving . All those politicians who invested themselves personally in the NI combine must be feeling queasy this morning . <p> Detective Superintendent Dave Cook was spied upon from a van outside his home and even followed driving his children to school while investigating the murder of the private investigator Daniel Morgan . The surveillance is said to have taken place just three months after the missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler 's mobile phone was allegedly hacked into . <p> Dave Cook <p> 08.29 Ford 's withdrawal of advertising is a significant blow to the NOTW 's coffers , says Claire Enders , the media analyst . She told Radio 4 's Today programme that Ford ads are worth about ? 4.5 million to the tabloid annually , which is about 10 per cent of their total ad revenues . <p> Newspapers rely on selling advertisements for a significant share of their income and the loss of major accounts , or attempts on the part of advertisers to negotiate lower rates , can be highly damaging . <p> 08.06 Armando Iannucci , the comedian , has tweeted a link to a spreadsheet with the contact details of the CEOs of the NOTW 's main advertisers . Given the mounting pressure for them to pull advertising , they may well find their inboxes brimming very soon . <p> 07.51 Graham Foulkes , whose son David was killed in the 7/7 bombings , is speaking on Radio 4 's Today programme . He says police contacted him yesterday warning him that they suspect the NOTW hacked into his phone . Speaking of the period after the explosions , when his son was feared dead , he said : <p> We were in a very dark place and we were using the phone frantically trying to get information about David and where he may have been and if he was in hospital . We were talking to family and friends , and talking very intimately about very personal issues . The thought that these guys were listening to that is just horrendous . <p> Graham Foulkes , whose son David died in the 7/7 bombings <p> 07.38 You get a sense that very soon this story is going to completely unravel and the full extent of the hacking will be laid bare . Yesterday the focus was very much on allegations that teenage murder victim Milly Dowlew 's phone was hacked . But it is morphing into a much broader story after last night we discovered that the phones of relatives of Soham murder victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman , and7/7 bombing victims may also have been targeted . <p> Duncan Gardham , our security correspondent reports : <p> Detectives from Scotland Yard 's team investigating the phone hacking scandal are in the process of contacting a " handful " of the 52 bereaved families whose names or phone numbers have appeared as part of their inquiry , sources told the Daily Telegraph . <p> 07.26 Jon Snow , the Channel 4 News anchorman is tweeting that following Ford , numerous other big companies are considering pulling advertising with the NOTW . <p> 07.16 Quick look at today 's papers , and the story is dominating the front pages for all , save The Sun , the NOTW 's daily sister paper , which carries stories about an IVF lottery and Victoria Beckham 's baby bump . <p> 07.05 One of the biggest developments overnight was the revelation that Andy Coulson- the NOTW 's former editor and David Cameron 's former press adviser - was back under the spotlight over the hacking scandal . News International , which publishes the tabloid , released a statement saying it had released new evidence to police which it is alleged shows that Coulson condoned payments from his staff to members of the police . <p> Andrew Porter , our political editor reports : <p> The company said that emails had been passed to investigating officers to help them with their inquiries . The shock move by bosses at Wapping to effectively throw Mr Coulson back into the spotlight illustrates the lengths they will now go to to protect Rebekah Brooks , News International 's chief executive . Mrs Brooks was editor when the News of the World is alleged to have hacked the phone of missing teenager Milly Dowler . That revelation on Monday has sparked widespread disgust and fury at Westminster and triggered calls for her immediate resignation . Mr Coulson was her deputy at the time and later went on to edit the paper . The two journalists were incredibly close friends as well as colleagues .

@@4217232 <h> You are here : <h> Looking back at Harry Potter And The Philosopher 's Stone <h> With the final Harry Potter a week away from release , Mark takes a look back through the earlier films in the franchise , starting with The Philosopher 's Stone ... <p> Here 's a potentially contentious point . The Harry Potter films are to the Noughties what Star Wars was to the generation that grew up in the Seventies and Eighties . In many ways , that would be a shame for George Lucas , who presumably hoped his prequels would make Star Wars into the Star Wars for the Noughties . <p> I say it 's contentious , because it 's not my intention to write a series of one-sided celebratory articles . The staggeringly successful film adaptations of JK Rowling 's book saga will easily get enough coverage from ITV , who hold the rights to show the films on telly and seem to have set up The National Movie Awards solely to remind people of how good they are . <p> On a personal level , I can trace my interest in films back to the production of the first film in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having loved all of the books released at that point , I absorbed every nugget of information I could find about the big-screen version , before the film 's release in November 2001 . <p> It 's for that reason that , while I might forget my PIN number or when my birthday is , I can recall the name of the actor who played Quidditch captain , Oliver Wood , at will . These were the beginnings of my film geekdom . But it 's in retrospect , and with the added capacities that come with being older than 11 , that you notice these are n't flawless films . <p> So , with the final film , Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 , just around the corner , it seems as good a time as any to look back on the big old mega-franchise , which has gone through four directors in eight films , keeping most of the same cast , in just under a decade . <p> Interestingly , Steven Spielberg refused an offer to direct early on , because of the proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts . There 's no challenge . " <p> It 's also believed that producers disagreed with his ideas for a more radical adaptation , an animated film with Haley Joel Osment voicing Harry Potter , or a film which comprised more than just the first of the seven books planned . So , the magic began with Chris Columbus at the helm , and he played it much safer , setting out the blueprint for the eventual eight-film endeavour . <p> The director had previously directed the first two Home Alone films , but perhaps more relevantly , he 'd written the screenplay for Young Sherlock Holmes , which put a teenage version of Conan Doyle 's sleuth in a boarding school , solving a mystery with a young Watson and his childhood sweetheart , Elizabeth . <p> Harry Potter , played by Daniel Radcliffe , lives a pretty miserable existence with his only living relatives , the Dursleys , who make him live in the cupboard under the stairs . Just as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dudley , show the series ' sensibilities to be close to the gruesome playfulness of Roald Dahl 's work . <p> When the Dursleys are plagued by letters addressed to their nephew , they fruitlessly continue trying to disguise his wizarding heritage . Soon enough , an affable half-giant called Hagrid , played by Robbie Coltrane , comes along and literally kicks the door down on their deception . Harry 's due to begin studying at a school for young witches and wizards , Hogwarts . <p> Although I 've already made the Star Wars comparison , it might be more apt to compare this first instalment to Superman : The Movie . There are inherent similarities in the way that it adapts a much loved property by pioneering new special effects and surrounding an unknown lead with a well-known and talented supporting cast . <p> But the general structure of that first Richard Donner movie makes tonal shifts throughout . We begin on Krypton , as baby Kal-El is oblivious to the ructions shaking his entire world , and we see him being deposited to somewhere far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where young Clark Kent lives an ordinary life . That is , until he discovers his powers and moves to Metropolis . <p> It 's worlds away from Smallville , and it 's there that Clark , and the movie , really takes flight . The next tonal shift comes when Lex Luthor puts his nefarious plans in motion . Not everything about that big city is wondrous . You get the picture . My point is that the thematic beats of those first two parts have fairly obvious parallels in this first Harry Potter film . <p> I would argue that the sense of discovery is much greater in this one , as we 're bombarded with fantastical concepts like Diagon Alley and Quidditch and Hogwarts , realised on the big screen through the astounding work of Stuart Craig , stalwart production designer on all of the Potter films . <p> The first half of the film properly achieves the sense of wonderment that any young boy would have , being rescued from that awful life . And boy , is it an awful life . Richard Griffiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in the film , playing characters who have essentially abused a young boy for the last ten years or so . Like so many of the cast in this one , they overplay it in all of the right ways . <p> That refusal to underestimate or patronise the young audience transfers from Rowling 's novel very well , with Richard Harris ' Dumbledore sagely dispensing advice , like " The third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds , to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death , " straight from the page . <p> It 's around Christmastime in the film , when that Luthor shift happens , even if the seeds of the titular Philosopher 's Stone have been planted all the way through the enjoyable opening . From here , the film takes a supposedly darker turn , which is most immediately apparent from the way that the lighting gets turned down . <p> Columbus probably is n't the fans ' favourite director , but he 's still the one who most faithfully adapts the source material . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the downfall of this film and its immediate sequel , especially when such scenes jar with the darker tone . <p> There are some scenes excised , such as Hermione 's " cool use of logic and intellect " , but she gets fifty points for Gryffindor in that regard anyway . I think this faithful adaptation set up the unrealistic expectations fans held about later films . Most literary fans may well agree that Harry Potter fans do n't know they 're born , especially with the scenes so painstakingly translated in the first film . <p> For instance , the detour to Hagrid 's hut , in which we discover that he 's got a baby dragon called Norbert , does n't really go anywhere in this cinematic version of the story . And a lot of stuff like that is crammed into the breathless last hour of the film , before it slows back down to a crawl after the climactic battle . <p> Also , in contrast with the unique Britishness of the novel , the film sometimes feels cribbed from Mary Poppins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Warner Bros . Pictures was that the main players should all be played by British or Irish actors . <p> But Steve Kloves , who eventually wrote seven out of the eight Harry Potter films , is an American screenwriter . I rate Kloves ' later work on the series , but it 's in this instalment that we get dialogue like " Holy cricket , you 're Harry Potter " from Hermione . There 's sporadically weird dialogue that actually , sometimes , makes British actors sound like they 're instead pretending to be British . <p> It 's not to be blamed on the leads . This was the acting d ? but for both Rupert Grint , as Ron Weasley , and Emma Watson , as Hermione Granger . They quickly establish a chemistry with Radcliffe , but like much of this production , there 's a definite feeling that they 're just finding their feet . <p> The inevitable dismissal of Harry Potter And The Philosopher 's Stone is that it 's the most quaint instalment , as compared to the sequels . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it could have been , even by 2001 's standards . <p> Witness Firenze the centaur , a casualty of the film 's rush for a November release date , already pushed back from the lucrative July 4th weekend .

Despite being slightly baggy in the second half , that 's how it justifies its length of almost hundred and fifty minutes . One hundred and fifty minutes minutes , from the shortest book in a series that also contains seven hundred-page tomes . <p> With all of its sense of awe at this new world , it 's not beneath a few genuinely unsettling moments , like the reveal of the arch-baddie 's face underneath Professor Quirrell 's turban . Largely , though , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film .

With a pedigree of eeriness which leans so heavily on a bygone iconography of menace , Gatehouse may well represent primetime 's hauntological turn . <p> Those who have tracked the shift towards the ghostly in British underground music over the last couple of years might feel that hauntology is due a critical exorcism by now . For the Thursday evening TV audience , however , it could still require some introduction . To recap , Simon Reynolds appropriated the neologism from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe a musical aesthetic which manipulates old library recordings , obsolete electronics , static , and musique concrete 's repertoire of techniques to produce disquieting , melancholy effects . <p> Where some genres -- Britpop serves as straw man here -- reach backwards in a nostalgic shirking of the responsibility to produce material which might challenge the listener , hauntology bends towards those instances belonging to the cultural past in which the weird and ambiguous were purposefully cultivated . It returns both to spurts of creativity which did n't find their way into the mainstream and , almost contradictorily , to works which attained so great a familiarity through their exposure to a mass audience that their experimental brio was overlooked . <p> Chronologically-speaking , the lodestone of hauntological thinking is a period which extends from the late 60s to roughly the time of the Miners ' Strike . It makes a romantic overture to the cultural -- and political -- achievements of British social democracy , belying an increasingly widespread yearning for the straighter , and yet far stranger , era before Thatcher 's demolition of the Post War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information film -- Gatehouse , come to think of it , is n't a million miles from the unforgettable Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water -- as well as the sonic adventurousness of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and audacious grands projets in social housing and town planning , hauntology asks what kinds of futures might have matured from such instances of technical , stylistic , and political innovation in public life . <p> The BBC figures prominently in the preoccupations of this disposition . What emerged from Television Centre and Broadcasting House under a succession of modernising Director-Generals in the 60s and 70s has lately come to emblematise how publicly-funded bodies were once able to broadcast work with intellectual clout equal to social democracy 's egalitarian ambitions . <p> A slightly extreme example , perhaps , but one might illustrate what has been lost since then by pointing to a hefty sag in the cerebral pitch of the Corporation 's art documentaries : where the 70s gave us the rigorous Marxian demystifications of John Berger 's Ways of Seeing , the noughties serve up Andrew Graham-Dixon cooing over the rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years to throw a little light on game theory or macroeconomics using nothing but old tourist promos and the shadier reaches of his iPod , but -- due to deregulation - the state broadcaster has become palpably blunted by its subjection to market forces it has n't always been required to appease . <p> Over the course of its seven-episode run , The Shadow Line evokes some of the alluring disorientations and assured intelligence of a prelapsarian BBC . Press coverage ahead of its release led many to expect a tea-and-toast spin on The Wire , but , from the Beckett-quiet mumblings , bruised palette , and explicit artificiality of the first episode 's opening scenes , it 's clear that writer-director Hugo Blick possesses inclinations substantially dissimilar to the American show 's exhaustive realism . None of the characters , with the possible exception of Christopher Eccleston 's flower importer-cum-smack wholesaler Joseph Bede , seem designed to be played naturalistically , permitting a staginess in which a thespy cast -- Rea ; Anthony Sher as errant drug financier Peter Glickman ; Rafe Spall as the thuggish , deceptively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one level or another , every single scene inspires bewilderment on the viewer 's part . An image from the fourth episode of Gatehouse sitting atop a filing cabinet whilst surveilling the offices of Glickman 's son , for example , exudes poetic surreality in a manner we probably have n't been blessed with since Twin Peaks ; Spall 's wired , hyper-stylised delivery indicates a sensitivity for the surreptitious camp of criminality that the makers of more straight-laced cop shows seem determined to ignore . <p> Perhaps it 's the script 's cavalier attitude to sense-making , or its tonally-bumpy marriage of unforgiving noir and unexpected belly laughs , but critics were not uniform in their appreciation of The Shadow Line . With disheartening literal-mindedness , a number accused Blick 's dialogue of being clich ? d -- more of which in a moment -- and pilloried the plot as implausible and convoluted . These allegations miss the point : even repeated viewings wo n't discern that much logic in the story , which turns on institutional corruption , the mnemonic exertions and amorous subterfuges of DI Jonah Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension schemes . <p> All of this is , in practice , an elephantine MacGuffin configured to take us from one set-piece to another and to justify increasingly outlandish onscreen interactions . That straightforwardness and plausibility of plot are now principle measure of a show 's calibre -- hence Channel 4 's ironing out of some of the ambiguities of their adaptation of David Peace 's Red Riding in 2009 -- speaks volumes about a retreat from experimentalism in television drama ; The Shadow Line seems to want to reverse this process and reclaim the medium for oddness once again . <p> So much of this is achieved through what the less charitable might deem to be directorial tics . One scene in which Gatehouse does for a meddling investigative journalist by running his motorcycle off the road exemplifies this : a combination of uncomfortably forced camera angles and over-extended shots -- techniques which once again recall nothing so much as Hammer House of Horror at its most perverse -- cultivates a sense that everything is slightly out of line with contemporary dramatic convention . This attention to visual detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent conspiracy narratives such as Paul Abbott 's Exile , marks The Shadow Line out as a counter-argument to the jadedness of so much of what the BBC has to offer these days . <p> Blick also capitalises on awkwardness and incongruity in his dialogue , having characters lengthily spin out laboured metaphors in a manner which , whilst read by some as an inability to make the show 's language escape clich ? , effectively depicted a world in which individuals lack the wherewithal to use words to control their own destinies . In the plays of Beckett and Pinter , clich ? is what characters reach for when they 're incapable of grasping the enormity of the situations which confront them : crime and corruption , The Shadow Line implies , have the power to overwhelm our linguistic capacities . <p> Amongst a huge cast , only Gatehouse regularly speaks without having recourse to clich ? . As the half-seen controller of everything that is said and done in the show , he serves as a surrogate version of a director within the narrative . Considering this together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that his part is an allegorical one : it was , in a way , as if an old version of the BBC -- a version in which wit and nuance won out over insistent , yet meaningless , valorisations of the ' new ' -- is picking off its progeny . <p> In its depiction of an environment in which almost nobody could manage to say anything constructive , The Shadow Line seems to be taking a pop at the vacuity of contemporary drama 's rhetoric of earnestness by presenting the triumph of a character who is , in the final account , utterly unencumbered by emotional investments . Gatehouse 's troubling affectlessness resurrects the ambiguous terrors of Cold War thrillers and paranoia-tinged curiosities such as The Prisoner ; behind this , perhaps , lies a conviction that TV 's real strength is its capacity to leave the viewer with unanswered questions . This is the BBC at the top of its game , in spite of the arguments of reviewers who tend to reserve their praise for what arrives here from the American networks , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUR COMMENT <p> Good to see a properly considered review of a great show , and it would be fascinating to see how future plots might unfold in a second series . <p> And in that putative second series , it would be curious to see what attire Gatehouse would opt for in summer time - the hat , gloves and heavy overcoat pretty much confine him to operating in cold weather and late nights . <p> My dream future for TSL would be to see how Gatehouse et al would fare vs . Luther and his friend Alice - both of whom have sadly disappeared after a mere 4 episodes of the second series . <p> Yeah , this was an excellent series .

@@4219239 <p> Exhibition : Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera from the Gelman Collection , Pallant House Gallery , Chichester , July 9 -- October 2 2011 <p> Frida Kahlo , arguably the most famous female artist of the 20th century , has never been shown in the UK alongside her husband , Diego Rivera . In some parts of the world , Rivera is even better known , so this show was always going to have its work cut out . <p> In her paintings , Kahlo comes across as a solitary figure . Many of her self portraits here wear a look of imperious self-containment . The spider monkeys which clamber over her in the Self Portrait with Monkeys seem to compound her removal from the world . And even the way she gazes back at lover Nicholas Murray in his iconic colour photographs might be called magisterial . <p> But as demonstrated here , this was loneliness in a crowd . Socialist mural painter Rivera loved women as much as he loved the people . Kahlo 's own lovers , along with Murray , included the exiled Trotsky . <p> Friends are much in evidence , and the show includes a drawing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manuel and Lola ? lvarez Bravo ( Lola gave Kahlo her first solo show in Mexico ) . <p> The complications of these private lives are common knowledge .

The entrance is lined with vintage photographs by her father Guillermo . <p> But the paintings are no mere colour plates in the pages of a biography . No book could contain the bursting floral displays in the grandest pieces by Rivera .

The most interesting pieces in this show are not about Frida or Diego , but about Mexico . This show is a tantalising glimpse of the world 's greatest collection of that country 's modernist and contemporary art . <p> It is concentrated and potent ; it will no doubt please Kahlo fans ; but it also makes clear there is much more to be seen .

@@4219240 <h> Lunch with the FT <h> Lunch with the FT : Michelle Bachelet <p> Michelle Bachelet fled Chile in the 1970s after being imprisoned by the Pinochet regime . Thirty years later she became the country 's first female president . Now she champions women 's rights at the UN . Over shellfish and rocket salad , she tells her story to Gillian Tett <p> The first thing I notice about Michelle Bachelet as she enters the Manhattan restaurant Cibo is that she is wearing a shocking pink jacket . It is not a particularly elegant garment : the fabric looks cheap and the cut unfashionable -- at least by New York 's strict sartorial standards . But the jaunty shade suits her , lighting up the Italian restaurant . It also seems rather appropriate for her job . <p> Until last autumn , Bachelet , 59 , was best known as the first female president of Chile . It was just the latest twist in an extraordinary life : a leftwing activist in her youth , Bachelet came from a family that was tortured under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s ; she went into exile and studied medicine , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held ministerial posts before being elected as president in March 2006 and serving a four-year term in power . <p> Last autumn , six months after stepping down as president , she was appointed undersecretary-general of United Nations Women , a high-profile UN attempt to put " pink " issues firmly on the global policymaking map . <p> As she sits down , I ask how she has settled in at the UN . Uneasily , I confess that I feel torn between idealism and cynicism about her new mandate : part of me loves the fact that the UN is finally doing something to coordinate female causes , particularly in poor , war-torn parts of the world ; but my experience of the UN in the past , as a reporter and an anthropologist , leaves me sceptical about the bureaucracy and ineffective rhetoric that often plague the organisation . <h> More <h> Lunch with the FT <p> Bachelet listens , and gives a calm , sunny smile . Her demeanour provides no clues to her extraordinary life ; her clothes are neat , albeit a little frumpy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purple eye-shadow , but is gently wrinkled . It is a face notable mainly for its normality : in New York powerful women over the age of 50 often use surgery to make the years disappear ; in Latin America , female politicians have tended to be doubly glamorous -- courtesy of discreet " treatments " . <p> " I would not have taken this job if I did not think I could do something , " she says , explaining that the aim of her new post is to co-ordinate disparate initiatives that exist across UN bodies . This , she hopes , will galvanise governments to improve the position of women , not just where they are victims ( say , in war ) , but also in a broader sense . " I want to build for UN Women a strong case for why women 's issues matter , why improving women 's lives is a good investment ... " She pauses ; her English is fairly fluent , but the grammar is charmingly idiosyncratic and she often searches for words . <p> But , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her want to scream ? A few days before our lunch , I had met Bachelet for the first time , when I chaired a UN event on the plight of impoverished widows across the world . Two details stuck out : the arrival of the first lady of Gabon , who was overseeing the event , wearing an extraordinarily glamorous ( and apparently expensive ) outfit ; then the impact of Bachelet ( looking a bit scruffy ) , who quietly and tactfully intervened in the programme to make it less dull , without offending the Gabon hosts . It underlined the kind of diplomatic challenges she will face at the UN . <p> She laughs . " There are some formalities that any institution has , and that you respect . But I try to do it a little bit more interactive and dynamic ... if things can be rational and explained in a good way , things can change . You need to have a strong case . That 's what I want to build for UN Women ; a strong case for change in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant is charming , but basic , with dog-eared menus . Bachelet says she selected it for convenience and I observe that it is also cheap . " Well , I have n't noticed that , " she admits , surprised . " But it 's OK . It 's a normal restaurant , it 's nice , the food is good . " After some debate , I order a chopped rocket salad and soft-shelled crab ; Bachelet chooses two appetisers : another chopped rocket salad , and steamed mussels . She shuns wine , without a thought . <p> " Are you on a health kick ? " I ask . New York women who want to stay rake-thin usually only order two appetisers . Bachelet sports a middle-aged spread ; indeed , elements of the Chilean media nicknamed her " fatty " when she was president . " No . I should and I try , but ... " She says she has no idea how New York women stay so slim : " They drink ! I have seen it myself ! For me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out because I 'm preparing documents and things like that . Any meeting ... I go walking , but it does n't help much . " <p> Her casual approach to ordering , like her indifference to the inexpensive restaurant , is another sign of Bachelet 's apparent lack of interest in the trivial and material . Given the challenges she has faced in her life , this is perhaps unsurprising . <p> She was born in 1951 , into a middle-class family in Santiago , the youngest of two siblings ( her elder brother is no longer alive ) . Her father was a high-ranking army officer ; her mother an archaeologist . " I have a mother who always told me since I was a child that marriage is not the goal of a woman ... that you can do much more than that , " she recalls . " Even my father , well he was in the military ... but he was very progressive too . " <p> Her early family years seem idyllic , albeit shaped by an overwhelming sense of military discipline and duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " helping to improve the world " . But then she decided to study medicine . " It was a very -- I would say -- comfortable family ... I felt love from my parents and I think that helped me even though I was shy . " <p> But in 1973 , this world fell apart when the Pinochet regime seized power in a coup . Her father resisted , and was seized and then tortured so brutally that he died . Then the regime threw Bachelet and her mother into prison for months . <p> " You were also tortured ? " I ask , carefully ; it is not really intended as a question . <p> She pauses . She has never discussed this period of her life in public in detail . " There 's a lot of people who had a worse time than mine , " she replies , and firmly moves the conversation to the next stage of her life : after prison , she and her mother then moved to Australia , before settling in East Germany , a place sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married a fellow Chilean leftwing activist , continued to support the anti-Pinochet cause and started having children . <p> The waiter interrupts with our food : two rocket salads , neatly arranged into a pyramid , which are tasty , but unremarkable . She starts to eat , in an absent-minded way , and continues with her tale . <p> In 1979 , she returned to Chile , hoping to promote democracy . She qualified as a surgeon -- but when she applied for jobs in public health , she was turned down because of her leftwing views . So she joined a non-governmental group instead and , eventually , when the political climate changed in the early 1980s , she finally entered the public health service , taking charge of a programme on HIV/Aids and epidemiology in Santiago . She performed well and , in 1996 , was chosen by the central committee of the Socialist party to run for the city council . In 2000 she was named minister of health . Then , in 2002 , she became defence minister . <p> It was a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Latin America -- yet here was a self-declared agnostic operating in a Catholic region ; moreover , after her return to Chile she divorced her husband , becoming a single mother . There was also the emotional legacy of her family 's persecution under Pinochet . She insists , however , that it was precisely because of her past that she felt so keen to do this job . " I 've always thought that one of the problems of our coup d ' ? tat ... was that there was no political dialogue or understanding between the politicians and military , " she says . " I lived in military units as a child . I was -- as they say -- part of the military family . So , I thought , I could understand the language , to build a bridge . " <p> When she was president , did she try to find out exactly who had tortured her family ? To seek revenge ? " No , " she says , surprised . " There was a time in my life when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a process . It 's not that I said , ' OK ' , but ... " English words fail her . " I really wanted a country where people could live understanding their diversity and not thinking the person in front of them is an enemy but someone who can be different . " <p> She pauses , then recounts a story about going into a Santiago hardware store where she ran into a former friend of her father 's who had initiated some of her family 's torment . As she tells her tale , her voice is devoid of any self-pity or bitterness ; she likes to live , she says , by looking forward -- not obsessively watching the past . She does not want to be a victim . <p> Our plates are cleared , quietly , and I ask about the period between 2006 and 2010 , when she served as president . Opinions on her track record are mixed : some leftwing politicians blame her for the fact that under her leadership the Social Democrats lost power for the first time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective leadership at a time of global economic turmoil , and note that opinion polls show that she is still the region 's most popular politician . <p> Bachelet herself seems ambivalent about this time . " To be a president can be very lonely because , even though you have a lot of advisers , at the end it 's you that has to make the decision , " she notes . But she says she is proud that she was able to promote " social protection " for the poorest parts of society . She is also pleased that she promoted the cause of women -- as one newspaper noted , after her tenure young Chilean girls started saying that they wanted to be president when they grew up , rather than to be nurses . What she disliked was that this also turned her into a quasi-celebrity in Chile . " Yesterday somebody was asking me what do you miss about Chile while living in New York . I said , ' I miss my family , but I also like to be Miss Nobody here -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the UN job was not without controversy . Some members wanted an African candidate and others disliked how Bachelet approaches " women 's issues " . Notably , she has always stressed that feminism should not be just about trying to protect women -- but also to " empower " them , in a positive sense . Just as in her own life , she does not like focusing on victimhood alone . " Empowering means putting more women in decision-making positions ... governmental , parliamentarian , " she says . But she was eventually appointed , and moved to New York . <p> Does she like the city ? I ask , as the waiter appears with our main courses ; she expresses surprise at the scale of her large , steaming bowl of mussels ; I have a slightly overcooked plate of soft-shell crab . What does she do with her spare time ? <p> " Hobbies ? I do n't know . I am always working , reading , travelling , preparing for meetings . I would like to , how do you say it ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " savour " . <p> " Yes ! To savour New York . To walk . To see friends , museums , theatre . I would like to see my grandchildren . " Her two daughters are still at college in Latin America ; her eldest son works in Chile and has two children , whom she misses . <p> " Oh , and I like to dance , dance ! " she suddenly adds . <p> Dance ? I ask , surprised . <p> " I 'm not a tango dancer . That 's very professional . But I love merengue , salsa ... " She becomes animated and explains that just before she left Santiago , " my friends organised me sort of a farewell party and birthday party . So I danced ! " <p> I ask if there is anything else she does in New York . " I have to do the normal things -- clean the house , the laundry . I do it on the weekends . " <p> " Do n't you have a cleaner ? " I ask , genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not glamour and all that kind of stuff . I think it 's due to the education I received at home but also because of the coup d ' ? tat . When you lose friends , lose loved ones , you really ask yourself what is really important in life and you realise the finitude of the human being . That makes you more humble , more realistic but also ambitious -- not in the sense of trying to touch the ceiling , not in the sense of power -- in trying to make a difference for others . " With a rueful smile , she says that her daughters ( to whom she is very close ) have teased her for being " addicted " to public service , be that running a country , creating a charitable foundation or trying to help women . <p> The main course is cleared away . She orders a green tea , and I choose espresso . After the bill arrives , she quietly gathers up her bag and heads to a dingy sidedoor around the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back to the UN , faster , " she says , as her pink jacket disappears -- presumably into another round of meetings . Such powers of navigation will come in handy at the UN , I muse , hoping she finds a way to overcome obstacles there as effectively as she has throughout her life . <p> In the popular imagination , Latin America is home to the political strong man -- the charismatic caudillo who concentrates power in his own hands and imposes his obsessions on the history of the nation , writes John Paul Rathbone . <p> Women , meanwhile , are relegated to one of two roles : a passing mention in a romantic ballad -- or that of matriarch , the domineering do ? a who really wears the trousers behind the scenes . <p> Such was the case with Eva Per ? n in the late 1940s and early 1950s . Unburdened by any constitutional limit , she ruled Argentina alongside her husband Colonel Juan Per ? n . More recently , it was joked that security for former Mexican president Vicente Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n -- because if she went , so did Fox 's brains . <p> Today , however , Dilma Rousseff is president of Brazil , Cristina Fern ? ndez president of neighbouring Argentina , Laura Chinchilla rules in Costa Rica , and Keiko Fuijimori and Mirlande Manigat only narrowly lost this year 's elections in Peru and Haiti . Sandra Torres is likely to win Guatemala 's presidency in September . Female presidents now preside over half of Latin America 's $5,500bn economy and four Caribbean states are governed by women . All this in a region associated with machismo . <p> To be sure , it was often men who helped bring these women to power : Fern ? ndez and Manigat are former first ladies -- Torres still is . Fujimori 's father is a former president . And Rousseff won December 's election after being plucked from near-obscurity by the wildly popular Brazilian former president Luiz In ? cio Lula da Silva . <p> Nonetheless , the rise of female political power in Latin America marks a sea-change . In 1997 , women made up 12 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in five seats and nearly 20 per cent of government ministries -- equal to or better than in the UK or the US . <p> Laws requiring political parties to field a quota of female candidates have surely helped . But progressive feminism is not the root cause of this shift ( although there has been a rejection of the fascist-style military dictatorships of the 1970s , with their patriarchal values ) . It is rather that with fewer children , better education and better jobs , Latin American women have greater participation in democracy -- and are more likely to vote for their own sex .

Then it will just be added to the loan . <p> The earlier you can establish when his care needs arose , the better <p> For the first 12 weeks , when the council is supporting him , it is unlikely that they will concede because this is an additional cost to them . If he has not done so already , then he should claim attendance allowance towards his care costs which he will be entitled to once he is meeting the full cost himself after the 12-week council funding . Attendance allowance is non-means tested and non-taxable and amounts to ? 73.60 per week . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pension credit purposes , so if claiming attendance allowance , he would also be entitled to the pension credit severe disability addition of ? 55.30 per week . <p> These benefits together should be adequate to meet his service charges , so perhaps the management company can be patient and wait until they are in payment . There is a condition that you must have had care needs for at least six months before attendance allowance is granted , so the earlier you can establish when his care needs arose , the better . <p> Under the proposed Dilnot arrangements , what would be done to control for quality of care ? For example , say I have cancer and am given six months to live , but need a care home . I know that I have to foot the bill for the first ? 35,000 and then the state pays . So I choose a marvellous residential care home with all mod cons and personal ; care which charges ? 140,000 per year . Would the tax payer pick up the tab to keep me in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing care ? Would that continue to be free ? How do you discriminate between nursing care and social care ? Nicita , Abingdon . <p> There is a very fine line between free NHS continuing care and means-tested social care . If your care needs are assessed to be primarily health care needs , then the NHS could pick up the costs and fund a placement in a care home of their choosing . The NHS is also responsible for palliative care , so if you were terminally ill , it should pick up the costs . <p> As regards the proposed ? 35,000 cap , councils will set an amount they consider reasonable as a weekly cost and this will be the figure used to notionally calculate when the cap has been reached . You would not be able to reach the cap earlier by choosing more expensive care . <p> Once the cap is reached , if you were in a care home more expensive than the council would normally pay for , you would have to find a way of paying the difference yourself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by care home operators to providing training for care workers to reach levels of NVQ that demonstrate caring skills . The care home sector would argue that councils do not pay them sufficient rates to allow them to pay more than the minimum wage for carers . <p> The Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) is responsible for registering providers of care services and , through monitoring , ensuring they continue to meet essential standards of quality and safety . <p> Why should those who save and pay tax all their lives have to pay for care in old age when others who waste and do not plan ahead get their care free ? Tom C. <p> Funding for care home placements has been means tested since 1948 . The principal being that those who can afford to pay should do so , with a safety net for those who do not have the means . This is how a welfare state works , but it also means that those who are able to afford it have a greater choice of where they may wish to spend the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private residential care home for the last two and a half years and her savings will last approximately another year . My mother is in good health , apart from dementia , and could live for many more years . What will happen when her savings run out ? It would be extremely upsetting for her to have to move , and who will fund it then ? Janice Pallett , Brentwood , Essex . <p> Image caption For state support in England , an individual is judged on two criteria - means and needs <p> Before your mother 's capital depletes to the means test threshold limit , currently ? 23,250 in England , you should ensure her care needs are assessed by her local authority . Once she reaches the means test threshold , they would be obliged to contribute towards her care costs if she is assessed as needing the care . <p> If the home costs more than the council are prepared to pay , you could argue that part of her assessed needs should be emotional needs and moving her to alternative cheaper accommodation does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the care home owner would have to reduce its fees to the local authority rate , or a third party would have to be found to top up . Your mother would not be allowed to top up from her remaining capital . Some benevolent funds assist with top-ups . <p> My mother has dementia . She has been in a care home in Somerset for two years . I live in London and have moved her to a care home in Surrey . She has had to sell her house to pay fees . If my mother runs out of money , would the local authority pick up the bill , despite the fact that she has only lived in Surrey since November ? Lynn Voller , London . <p> If your mother moved to the care home in Surrey of her own volition , then she becomes a resident of Surrey and that council 's responsibility . If she was assessed and placed in the care home by Somerset social services , then it would become their responsibility , should her money run out . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst self-funding her care call the FirstStop Care Advice Line on 0800 377 70 70 and ask for Factsheet 1 : Self-Funding Care Home Fees . <p> It seems particularly unfair that where people do have capital and property values taking them above the threshold , they should pay tax on any pension or investment or deposit income which goes straight to the residential or nursing home . A system should be devised whereby , if the pension or income is paid directly to the nursing home , it could be received gross , as is the case with a purchased life annuity . Lorna Brown , Wales . <p> It is true that if you purchase an " immediate need care fee payment plan " to cover your shortfall in income , the monthly payments from the plan are paid tax-free if paid direct to the care provider however . As with many annuities , a substantial amount of the payment is deemed to be return of capital for tax purposes , so the amount being paid tax free is minimal . <p> The government might find the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care home residents ' income , prohibitively expensive . <p> I have privately funded my father in an Alzheimer 's specialist care home for two years , at approximately ? 28,000 per year .

Terry Brown , Cleethorpes . <p> It is not clear that if the Dilnot Commission 's recommendations were implemented , they would become retrospective and people who have already paid for care for a period would have this counted towards their cap .

Walking into a party where nobody recognises you is slightly different , especially when it 's a gathering of your nearest and dearest . <p> But when I decided to dye my hair platinum blonde , I had no idea of the social repercussions . <p> White blonde -- a label which takes in every shade from ash to platinum to silvery grey -- is having something of a fashionable resurgence . It has always been a stylish statement , from Marie Antoinette 's powdered wigs via Marilyn Monroe 's candyfloss waves to Linda Evangelista 's bleachy Nineties crop . Thanks to an influx of Scandinavian models , the very palest shades are appearing on the catwalks again , like photo negatives after so many seasons of Brazilian honey blondes , flaxen Eastern Europeans and the rich plum shades sported by certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde -- it 's another step up in the colour chart entirely , more tone than shade . <p> And there are plenty of models leading the way -- Kristen McMenamy has attracted attention for her unashamedly grey locks , while Charlotte T and Kathleen Burbridge are just a couple of on-the-rise faces who have made bleached tresses their trademark . The more extreme dip-dyed trend has fed into a vogue for unnatural hair colours and , having spent so long tackling roots and brassiness , it 's a strange feeling to know that my hair will soon look completely fake -- and that I 'll be proud of it . <p> Bleach has never really been out of fashion , but it has for a long time more readily been associated with the rock scene , with the likes of Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani as its poster girls . Right now , though , the mood for platinum hair is much sleeker and more grown-up : on long hair , as opposed to crops , and tamed , rather than backcombed to within an inch of its life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken lightly , of course , and , having hovered between mousy and **28;62;TOOLONG for almost 10 years , I finally felt ready to take the plunge . It 's absolutely critical that one has a consultation beforehand with a colourist who knows what he or she is talking about , because if this process goes wrong , your hair is for the high jump . Too much bleach and it will turn to dust in your hands ; too little , and you 'll come out the colour of sunset during a nuclear attack . <p> Bruno Elorrioroz is Aveda 's advanced technical director and has worked backstage and front-of-house , colouring models ' hair for shows and ad campaigns , for more than a decade . He 's also the prince of platinum , having created Kathleen Burbridge 's latest bluish-grey tones . <p> " There 's a big trend for white blonde , " he tells me , as he rigorously inspects my hair to check it is strong enough to withstand the chemical process . " There 's something pure and angelic about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the bright , bright colours around now . It 's also really refreshing for your complexion , as it brings a bit more light to the face and fades imperfections . It 's important generally to go lighter as you get older and your skin gets duller -- lighter hair will give you a bit of a lift . " <p> When at the end of the consultation he announces that it will take seven hours to transform me from honeyed to heavenly , I start to worry about ageing simply from being in the chair for so long . But vanity has a price , and my boring old hair and I are feeling pretty impoverished . He also warns me that , because my natural hair colour is quite dark , I wo n't be able to achieve the absolute white-greyness of the inspiration pictures I brought with me . <p> " From being mousy brown naturally with gold , coffee and honey highlights , it 's a big step to go platinum , " Elorrioroz continues , when I return on the allotted day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the worst decision of my life . " But I love risk ! " he trills , snapping on some rubber gloves . My face at this point is set in a rictus grin from the effort of not crying , my hands like claws on the chair so I do n't run straight out of the salon and back into the realm of hairstyles that do n't frighten children . <p> The first stage is not unlike the usual highlighting process : Elorrioroz applies Aveda 's " enlightener " to the parts of my hair that are already coloured -- that is , from the ends up to about an inch away from my scalp . By the end of this phase , I feel a little like a medieval warrior in a full suit of armour and my head is wobbling on my neck under its own weight in tinfoil . This will lift the base colour of my hair to as pale a shade as possible , before the roots ( which will take the colour more quickly because they are not already coated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foils are removed , it 's time for the first of many trips to the sink to have the enlightener rinsed out and a deep conditioning treatment applied , to stop my hair drying out . The biggest risk of colouring hair this intensely is that it will dehydrate so much as actually to crumble away , which is why I chose Aveda for my " transformation " , as Elorrioroz keeps calling it . ( It feels a bit Stars in Their Eyes , and I wonder whether I 'll have to walk through dry ice at the end of it all . ) <p> Aveda 's USP is using plant extracts and natural botanicals to counterbalance and replace some of the potent chemical nasties in beauty products and cosmetics . Although it takes a certain amount of nastiness to lift brown hair to ethereal white , Aveda 's " Kera-Catalyst " is a far cry from peroxide , containing 97 per cent natural ingredients . Nevertheless , my eyes begin to sting a little by the time we 're four hours in . <p> After the first application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custard yellow with an inch of black at the top . After the roots have been treated too ( and yet another sink visit ) , my hair is a uniform pale blonde , albeit styled like Doc 's from Back to the Future . At this point , I assume Elorrioroz 's work is done . " Oh gosh , it really has gone light , has n't it ! " I exclaim . " Well , thank you very much , Bruno . Sorry to keep you so long . " It has been almost six hours . But there is more . <p> What follows is an interminable sink visit during which the lightening mixture is applied all over , rinsed off , applied again and rinsed off once more . By the end of it , both hairdresser and patient have tears rolling down their cheeks from the fumes . Then , blessed relief , a toner is applied . " Toner brings softer shades to blonde , " Elorrioroz explains , " by neutralising it and getting rid of brassiness . It makes sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide pollution and the water that comes from copper pipes in your house . " <p> He talks about my new hair as if it 's a sociable sort of chameleon , sucking the colour from its surroundings . Swimming is out , because the chlorine will turn it green ; smoking too , unless I wear a swimming cap , Elorrioroz says . I think he was joking , but I 'm still worried about standing too close to vividly painted walls or dirt , in case my newly virginal hair imbibes hues like a hen-party does with pi ? a coladas . <p> " It 'll have an effect on how you see yourself in the mirror , " he warns . " You 'll have such a different perception of yourself -- you 'll probably want to buy some new , different clothes , try new make-up , more lipstick , more eyeliner . But you 'll be the Million-Dollar Woman . I call this ' couture hair ' , because it 's so clean , so pure and has such a strong impact . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salon with my new look , a perfectly monochromatic silvery mane , I feel completely different . People are looking at me , and it is n't because there 's something stuck to my face . For the first time , I understand how it must feel to be born " cool " . Because while this hair is actually much easier to pull off than I had anticipated , it still makes quite the statement -- and I 'm not quite used to it being so easy . <p> I am called variously a goth , an albino and Voltaire by my colleagues , my friends and my boyfriend , but it 's invigorating to make the decision to look so completely alien ; it 's quite a rarity , I realise , to be in a position where people do n't recognise you , and it makes you feel slightly invincible . <p> Which brings us back to the party when none of my friends knew who I was . Watching their faces melt from total indifference to joyful glee was pure exhilaration . And having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention -- well , some things never change , do they ? <p> How to keep your platinum perfect <p> White-blonde hair takes a lot of maintenance and , while visible roots look a bit grungy and cool , you 'll probably need touch-ups every six to eight weeks . In the meantime , look after your mane at home by applying deep-conditioning masks and treatments , such as Aveda 's Damage Remedy ( ? 21 ) , whenever you wash your hair . Because the chemical process strips and dries out each follicle , bleached hair needs washing only about every four days . When you do wash it , be sure to use an intensively nourishing shampoo and conditioner , such as Aveda 's Blue Malva range ( shampoo ? 23 ; conditioner ? 18.50 ) , which comes out a livid purple shade -- all the better to counteract pollutants and ensure your tresses retain their gleaming and ethereal silvery whiteness.

Food and flowers had been chosen , work had begun on dresses for the bridesmaids . " Tranquila , hija " ( Be calm , daughter ) , repeated the bride 's mother .

Less easy to quantify , but also a key element of a compensation claim , is " loss of enjoyment " based on how much of your holiday was affected by these problems . <p> Before turning to the settlement services provided by the Association of British Travel Agents ( Abta ) , it 's worth writing to your tour operator again , explaining why you 've rejected the voucher , restating your case and stating how much you feel you should be compensated . <p> If , after a reasonable exchange of letters , there 's no resolution and you reach deadlock , consider following the scheme outlined on Abta 's website ( www.abta.co.uk ) . <p> You 'll need to fill in an online form and send copies of your booking confirmation invoice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent arbitration scheme ( an alternative to court action ) . <p> However , you may find that none of this is necessary .

An hour from now the tide carrying us in fine style up-Channel will reverse , so we will bounce up and down in wild seas and make zero progress .

It is rural England at its most romantic , and a million visitors a year cram the National Trust car-parks along the shore . <p> But this lovely scene of blue water and green hills is not all it seems .

There is the armada of up to 300 boats that invade the bay on sunny summer weekends , people who want to splash around in smooth water or , like me , to dodge a contrary tide or foul weather by anchoring in the only sheltered bolthole available between Weymouth and the Solent . And there are the villagers , who support the weekend boaters because they hate the idea of regulations that stop people enjoying the place . They also want to continue using moorings in the bay for their own boats . <p> On the other side are conservationists and a community of cute , delicate creatures with long snouts and revolving eyes , their curly tails clinging to long blades of eelgrass growing in meadows just beneath the boats ' keels -- seahorses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be banned to protect the seahorses ' habitat . <p> The furore is more than a simple matter of conservation .

For three years , four regional projects have been working with local sea users to identify sites where ' nationally important ' wildlife and habitats require protection . <p> Days of long-winded meetings have resulted in 43 potential MCZs being agreed and mapped out . Details will be delivered to the Government on August 1 , and after three months of consultation the final zones will be declared next spring . Of these MCZs , 13 will be ' reference areas ' allowing no human activities .

A 6in stick-like object covered with greeny spines had turned its back as if trying to make itself invisible and was slowly moving away -- a seahorse ! <p> What 's not to like about seahorses ? Demure little creatures , they waft through the vegetation in a delightfully coy head-down posture propelled by a fluttering fin on their backs .

He fell in love with the creatures as a schoolboy in Malta where his father was in the RAF . He went on to join the marine staff at Paignton Zoo , took on the breeding of seahorse species from all over the world , and set up and ran a seahorse aquarium on Exeter Quay . <p> Along with whales and pandas , seahorses have long been iconic but little was known about them . Ancient Picts had carved them in stone and fishermen found them in nets , but in Britain they were thought to be accidental visitors . Intrigued by a photo of seahorses in Jersey in 1994 , Garrick-Maidment resolved to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sightings reported by divers , fishermen and naturalists produced an unexpected picture .

The trust 's president , Nick Baker , plus three of its four patrons -- Kate Humble , Chris Packham and Mark Carwardine -- are BBC wildlife presenters . Its first move was to put up a case for extra protection of seahorses and in 2008 both species were listed under the Wildlife and Countryside Act as ' threatened ' . This means that they are legally protected in the same way as bats and otters , and habitats must be protected as well . <p> Two years ago the trust was granted ? 42,000 of lottery funds to tag Studland seahorses with little numbered necklaces and study their behaviour .

' It 's sad that authorities do n't live up to their duty to police the bay . ' <p> There is no evidence that seahorses in Britain are declining , because numbers are not known . Nobody is harvesting them for aquaria or Chinese medicine , as in the Far East where many thousands are taken every year . The main problem is their habitat . Eelgrass is not a seaweed , but the only flowering plant found beneath the sea 's surface . Large beds extend along much of the British coast , but worldwide it is under pressure from many human activities such as fertiliser run-off and dredging . It is a nursery for many other species and protects beaches from erosion . <p> ' In marine terms , ' Trewhella says , ' it 's more important than rainforest .

' They create desert conditions , ' Trewhella says . ' We have dived all over it and verified that the bare areas are getting bigger . ' <p> Garrick-Maidment is scathing about the motor-boaters he calls the ' Birmingham navy ' , who know little about seamanship and winch up anchors festooned with tangled roots of eelgrass . One day , when he was scuba-diving , a speedboat even tried to tie up to the float Garrick-Maidment was trailing to indicate his position . Others are said to have ignored shouted warnings and aimed deliberately at divers . <p> Trewhella , 47 , makes no bones about stirring the hornets ' nest . ' Eelgrass is as important to seahorses as jungle is to orang-utans , and I do n't believe its fate should lie in the hands of villagers who are mostly second-home owners down from London and have never been locals , ' he says . In fact , the parish says only a quarter of its houses are second homes or rentals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , so why is nothing being done ? Studland has the biggest concentration of seahorses found so far in Britain and is their only known breeding site , offering a unique chance to study them in the wild . <p> ' We usually find 40 a year but if the site were pristine and healthy we 'd see 200 , suggesting they are in serious trouble , ' Garrick-Maidment says . ' We 're not trying to be killjoys . Boats are welcome but anchoring must be banned . ' <p> One compromise might be eco-friendly moorings that rise and fall with the tide but do n't damage vegetation . They are used in other parts of the world such as France and Florida . ' In any civilised society they 'd be seen as the perfect solution , ' Trewhella says . <p> Villagers woke up to what was happening in their bay when the Dorset Wildlife Trust submitted an article to the parish magazine , edited by Toni Ives .

' They are expensive , need to be lifted for maintenance every year , and boat insurers have to approve them , ' Warner says . ' Above all , there is no demonstrated need for them -- the eelgrass is in good shape and so are seahorses . ' <p> A third squadron came , guns blazing , over Studland 's horizon .

' <p> Reed and a group of Scuttlebutters formed the Boat Owners ' Response Group to represent cruising sailors and their website quickly got 25,000 hits from 7,500 boat-owners . With the villagers , they loudly accused two recent BBC nature programmes about Studland Bay of bias . In a formal complaint , Reed wrote , ' Chris Packham has taken colloquial hearsay and presented a sensationalist and completely false view in which derogatory remarks about " G&amp;T " Sunday sailors were doubly objectionable .

His worry is that once a heavily used bay such as Studland is designated an MCZ , its management will be reviewed every six months and new rules imposed by stealth . ' This is the sting in the tail , ' he says . ' It 's conservation gone bonkers . ' <p> The hallmark of the whole argument is lack of scientific data . Locals and boaters say the eelgrass is expanding . The Seahorse Trust says it is being irreparably damaged and diminishing . Who is right ? There is no hard evidence either way -- nobody appears to know . <p> Dr John Collins of the National Oceano ? graphy Centre in Southampton investigated eelgrass damage in Studland but focused only on the ways in which anchors and chains cause damage . In a BBC radio interview he said he did n't question that the eelgrass was doing well at present , but advocated caution .

When I suggested jocularly to Collins that true scientific understanding of Studland 's eelgrass seemed to be as full of holes as the eelgrass itself he declared himself ' insulted ' and cut off communication . <p> In an effort to get some scientific answers , the Crown Estate and the conservation watchdog Natural England have commissioned a survey in Studland Bay . On the seabed , two similar zones have been pegged out . In one , anchoring continues as usual . In the other , six buoys on the surface ask boaters not to anchor in the area between them so it can be kept pristine . The plan was for divers to make periodic fingertip searches to compare the health of the vegetation in both zones and measure the recovery rate of damaged plants . But the survey got into trouble from the start . <p> Last summer , the yellow buoys marking the voluntary no-anchor zone wandered all over the bay .

Raising anchor and hoisting sail , I resume my voyage to the Solent . The future of Studland Bay will be decided in the next few months when the Government makes its final designation of MCZs and the Marine Management Organisation takes responsibility for them .

@@4236237 <h> You are here : <h> The Amazing Spider-Man trailer analysis <h> By now , many of us have seen the first trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man , but what does it tell us about the finished film ? Here 's James ' in-depth analysis ... <p> The Amazing Spider-Man teaser trailer ( which you can see here ) has given us our first look at next summer 's reboot of Marvel 's flagship character , and it 's our best opportunity to see what the film 's actually going to be like . Let 's see what conclusions we can draw from it ... <p> Back to the beginning <p> It 's clear that director Marc Webb 's reboot is n't just setting the story in the " high schooler with superpowers " period that Raimi 's films glossed over - it 's going right back to the start of his story . <p> There 's more than enough material here to prove that Spider-Man 's origin will be a major part of the film , rather than the subject of an Incredible Hulk-style summary retelling . We see Peter in some kind of ( Oscorp ? ) research lab . We definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we see the tentative discovery of those powers . <p> In many ways , it seems a risky decision . Virtually everyone who sees this film will know Spider-Man 's origin story . Perhaps that was true when Raimi did it , but he had the advantage of being the first person to do it on the big screen . No one vouches for the iconic status of Spider-Man 's origin story more than me - but do we really want to see it done again so soon after the last cinematic interpretation ? <p> Admittedly , studios have groomed us to accept reboots of huge franchises in recent years , with the likes of Batman Begins , Casino Royale and JJ Abrams ' Star Trek . But The Amazing Spider-Man is a test case of sorts . Can a character ( and story ) be recycled so soon without confusing , boring or otherwise alienating the audience ? <p> By the time The Amazing Spider-Man hits screens next year , it 'll be fewer than ten years since Raimi , Maguire et al told their version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic analysis , that suggests that the majority of the cinema-goers watching The Amazing Spider-Man will be same ones who were in the audience for Raimi 's films . Will they take kindly to being sold a story they 've already seen ? <p> Parental guidance <p> Interestingly , the trailer clearly shows us two characters who were left out of Raimi 's version of the origin story - Richard and Mary Parker , Peter 's biological parents . <p> At the start of the trailer , we see Richard insisting to a youthful Peter that " It 'll be safer " for him to live with his aunt and uncle , and telling him that " There 's something your mom and I have to do " . Peter 's narration at the end asserts that " There are two kind of secrets - those we keep , and those that are kept from us . " <p> The strong implication , then , is that a component of this film will be Peter investigating his parents ' death . This has the potential to send the film in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Marvel Universe , Peter 's parents were secret agents who died on a mission investigating the Red Skull . In the Ultimate Universe , Richard Parker was a scientist who created a prototype of the Venom symbiote as a cancer cure , but died in a suspicious plane crash after his project was taken away to be used as a weapon . <p> It seems likely that The Amazing Spider-Man will adapt one of these plotlines - probably the latter , given Peter 's discovery of something belonging to his father in the trailer ( though it 's difficult to say what . Something related to web-shooters/web-fluid , perhaps ? ) . It 's probable , too , that the film will tie Richard 's research to both Peter 's transformation and the appearance of the Lizard , the way the 90s Spider-Man animated series did . <p> Spider-goth <p> Perhaps the most surprising feature of Webb 's teaser trailer is just how downbeat it is .

Webb 's version of the character seems to be darker and more brooding . Surely , no one would be daft enough to think that just because dark and brooding worked for Batman , it 'd work for Spider-Man ? <p> And yet there 's Garfield , doing his best Robert Pattinson impression , all cheekbones , pout and staring into the middle distance as if concealing some deep emotional turmoil . Raimi 's Spider-Man may have been goofy , but that 's half the point of Peter Parker . He was never cool , he was the weird , geeky outsider . In publicity shots , Garfield 's Peter Parker looks more like the missing cast member of Scott Pilgrim than the nerdy , uncomfortable outcast . The teaser does little to dispel that appearance . <p> What we did n't see <p> Perhaps the biggest indication that this is a teaser rather than a full trailer is the lack of any real look at the character in costume . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence ( Spider-Man by way of Mirror 's Edge ) ends with his image reflected in a window . <p> Leaving aside how well you think that sequence works , it 's hard to accept this as the trailer 's selling point . After all , it 's barely four years since we last saw Spider-Man in costume on the big screen . Presenting it to us as if it 's a big deal is optimistic at best . Compared to Raimi 's teaser , which felt bold , original and exciting , this one falls flat ( although , to be clear , it 's impossible and wrong to judge the overall film itself from just a trailer ) . <p> Mary Jane is also notably absent from the trailer . It seems that Gwen will be the primary love interest ( we catch a brief moment or two of what appears to be Peter Parker eating dinner at the Stacy Family 's table ) , so where does that leave Spider-Man 's traditional beau ? She 's definitely in the film , but perhaps not as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lizard . <p> There are a few lines that might yet be attributed to a megalomaniacal Connors ( " Are you ready to play God ? " and " Do you have any idea what you really are ? " - again , making Spider-Man seem more like a refugee from Twilight than a superhero ) but it appears the true nature of Spidey 's foe is being saved for the full trailer . Fair enough . <p> Perhaps the most interesting thing we did n't see in this trailer , however , is much influence of Ultimate Spider-Man . A lot of early speculation about the film suggested that the reboot would use that comic book rework as its inspiration , but between the " classic " take on Gwen Stacy , the inclusion of her family and the use of The Lizard as villain , rather than the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn , there 's very little to delineate it as inspired by Ultimate Spider-Man . <p> Whether you think it 's a good or bad thing , it seems that Marc Webb 's Spider-Man is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The " good old days " is now only mentioned in the past tense . It is a " bygone era " . <p> The days when neighbours knew each other on a first name basis , when people looked out for each other , socialised together and shared common interests and concerns , seem long gone . The pace of life in 21st century Britain and indeed elsewhere in the world has become too fast and furious , beating to the drum of globalisation . Traditional communities are crumbling and relations with our neighbours are all-too-often reduced to a curt nod . <p> Even in my own community of the East End of London , many of us are living side-by-side but rarely mix . Do we really know much about each others ' lives , our shared hopes - or even why it is important to have a joint stake in the well-being of our local communities ? We may pass each other on the staircase or courtyard yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neighbours who live in the same block of flats often find themselves in an awkward situation when suddenly stuck in a lift together , standing in silence , suddenly discovering patterns on the floor or fiddling with a mobile phone to avoid a conversation . <p> The close communal ties that were once emblematic of the East End or the docklands of Liverpool allowed immigrants to come in and integrate them into local life . Some of the first Muslims came as seafarers to these same communities and integrated without problem , whilst still maintaing their cultural and religious heritage . Communities were strong enough to accept these new arrivals . Today social and economic strains are leading to an aggressive ' individualism ' , eating away at our traditional society and the shared values that underpin it . It is to the detriment of us all .

The Labour Party even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white , British working class - so-called ' Blue Labour ' - that has recognised that concerns about housing , economic uncertainty and sometimes ill-conceived initiatives have contributed towards these strains . <p> Today , third- and even fourth-generation British Muslims should inherently identify with what I call a strong ' neighbourly ' culture . Sadly , in practice , this has not always been the case . In many areas Muslims have kept to themselves . Of course , there are some practical reasons for that : ranging from language barriers to racism and a lack of confidence or interest in engaging with non-Muslim neighbours . Rather than practically living out the teachings of Islam , which call on us to be exemplary good neighbours , these Muslims have unfortunately added to the sense of ' fracture ' within their local areas . They should in fact be doing the opposite : meeting and engaging with those around them . As a national community , British Muslims are here to stay and we must do our part in helping make the streets around us better places to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is emphatic : " Worship Allah , and associate no partners with Him ; and do good to parents , relatives , orphans , those in need , neighbours who are near , neighbours who are strangers , the companion by your side , the wayfarer you meet , " states the Qur'an . <p> The Prophet Muhammad himself said : " The best of companions to Allah is the one who is best to his companions , and the best of neighbours to Allah is the one who is the best of them to his neighbour . " <p> That is why we at the Islamic Forum of Europe ( IFE ) have launched the My Neighbours Project fortnight , with activities ranging from soup kitchens , interfaith walks , neighbourhood ' clean ups ' and many other initiatives up and down the country .

@@4238233 <h> Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 Preview <h> Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 Preview <p> There are two ways to tackle this . First , we can choose to look at Modern Warfare with our typical grumpiness and lament the obvious lack of new ideas and the continued reliance on tight , tiny corridor levels and one-off set-pieces . There 's nothing new here , we can write , dismissing Modern Warfare as a series which has coasted on the size of its explosions and basic moreishness of its multiplayer mode for far too long . It 's popular , sure , but it 's not big , clever or new . <p> Yawn . <p> The other way to approach Modern Warfare 3 is with a mind that , while not exactly more shallow in its expectations , is at least more open to being impressed by explosions and car crashes . This approach recognises that Modern Warfare 3 does n't have to rival Baudelaire in depth , nor Sartre in complexity - if it wants to be bombastic then it 's enough for it to achieve that . Pow ! Boom ! Who cares about the tight linearity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fun ? <p> Wow ! <p> Burst our bubbles <p> The truth of the matter , though , is that both viewpoints are incomplete . The reactionary melodramatic that resides in most games journalists wants to instinctively resort to either one or the other , but the reality of Modern Warfare 3 is best expressed somewhere in between . MW3 is insipid and uninspired , but also fun . It 's exciting and new , but also formulaic . <p> This should n't come as a surprise . Call of Duty has been this way for years and , while the passing of responsibility between Infinity Ward and Treyarch has caused minor fluctuations in quality , Call of Duty has also been an anchoring constant for the industry . It has never mattered whether the games were set in World War II or some quasi-now ; whether they pitted you against zombies or terrorists . Call of Duty has always been the same and it has always been fun . <p> The Modern Warfare 3 trailer . You 've seen it before , right ? <p> Sitting down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is summed up by Robert Bowling 's forewarning about some of the enemies we 'll face in the coming wave-defence game . There are dogs with C4 strapped to their bodies , he says , explaining that Spec Ops ' lack of context and story means we should n't get too upset by their inclusion . At first , we roll our eyes - what 's next , zombie Nazi dogs too ? Then we find ourselves enjoying the canine slaughter regardless . Modern Warfare 3 is stupid , but it 's also fun in the basic way that 's made it hard to launch legitimate critical attacks on the series since 2003 . <p> Elsewhere , the singleplayer mode continues in the same vein . An SAS mission called Mind The Gap jumps out immediately because of way it has the SAS battling would-be bombers on the London Underground and , again , a preamble distances the in-game battle from any real events . Moments later we watch the level play out and it 's immediately clear that Activision 's position is defensible - underground car chases , helicopters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speed than the 7/7 bombings . Still , an audience wearied by the constant Churn of Duty ca n't help but let MW2 's No Russian cynically come to mind as another case where the series courted controversy .

@@4238234 <h> His Majesty 's Opponent , By Sugata Bose <p> Subhas Chandra Bose ( 1897-1945 ) -- affectionately known as Netaji , " the revered leader " of India 's struggle against the British Raj - was an unusual His Majesty 's Opponent . He came from a middle-class , affluent Bengali family . Unlike the Gurkhas or the Panjabis , the colonial government regarded the Bengalis as a " non-martial race " . <p> He studied at Cambridge , passed the bureaucratic Indian Civil Service examination with good results , admired the openness of English society and later married a Western woman . And yet he was the staunchest firebrand of all Indian nationalists . Early in his political career , he successfully campaigned to remove Lord Curzon 's offensive " Black Hole " memorial of 1901 from a prime spot in Kolkata . <p> The account of Bose 's adventurous escape from house arrest and constant surveillance in Kolkata to Nazi Germany would humble Osama Bin Laden 's ingenuity .

Even the F ? hrer had to address him as " Your Excellency " and allowed him the facilities for regular broadcasts into India . <p> Though Bose 's first communiqu ? from Germany after his departure created a stir when he announced that the Germans were going to defeat the British and that India was about to win her freedom , his words had little impact . By then , Mahatma Gandhi had already launched his " Quit India " movement with mass support . <p> Undeterred , Bose began creating an Indian Legion from about 3000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as POWs . In spite of the soldiers ' pledge of loyalty to the colonial army , Bose managed to persuade them to join him by speaking individually and promising appropriate rank , salary , benefits and , of course , certain victory .

Strategically , Bose expected that when the German army , approaching from the southern USSR and the Middle East reached India with newly-converted Indian soldiers in the frontline , the colonial army would be hesitant to attack them . Even if they did , the Indians would protest at the massacre of Indian soldiers . <p> In theory it was a win-win scenario , but actually Bose 's masterplan ended in disaster . Germany 's defeat at El Alamein in 1942 halted Hitler 's progress and the Indian Legion 's leadership and morale collapsed .

Without any qualms about Japanese war atrocities , Bose was comfortable with his reception .

So , with 45 per cent of proceeds being paid out in prizes , a 20 per cent performance fee could earn the Treasury ? 524m -- enough to fill in the black hole in the defence budget or reverse spending cuts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child Trust Fund . Deserving causes all . Well , some of them , at least . <p> However , it was actually a hypothetical question put to me this week by Rick Di Mascio , a former pension fund manager who now runs investment evaluation firm Inalytics . He was referring to another multi-billion pound game of chance : investing in equity funds . I say " chance " because he brought me proof that fund managers ' performance is as much down to luck as skill . <p> While financial advisers were quick to laud the 16 as geniuses , an economics professor wrote to say that anyone with an elementary grasp of probability would know that a quarter of a quarter of a quarter must , by definition , be top quartile in all three years . That 's 1.5625 per cent -- or 18 of 1,188 funds . Ergo , the 16 ' consistent ' fund managers were as likely to have been lucky as skilful ( and , presumably , the missing two were just extremely unlucky or extremely inept ) . <p> But Inalytics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a database of every buy and sell decision made by fund managers at 30 different firms , to determine how good their judgment is . By tracking what happens to the shares after they make these decisions , Inalytics can quantify how often the managers get it right , and how efficiently they run winners and cut losers . <p> As one might expect , given the large sample , the win-lose ratio tended towards 50:50 . Over three years , the average fund manager got it right 49.6 per cent of the time , and the best managers just 53 per cent . <p> So Inalytics decided to focus on those managers who appeared to get it right more often than not , and took Australian funds as an example . According to its database , between April 30 , 2006 and December 31 , 2010 , 42 out of 62 Australian funds outperformed the benchmark ASX 300 index -- enough to justify their charges , one might think . Deserving cases all . Well , not quite . <p> When their managers ' decisions were studied in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadvertent contrarianism . Inalytics found that a high proportion of the positive performance came from stocks that the managers had underweighted . In other words , it was the holdings they did n't rate and bought less of that produced the biggest returns ( and vice versa ) . Overall , 39 of the 42 managers owed their positive returns to underweights -- and , for seven funds , the contributions from the overweights were actually negative . <p> Why does this matter ? According to Di Mascio : " These results show that there is a marked difference between the track record of a manager and their level of skill ... This is interesting as many fund managers will charge significant performance fees relative to the index . " <p> Interesting ? Scandalous more like . Just last week , my colleague Alice Ross reported that 91 UK funds are now charging investors up to two per cent a year just for doing their job , plus another 15 to 20 per cent for this inspired performance ( Investors warned off funds with performance fees , July 16 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " These funds effectively charge a performance fee for winning the lottery . If they base the fee on a track record that depends as much on chance , you are paying for luck as much as skill . " <p> It seems that in fund management , unlike any other service industry , you do n't get what you pay for . You pay for what you get .

@@4240233 <h> I 'm Feeling Lucky <p> The first thing you look out for , on arriving in Mountain View to meet anyone from Google , is the little shuttle that ferries workers to and from the company 's San Francisco Bay area headquarters . I ended up as the bus 's only passenger , and was treated to a guided tour by the elderly driver . Mountain View is a company city and the stretch of it occupied by Google is a sprawl of low buildings and perfectly sculpted greenery . Inside might be the toys and sweetie jars that make Google 's headquarters sound like Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory . From the outside , however , everything seems eerily peaceable -- like a real-life version of the neighbourhood-building computer game The Sims . <p> Douglas Edwards spent six years in the Googleplex as Google 's first brand manager , and I 'm Feeling Lucky is a rare insider 's account of the company 's birth pangs and its early years . He can personally vouch for the goodies . " The office was so much more fun than home , " he says , " which was tragically sugar-free and devoid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> IN Books <p> For the most part , however , fun was an afterthought . The point of the PageRank algorithm that powered Google 's search engine was that it was fast , accurate and easy to use . In search terms , says Edwards , it was " the difference between judging a stranger by his looks and gathering opinions from everyone who knew him " . But it was a brilliant feat of engineering by Google 's mercurial young founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page -- an elegant mathematical response to the problem of how to find a needle in the internet 's haystack . <p> Edwards calls himself employee Number 59 , and the Maoist designation neatly conjures up the cultish flavour of the company in its early years . Both Brin and Page are keenly interested in the views of their staff but do n't seem to care at all for soliciting the views of anyone outside the company -- the fashionable mantra of " crowd-sourcing " . Google , says Edwards , was a " company that enforced closeness more than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips ... privacy was hard to come by , and personal hygiene took on added importance " . <p> In Edwards 's telling , Page is the efficiency nut while Brin is impulsive and more of a joker ; Eric Schmidt , the arriving executive chairman , is hired to be the weary voice of business pragmatism . There are some telling vignettes . At one point , Brin suggests taking the entire marketing budget and using it to inoculate Chechen refugees against cholera or to give out free Google-branded condoms to high-school students -- for those who are feeling lucky , presumably . After one of those periodic panics about what Google is up to with our data , he begins pacing up and down the room and demanding that more technical information is put up on the site so that everyone knows that " There is no privacy issue " . <p> No one wants for ambition , and everything is susceptible to a geeky solution . At one point , Page floats the idea that Google could be the online publisher of all online content , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from books to music -- not a bad idea , in retrospect , given the problems facing the established media . Immediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 , the patriotic Brin trawls through Google 's logs for searches that involved " Boeing " , " aviation schools " , " Logan airport " and " fuel capacity " . It turns up nothing of interest . When the company first goes public in 2004 and its stock races through the roof , both Brin and Page seem less interested in the valuation than in the technology used by the traders . <p> For the most part , however , this insider expos ? makes working for Google sound rather dull . He devotes most of a chapter to the story of how Google hired a chef to feed its Oompa-Loompas , and records the menus he e-mailed out daily : " Soups : cream of asparagus , savory mushroom &amp; lentil . Salads : Thai noodle , old-fashioned potato salad , carrot dill , organic mixed greens . " In the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff could have been mined for satire , or shoehorned into an artful tale about the humming tedium of the electronic office . Here , however , it 's delivered straight-up , as if reading what Google had for lunch might tell us something profound about its rise to power . <p> What Edwards 's story ca n't quite get around is the fact that he was a conventional brand manager in a company which did n't much need one . True , he thought up the name for Google 's enormously lucrative AdWords advertising programme , which fillets search keywords for advertising opportunities . Most of the time , however , he was pretty much surplus and he 's smart enough to know it . " I do n't claim to have ' built ' Google 's brand , " he says . " In a company where products were the brand , brand management would become product marketing . I knew that was the natural order of things . " In one meeting with Brin and Page , Edwards hears a Google engineer say that " brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , which is as good a way of putting it as any . For a long time , Page does n't even allow the B-word to be used at Google -- it would imply that the product alone was n't enough . <p> If there 's one business lesson worth taking away from I 'm Feeling Lucky , in fact , it is that Google 's enthusiasm for the nuts and bolts of its products over the free-floating attributes of its brand was one good reason why it just grew and grew . Google went from upstart to quasi-monopolist , nimbly avoiding the vanity parade of big companies who were busy polishing up their images . <p> When Edwards gets around to drafting a memo laying out the company 's brand strategy for Schmidt , its guiding principles include the notions that " paid ads work against our brand " and " we 'll grow faster getting current users to search more than by mass marketing " . Both of which tend to empty the brand manager 's cupboard of its traditional tools . As Edwards finds himself increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and then he leaves .

@@4240235 <h> Euro crisis : If he cares about British voters , David Cameron will have to upset Nick Clegg <p> The advocates of an ever closer union leading to the European Empire have won the day again . Put aside the arguments about whether yet another Greek bailout will be enough to calm the markets . There will probably be another one after that . <p> More important by far is the cat let out of the bag by President Sarkozy . He set out the truth of the matter plainly enough : " Our ambition is to seize the Greek crisis to make a quantum leap in Eurozone government . " That , of course , has always been the purpose of the single currency . No one with any pretence of economic reality ever believed that the currency could survive without a single finance ministry and a single tax system which would create a single pan-European government . <p> It is a long time since I challenged the then Chancellor , Ken Clarke , to name a currency which had more than one Chancellor of the Exchequer to its name . If the euro is to survive , then , the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation . Two , let alone 22 , treasuries is too many . <p> Again , Sarkozy made that clear . As he put it , he and Angela Merkel have plans for an embryonic EU treasury by way of the European Monetary Fund , and would soon propose plans for " economic government " in the eurozone . <p> In the meantime enough will be squeezed out of the German taxpayers and perhaps the private sector to keep the Greek economy on a life-support system that will preclude any substantial reduction of its debts or significant economic recovery . The unfortunate Greeks have been given all possible forms of assistance except actual help . They will be allowed to default on their debts , but to gain no advantage from doing so . <p> There were three possible options to resolve this crisis . One was to allow Greece to leave the eurozone , recreate a devalued drachma and reinvigorate its economy . The second was to create two eurozones , the northern " hard " eurozone and the southern " soft " eurozone , which could pre-empt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Merkel , Sarkozy and the Commission have chosen , is to march on towards their dream of " ever closer union " in the grand European Empire stretching from the Atlantic across the continent of Europe , down to ( or even beyond ) the Mediterranean and through Turkey into Asia . <p> There is a great problem in that vision . It has not been achieved since Roman times . It has been attempted time and time again from the time of Philip of Spain to that of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin without success . <p> Now in the 21st Century it will have to overcome the nationalism of European states in its modern form of a demand for democracy , but as Enoch Powell declared long ago that could not work on a pan-European scale since " there is no European Demos " . <p> The EU already has the legal status of a state : it has a flag , anthem , frontiers , a Foreign Ministry , embassies , a defence force , courts , judges , a currency and now , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And without that Demos of citizens sharing newspapers , language , cultures , habits , political parties and more which is essential for it to be a democracy , the riots will not be confined to Athens . They will proliferate and spread , because the people will lack the power to control those who govern them . <p> We are entering a European autumn . The winter will inexorably follow and we can only hope that a European Spring will not be long delayed . <p> In the meantime , at our parochial United Kingdom level all these events are putting some extra strain on the Coalition .

In fact the EU itself found few enough friends . I think peta was an apologist for it writing about the terrible things that our " friends " in Europe might do to us if we left . Most of them would be illegal under the WTO . They would also do as much damage to other EU states as to us . <p> He also observed that I was a member of a government which tolerated the fisheries policy . Exactly so .

Then boester said no one represents the average Englishman , lord lucan made the shrewd point that no one listens to the ordinary people across the EU . <p> I was glad that Oberstleutnent picked up the point that fish stocks will only be sustainable as long as someone owns them and can profit from that ownership .

Its central character , Sir Henry Cecil , belongs to some Wildean parable -- one that shows how the fast set might learn from the example of their horses . For the quicker your horse , the sooner your race tends to be run . Yet Frankel , as fleet a thoroughbred as many remember , has so far just kept on galloping . <p> In 2000 , when they were 57 , Cecil lost his twin brother , David , to cancer . Six years later , the doctors found the same disease in his stomach . In the meantime , one of the great achievers in Turf history had been reduced to a pitiable , marginal figure ; a beautifully dressed wraith . The previous year , the man who accumulated 10 trainers ' championships between 1976 and 1993 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baronial lair on the hill above Newmarket , corroded by bitterness . <p> Yet the colt he runs in the Qipco Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on Wednesday could well prove his crowning glory . This unbeaten , unfettered talent most obviously evokes the man after whom he was named : Bobby Frankel , Prince Khaled Abdulla 's principal trainer in America , himself claimed by lymphoma in 2009 . But it is another grief that has contributed most to his fulfilment . <p> " It was like losing half of you , really , " Cecil reflects . " When David died , for a long time , half of me seemed to have gone . " <p> He sits in his study , surrounded by testaments to his craving for the exquisite : the model soldiers , knights , pipers ; Georgian military drums ; a fossil of a shark 's tooth ; nude statuettes . All these ephemera -- like his dandy wardrobe , or his rose garden -- always seemed like manically sharpened points in some palisade of frivolity , to preserve him from the slings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he lost David , Cecil was bereft . Everything was going wrong . His second marriage was in ruins ; his stable would soon be going the same way . There was only one way back . He had to start living David 's life for him ; to complete his own with its missing half . " In a lot of ways , I think that was so , " he says . " He 'd have been very upset , looking down , if I had n't picked myself up from disaster . Very upset . So yes . Probably a lot of it , I 've done for him . " <p> One of his first resolutions was to quit drinking , albeit he protests he had resisted a family addiction . He never drank during the day , certainly , but in the evening would open a bottle of red and rarely stop with a glass or two . " My brother had been an alcoholic , and my mother was , " he admits . " But it just did n't agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either could n't stop laughing , or I got slightly aggressive . So I went to see a doctor and he said you 're not alcoholic , but to some people drink is poison . So I gave up that day and I have n't had a drink since -- nor wanted one . I 'd had divorces , financial problems , I 'd lost my driving licence . I became like a hermit . I was quite depressed . It was a time when everything was getting on top of me , with my brother dying , the horses dwindling to nothing . And it was n't helping . So I gave it up , just like that . " <p> Large , loose hands rise from his long , folded legs in a vague gesture of self-deprecation . At 68 , there remains something physically captivating about Cecil , with all his familiar tics -- the rolling eyes , the wry droop of mouth and eyelids . There is a hint of the simian to the wide expanse between nose and lips ; and yet the overall effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular beauty ; his father , a dashing army captain , was killed in action in North Africa shortly before the twins were born . It is curious to wonder what strain of Cecil 's genius might be traced to this man . <p> Cecil has been told that his father was fairly wild . " But he was only 28 when he was killed , " he says . " When I say he was wild , he enjoyed himself -- he was only a young man . I mean , I was wild as well , when I was younger . Maybe I got that from him . " <p> Some legacies were more overt . His mother soon provided a step-father , in Cecil Boyd-Rochfort , who trained here at Warren Place until Cecil took over in 1969 . By then , he had married the daughter of another outstanding trainer , Noel Murless . Between their lore , and his own flair , Cecil made this the most glamorous yard in Europe . In 1999 , he remained so pre-eminent that he came within a neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighth Oaks winners , in 2000 and 2007 , were divided by an abrupt , bewildering fall from grace . <p> A stable of 200 blue bloods shrank to a humiliating rabble of barely 50 , owing their last vestiges of quality almost exclusively to the fidelity of Prince Khaled . The spiral seemed irreversible , and was mercilessly distilled by the ghastly , cadaverous aspect Cecil acquired in chemotherapy . It was precisely this nadir , however , that provoked the bereaved twin to discover a latent , surprising , better self . <p> In this he was fortified by Jane McKeown , whose precious , understated solidarity gained formal status when they married in 2008 . But Cecil accepts that he might never have made his epic professional recovery -- crowned by Frankel , but by no means contingent on him -- were it not for the final doom that threatened to flood the tide of his private troubles . <p> " You get to a stage where you look at things , set out realistically what is happening , " he says . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I 've always been a winner . I had to become a winner again , hmm ? I do n't like being an also-ran . So that 's probably one of the things that made me sort of claw back . " <p> He gives a brief , embarrassed laugh . The old fl ? neur retains a scrupulous dread of the earnest , the personal . <p> " I do n't like to be defeated , " he drawls . " I like to beat everything , you know ? Beat depression , get on with life . Try and beat what I 've got . It 's important . Also to have some respect from other people . " <p> And , presumably , some self-respect ? " You do n't want to let anybody else down , " he shrugs . " So basically you 've got to fight back . You only know whether you can when you 're in that position . But you 've just got to do it , have n't you ? Just got to get on with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to surrender his cherished old hack . But he wobbled on to the heath at the same time , every morning , inwardly sustained by the condescension of inferior trainers , who asked each other why he did not just retire . He derived grim satisfaction from every place he retrieved , by heroic increments , back up the prize-money table . <p> " I might not be competitive on the outside , " he says . " But I am on the inside , definitely -- underneath , very competitive . Always have been . We like winning , you know . We do like winning . It 's what motivates you . Nobody likes failure . Your horses are running badly , or they 're no good , you get jealous of everybody else . It 's not quite so much fun , is it ? " <p> He never lost the regard of the racing public , with whom he has always enjoyed the relaxed , bantering intimacy of a true patrician . In their eyes , his recent knighthood was quite supererogatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own struggles . <p> " My advice is always to take the good things from the day , and push everything nasty out of the way , " he says . " It 's not straightforward . But if I had n't done it , there would n't have been any result . You have to be positive . If you concentrate on the good things , you will feel better -- mentally , then physically . If you 're depressed , mentally , everything 's going to go . " <p> Even when brutally forced to confront the things that really matter , Cecil never lost his love for the purely ornamental . " No , " he demurs , frowning . " I 've always liked nice things , and nice things are ... a comfort .

Basically 99 per cent of the talk is piffle , is n't it ? It 's nothing important . " <p> He is not really scandalised , though . How could he be , when he has himself always obsessed over minute judgements of shoe or sock or shirt ? " My mother was a compulsive shopper , and I do love shopping , " he says . " I 'm not as extravagant as I used to be . I 've enough shoes . But I would have liked to design clothes . Or gardens . Though I know nothing about gardens , really , whatever people say . " <p> What he truly loves in horticulture , as in everything else , is its exoticism . Outside , he points out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago in some Australian canyon , where they had been minding their own business since managing to survive the sauropods . " Oldest tree in the world , that , " he says casually , as his long , lank limbs lead you towards a big , mesh pen . <p> With surprisingly brusque hands , he grabs samples : wineberries , impossibly sweet , and the famous peas . One of Boyd-Rochfort 's relations accompanied Howard Carter into Tutankhamun 's tomb . " Out of one of the mummies fell four or five dried peas , " Cecil says . " He put them in his pocket , took them back to Ireland and , after two and a half thousand years , they germinated . They 're much taller than normal peas , much bigger , lighter in colour . And amazingly good eaters . " <p> So the Egyptians were not wrong . If not quite into the afterlife , something of the world could endure .

" <p> That is not how he will be remembered now . It is no mystery if Frankel , this conspicuously energetic horse , should seem preternaturally suffused with life .

But they could be worth ? 40,000 . <p> When Gordon Brown introduced child trust funds in 2005 he proclaimed : " Our aim is a Britain of ambition and aspiration , where not just some but all children have the best possible start in life . The child trust fund CTF is designed to ensure every child has assets and wealth and that no child is left out . " <p> The reality is likely to be very different . <p> Millions of children are going to be bitterly disappointed when their parents hand over their child trust fund account when they reach 18 . This week Mark Hoban , the financial secretary to the Treasury , will announce that the new junior individual savings account ( Jisa ) due in the autumn will be able to shelter up to ? 3,600 a year tax-free , instead of the ? 3,000 indicated when CTFs were closed to new savers . Yet with all eyes focusing on the Junior Isa , six million girls and boys with CTF investments risk being forgotten . <p> There is evidence to suggest that many parents have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to top up the fund . <p> Children who qualified for the fund got a voucher worth ? 250 at birth and another ? 250 at age seven -- but parents , friends and family can invest an extra ? 1,200 each year to boost the tax-free returns . However , according to the Tax Incentivised Savings Association ( Tisa ) , around 20pc of schemes get average monthly contributions of ? 25 , while 10pc of plans receive a lump sum of around ? 530 added each year . This means that around four million children with CTFs are relying on just the government handouts to ensure they have " assets and wealth " . <p> Most of the accounts so far have been invested in so-called stakeholder accounts . These are share-based accounts that typically track the FTSE All Share index -- but returns so far have been mediocre to say the least . This has not been helped by the market turmoil during the credit crisis and subsequent recession . The annual fee of 1.5pc , which is high for tracker funds , has also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholder CTF . It invests in the L&amp;G All Share Tracker but over the past five years the fund has returned just 14.5pc after fees , whereas the All Share index itself has risen by 24.5pc . <p> With such a poor start it would seem that these children are going to be some way off saving enough for a deposit on a home or funding their university years . Even a second-hand banger looks a far-fetched bet . <p> The prospects are even poorer for children who have an estimated ? 500m wallowing in cash CTFs . Interest rates have fallen sharply since 2005 and , given the Bank of England report out last week that suggested that Bank Rate was likely to stay at 0.5pc for some time yet , the outlook is grim . Even when rates do rise they will increase only gradually , according to the consensus among economists . <p> Certainly , rates for cash CTFs are pretty poor . Nationwide , which is one of the biggest providers , pays just 1.1pc on its cash CTF ( this is bumped up to 2.1pc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ) . <p> A child who invested their ? 250 in a cash CTF with Nationwide would be sitting on ? 328 today -- with interest of 1.1pc they are getting a " real " rate of return after inflation of minus 3.9pc . Assuming all things remained equal for the next 13 years , their trust fund would be worth just ? 199 in today 's prices . <p> A Nationwide spokesman said : " As a result of the historically low interest rate environment , returns on deposit accounts are generally lower now than they were a few years ago . We do encourage our cash CTF customers to save regularly ; we find that around two-thirds of them do so . " <p> CTFs get a poor deal compared with providers ' Isa rates . Which ? , the consumer champion , found that of the 11 providers offering cash CTFs , seven offered better cash Isa rates to adults . The good deals are also on the wane . Hanley Economic Building Society , which pays 5pc on its CTFs , no longer accepts transfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds now closed to new savers , there is a fear that rates will only decline as savings providers concentrate their efforts on the new market for Junior Isas , which will replace CTFs in November . And , with current rules preventing CTF savers from transferring their funds to a Junior Isa , millions of young savers could be trapped on poor rates . <p> Richard Lloyd of Which ? said : " It 's incredibly important that young people get into the habit of saving , but banks and building societies are doing little to encourage them by offering such paltry rates . <p> " The situation is set to get worse , as unless the Government allows transfers from child trust funds to Junior Isas , a whole generation of young savers could be stranded on uncompetitive rates .

The children to have benefited most are those with parents and grandparents who can afford to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That is where the decent money can be made . Plough the maximum each year into a fund that invests in shares and a child could be looking at a pot of almost ? 40,000 when they turn 18 .

If Piers is still invested in the fund today , he will be sitting pretty , as the index is up by 150pc since . <p> Even a small monthly sum will make a considerable difference over the long term .

But it rests on false assumptions . It is true that many skilled workers here will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more skilled " mean ? Restaurant owners will tell you that they employ Eastern Europeans because they know how to be professional : they turn up on time , look people in the eye , shake hands when necessary , listen attentively , take an interest , sit properly , stand properly , and take pride in their work . Restaurants do n't employ Poles because they are " skilled " waiters , or even experienced ones . The difference is that unlike their British rivals , most have stayed in school until the age of 18 , where they have learnt the skills that are necessary for success in the workplace -- whatever workplace that might be . <p> The qualities that Lord Jones and others are looking for are , ironically , the very ones that our schools used to be good at inculcating : how to be professional , how to wear a uniform with pride , how to meet deadlines that count , how to complete homework and do as one was asked . In short , they encouraged students to have a real sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocational training are suggesting is , in effect , that the workplace should make up for the failings of the education system . In fact , this is already happening : McDonald 's offers 4,000 of its employees coaching towards Level 1 Literacy , the equivalent of a grade D-G at GCSE , because so many fail to reach the literacy levels expected of an 11 year-old . <p> In his interview , Lord Jones pointed to the fact that nearly half of our children fail to reach grade C in maths and English . Common sense would suggest that if these children are n't capable of reaching the required standards , why waste everyone 's time by keeping them in school ? <p> This is the second false assumption : that these children are not gifted enough to get these GCSEs . It is a reasonable enough one to make -- until you realise the extent of the chaos that exists in many classrooms , the low level of expectation fostered by the system ( and resisted by most teachers ) , and the lack of proper leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply are n't bright enough , and should be encouraged to attend colleges and get work experience : but they are a small minority . <p> On the homepage of his website , Lord Jones is quoted as saying : " In a fiercely competitive world , we should not compete on cost alone , but on our ingenuity . " Is n't that what school is meant to be all about ? Sure , it 's good to know who Churchill was and how to speak some French -- but it 's better to lead the brain through a variety of complex subjects and train it to develop that very ingenuity . <p> As a child , Lord Jones won a scholarship to Bromsgrove , a public school . He played rugby and hockey for the school , and was even made head boy . A few days before he was due to graduate , he was expelled -- with what would have been an excellent record -- after streaking around the quadrangle to win a bet . <p> The irony here is that what taught the young Digby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his traditional education . His school inspired him to push the boundaries ; when he did so inappropriately , it made sure he paid the price . It is by keeping our standards high in school that children will learn how to succeed in the workplace later . Lord Jones and Sir Richard Branson ( who attended Stowe ) are the perfect examples . <p> Looking around at the state of our schools , it 's easy to understand why some people want to throw up their hands and turn to the workplace instead . But before we give up , it 's worth trying to fix the system first .

Having been invited by Damon Albarn to contribute to the album Plastic Beach , and having co-written " Empire Ants " and " To Binge " , they found themselves playing arenas . <p> Listening to Little Dragon 's new album , Ritual Union , you can see why Albarn , pop 's greatest experimenter , is a fan . It is hard not to be drawn in by the minimal beats and synth grooves of their electro-soul , which are overlaid with the airy vocals of Japanese-Swedish singer Yukimi Nagano . <p> The drummer Erik Bodin and bassist Fredrik Wallin were drawn to her at high school , in 1996 . Nagano was 14 when the pair , two years older , invited her to join their band . " From the very start , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was extremely shy , but she had this super-dark voice , she could sing very low .

" Back then she had a fiery temper , " says Bodin . " I think when you 're young you do n't know how to express what you feel and you get angry . At some point someone called her a little dragon . " <p> Poised to enter the Top 20 with Ritual Union -- their two previous albums went nowhere near the chart -- Little Dragon might now have to relinquish their cult status . <p> " It 's very exciting , " says Nagano . " It feels like we 've put so much work and heart into it . But I feel like nothing has happened suddenly . There has n't been that one moment where suddenly our song was played on the radio and everything changed . " <p> Instead , everything has changed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second album , Machine Dreams . It is not only Albarn who has been won over by their charms .

Andre 3000 is such a big fan that he tipped off Big Boi , who will now produce one of the band 's songs for his new album . <p> " It 's super flattering " , says Nagano . " It 's crazy how someone that you have listened to and has somehow shaped who you are has suddenly come back and said that they 've been inspired by your music . " As a teenager , Nagano loved Saadiq 's R&amp;B supergroup , Lucy Pearl . " That was kind of crazy to hear , " she says , " that he thought our album was the best album of the year .

But being on the road and meeting other artists and inspiring people opens that door . I think if the vibe is there , and there 's a kind of connection , then why not ?

" It 's all very much about being spontaneous . We want it to feel fresh . " <p> Nagano describes Albarn 's working methods with childlike enthusiasm . " His studio was real cool . When we were writing with him , there was a bunch of instruments , everything from church bells to percussion stuff to all kinds of different synthesisers , so the guys would jam something and you 'd just record that .

" <p> You might have imagined that Little Dragon would have upgraded to a shiny new studio , to parallel their climb to fame , but they like to keep things just as they were when they began . <p> " We 'll stay there until we get kicked out , " says Nagano . " If we were in some fancy studio and the clock was ticking away and it was costing so much to be there and you have an engineer -- just having a stranger in the room can change the whole energy of your creativity .

" We were just stuck in our little place , writing music . We forgot to go to the post office and forgot to pay our bills and only went out to get food . It was a funny time in our lives because we really dived into writing music , playing music . That was all we did , we were just writing songs and jamming out . We became lost in there .

" The album 's sound was informed by everything from Brian Eno to Busta Rhymes to commercial pop and African house music , which Bodin picked up while visiting his wife 's family . The trance-like , minimal feel of that music rubbed off . According to Bodin , though , it was Nagano who most shaped this album . <p> " She has developed a lot over time , but it feels like on this record she 's very direct , " he says . " It feels louder . We just try to decorate the music along with her voice . Since she 's very direct , it made the music more minimal . Because we were doing everything ourselves on this album , we were confident to strip it back and have it minimal rather than adding and adding .

" But the winter , cold and darkness can inspire you to be creative and do something . " <p> Having met Bobby Womack , De La Soul and members of The Clash while on tour with Gorillaz , Little Dragon are not ruling out further collaborations . " We all shared the same childish passion for music , " says Bodin . " Bobby Womack said the simplest but wisest things , like ' It 's unpredictable what 's going to happen , just stay true to yourself ' , and it made a big impact on us .

@@4252238 <h> Palladium Metal Investing Primer <p> Often lost in the shuffle and the talk about gold and silver as the primary precious metals is another metal , which has uses that rival that of silver , is brilliant in appearance and makes a beautiful coin . Its value has quadrupled since 2003 after seeing an all-time high in 2001 , and potentially the best aspect yet is that the supply and demand fundamentals have never been better . Guess it yet ? I 'm talking about palladium . Over the next several pages , we 'll take a look at the many uses for palladium , who the big producers and consumers are , prices , and most importantly , the future outlook . The purpose of this article is not to form specific recommendations , but rather to raise awareness of another of the semi-precious metals and to act as a primer for familiarizing people on its fundamentals . <p> By way of introduction , let me say first that palladium does not have a rich heritage as a monetary metal like gold and silver . Rather , it is akin to platinum in that you can buy coins ( Maple Leafs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recognizable by and large as their gold and silver counterparts . The metal is more of an industrial metal , which one might immediately think is bad because by definition , it is susceptible to swings in economic output . This would be true , however , as is the case with energy and other products , we must keep in mind the interlocking nature of the global economy and that we need to be focused on aggregate demand as in global demand , not aggregate demand as in sub-regional or regional demand . Palladium is also not an effective inflation hedge . Looking at historical prices through 2006 , you 'll quickly notice that the peak was in 2001 , hardly the pinnacle of dollar destruction . However , over the past several years , palladium , like most other commodities , has trended upwards as the dollar has come under increased attack . <p> Palladium 's Uses <p> Probably the most well known use of palladium is in autocatalysts or catalytic converters . These can be made of platinum as well , however , palladium has several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oxidation , meaning it will last longer in catalytic applications , is softer and more ductile , and is generally cheaper than platinum . Auto-catalysts are by far the biggest use for palladium at the moment and such catalysts are even present in hybrid cars as well , meaning demand is not likely to be adversely affected even as many car owners switch to hybrids in the coming years . One possible risk to palladium demand would be a revolutionary breakthrough on the electric/solar/LNG side , which would make it feasible for a large amount of car owners to affordably switch to the new technology . There are certainly examples of these , but they are by no means a threat at this point and I would n't foresee such developments becoming an issue over the next several years at a minimum . These types of major changes are generally slow to occur . As of 2009 , roughly 45% of palladium was used in autocatalysts . This number was down from over 53% in 2003 , which bodes well for the diversity of uses for the metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its metallic characteristics make it a very suitable substitute for gold in plating of sensitive electronic components . The fact that it costs roughly half that of gold makes is a shining example of the substitution effect in practice . As of 2009 , around 15% of palladium <p> consumed went into electronic components . Jewelry accounted for roughly 14% of palladium used in 2009 . Investment in the metal accounted for 10% of 2009 demand . This is very important because in the earlier part of the decade , investment in palladium was trivial at best despite the fact that the metal had very recently been at a record high . Interest has been multiplying significantly , however , most metals investors still have yet to make their first purchases of palladium . <p> Rounding out the balance of Pd 's uses are dentistry and chemical refining , where it is used to develop raw materials for use in synthetic rubber , polyester , and nylon . It is also utilized in oil refining where it is present in several types of hydrocracking applications , photography , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are many diverse uses for palladium and this fact alone bodes well in that it serves to insulate prices somewhat from the stagnating USEconomy . <p> Palladium Supply and Demand <p> As of 2003 , the situation with regards to palladium was eerily similar to that of the rare earth metals in that much of the globe 's resource base was concentrated into a very small oligopoly of producers . In that year , nearly 80% of global palladium production came either from the Russian Federation or South Africa . By 2010 , Russia was largely tapped out of palladium . Its purported massive stockpiles were diminished to nothing and its three biggest mining projects were all in advanced stages of decline . Russia has been supplementing mine production from its Norilsk mining company with sales from Gokhran , the state repository ( a stockpile ) , and the Russian Central Bank -- obviously another stockpile . In early 2010 Anton Berlin , a director of Norilsk , stated that there would likely be no sales from the Russian repositories in 2011 . <p> While the exact content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Berlin did confirm that sales out of the stockpiles have been declining since early in the decade . At this point , the largest palladium deposit on earth exists in South Africa in the form of the Bushveld Complex . Currently , the only other producing nation that has significant upside potential in terms of production is Zimbabwe . However , it is a locale that is loaded with political risk among other things at this stage of the game . There are currently several projects going on in North America , the most promising of which exists at Thunder Bay , which could end up producing nearly 40 million ounces of palladium . It must also be understood that the projects in the Thunder Bay area are for the most part in their infancy and real production is likely several years down the road . <p> The market will need every ounce from these projects because light vehicle production is set to increase through 2016 . If you 're worried about a worsening of the US recession killing off demand , consider the fact that China is outpacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several other jurisdictions like India and Brazil where more stable economic environments will lead to growth in middle classes that will take to the road as well . Remember ; consider aggregate demand , not just regional demand . Other factors that will provide upward pressure on palladium usage are increases in investment demand , medical uses , and , in particular , the petroleum industry as shrinking supplies of crude oil demand even more efficient refining techniques . Palladium has also been a part of many of the early work in fuel cell technology and while it is impossible to gauge what the impact will be at this stage , fuel cells will clearly be in focus as the world comes to grips with peak oil and seeks suitable alternatives . <p> Summary and Outlook <p> Palladium has several big advantages over many of the other metals in the commodity space . First , it is practical in terms of holding a physical position should one desire . Compare it to copper , for example , where a $1000 position requires you to hold over 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not practical for the average investor to hold a physical position at all . As I outlined above , supply and demand dynamics favor higher prices in the future , and while it was not the focus of this article , there are some very significant opportunities in the palladium mining space for those who wish to take advantage in that manner . The obvious risks to palladium are the same as the other industrial metals . Another severe global recession would likely dampen demand enough to keep prices in check . Such a recession/crisis , if it were to impact the capital markets as we saw in 2008 , would likely impair mining firms ( especially exploration/development types ) from getting the necessary capital to fund their continuing operations . Innovation , especially in the automobile space , represents a risk to the current demand profile for palladium , but innovation also presents more potential uses for the metal as well . <p> The bottom line on palladium is that while it is certainly not the sole answer to protection against dollar destruction , there are some very compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration .

@@4252240 <h> Posthumous album from Winehouse will have a reggae feel <p> A posthumous album by Amy Winehouse is likely to move away from the jazz influence of her two albums and be reggae inspired . Music industry insiders have also hinted it may prove her most autobiographical work . <p> The singer , who died aged 27 last Saturday , could have as many as seven singles in the top 40 this weekend . Meanwhile , details have been emerging about scores of new tracks she had recorded that are likely to become an as-yet-untitled third album . <p> Her record company remained tight-lipped over the album 's contents but , according to her biographer , many of the new songs have a reggae feel , inspired by the time she spent in St Lucia last year . " In what we can tell from the third album , I think she had been quite influenced by reggae , " said Chas Newkey-Burden , who wrote Amy Winehouse : The Biography in 2009 . Speaking from his home near Windsor , Mr Newkey-Burden added : " I think Amy would have been quite keen for a slightly indulgent third album . It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like . " <p> Recording sessions on the album were fraught and Winehouse was said to be unsatisfied with the work . But it is unlikely her record company will try to prevent the songs from seeing the light of day . <p> " Personally , I think her third album should n't be released , " said Mr Newkey-Burden . " Obviously , it 's up to her family , but , as a fan and her biographer , I would be against it being released because it would muddle the legacy . The only way it would be fair would be to release it as a ' sessions ' -type album . But I suspect they will try to whip it into an actual album . " <p> Chris Goodman , Winehouse 's publicist , confirmed there was a lot of material available , but would n't be drawn on when it would be released . " She wrote all the time , " he said . " If it 's for a new album , it 's difficult to say . I remember sitting down last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs and people were excited . The music was n't a completely new direction , however .

" I 'm resigned to the fact that whatever was made will come out , " he said . " The fans love the artist and want to hear more ; record companies want to recoup their investment . Together , they 're a formidable double act . With Amy , we do know that her recordings in St Lucia were a failure . But people will be curious . Just as long as these recordings are not presented as being worthy of Back to Black , or ' a great lost Amy Winehouse album ' . " 
@@4254231 <h> Sarah Churchwell : The wilful ignorance that has dragged the US to the brink <p> The Tea Party version of the American Revolution is not just fundamentalist . It is also Disneyfied , sentimentalised , and whitewashed <p> Monday 1 August 2011 23:00 BST <p> Here 's a monumental historical irony : a moment in the origins of the United States that every American schoolchild learns to view with pride , the Boston Tea Party , has now become a symbol of our ( inter ) national shame . In one sense , it is difficult to know what to say in response to the utter irrationality of the Tea Party 's self-destructive decision to sabotage the American political process -- and thus its own country 's economy , and the global economy . <p> Last week , while the US government was locked in stalemate and risked defaulting on its national debt for the first time in its history ( and thus also defying the Constitution that Tea Partiers supposedly hold sacred , which declares in the 14th Amendment that it is illegal for Congress to default ) , Michele Bachmann instructed her followers not to listen to those who attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default if it did n't raise the debt ceiling . When , of course , that is precisely what it would have done . But the Tea Party has never let facts get in the way of its belief system , and now that belief system is genuinely threatening the wellbeing of the nation they claim to love . <p> Mottos are supposed to express a philosophy : in so far as the Tea Party can be said to have anything so exalted as a philosophy , their motto is quite telling . They are one of the most inaccurately named movements in American political history , but that inaccuracy is itself emblematic of the party 's adamantine ignorance . Any American schoolchild can tell you the motto of the historical Boston Tea Party from which they take their name and -- they mistakenly believe -- their inspiration : " No taxation without representation . " <p> Impatient with those extra two words , evidently , the Tea Party has truncated this proposition to something simpler : " No taxation . " Never mind that the US has among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by Mexico and Chile ( are these the nations the Tea Party would like to emulate ? ) . Never mind that the nation 's actual Founding Fathers were perfectly prepared to pay taxes -- they just thought those taxes should purchase them a democratic voice in their own government . <p> The motto that came out of the Constitutional Convention was not " In God We Trust " : it was " E Pluribus Unum , " out of many , one . The phrase " In God We Trust " emerged from the American Civil War , but it was n't put on US currency until the Cold War , in 1955 . The following year , the same year he signed the Civil Rights bill into law , Eisenhower made it the nation 's motto . <p> In other words , In God We Trust is an act of revisionist history and retrospective religiosity , reinserting religion into our national history . But the attempt to create one from many has led to Civil War more than once ( the American Revolution was a civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South and other states threatened to walk out of the Constitutional Congress , did secede in the 1860s , and revolted again in 1944 , with the so-called ' Dixiecrats . ' ) <p> Texas was forever threatening to secede . The Tea Party could secede with my blessing : E Pluribus Unum is clearly not a motto that they are prepared to embrace -- despite their supposed reverence for the Founding Fathers and the American Constitution . <p> Anyone who followed last year 's midterms and knew anything about American history already realised this . Tea Party candidates kept invoking semi-mythical figures such as Paul Revere , who was not a Founding Father at all : in fact , most of Revere 's supposed story was a legend written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1860 to rouse popular sentiment on behalf of the Union cause in the Civil War -- in other words , to maintain the spirit of E Pluribus Unum and fight against divisive polarisation . <p> Tea Partiers love mentioning Thomas Paine because they think they share his " Common Sense " ( otherwise known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bothered to read it , and are clearly unfamiliar with essays such as " Public Good " , in which Paine wrote that , especially while at war ( as America currently is , of course ) : " To have a clear idea of taxation is necessary to every country , and the more funds we can discover and organise , the less will be the hope of the enemy . " <p> As Harvard historian Jill Lepore argued last year in her brilliant The Whites of their Eyes : The Tea Party 's Revolution and the Battle over American History , none of the people voting for the Tea Party candidates knows any of this because they have n't studied American history since grade school , when all American schoolchildren learn a simplified , cartoon version of the American Revolution ( which we would never call the " War of Independence " ) . <p> It is a Sesame Street version of the American constitution and politics , a myth that is being treated as the alpha and omega of our political and legal reality . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a myth of genesis , it 's a creation myth about America that is just as simple as the idea that God created man and woman : the Founding Fathers created America . <p> The Tea Party version of the American Revolution is not just fundamentalist : it is also Disneyfied , sentimentalised , and whitewashed . It rests on a na ? ve , solipsistic and exceptionalist faith that for America it will all work out in the end , because America is " the greatest nation in the world " . They take solace in tautology : America is great -- this they know -- because Fox News tells them so . <p> Their goal , as others have said , is to roll back the clock a century and more . In 1892 , when the robber baron and corrupt financier Jay Gould died , Mark Twain wrote a scathing epitaph : Gould , he said , " reversed the commercial morals of the United States . He had put a blight upon them from which they have never recovered , and from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Jay Gould was the mightiest disaster which has ever befallen this country . " <p> It has been a century and we have surely not recovered : but we have managed to create an even mightier disaster . It remains to be seen whether we will recover , but it is long past time to stop making declarations of independence . We need to get back to work forming a more perfect union -- or any union at all . <p> Sarah Churchwell is Professor of American Studies at the University of East Anglia

@@4254240 <h> The Real Problem With Internships <p> Last week , David Willetts - the Universities Minister but also the Chair of the Government 's Gateways to the Professions forum - launched a new government code for Internships . <p> The code , which it is hoped will be adopted by most professional organisations , aims to make high-quality internships - long the finishing school of the middle-classes - more accessible for young people from less affluent backgrounds . Currently , the thinking goes , unpaid internships are contributing to stagnating social mobility by blocking access to those without money or contacts . <p> Broadly , the code has two approaches . First , to encourage ample remuneration for interns , the rallying call of the unions and others who cry exploitation at the unpaid nature of internships . This approach , though well-intended , is misguided . Second , to make such crucial placements openly advertised with a fair , rigorous recruitment process . Fortunately , this addresses the real problem with internships . <p> The code points to the National Minimum Wage Act , which stipulates that any worker - that is , someone with set tasks and deadlines - must be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , exceptions : volunteers , for example . Willetts knows he is on slippery terrain . So do thousands of employers , especially in sectors such as the creative industries where small businesses reign , who regularly advertise for " voluntary interns " . <p> Luckily , research from the Social Market Foundation suggests the majority of young people from all social backgrounds and regions are not put off from the unpaid nature of internships . In fact , most have done unpaid work experience at some point in their lives . They are exercising choice when undertaking internships , seeing it is as an investment which will accrue greater returns in the long-run : and they 're right to make this call , since studies demonstrate that those with work experience have greater employability . <p> The fact is internships in our top professions are incredibly competitive . You 'd expect ambitious , well-qualified young people to apply . So the reason for poor social representation in these internships , first and foremost , is because of the well-documented poorer prior educational attainment of those from less privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent background does do a high-quality unpaid internship , they are hungry for success and so tend to find imaginative ways of being able to afford their placement . Many do part-time jobs in the weekends or evenings or use a bank overdraft . <p> The unpaid nature of internships is not really the problem . Where internships could be hindering social mobility is that they are still quite informal . If a placement is not properly advertised , those who are better connected - children of parents already in professional occupations - have an advantage , since they can find out about and secure these opportunities through word of mouth . Worse , if internships are not promoted as a formal part of the steps towards securing a career , those who are n't as well-connected will not realise how vital these experiences are . <p> The best thing employers can do is make sure work experience is open to as wide a pool of young people as possible , by advertising on a single gateway , ensuring fair and rigorous recruitment , and reaching out to as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internships , as proposed by the SMF in our report Disconnected . <p> Considering young people are making an investment by undertaking an unpaid internship , its vital employers provide a high-quality experience which justifies a lack of pay and offers good returns in the long-term . Again , SMF proposed that best practice internships include inductions , performance reviews , a guaranteed reference letter and the opportunity for a final stage-interview . It 's good to see the government highlighting these practices for employers looking to sign up to this new code . <p> Let 's stop fixating on trying to wipe out the unpaid nature of internships . This could do much harm in fact , by reducing the number of employment experiences young people , particularly those from less privileged background with lower educational attainment , can engage with to get a foot in the door . <p> Instead , let 's tackle the real problems : fighting the nepotism that still determines access to our top professions and , much more importantly , improving the educational performance of young people from less privileged backgrounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The ship , a converted American cargo vessel , was sailing up and down the Firth of Clyde , allowing her aircraft to practice take-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rocked the ship and sent her aircraft lid soaring high into the air . <p> Initial theories were that the explosion could have been caused by either a U-boat torpedo , an enemy mine , an aircraft crashing while attempting to land on the deck , or the engine crank case blowing up . <p> The first three assumptions were quickly discounted as the Firth of Clyde was considered too dangerous for U-boats , the surrounding area was the biggest minesweeping base in Scotland , and surviving officers were completely unaware of any planes landing at the time . <p> An engine room problem remained the most likely reason , but although the enquiry was held the findings were not made known . Rescue ships had been told " This incident is not , repeat not , to be spoken about " while the survivors , without receiving any kind of counselling at all , were sent on 14 days leave with the strict instructions : " Do n't ever talk about the sinking of HMS Dasher ! " <p> But now , almost 70 years on and thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ayrshire , some of the facts have finally been uncovered . In The American Connection to the Sinking of HMS Dasher it is revealed that the Board of Enquiry found the explosion most likely occurred in the main petrol compartment , and was ignited by either a man smoking in the shaft tunnel or someone dropping a cigarette down from the Fleet Air Arm messdeck above . <p> A damning report to the Admiralty from the Royal Navy deputy controller also recorded that in spite of safety on the type of ships being low , compared with normal standards , the personnel did not seem to have been particularly trained nor special precautions taken . <p> George " Dodie " Irvine was born on 4th August 1913 in Ivy Cottage , Charlotte Street , Lerwick , where he lived with his mother , father , brother and four sisters . <p> He was always interested in boats and boating and enjoyed competing in model yacht regattas . That soon developed into bigger boats and he became the proud owner of a Shetland Model with which he took part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocers D &amp; G Kay in Lerwick , where he was said to be an ex ? tremely popular shop assistant and a great favourite with customers . He attended the Lerwick United Free Church where he was a member of the choir . <p> In his spare time he enjoyed the open air which included cycling , sailing and camping . He was also a keen observer of nature , especially bird life . <p> He married Margaret " Manga " Thomson in 1940 and their only child Irene was born in October 1941 . <p> When the war broke out and call-up came , it was natural that the navy was his first choice . He had been home on leave and returned to his ship just 10 days before the terrible news came that he was " Missing in Action " . <p> Two weeks later , when a second telegram arrived , stating that that he must be " Presumed Lost " , The Shetland News stated : " He was an exemplary young man who was highly respected and much loved by all who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irene Oliphant and living in Ayrshire , was just one and a half years old when her father was killed , so remembers nothing about him . But she said the whole family were devastated by his death , especially her mother who never re-married . <p> The new book opened up a fresh awareness for her of events surrounding the Dasher , and she was amazed at the emotion it stirred up in her . But sadly her mother died in 1984 without ever learning what really happened to her husband . <p> According to the book ever since the day the American-converted ship was handed over to the Royal Navy there had been a persistent smell of aviation petrol . The Royal Navy advised the Americans that there was a design fault in the aviation fuel system . However , the Americans denied there was a problem . <p> The day after the sinking funeral arrangements were made for the 60 Dasher fatalities that had been brought ashore by the rescue ships . Incredibly only 12 of the casualties were officially buried with full military honours at Ardrossan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the next three weeks more and more bodies continued to be washed ashore , and were collected and taken to Ardrossan Harbour , which was the local Royal Navy base . At the end of each day the bodies were taken away on the back of a local contractor 's lorry , covered with a tarpaulin . <p> An Admiralty document dated 6th April 1943 , marked " Top Secret " and signed by Jas Eccles , Director of Operations Division , stated : " Bodies are being washed up , identified , buried etc on the coast . It is evident the Dasher missing bodies comprises of two groups . Those who were brought ashore and disappeared , the others who were washed ashore over a three-week period also disap ? peared . " <p> When the Americans were ad ? vised that the Dasher had blown up and sank due to an onboard ex ? plosion , they changed the design of the aviation petrol system on all future aircraft carriers . <p> Mr Steele searched records and interviewed witnesses , with all the evidence pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year he approached North Ayrshire Council and presented his research . This resulted in Dr Tony Pollard , director of Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University , organising a low-level radar survey within the cemetery . A specific small area of ground was targeted and a report read : " The survey does not rule out the possibility that there may be a large pit containing numerous bodies without coffins . " <p> Regarding the mass grave , if Mr Bruce had been off duty at the time of the explosion he would not have been in the hangar area where the terrible fire raged . In that case he would have lost his life when the Dasher sank , or when he was in the water . Until such time as the MoD releases the identity of those in the mass grave that will remain unknown . <p> Mrs Oliphant says her mother was informed that her husband was missing presumed dead . No other information was provided and that remained the case for the duration of the war and beyond . <p> She said : " In 1973 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at this point we were informed that the ship had sunk between Ardrossan and Arran . Sadly , Manga died in 1984 not knowing any further details . <p> " What really got to me and all the folk I spoke to at the Dasher memorial service in 1996 was the totally unnecessary withholding of information especially as it was published in two national newspapers in 1945 . Many people still never knew until the appearance of John Steele 's first book in 1995 . <p> " I often thought when I was young that maybe some day my dad would turn up . These things were seldom talked about . I do n't remember my dad but I 'm told that he had a great sense of fun , was great company and kept everyone cheery , often playing the mandolin and accordion and loved cycling and sailing . The family all missed him very much and were devastated by his death especially Manga who never re-married . <p> " Coming across John 's book in a bookshop was a complete accident but it opened a fresh awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of emotion this stirred up for me , both in reading the book and in meeting , at Ardrossan , relatives of those lost and survivors themselves .

The idea that the disturbances were nothing more than spur-of-the-moment criminality seems inadequate . We demand deeper causes . If we are on the Left , we blame poverty , racism or police brutality . If we are on the Right , we blame failures in welfare and education that have produced a generation with no sense of responsibility . <p> All these theories are beside the point . They might be true , but they did not abruptly become true last weekend . While potentially interesting , they do n't help us to understand the suddenness or the scale of the unrest .

On their last two visits to London with Dudamel , the Venezuelan youngsters put on their colourful national colours , played a selection from West Side Story and threw their instruments up in the air and caught them . I suppose that such antics would n't have sat very well with the devastating and heart-rending effects of Mahler 's second . <p> Nevertheless , I strongly suspect that of those 15 minutes of applause , 12 were in appreciation of what the audience had just seen and heard , and three were a plea for that fondly remembered encore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4279231 <h> article <p> 08.17.115:21 PM ET <h> The Last Boy Scout <p> Rick Perry might just be America 's proudest Eagle Scout . How his love of merit badges started a beef with Mitt Romney and launched his run for the White House . <p> The fight is still fresh for Mitt Romney and Rick Perry . But the 2012 campaign is n't the first time the governors have found themselves in a disagreement . Their first spat was over a cause near and dear to the Texas governor 's heart -- when Romney rejected the services of the Boy Scouts for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games . You do n't get in the way of America 's Tiger Cubs or Cub Scouts -- not if Rick Perry has anything to do say about it . <p> In Perry 's account , Romney , a fellow Eagle Scout , nixed a plan to allow Olympic workers to stay at a Scout camp because the Olympic bureaucrats were scared of protest . In 2000 the Supreme Court had ruled that the Boy Scouts could legally exclude open homosexuals from their ranks . Adding insult to injury , neither Perry nor any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Perry says in his 2008 book , On My Honor : Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For , an ode to America 's Scouting youth . <p> Even worse ? Romney had the same squishiness into his first campaign , a 1994 run against Sen. Edward Kennedy . Perry writes in the book : " Whether pressure from gay rights groups caused Olympic organizers to resist volunteer assistance from Scouts , we know that Romney , as a political candidate in the politically liberals sic state of Massachusetts , has parted ways with the Scouts on its policies over the involvement of gay individuals in Scout activities . " <p> At the time of the Olympics , Romney said there was no beef : " We 're very pleased to have Scouts help out , " he told the Deseret News . The local troops were being excluded not because of politics , but because of an age requirement , Olympic officials said . Later Romney was criticized by Democratic opponents for sitting on the Boy Scouts of America board , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry , who likens homosexuality to alcoholism -- genetic but ultimately degrading only if the afflicted individual gives in to temptation -- stands firmly behind the organization 's decision to exclude open gays . " I do not believe the teaching of sexual preference fits within the parameters of Scouting 's mission , " he writes . <p> Today , there are 2.7 million Boy Scouts and more than 1 million adult volunteers involved in 115,000 units . Many of those families likely appreciate Perry 's rectitude and his steadfast defense of their uniformed youth . Those millions make for a good start to a grassroots campaign , even if most of the Scouts are n't old enough to enter the voting booth . <p> Perry is n't the first candidate to go from Scouting to stumping . We 've even had an Eagle Scout in the White House before . Young Jerry Ford earned the honor in 1927 . John F. Kennedy was a member of Bronxville , N.Y . ' s Troop 2 when his family lived there . We 've had Eagle Scouts scarf down corn dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gephardt , who earned his medal in 1955 . But it 's safe to say we 've never had a presidential wannabe with such affection for the outdoors program . Rick Perry is the first , and I 'll bet my bugling badge the last , presidential candidate ever to write a whole book in praise of Scouting . <p> They say Rick Perry has great instincts . He 's never lost an election , after all . From the book 's beginning , Perry 's horse sense is on full display . " You may be wondering , " Perry writes , " ' why would the governor of the second largest state choose to write his very first book about the Boy Scouts ? " Yes , why ? Because if you want to understand Rick Perry , the man , you 'd better get to know Rick Perry , the Boy Scout . <p> Perry is from the fly-speck town of Paint Creek , Texas . His father called the place Big Empty , and Scouting filled the void . The man to see in Paint Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cow-counting , tractor-driving farmer , " his son Mike Overton , a veterinary doctor , tells The Daily Beast . On the Overtons ' 500-acre farm , Rick and the boys would run ragged . When anyone got out of line , Mr. Overton would step in . <p> " Mr. Overton could have descended from Mount Sinai . What he said was law , " Perry writes . <p> Riley Couch , a Dallas banker who came up with Perry , recalls how Overton administered justice . <p> " He had a board of education , " Couch says . " It was a paddle . " <p> Overton not only helped Perry and his friends earned their badges ; he also opened up a world outside Paint Creek . They drove to Dallas for state fairs . Couch and a couple of buddies sneaked into a hotel , where they rode an elevator for the first time . They went to College Station for football games , where Perry fell hard for Texas A&amp;M , Overton 's alma mater . In 1964 Perry joined the Scouts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baines Johnson went , too . <p> " Kennedy was killed in November 1963 . Needless to say , the Texas Scouts were n't too popular , " says Couch . " I remember the first night there -- Rick was n't in my tent -- New Mexico Scouts started throwing things at us . Next thing , a hatchet flew past me . Rick got along with the foreigners , as we called them . " <p> Perry 's view of the outside world has n't changed too much since then . He 'll vigorously defend the Scouts no matter who the perceived enemy might be . Besides that turncoat Romney , there are bullies everywhere . Atheists and gay activists are the most threatening . <p> His biggest bugaboo might be the American Civil Liberties Union , the individual-rights organization , which has been particularly litigious when it comes to the Scouts . Everywhere , Perry sees an assault on his wholesome Scouts ; the judiciary and the ivory tower are both stacked with liberal relativists . Psychiatrists are overdrugging America 's kids . Even the whole math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal arithmetic . Pretty typical of what keeps conservatives up at night . <p> ' I remember the first night there -- Rick was n't in my tent -- New Mexico Scouts started throwing things at us , ' says Couch . ' Next thing , a hatchet flew past me . Rick got along with the foreigners , as we called them . ' <p> Is there anything for a liberal to love in this Eagle Scout ? Well , sure . According to On My Honor , Perry and Michael Dukakis once had a conversation . Perry grew up on a farm with free-range eggs . Perry has a conservationist 's soul ( just do n't ask him about that climate-change stuff ) . Perry watches women 's tennis .

On top of those big-name treats there are also some great must-have indie titles . We do n't favour the big boys here . <p> Gameloft 's take on Naughty Dog 's critically-lauded Uncharted series , Shadow Guardian , is an adventure on a scale not often seen on iPhone -- it 's pretty epic .

It 's not a purist 's racing game , but supplies more than its share of fun . <p> 58 . Isotope <p> By Affogato <p> Released June 2009 <p> Although it 's a game for mobile devices , Isotope offers more depth than many of the console-bound games it 's inspired by -- most notably Geometry Wars . A twin stick space shooter with elements of roleplaying included to keep you hooked , there are many hours of gameplay on offer here . You can buy new ships , and upgrade them with new weapons and armour . The neon-style graphics give Isotope a high recognisable style too -- even if it is an already-familiar one . <p> 57 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A novel take on the tower defence genre , Defender Chronicles ditches the usual top-down view of game style in favour of a side-on view .

It 's based on the console game of the same name but features a campaign that does n't just ape that seen in its bigger console brothers . Played from a behind-the-shoulder perspective , you control a suited soldier as he taken on hordes of nasty , many-limbed enemies . Scary stuff . <p> 54 .

Ultimate Spider-Man : Total Mayhem <p> By Gameloft <p> Released August 2010 <p> Gameloft is a publisher often accused of nicking ideas off others , and borrowing bits from its previous games . But every now and then it hits it out of a park with a game that tops its genre . Ultimate Spider-Man : Total Mayhem did this for the third-person action adventure back in 2010 .

Even though these unpaid , legally unqualified volunteers deal with more than 90 per cent of the country 's criminal cases , their only reward is a sense of doing something worthwhile for the community . This year is the institution 's 650th anniversary , and various events had been taking place to celebrate it . They had not , frankly , caused much excitement . <p> Then came the August riots . Suddenly , events inside our magistrates ' courts have become front-page news . Sessions have been held through the night , and even on Sundays . Serco vans queue nose to tail outside courthouses , waiting to unload prisoners . Bleary-eyed lawyers totter from one client to the next , with barely time for a cup of coffee . Reporters cram the press seats that have been vacant for decades . <p> The transformation of savage urban rioters into shamefaced teenage girls , or little boys with embarrassed-looking mums , has been a daily drama . Attention has shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how effectively we are dealing with the thousands who have been caught . <p> As a magistrate , my impression is that the system has acquitted itself pretty well . Despite the impact of scything budget cuts , the courts have risen to the occasion . For more than a week now , they have been processing cases far more speedily than usual , with only rare discrepancies in sentencing . <p> Although much of the judicial work has been handled by professional district judges , JPs have been exceptionally busy . The chief disappointment among my magistrate colleagues in Haringey , where the trouble started , is that nearly all the north London cases are being heard in Highbury Corner in Islington , since the court has far more cell space . This has not stopped our JPs from volunteering to help : after all , the whole point of the magistracy is that it provides local justice , administered by local people . <p> Some aspects of our work have not been readily understood . Politicians demand that every convicted looter should be jailed . Senior police officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of youngsters who have been allowed to walk free after pleading guilty . The implication is clear : the judiciary are a bunch of softies , wilfully turning a deaf ear to the public 's cries for vengeance . <p> Such complaints are disingenuous . As those politicians and policemen well know , magistrates are not free to sentence offenders as they please : they must follow the guidelines laid down by statute . For every offence , there is a carefully refined scale of punishment , taking into account the nature and gravity of the crime , the effect on the victim , and the age and character of the offender . <p> For magistrates in the youth courts , it is particularly galling to be castigated for not locking up those who caused mayhem . The fact is , no child under 12 can be given a custodial sentence , under any circumstances . A child aged 12 to 14 can only be locked up if he is a persistent offender . And anyone under 18 with no previous record who pleads guilty must almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There have been similar misunderstandings when it comes to adults : magistrates can only send offenders to prison for up to six months , with any offence that carries a higher tariff being referred to the crown courts for longer sentencing . <p> Over the past fortnight , we have witnessed an unusually well-publicised demonstration of local justice , dealing with eruptions of criminal behaviour that have been all too painfully local . The value of such a judicial system , rooted in the community , has never been more evident . The threats to the magistracy 's future , especially from court closures , have not gone away . But a Government that makes so much of its commitment to swift and effective justice might want to think again about how it can best be delivered . <p> Trevor Grove is a London JP and author of ' The Magistrate 's Tale ' ( Bloomsbury )

" Just leave it in the sink , " she says . " I 'll do them later . " <p> On August 29 Clijsters will begin the defence of her US Open title , which she won in 2005 , 2009 and 2010 . But even as she prepares for perhaps the biggest tournament of her career , she is ensconced in a picture of domestic normality . Yes , she is training and psyching herself up to defend at Flushing Meadows . And yes , it is a bout of preparation that has taken on extra urgency as she overcomes a spate of injuries and approaches her final seasons of peak performance . Yet in between physical therapy sessions , serve and volley practice , weight training and runs , she is busy cooking for Jada and her American husband , Brian Lynch , and playing foreman at the ? construction site she calls home . <p> Maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Open would make Clijsters the three-time defending champion at Flushing Meadows . She would be only the second woman , after Chris Evert in the 1970s , to win three or more consecutive titles there . It would also make her the most dominant women 's player at the majors this year . Coming off last year 's victory at the US Open , she started this season with a win at the Australian Open , her first down under . She was ousted early from this year 's French Open , a wide-open tournament eventually won by Li Na , the first Chinese player to win a major . Then , just days before Wimbledon got under way this summer , Clijsters withdrew with an ankle injury . Wimbledon was another unpredictable tournament , and the ? women 's singles victor was Petra Kvitov ? , a ? relatively unknown 21-year-old . In early August , Clijsters withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Toronto after tearing a muscle in her stomach . She still plans to compete in New York . <p> A third consecutive US Open would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her generation , and give her victories at three of the past five majors . " I 'm feeling better , " Clijsters says of her forthcoming matches . " At the French Open I felt like I could move around the court . " <p> She deflects skilfully any inquiries about her legacy . Even in English , her second language , she can bat a nosy question back to a spot from which it is hard to return to the point . When asked about defending the US Open , she replies , " As a child I was very insecure , I always tried to please people . With tennis I was just able to focus on the ball . I still do that now . " <p> The most she will give away is that she still has an insatiable hunger to compete at the highest levels of her sport . " It 's those quarter-finals , semis and finals that make it special , " she says . <p> The US Open , however , will be perhaps the most competitive tournament on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury-plagued field is expected to have returned to health , and Clijsters will have competition from the likes of Venus and Serena Williams , Maria Sharapova , and a new generation of fast , hard-hitting players coming on tour . <p> Clijsters is not willowy and lithe like the eastern European pros that have become the alluring face of women 's tennis . Instead , the 28-year-old is built more like Serena Williams , the American player who , with her sister Venus , has dominated stretches of the women 's tour for the past decade . With muscular legs , a forceful torso and long , strong arms , Clijsters has used her impressive physique to excel on court . Opponents fear her booming groundstrokes , and she is perhaps best known by the public for her acrobatic ability to drop into a full split as she reaches low to return wide shots . <p> Her sandy hair is packed into tight curls , framing a round face with big cheeks that amplify a mischievous grin . Her eyes , wide and blue , seem large enough to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maintaining a top-tier body is a full-time affair , and has taken on added urgency now that Clijsters is a mother . She avoids processed foods and is drawn towards homeopathic remedies . " I 'm all about holistic medicine and healing , " she says . " We never had antibiotics at home , we always had herbal treatments . " To maintain flexibility , Clijsters practises yoga , and intends to install a yoga studio in the tennis academy she owns in Belgium . <p> With her husband Brian Lynch and daughter Jada , after winning the 2009 US Open <p> In the weeks leading up to a major , Clijsters works out five hours a day . She might begin with a run on a nearby beach , take a break to cook lunch for Jada and Lynch , spend a few hours doing weight training at the gym , then practise hitting on a nearby court . " I love training , " she says . <p> This gruelling regime is not Clijsters ' only sign of toughness . She has " Jada " tattooed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " B " , for Brian , where her wedding ring would be . " I 'm not the most organised , " she says , by way of explanation for the tattooed " B " . " I always had to put the ring away and take it on and off for practices . " This way , ? nothing gets mislaid . <p> She also has a more unconventional means of ? staying fit . When I inquire about a series of bruises on both her arms , Clijsters tells me that she and Lynch often box together . " The couple that goes boxing together is very unique , " she says , explaining that they recently went a few rounds on their fourth wedding anniversary , just days before . " He said ' Happy Anniversary ' when he hit me . " <p> To succeed at the highest levels of tennis , ? however , physical toughness is not enough . Winning a major requires the kind of mental mettle that few players can summon on a regular basis . Clijsters ' own record tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before winning her first US Open championship in 2005 . She played another four semi-finals before retiring in 2007 . When she returned in 2009 , Clijsters won the first major she entered ; her second US Open title and the first of her current streak . Fans have taken to calling her " Comeback Kim " . <p> She credits her recent psychological successes to her trainer , Sam Verslegers . " He has very good ? techniques to keep the mind where it should be , without the nerves taking over , " she says . <p> She has also become better at dissecting her opponents ' technique , and adjusting mid-match . " What I love is when something bothers me , " she says . " I 'm not the person that will let it all out , I will try to figure it out and find the ways to beat them . I love sitting on the side of the court and changing my momentum and the way I 'm feeling . " <p> Just as her nerves on court have calmed , Clijsters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're more worried when you have children , " she says . She is currently the only mother playing on the women 's tour , a distinction made all the more spectacular by the calibre of her play . She and Lynch travel with a nanny , but Clijsters remains a hands-on mother . " Now that I 've been home with Jada for a couple of years , I realise how spoiled you are as a tennis player , " she says . <p> Clijsters in an outfit for the photo shoot <p> Clijsters is protective of Jada , and is playing fewer tournaments so that she can spend more time with her daughter . " This is my lifestyle now , " she says . " I do n't have the full schedule . It 's my choice to be home more often . " <p> Playing fewer tournaments has had a material impact on her standing . Even though Clijsters has been playing her best tennis in recent seasons , winning more majors than any other player of late , in recent weeks she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tennis Association tour . The WTA awards points based on a number of factors , including how many tournaments one plays in .

She hopes to represent Belgium in the 2012 Olympics in London . " I wonder if it 's going to be easier or not , " she says . " I do n't know what the Olympic rules are . I do n't know how many rounds there are . There are a few countries who have a lot of girls now . " <p> . . . <p> As our conversation winds down , a photographer sets up in the kitchen . Clijsters disappears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin , but Clijsters stalls . She has realised that she does n't have a watch from one of her sponsors in the house . " I never think of that stuff , " she says . " I 'm supposed to put it on after I finish a match , but that 's not what I 'm thinking of . " Clijsters ' mother-in-law shows up ? ? 30 minutes later with the appropriate watch , and the photo shoot proceeds . <p> Being famous is a sort of necessary evil for ? professional tennis players . Like most elite athletes , they did n't excel at sport out of a hunger to be well-known . Instead , ? players such as Clijsters rise to fame by virtue of their on-court accomplishments . It may seem like an obvious distinction , but for someone like her , who shies away from the spotlight , it serves as a reminder that she is player first , celebrity athlete second . <p> " I 'm not going to say the celebrity ? lifestyle is bad , but it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , and once in a while it 's fun . But it 's not because I want to be on TV . " She wants to make it clear that " I play tennis because I love tennis , not because I want to be famous . " <p> But , pressed , Clijsters acknowledges that fame has its perks -- she confesses that she was able to get her tickets for The Lion King through a ? connection at the US Open . And it also affords her the status , and cash , to fund charities , such as SOS Children 's Villages , which cares for orphans around the world . <p> With the photo shoot over , Clijsters readies ? herself for some on-court practice . I take the ? opportunity to chat with Carl Maes , a fellow Belgian who coached her early in her career and who this year returned to coach her for this final run .

Observing the ? transformation , Maes says : " I think that she likes this outfit a bit better . " <p> We drive in a caravan to the Atlantic Tennis Club , a well-maintained but by no means luxurious club in suburban New Jersey . It 's a trip Clijsters often makes on her own , riding her bicycle the few miles from her home along a wooded bike path . Before hitting , Clijsters jogs around the court , then tosses a football back and forth with me , Verslegers and Maes . After a series of stretches to loosen her up and build strength in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue concrete . <p> On court , even against Maes , Clijsters is a different woman from the mother in the kitchen .

" <p> She 's working , but she clearly enjoys the effort . " You can start playing for the wrong reasons , " she says , implicitly giving notice that so far , she 's avoided that fate .

They all know what to expect from the big players ; Volkswagen will have the largest display , Alfa Romeo the prettiest girls . And they thought they knew what to expect from Lotus . <p> Despite its illustrious past , the British car-maker was a perennial underachiever , its tiny motorshow stands -- if it could afford to attend at all -- featuring one or two cars that looked more carelessly parked than proudly displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at the Hethel factory . <p> Not this time . Lotus 's stand at the last Paris Motor Show was more than twice the size of Ferrari 's . The food was by renowned caterer Len ? tre . Mickey Rourke and Naomi Campbell were on hand to draw attention to not one , but five silk-shrouded shapes . Few had any idea what lay beneath . <p> When the sheets came off , there was a gasp . Here were five sports and supercars that bore a closer resemblance to Aston Martin 's range than the tiny Norfolk manufacturer 's . <p> When it became clear these were real cars , which Lotus was planning to build within five years , investing ? 850 million it does n't currently have , there was mayhem . Hours after the cars were unveiled , the usually seen-it-all-before crowd was still five-deep and Lotus 's burly PR man was forced to play bouncer . <p> Dany Bahar had been in the car industry for just two years when Proton - the Malaysian car-maker that bought Lotus in 1996 - asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrari boss Amedeo Felisa and McLaren chief Ron Dennis quickly arrived with their retinues to examine their new rival . And in the middle of the maelstrom , smiling gently as people queued to shake his hand , was Dany Bahar , Lotus 's new , 38-year-old CEO , and the mastermind of the entire show . <p> Lotus is one of Britain 's most extraordinary companies , its racing success and engineering brilliance overshadowed only by its permanent air of financial peril . All of this it owes to its founder , Colin Chapman . He was Britain 's Enzo Ferrari ; as an engineer he has been compared to Brunel . He founded Lotus in 1952 , aged 24 , with a loan from his fianc ? e and from a yard behind his father 's north London pub . <p> From humble beginnings , Lotus beat Ferrari as the first Formula 1 team to win 50 Grands Prix . Chapman 's influence on F1 was immense ; he pioneered everything from active suspension to tobacco sponsorship and his team gave Ayrton Senna his first F1 win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won seven constructors ' and six drivers ' titles and the U.S. Indy 500 . <p> Chapman 's obsession with lightness and purity extended to his road cars and made them sensational to drive ; the Lotus Seven of 1957 is still a benchmark for simple , naked excitement . The Esprit was one of the iconic supercars of the Seventies and Eighties , a genuine Ferrari rival and the star of Bond movies , Basic Instinct and Pretty Woman . <p> For almost the entire period of Proton 's ownership , Lotus has relied on one model - the Elise - and some closely related spin-offs , with the bigger , more expensive Evora arriving in 2009 <p> But despite all this , Lotus has never been financially stable , and that came from the top too . <p> A Lotus is a discretionary purchase , and the company 's sales have fluctuated wildly with recessions and oil crises , from a low of just 320 cars in 1993 to over 5,000 in 2005 ; it now sells about half that . Former Lotus CEO Mike Kimberley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Chapman 's death from a heart attack in 1982 meant he avoided what would have been his darkest hour : likely conviction and imprisonment for what a judge described as a ' barefaced , outrageous and massive fraud ' . <p> In 1978 Lotus was contracted to engineer the ill-fated DeLorean sports car ; Chapman and the American entrepreneur John DeLorean were friends . Keen to encourage industry in Troubles-torn Belfast , where the car would be built , the British Government provided millions of pounds in subsidies , which were channelled through a Panamanian company . <p> When DeLorean went bankrupt in 1982 it became clear that most of the public money had simply disappeared ; it 's alleged that DeLorean and Chapman took around half each . <p> In the end , only Chapman 's finance chief Fred Bushell was convicted of conspiracy to defraud ; he pleaded guilty but refused to reveal what had happened to the money , and received a three-year sentence in 1992 . <p> The judge remarked that if Chapman had lived he would have got ten years . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dany Bahar laughs as he recalls his first contact with the top brass at Proton , the Malaysian car-maker that bought Lotus in 1996 and has soaked up its losses ever since . <p> The Exige , a coup ? variant of the Elise <p> Born in Turkey and a Swiss national , Bahar worked for a wealth-management firm in Liechtenstein before moving to Red Bull and masterminding its sports-sponsorship strategy , setting up its two F1 teams . In 2007 he was poached by Ferrari to run its global sales and marketing operations . He 'd been in the car industry for just two years when Proton asked him to take charge at Lotus . <p> Bahar put together arguably the most ambitious expansion plan the sports car world has ever seen , and only agreed to join when the Proton board backed it . This approach sounds extreme , but Bahar argues his plan was the only viable way forward for the company . <p> For almost the entire period of Proton 's ownership , Lotus has relied on one model -- the Elise -- and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evora arriving in 2009 . <p> But Bahar says Lotus 's history proves you ca n't build a stable , profitable business on a couple of low-volume , low-margin cars , and there 's no reason Lotuses have to be cheap . <p> So he planned the five new models unveiled in Paris , ranging from a ? 30,000 replacement for the Elise to a ? 110,000 reborn Esprit that 'll rival Ferrari 's 458 and McLaren 's new MP4-12C supercar . <p> There was also a new Elan , a mid-engined rival for the Porsche 911 at around ? 80,000 , and two front-engined cars , the Elite and the Eterne ( a folding-hardtop rival to the Aston Martin DB9 , and a four-door sports car to rival the Aston Martin Rapide ) both set to cost well over ? 100,000 . <p> Bahar 's plan only requires that Lotus sell an average of 1,500 units of each car per year -- about what it manages with its two current models -- and he 'll make things easier by increasing the number of countries in which you can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars will share half their components , and some as much as 75 per cent , radically reducing development costs . <p> The assembly line at Hethel . Bahar says Lotus 's history proves you ca n't build a stable , profitable business on a couple of low-volume , low-margin cars , and there 's no reason Lotuses have to be cheap <p> Explained like this , the plan seems almost conservative . But it 's not . It still requires Lotus to expand from an output of 2,611 cars last year to nearly 8,000 by 2015 . It requires ? 850 million of investment over ten years and ? 510 million in the first five . <p> Of that , only ? 100 million will come from Proton and ? 270 million from loans , leaving ? 140 million to come from the profits of the first models to appear .

And by relaunching Lotus as a British Ferrari , Bahar is taking on the world 's most prestigious car brands , which all have slick , ruthless marketing operations . <p> His scheme is n't without precedent . Aston Martin went from building just 46 cars in 1992 to over 7,000 at its peak in 2007 . Most of Britain 's premium car marques , from Mini to Rolls-Royce , have now been brilliantly reinvented by foreign owners . But these reborn brands have been backed by global car-making groups such as BMW and Volkswagen , with billions to invest . <p> Lotus 's owner Proton does n't have the cash or the engineering resources to be a significant help . Lotus has survived only on its engineering wits , using its tiny budgets to maximum effect . <p> If Bahar 's plan works , the firm 's 1,100 employees could be joined by another thousand , with many more jobs created in the supply chain .

If Bahar 's plan works , the firm 's 1,100 employees could be joined by another thousand , with many more jobs created in the supply chain <p> But rather than row back on his Paris promises , Bahar has gone further . He 's taken Lotus back into Formula 1 for the first time since 1994 , and with Indy and Le Mans entries and a planned rally car , the marque is now active in every major motorsport discipline . <p> He has announced that Lotus will also build a high-end electric city car to rival Aston Martin 's Cygnet from 2014 . <p> Most astonishingly , he has also just revealed that the new Lotuses will be powered by a bespoke family of engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually be done ?

They believed in their cause , but it was n't my cause , and to change that belief would have been more time-consuming than having fresh blood . ' <p> To replace them he drew up a list of 24 top executives and persuaded 23 of them to leave secure jobs at the world 's best car-makers and move to Norfolk . These are the rock stars of the global car industry . Donato Coco joined from Ferrari as director of design , having styled the beautiful 458 .

Lotus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that size . <p> If it gets it , it 'll expand its factory to build the two front-engined cars in Norfolk ; if not , they 'll be outsourced to a factory overseas . Bahar showed Business Secretary Vince Cable around before meeting Live . Cable , a sports car fan , told us visiting Hethel was ' a lifetime ambition ' , but he had n't come with a chequebook . <p> ' But it has n't got many precedents . Aston Martin is about the only example , but it did it with a ton of Ford 's money . I 'm not convinced Proton has the funds . ' <p> Erich Hauser at Credit Suisse agrees . <p> ' In terms of scale of expansion I think it 's unique . Their rivals are all expanding their line-ups too , but into SUVs and four-doors . It 's almost archaic of Lotus to say they 're going to make this work based largely on sports cars . <p> ' Lotus has always been a left-field choice , usually bought by a real chassis enthusiast .

How different it would all be a generation later . In 1945 , Hitler fought on , well past the point at which any hope of ultimate victory could be entertained , seemingly revelling in the horror and slaughter engulfing Germany . <p> This paradox is at the heart of Ian Kershaw 's new book , The End . Why , he asks , did German politicians , soldiers and civilians continue their dogged , futile resistance in 1944-45 ? Why was there no internal revolt , like the one that toppled Mussolini ? Why did the German people not protest when all was so patently lost ? These are very valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a vast acceleration of casualty rates in almost every sector . Nearly half of all German combat deaths , for instance , were registered during that period , while the escalation of the air war gave the world the horror of Dresden . Elsewhere , this was the period of the death marches of concentration camp inmates , the combat debut of the hopeless Volkssturm militia and of the mass rapes and mass suicides of German civilians . Given such tremendous costs , it clearly behoves us all to ask why Germany continued fighting against such murderous odds . <p> Kershaw adopts a largely narrative approach , which -- with various digressions -- spans the period between the failed attempt on Hitler 's life of 20 July 1944 and the German capitulation 10 months later . In this period , horrors at the front -- such as the first Red Army incursion into German territory at Nemmersdorf in East Prussia -- would increasingly be matched by horrors at home , as the murderous SS condemned to death all those who dared to resist or showed insufficient martial spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many factors that contributed to draw out Germany 's demise . Loyalty to Nazism also played a role , as did other more nebulous factors such as the supposed innate obedience and conformity of the German people , and the Allied doctrine of unconditional surrender , which appeared to rob moderate Germans of a viable alternative to continued defiance . <p> But for all the respective merits of these arguments , Kershaw is convincing in laying the blame for the disastrous decision to " hold out " primarily at Hitler 's door . Not only was the dictator personally obsessed with the idea that a heroic defeat was preferable to any form of surrender , he had also concentrated such an unchallenged system of power in his own hands that he was effectively able to drag all of Germany with him into the abyss . It is telling , indeed , that only Hitler 's suicide on 30 April 1945 opened the way to a German capitulation . <p> A respected authority on the subject of Hitler and the Third Reich , Kershaw is a sure-footed guide through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe .

@@4284240 <h> Simon Price : There 's no going back to the Old Grey Twilight Zone <p> The hippy tastes of Bob Harris were blown away by glam rock and punk <p> Saturday 20 August 2011 23:00 BST <p> The New York Dolls break the mould on ' The Old Grey Whistle Test ' in June 1973 Rex <p> His sneer said it all . The New York Dolls , super-camp street trash teetering around on high heels in lipstick and Empire State hairdos , had just ripped through a proto-punk stormer called Jet Boy , with twin frontmen David Johansen and Johnny Thunders , looking respectively like a dragged-up Jagger and an electrocuted Cher . As the last echoes of their guitars ebbed away , " Whispering " Bob Harris , presenter of The Old Grey Whistle Test , turned to the camera , gave a toothy smirk , and said simply " mock rock " . <p> It will be 40 years next month since TOGWT took to the screens as part of BBC2 's Late Night Line-Up . The anniversary has prompted a mini-wave of nostalgia ; Harris is to present the Old Grey Whistle Test 40 series from Wednesday night on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to TV . Which is all very well -- just do n't expect me to join in the celebration . <p> As someone who was four at the time , clearly I was not its target demographic . But even in retrospect , the attitudes it represents leave me cold . A hangover from the just-deceased hippie era , TOGWT was essentially the sight and sound of an entire generation of beardies putting their fingers in their ears and shouting down their younger , glam rock-loving siblings : " Laa laa laa , we ca n't hear you ! " . <p> The Dolls incident was n't the only example of the prematurely fogeyish Harris failing to get a band who incorporated a little flash and dazzle into their act . On 20 June 1972 , Roxy Music turned up on TOGWT for their television debut . The footage of their rendition of Ladytron is beguiling to this day , and one can only imagine how gloriously alien they must have appeared at the time : Bryan Ferry , in a metallic tiger skin bolero , his eyes almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of his leopard-print sleeves , twiddling knobs on a synthesiser ; Andy Mackay tootling an oboe in a silky sci-fi collar of Quality Street wrapper green ; and Phil Manzanera in enormous sparkling fly-eye specs unavailable in any earthly shop . <p> Presenter-producer Richard Williams was a fan -- " Roxy Music can bring pictures to your head like no one else ... and they 've only just begun " , he had written in Melody Maker -- but his opinion was not widespread on the programme . <p> As Johnny Rogan remembers in his book Style With Substance -- Roxy 's First Ten Years : " Before their all-important TV appearance ... Bob Harris announced to the world that he was totally against them appearing on the show . As far as he was concerned Roxy Music were little more than an unimpressive hype . Their recent overkill in the media might have fooled large sections of the public , but he did not count himself among them . " <p> Roxy Music were way , way outside TOGWT 's comfort zone . Hairy prog-blues merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . If you want an enduring image of The Old Grey Whistle Test , think of Kris Kristofferson gazing across at Rita Coolidge with conspiratorial smugness , or one member of Focus looking at another with a " lost-in-music " face , or the drummer from the Edgar Winter Group catching flies with his open mouth as he embarks on an elongated solo . And all hosted by Harris in a style , laid back to the point of narcolepsy , which has been much parodied by comics , from Eric Idle on Rutland Weekend Television to Richard Ayoade on Snuff Box . <p> In its defence , TOGWT survives as a useful archive , almost by accident , of artists such as Bob Marley and the Wailers and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band , as , unlike Top of the Pops , classic episodes were not thoughtlessly trashed by the BBC . And , even if it was against its presenter 's wishes , the occasional Roxy or Dolls did sneak through . <p> It is difficult to overstate how precious live music on TV was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would set up a microphone surrounded by cushions to create a makeshift soundproofed booth , around the TV speakers . We talked above a Harris-esque whisper at our peril . Furthermore , it was almost the only place rock musicians were interviewed about their craft , often with unintentionally hilarious results . " I do n't know if we should explain what Rastafarians are , " said a visibly relaxed Keith Richards in 1974 a propos of a recording session in Jamaica , " but they 're these very heavy , happy dudes ... who play drums . " <p> TOGWT had the good fortune to be born in a year when the LP was coming into its own , and there was a mutually-beneficial synergy between the show and the albums boom of 1971 . In a recent issue of The Word , David Hepworth , himself a former Whistle Test presenter , wrote a column arguing that 1971 was " the annus mirabilis of the rock album " , citing , among others , Hunky Dory , Led Zeppelin IV , What 's Going On , Sticky Fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LA Woman , American Pie and Imagine as evidence . <p> It 's a difficult canon to argue with . But the crux of the problem lies in the phrase " rock album " . While 1971 might have been a golden age for the long player , it was an all-time low for the pop single . The first No 1 of the year was Clive Dunn 's Grandad , the last , Benny Hill 's Ernie ( The Fastest Milkman in the West ) . Only Marc Bolan was blazing a trail for the return of the single as pop 's prime format , with T. Rex smashes such as Hot Love , Get It On and Jeepster , and his beguilingly androgynous mystique . But T. Rex never appeared on The Old Grey Whistle Test . No one ever sat down with Marc Bolan and found out what made him tick . Because a trivial Top of the Pops tyke like him could n't possibly have anything interesting to say , could he ? <p> For my generation , 1981 is our 1971 . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers . The lunatics had taken over the asylum , to quote Fun Boy Three 's single of that year . <p> It was the year the New Pop movement emerged with the debut singles of ABC and Duran Duran ; the Scottish sound of Altered Images , Associates and Orange Juice ; the gothic rock of Bauhaus , and the tribal beats of Bow Wow Wow , PiL and The Creatures . Human League broke through with a run of hits culminating in the million-selling Christmas No 1 , Do n't You Want Me . Other chart-toppers included Adam and the Ants ' Stand And Deliver , Soft Cell 's Tainted Love and The Specials ' Ghost Town . <p> The Old Grey Whistle Test was embarrassingly tardy in responding to punk and post-punk until Annie Nightingale took over in 1978 , when the studio doors were opened to the likes of Siouxsie , Japan , XTC , Blondie , Tubeway Army , Ramones , Squeeze and Iggy Pop . <p> TOWGT had a second life in the mid-Eighties as Whistle Test , popularising what was then termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R.E.M . in particular . But even then , the edgier alternative sounds were better-served over on Channel 4 by The Tube . <p> A revived TOGWT in 2011 ? Fine , if you 're after a delicate , navel-gazing session from Laura Marling or Jamie Woon . But if you 're looking for a 21st-century Roxy Music or New York Dolls , you 'd better hope there is n't a 21st-century Bob Harris calling the shots . 
@@4289230 <h> David Mach : Precious Light , City Art Centre , Edinburgh <p> Glimpsed at first from the street , through the large windows of Edinburgh 's City Art Centre , the agony of David Mach 's " Golgotha " is immediately evident . Three figures , all made of coat-hangers in a way that makes them bristle with spikes , dangle from criss-crossed beams of metal that seem on the verge of collapse . The mood of crisis is visceral , the pain conveyed by the figures unbearable . Powerfully built yet vulnerable , they are attached to the beams with bolts driven through their feet and wrists . The man on the left contorts his face and opens his mouth in a howl . But no one can save him . <p> Seen from the back , the beams take on a life of their own , the central one thrusting out so far that it threatens to crash into the reception desk . Nearby , an immense circular collage , " City of God " , echoes this sense of fracture , of brutal displacement . It shows a crucified figure split into male and female halves , their shared torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions . Below , helicopters and balloons float over a scene of terminal destruction , where shocked figures gaze at a notice that carries three ominous words : " GOD 'S WARNING SIGN " . <p> Mach calls his overwhelming show Precious Light , and he sees it as a " contemporary imagining of the King James Bible " . There can be no doubt about the stimulus Mach derives from his biblical source in its 400th anniversary year , and there is nothing bland or reassuring about the finest pieces . At the top of the escalator leading to the first floor , we are confronted by an even larger collage , " Noah 's Ark I " , where 21st-century figures run in pursuit of the animals they want to save . But a young woman screams as she struggles with a serpent coiling round her , and elephants charge past the people struggling to guide them towards Noah 's half-built vessel . <p> The Scottish artist , nominated for the Turner Prize in 1988 , unleashes the most cinematic side of his imagination in these collages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its title to Hollywood , though the piece does not otherwise refer to the Charlton Heston movie . Mach 's " Agony and Ecstasy " takes place outside St Paul 's Cathedral in London , where people cry out as they are submerged in blood-soaked mud and birds flutter with predatory menace . " The Plague of Frogs " is similarly apocalyptic , with men and women assaulted on all sides by a deluge of creatures from the sky . <p> Peace and hope prevail in a circular collage called " Adam and Eve " , the naked couple at the centre of a lush paradise of exotic flora and fauna . But it is no more convincing than a nearby head of Jesus Christ , made from thousands of coloured matches , who stares out from a plinth looking utterly calm . His composure left me cold ; I responded far more to a frowning , leering head of the Devil , likewise made of matches and set alight by Mach at a special performance in the courtyard of Edinburgh College of Art .

In " The Destruction of Jericho " , two children clutching toys in the back of a car stare out at scenes of destruction outside . As wide as a cinema screen , the piece makes us feel as if we too are trapped in the car . <p> On the floor above , Mach briefly lulls the viewer with " Heaven-Autumn " , where families and their dogs relish the rich colours of the leaves tumbling in profusion around them , before pitching him back into deadly chaos .

@@4291232 <h> Michael Voris : Being Catholic is about salvation , not accommodation <p> I was at Regent Hall , Oxford Street last night to hear Michael Voris speak about what it means to be Catholic . For those who did not see my last blog post about him , Michael founded St Michael 's Media , a Catholic TV station , in 2006 and RealCatholicTV.com , an on-line Catholic TV station , in 2008 . All credit to Paul Smeaton , son of John Smeaton and a recent graduate , for arranging this talk . <p> It was very well attended ; the " stalls " were packed , if not the " gallery " . But this was no theatrical event . It was a dedicated Catholic addressing his fellow believers and it was electrifying . Voris is no slouch when it comes to straight talking . He has been criticised for this in the past , for speaking as if he " has authority " . After all , he is only a layman , sounding off as if he were a bishop . <p> This is precisely Voris ' point : as a confirmed Catholic and " soldier of Christ " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his duty -- and ours -- to be an evangelist for the Faith . It is our responsibility and not to be sloughed off on the hierarchy -- who may or may not be fulfilling their responsibilities . He told us in no uncertain terms , " You have a vital role to play : to work out your own salvation and to do everything possible for the salvation of others . " <p> He has no truck with the description " I am a Catholic " , said in the same way as one might say " I am an Irishman . " To be Catholic is who we are ; the correct description should be " I am Catholic " and chuck away the indefinite article . This was heady stuff and several times he got loud applause . Voris is sometimes accused of being too full of himself -- but I do n't think he cared a toss about the clapping . He was too on fire with his message ; it is very simple : to be Catholic means to pay any price in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " to look at the world as a theatre of redemption . " <p> As if we did n't hear it all around us , he reminded us that the words " accommodation " , " tolerance " and being " non-judgmental " are simply not stances that a Catholic can take . " The Faith is about salvation , not accommodation " , he reminded us . It 's not enough to have a private devotional life and leave the world to go hang ; quoting the late great American Jesuit , Fr John Hardon , Voris told us , " If we are not about saving the world , then why are we Catholic ? " <p> In one memorable anecdote , he related that , aged 14 , he had served at a Mass in San Francisco celebrated by the late Archbishop Fulton Sheen . In the sacristy afterwards a young man had come up to him , telling him that he had written a book synthesising Eastern mysticism with the Western Church . " Get out ! " roared the Archbishop . " The Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have you polluting it ! Get out ! " <p> As I said , it was heady stuff .

" ... from a Salvation Army lectern . <p> If Mr Voris thinks it 's extraordinarily radical to recommend Pascendi Dominici Gregis to a bunch of people who had all made the effort to come to hear an explicitly conservative catholic commentator , I wonder how sharp the fellow really is . Either that or he could n't be bothered to write a proper homily ; oh yes , he 's not a priest . This was stream of conscience protestantism imported straight from the USA .

I particularly recommend his two-part presentations during WYD in Madrid : <p> Michael is a breath of fresh air in the midst of the fog of liberal cowardice from the Catholic Hierarchy . The latter have made tolerance into a virtue . The Church is in serious need of weeding out those who lack the intestinal fortitude to defend our One True Church . <p> Parasum <p> I was n't at the talk . But there are plenty of videos of him on Youtube ; I even referred to a couple of them .

St. Paul has a lot to say about how Jesus makes those who were enemies , of each other &amp; God , members of the same Church , &amp; about how He reconciles people -- St.Paul 's emphasis is n't perhaps as satisfying as that of Voris , but it is far more constructive , &amp; required far more effort , than the aggressive approach that MV seems to prefer . If my impression is mistaken , it 's based on his own videos . <p> Dialogue may be very tiresome in the eyes of those with his approach , but as long Catholics are part of a world which contains people who have beliefs of a different kind , to go full steam ahead over the prostrate bodies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loft@ss <p> If you think Voris is bad try listening to the " accomodating " Fr .

Nikon and Sony have simultaneously announced a whole new fleet of digital cameras , unveiling more than ten new models between the two firms . <p> First up there 's the A77 and A65 , which use Sony 's new translucent mirror tech to be able to snap photos without losing sight of your subject . Traditional digital SLRs move the mirror out of view for the split second the picture is taken , momentarily blacking out the viewfinder - this translucent mirror solution means you 'll always see what you 're shooting . <p> The cameras can also capture a burst of 24.3 effective megapixel resolution shots at an alarming 12 frames per second , making them perfect options for action-heavy shots . They 've also got full HD video , native geo-tagging and a big old screen . The A77 will be around ? 1,150 ( body only ) when it hits the UK this October . <p> There 's also the NEX-7 from Sony , a tiny camera that manages to stuff a ridiculous 24.3-megapixel sensor , a 2.4 million dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll launch in September for about $1200 ( body only ) . UK pricing has not been announced , yet . <p> The manufacturer has refreshed its NEX-5 camera , with a more beefy NEX 5-N . It packs a 16.1-megapixel CMOS sensor , full HD recording and other image-processing goodies . Sony claims that the 5-N is the fastest interchangeable lens compact camera available , with a release lag of just 0.02 seconds . <p> Finally from Sony , there 's a new Handycam camcorder on the scene , the NEX-VG20 . Not for home movies and YouTube vlogs , this high-end recorder is apparently the " first consumer HD camcorder with interchangeable lenses " , shoots in HD ( and does 16 megapixel stills ) , and can record sound in 5.1 surround . <p> Nikon kicked off with an upgrade to the P700 , in the Coolpix P7100 . It 's pretty similar to its predecessor with its 10.1-megapixel sensor and a maximum video resolution of 720p , but now features a pull-out LCD viewfinder and snappier software . <p> Then there 's the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy Coolpix AW100 .

The S8200 has a 14x optical zoom , a 16 megapixel sensor , a six frames-per-second burst mode and 1080p video recording . The S1200pj has just 14.1 megapixels on its sensor and a 5x optical zoom , but makes up for that with a built-in projector . There 's even an iOS app to send video from your iPhone or iPad to the projector .

There was a Tory government , a royal wedding , an austerity budget -- and The Borgias on the television . <p> Last time around , things did n't go so well . A co-production between the BBC and Italian RAI TV , the 1981 series has n't made it on to DVD in this country but all 10 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube . The series , all beards and trumpets , was characterised by the kind of silliness that can only result from attempts at solemnity . Adolfo Celi , the actor playing Rodrigo Borgia , was ogre-ish and charisma-less , his Italian accent thick to the point of impenetrability ; Clive Merrison 's performance -- every syllable sternly pronounced , eyebrow in a permanent arch -- was an example of the kind of English over-acting that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film &amp; Television <p> The filmmaker Neil Jordan , who made Mona Lisa , The Crying Game , and Interview with a Vampire , has avoided these vices in his spiffy and soapy mini-series ( Sky Atlantic Saturdays ) , the silliness he commits is , for the most part , intentional and self-ribbing . If we do n't include the Kindle version of Christopher Hibbert 's book The House of Borgia , Jordan 's programme , with Jeremy Irons as Rodrigo Borgia ( later Pope Alexander VI , with Lotte Verbeek as his mistress Giulia ) , is surely the most reliable small-screen introduction to this ruthless family . <p> There is competition , though you could n't call it stiff . In providing an account of the Borgias ' misdeeds that is engaging and lucid , if heavy on intrigue but light on contextual detail , the US cable channel Showtime , which produced the series , has succeeded where the BBC failed 30 years ago -- and where Ubisoft Entertainment did n't even try to succeed with its recent computer game , Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of various religious faiths " ) . There the modern-day Desmond is placed in the body of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze and assigned to destroy the Borgias ' Rome in 1499 . <p> The Borgias begins in 1492 , with the death of Innocent VIII . As in the earlier series , the cardinals talk as if the idea of a Borgia succeeding him was unthinkable -- the family being corrupt and Spanish . But there had already been a Borgia pope , Calixtus III . It is through such omissions that truculent history becomes fluent drama , bringing the necessary clarity in terms of structure and conflict . <p> Since the publication of Dan Brown 's Angels and Demons , with its insidious , parachuting cardinal , it has become well-established that the Vatican harbours evil spirits . The Borgias , their assassinations and bribery and now looking old-hat , retain only one advantage : sex .

" This is dramatic irony at its most beautifully arch , with the audience at a 500-year advantage over the characters . <p> There was dramatic irony of a less extravagant kind on display in The Man Who Crossed Hitler ( BBC2 Sunday ) , which took place in 1931 , but the details of the story would have been new to most viewers . As a study of tyranny , the programme pulled a much straighter face than The Borgias , but then it is something of an article of faith among programme-makers that murder and suffering matter less with every passing century .

In the final episode , Lesser unmasked himself as a Soviet agent , and a programme that started out as a portrait of social and industrial change in the 1950s ended as a perfunctory conspiracy thriller in which the corruption went , as it tends to , all the way up to the top . <p> The Man Who Crossed Hitler offered a sober portrait of a court case concerning SA violence in which Litten , the prosecuting barrister , called Hitler as a witness . But it was sullied by English phrasing . " Your ego is the size of the Brandenburg Gate " , " Max Schmeling , eat your heart out " .

Announcing the merger , hybris said the deal gave it a much more complete multichannel platform , with features including integrated order and warehouse management systems . Since then we 've spoken to hybris ' co-founder and chief operating officer , Carsten Thoma . Here 's what he had to say about the deal . <p> Internet Retailing : What for you is the most important aspect of your deal with iCongo ? <p> Carsten Thoma : That the two parties shared the same vision . We shared the same vision of the market and how the commerce market needs to evolve and that we were both heading into the market in the same way . <p> IR : What is that vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a global thing , across all touchpoints , not only online but offline too . You have to weave in all the online and offline touchpoints and you have to offer it on a global scale . Last but not least you have to be able to offer the solution in different deployment models . <p> IR : Why is the choice of deployment a real priority ? <p> CT : The beauty about the combination is that iCongo brings in a well-established managed service offering that puts us together into a position where we can instantly offer a managed service and/or cloud-based on-demand solutions for our customers in parallel to the well-established on premise deployment model that hybris offers . It 's a great synergy -- the combination gives ultimate flexibility to a customer to pick and choose applications and deployment models like from a menu . <p> IR : What do you think you 've achieved through the deal ? <p> CT : Looking at the portfolio of both companies from a commerce perspective it 's pretty much the most complete vision of commerce offering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear platform decision -- we strongly believe that these things must be consistent not only when it comes to the deployment of the solution but also when it comes to technology . We are very happy for the hybris technology stack to be the centre of that technology moving forward . <p> IR : Why is that complete multichannel offering important for retailers ? <p> CT : Retailers are going through many phases in the commerce cycle . They have to be flexible enough to react to every shift and every new trend , every new adoption of trends in that space very quickly . They also have to pay tribute to the fact their most important goal must be to expand online revenue and grow very fast in order to keep up with the whole growth of the market . <p> I think a partner that can offer you different options and flexibility across the cycle that you have to go through as a retailer is key . Therefore it 's also key , or at least a big advantage , if a retailer can be across different disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for them to set up their own organisation and own structures . You do n't have to deal with different partners , different contracts -- that can be very distracting . <p> IR : Does the merger put you up against new competitors ? <p> CT : Not different competitors from before -- we 're battling with the same type of companies and we do n't expect that will change . The consolidation in the market space has been going on for quite a while . Hybris has been a very strong contender in the market , growing fast . There might be a bit more competition on the order management side , with the specialist vendors , but the total will not change dramatically . <p> IR : Is there a problem that hybris and iCongo have clients competing in the same sectors ? <p> CT : We have clear strategies and/or migration paths for our clients and I think if you look at the overall picture there is a value-add for every single account .

Organisational size and rapid growth by acquisition can sometimes be hindering qualities in an ecommerce partner . <p> I believe that : - -Attempts to merge ' like with like ' ecommerce platforms only creates integration headaches and unnecessary cost burdens on users -That many iCongo customers may very well soon find themselves with legacy , unsupported technology that could end up being phased out -That vendors pre occupied with growth through acquisition and sheer size often lose sight of their customers and their needs -A significant number of these vendors ' customers will now question that strategy and consider a more agile , cost-effective eco-system of specialist partners for their ecommerce needs <p> How do retailers strike the right balance between scale , service and technical excellence when choosing a multi-channel/ecommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the e-commerce market is very dynamic , as the latest bvh figures from July 2011 show .

There is little sense in merging direct competitors whose portfolios largely mirror each other 's . Whilst on paper this may increase market share , it is hard to see how store managers benefit . If both parties have very similar offerings , how do they combine their solutions ? Their technologies were developed independently of each other -- technical integration does n't necessarily deliver double the benefit but instead requires additional effort in time , money , and resources . <p> Compromises are inevitably made to keep costs under control and lenders will want to see a quick return on their investment . It may also be some time , if ever , before online retailers can realise genuine value from such mergers for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear that in mind . <p> For existing customers of the iCongo e-commerce-platform , the recent hybris acquisition could mean that the backbone to their online business is a phased-out software model . This will result sooner or later in considerable costs for migrating to the new solution . It is also worth noting that many mergers have resulted in companies tending to get distracted by the associated organizational problems and lose sight of their customers altogether . <p> Given all these considerations there will be many prospective e-commerce users , as well as existing hybris and iCongo customers evaluating alternative software vendors . Online sellers need to protect their profits and opt for a software provider that is fully focused on enabling them to derive sustained benefits from the growth of e-commerce. 
@@4293235 <p> When the present Government threw out the South-East Plan , Thame breathed a sigh of relief . But it is now amazed to find itself preparing for another fight -- with ministers who are meant to be champions of localism . Recently , the Coalition announced a radical overhaul of the planning system , which aims to throw out the old rulebook , the size of a telephone directory , and replace it with a pamphlet of 52 pages . George Osborne summed up its intent during the Budget : " The default answer to development will be ' yes ' . " Anyone wanting to halt the bulldozers will , in the words of the planning minister Greg Clark , be guilty of " selfish nihilism " . <p> Net migration to the UK rose by more than 20 per cent last year to 239,000 , official figures showed today . <p> The increase from 198,000 in 2009 was fuelled by a fall in the number of people leaving the UK and goes against the Government 's pledge to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands by 2015 . <p> Britain 's current population of 62 million would fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no immigration , compared to a population of 64.3 million with balanced migration ; if it continues with its current level it will be over 90 million . Why on earth are we doing this ? And where 's the " Conservative " Party that 's supposed to be preserving English society and the English countryside ? <p> But even taking aside the Tory Party 's utter moral cowardice over the issue of immigration , why is the British response to increased population more green-field development and more suburbanisation ? I 'm not entirely sure we need it . Those of you lucky enough to holiday in Italy this year will notice upon flying over that country just how different it looks from above to ours . Italian settlements are compact and bounded ; their cities and towns constrained within clear boundaries . The south of England , in contrast , is one big suburb . <p> Even taking aside the issue of petrol and rail inefficiency , this has profoundly negative social developments . In Bowling Alone Robert Putnam described the effects that suburbs had on social capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " suburbanites kept to themselves , asking little of their neighbours and expecting little in return . " <p> He quoted Andrew Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk , architects who wrote that : " The suburb is the last word in privatisation , perhaps even its lethal consummation and it spells the end of authentic civic life . " While urbanist Lewis Mumford called suburbia " a collective effort to lead a private life " . He said : " Rather than at the grocery store or five-and-dime on Main Street , where faces were familiar , today 's suburbanites shop in large , impersonal malls . " <p> And on top of this suburbs tend to be cultural deserts . This is not to knock people who live in suburbs ; people move there because they are affordable , because they want green space , but also to escape the social problems that afflict inner city areas ( especially inner-city schools ) . But the most pleasant suburbs tend to be the most compact and possessed of a village-like feel . In contrast , Putnam says , urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suburbanites suffer a " sprawl civic penalty " of roughly 20 percent on most measures of civic involvement . <p> I 'm not actually sure we need to build over the green belt at all , there being plenty of land within urban areas in the desirable south-east , and low-density urban areas that could be built up .

@@4293237 <p> At Les Francofolies de la Rochelle last month , I witnessed a performance by Rennes rap group Psykick Lyrikah , based around rapper Arm , that had a somewhat divisive impact on the audience . A number of people left the auditorium and the reaction of those who stayed was either muted or fervently appreciative . I think audiences at Les Francofolies are used to being treated a certain way , to being warmly acknowledged and pandered to by performers . What they got was a no frills , no fuss , call and response-free show , which I suppose was interpreted as disdainful . Afterwards I put it to Arm that not treating the audience like children is also a way of showing them respect . <p> ' There 's no law in music that says you have to get an audience to participate in a performance to keep their attention , ' he says . ' A lot of that is about making up for something else that 's lacking . We 've got a different kind of energy and obviously there are people who go with it and others who are left cold by it .

Arm gives himself an entirely and deliberately minimal ( and at times bracingly crude ) synthetic backing ( ' just synths , programming and drum machines ' ) for his reflections on personal and collective agency and responsibility . These are questions which at the time of writing feel particularly pressing , but are n't necessarily going to light everyone 's fire ... <p> As far as the sound of Derri ? re moi goes , the press release mentions John Carpenter but Arm is more keen to talk about other inspirations . <p> ' While I was writing the album I was listening to a lot of American rap , particularly the Dirty South stuff , which was really quite different from the sample-heavy New York style or the West Coast G-Funk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , like the blues actually .

That 's partly why on the new album I wanted to come back to something that was more like a rap album , I felt as though I 'd drifted away from something and I missed it .

Here , Chicoro does not just focus on the most common ingredients used in hair products , but also gives a scientific explanation of what the ingredients do to the hair . For example , shampoos that contain sodium laurel sulphate ( SLS ) lift the cuticles and degrade or remove protein from the hair . <p> Step four : Putting It All Together is about connecting all three steps in an analytical way to use as a template for determining the selection of hair products .

@@4295240 <h> In the aftermath of the riots that rocked London , GRAHAM BALL meets historian Peter Ackroyd who says it 's nothing the city has n't seen before <p> No other writer alive today has written about London with more passion and knowledge than the historian Peter Ackroyd . One might therefore assume that he would be despairing over the riots that , earlier this month , engulfed parts of the city he loves . <p> Not a bit of it . " I was n't shocked or surprised , " he says . " There has been rioting in London going back over the generations . If anything , I 'm somewhat surprised there have n't been more . Rioting is as natural to urban life and a city like London as fox hunting is to the country . There was nothing new in it but some foolish people were saying ' London will never be the same again ' when in fact life went straight back to normal the following day . " <p> London 's history as a location for riots is indeed long standing . From the Peasants Revolt in 1381 , through the Gordon Riots of 1780 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of England and almost destroyed Newgate Prison , up to unrest in Brixton in 1981 , 1985 and 1995 , the capital has been no stranger to mobs in the streets . Each time order has been restored and life resumed . <p> London 's history as a location for riots is indeed long standing <p> Peter Ackroyd is probably our most prolific serious author . His output is formidable . During a writing career that began in the Seventies , Ackroyd has written 19 novels and 31 works of non-fiction including biographies of Dickens , Shakespeare , TS Eliot , Chaucer , William Blake , Ezra Pound and Thomas More . <p> He has also written three collections of poetry , a stage play and six television adaptations of his books . He has won seven major literary prizes and , in 2003 , was awarded the CBE . Yet there is no easing up for this author as he approaches 62 . Next Friday his latest book , Foundation , the first of a major six volume history of England , arrives in bookshops . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , book-lined study at the front of a large Victorian house in Bloomsbury , where he comes every day , sometimes Saturdays and Sunday included , from his home in Knightsbridge . He has a well established reputation for having no time for fools or small talk but today he could n't be more charming . Even so , it 's impossible not to feel that one is somehow intruding on his writing time . " I 'm quite busy at the moment . I 'm writing the third volume of the History Of England series , a novel and a biography of Charlie Chaplin . Oh yes , and my study of Wilkie Collins is due out in the New Year . " <p> He is angry that the Department for Education had reported that 159 state secondary schools across England had failed to enter a single student for a history GCSE last summer . " That 's terribly disappointing . The study of history is one of the most important mental activities . Do n't they realise that people with no knowledge of the past are unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn about the history of the country is a huge mistake and does them a great disservice . <p> " This thinking also goes very much against the grain of England . The English have always been interested in their past and their ancestors . In fact , the rest of Europe ridiculed us for it in the 17th and 18th centuries , calling us ' antiquarians ' . " <p> The appreciation and understanding of history matters immensely to Ackroyd , the subject occupies nearly all of his waking hours and dictates what he writes . So will his new history of England be his crowning achievement ? <p> " I hope it does well , I have written not for students or for historians who these days seem more and more to write for each other . I am aiming these books at the general public , anyone who wants to know more about the country they live in . It 's an inspiring story .

I am going to carry on writing until they carry me out . " <p> In the first volume of his new history of England Ackroyd addresses the question of identity and the origin of the English . <p> Iexplain that since before Roman times this island has been subject to waves of immigration , people from southern Europe , the Saxons , Normans , Scandanavians , Hugenots and many other Europeans have come here . There is nothing new in this . <p> " Invariably the incomers were isolated and criticised but within two or three generations those born here of foreign parents were as English as the next person . I am confident that this will happen with those coming here today . I have no fear or concern about the state of the country . Just look at London , it 's a better city to live in today than it was in the past and that goes for all our major cities . " <p> He says he will never live anywhere but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to leave the country , even on holiday . <p> Writing dominates Ackroyd 's life to an extent most would find intolerable . When he has cleared his desk of his current work load , there are two more volumes of the history of England , another novel and a biography of Alfred Hitchcock waiting . <p> ACKROYD 'S social life was an early casualty of his devotion to work , making him a somewhat reclusive figure . " I do n't have many friends , I do n't like parties and I seldom go to the theatre or cinema . I live alone but do n't feel isolated , " he says . " Writing is my vocation . I keep writing because I think I can improve . " <p> In Foundation , which has been impeccably researched Ackroyd has used his renowned writing skills to create a series of lucid narratives that tell the story of English history from pre-Roman times until the emergence of Henry VII .

" Everybody was incredibly happy . I never realized how much a drummer can change the foundation of a band , but it 's really true . I just want to have Mike Mangini checked to make sure he 's really human , because the things he can do seem totally impossible . " <p> Feats of musical daring do are nothing new to Dream Theater , and they abound on the band 's highly anticipated new album , A Dramatic Turn of Events . A glittering thrill ride that runs the musical gamut from mind-numbing progressive metal to lush , heavenly ballads , it 's an unqualified triumph for the celebrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums are filled with emotion , " says Rudess . " This one might be a little more so , what with all of the changes we 've been through .

I know I ca n't wait for people to hear the new record . I 'm really psyched about it . " <p> MusicRadar sat down with Jordan Rudess recently to talk about A Dramatic Turn Of Events . In addition , we discussed new hardware and software he 's working with , along with a certain poll he just won by a huge margin . <p> " Thank you ! Yeah , that was so flattering .

Without belaboring the exit of Mike Portnoy , we 're curious about some comments you made recently where you said you felt free to expand the role of the keyboards . <p> " Yeah , I would say that 's true . I feel that this change allowed us to rethink everybody 's role in the band -- who are we , where we 're at , what kind of music do we want to make ? We asked a lot of questions of ourselves . <p> " One of the things that came up was maximizing everybody 's input , and yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we not been maximizing keyboards to their best advantage ? Who am I , what can I do , and how can we change things and make them right ? <p> " It was almost a spiritual thing , if you will . What kind of energy do we want to put out to the world ? How can we rebuild this band ? What are the kinds of things we need to do ? All of those questions were important , and I think our answers are reflected in the album we made . <p> " It did n't all come down to me , though - it was everybody . With James , it was about his melodies , his range and how he would feel most comfortable ; and as composers , how can we make sure that things really flow for him ? With John Myung , who was feeling very re-energized , how can we use his enormous talents as a bassist ? So yeah , it was all around . <p> " Coming back to me , we really took the time during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which was great , because I was able to pick up the pencil and paper and write stuff out .

I found new ways to use the keyboards and bring the musicality in the band to a new level . " <p> It sounds as though you feel the rebooting of Dream Theater has been extremely positive . <p> " Well , you know , any change is good . But let 's address the situation with Mike Portnoy , and I should say right off that I 'm a supporter of his .

Unfortunately , it got a little turbulent and created some friction with the relationships , but hopefully everything will smooth over in time . The positive thing for me and this band , however , has been the re-evaluating and restructuring of who we are and what we do . <p> " Thankfully , within Dream Theater , there 's a whole lot of talent to work with . We 're in a really good place . We found an incredible drummer in Mike Mangini , who 's talented , skilled and funny . So life is good for us . We have a lot of exciting times ahead .

@@4298237 <h> On-screen chemistry that so nearly bubbled over into violent reactions <p> LIFE in the big , comfortable mobile home parked high on the moors above Holmfirth was rather less than harmonious . <p> On screen , the trio of ageing adolescents were the firmest of friends ; off it , the three actors who brought Britain 's most popular comedy to life shared a wary and sometimes acrimonious relationship . <p> It was the early 1980s , and Last of the Summer Wine had no rival as the nation 's favourite comedy series . Some 18 million viewers -- more than a third of Britain 's population -- tuned in every week to watch the exploits of the scruffy , disreputable Compo , the flat-capped philosopher Clegg and the barmy would-be leader of men , Foggy . This was comedy that transcended social status and age ; the Queen never missed it , and nor did countless children who had voted it their favourite series in the annual poll carried out by the top show for youngsters of its day , the Saturday morning Multi-Coloured Swap Shop , hosted by Noel Edmonds . <p> It had made unlikely stars of its central trio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sallis and Brian Wilde shared a magical on-screen chemistry as Compo , Clegg and Foggy , served brilliantly by the writing of Roy Clarke , who from his home near Doncaster , was creating one of the finest of all sitcoms . It would run for an astonishing 37 years in total , a longevity unrivalled by any other comedy series anywhere in the world , spanning 31 series and 295 episodes , and it was at the peak of its popularity . <p> Once the cameras stopped rolling , though , the rapport between the three principals cooled . A shooting schedule that saw them spend months in the Pennines filming meant they were thrust together for long periods of time whether they liked it or not , and the vagaries of the weather often meant they were confined to the mobile home they shared during days on location . <p> Everybody on set knew that relations between Owen and Wilde were cool , just as they knew that the quiet interventions of Sallis prevented the tensions between them boiling over into open warfare . Sometimes he could joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go farther and remind Owen that the success of the series was paramount and must not be jeopardised by arguments . <p> There were huffy silences and sharp exchanges ; barely controlled tempers and snide remarks , and the quiet of the mobile home could be more oppressive than companionable . It never got out of hand ; there were no screaming tantrums , all three were far too professional for that , and they were scrupulous in trying not to let the tensions show , even though they were an open secret on set . <p> They worked together closely and valued each others ' skills , knew that magic happened once the director called " Action " ; nobody was more delighted than them at the success the show had become , and so they accommodated each other and coped with the tensions by putting as much distance between themselves as they could at the end of each day , shrugging off any contact as surely as they left their costumes behind until the next morning 's call . <p> The flashpoint for problems lay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift for rubbing each other up the wrong way . Owen had a high opinion of himself and made no effort to conceal his view that he was the star of Last of the Summer Wine , however much he spoke in public of its success being down to the chemistry of the trio . <p> That irritated Wilde , as did aspects of Owen 's performance , whether it be playing to the crowd in the studio or his sometimes approximate delivery of his lines . And then there was Owen 's fondness for venting his political beliefs . Wilde was a man of conservative outlook who had neither time for Owen 's Left-wing views nor his willingness to air them irrespective of whether his audience wanted to listen or not . Wilde kept his politics to himself and failed to see why Owen should not do likewise . <p> Yet the trigger for the most serious disputes that arose between them came from Wilde , whose awkward streak manifested itself over money , contracts and even scripts . He would eventually manage to argue his way into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they discovered the disparity . <p> Nevertheless , the disagreements were kept under control -- until Wilde blew the gaffe with an unguarded comment in a newspaper interview . " There is friction between Bill and me , " he said , and the tensions at the heart of the show were laid bare . <p> The problems that resulted between the stars would see Wilde leave the show soon after , weary of disagreements . His career outside Last of the Summer Wine did not prosper , however , and he would return some years later , a chastened and more mellow man . <p> Those difficulties were one of a series of headaches that the show coped with over the course of nearly four decades , from its beginnings as a one-off half-hour comedy in early 1973 until it finally drew to a close last year . <p> They would include death , illness , mental breakdown , hostility from the BBC and occasional antipathy from the people of the Yorkshire town that the series put on the map .

Thora Hird and Jean Alexander became fixtures after initial guest appearances , and there would be slots for John Cleese , Norman Wisdom and Eric Sykes . <p> The loyalty of the viewing audience was mirrored in the faithfulness of the actors to the show . Owen 's 26-year tenure only ended with his death at 85 , and he struggled on through the intense pain of cancer to complete his final scenes only a couple of weeks before he died , telling Sallis : " I do n't want to go , Peter , there 's so much left to do .

This mill town five miles from Huddersfield had not crossed Roy Clarke 's mind when he started writing the show . <p> He had thought of Rotherham , where he had been a policeman , but the producer who brought the series to the screen , James Gilbert , was not taken with its then heavily-industrialised landscape . <p> Instead , his mind turned to a place that the comedian and writer Barry Took had told him about . Took had worked as a stand-up comic during the 1950s , and had endured an excruciating gig at a working mens ' club in an out-of-the-way place called Holmfirth . Nobody laughed , and he never forgot it -- but nor did he forget the charm of the town itself . <p> Clarke and Gilbert paid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen , for whom it became a second home and ultimately his final resting place . <p> Not that Holmfirth was ever referred to in the programme -- the name could be seen on the destination boards of buses and on signposts , but it was never uttered in dialogue . Yorkshire as a whole , and nearby Huddersfield in particular were name-checked on a regular basis , but the trio customarily referred to their town and the countryside as " round here " , because Summer Wine Land was much more than Holmfirth -- it was a composite drawn together from differing landscapes , towns and villages edited together into what appeared to be a seamless whole . <p> A couple of key locations , Nora Batty 's house , and Sid and Ivy 's cafe belonged to Holmfirth , but other settings were some way away . As a location , Holmfirth had its limitations , not least its narrow streets were all too easily brought to a standstill by filming . <p> Nevertheless , Holmfirth was emblematic of the series , and the interest it attracted was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it lies had been home to 50-odd mills , supplying only the finest worsteds and cashmeres well into the 1960s . But as the following decade dawned , the textile trade was in trouble , and the town was suffering . Fame changed all that . As the series worked its way towards being the country 's favourite comedy show , the numbers of tourists increased relentlessly , eventually reaching 60,000 a year . <p> The house where Nora Batty -- the fearsome battleaxe with the wrinkled stockings -- shooed Compo off her immaculately scrubbed steps was regularly besieged by sightseers . The family that lived there grew used to seeing droves of people outside taking pictures , and even found visitors walking into their kitchen , believing it to be a set as opposed to a real home . <p> An undercurrent of ambivalence in Holmfirth at the intrusion had shown itself early , as Gilbert discovered as he put the finishing touches to location filming for the pilot . " I sometimes think the people of Holmfirth have no cause to thank us for choosing the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming , and we were just about to wrap , and an old lady came up , she was taking her dog for a walk . She stood beside me by the camera and she could n't have been sweeter or nicer , and she said , ' Have you enjoyed yourself here ? ' , and I said , ' Yes , we 've had a very good time and been very successful , and we 're very sorry we 're going back home this afternoon ' . She just said , ' Good ' , turned on her heel and went off with the dog . " <p> Owen had no time for the grumblers . " There is a body of opinion , of course , that would wish us elsewhere and their feelings have been expressed to me personally and to our director in no uncertain terms .

" I went out of my way to be a part of that community of Holmfirth , by mixing and offering to do anything and everything , " he said . <p> Other settings in the Pennines would also become familiar to viewers -- Marsden , Meltham , Slaithwaite and Hepworth among them . All were woven together into a glorious tapestry of Yorkshire countryside against which the comedy was played out . Some settings , though , were less than glamorous . A Christmas special , The Loxley Lozenge , ended with a shot of Compo , Clegg and Foggy silhouetted against the sunset , apparently on one of the highest Pennine hills . It was , in fact , a slag heap . <p> It was all part of the illusion , just another magical moment in the fantasy world that so enchanted the audience ; in Summer Wine Land , even a slag heap could be made to look lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4298239 <h> The ultimate Michael Biehn interview : The Terminator , James Cameron , Aliens and more <h> In the first part of our extensive interview with actor Michael Biehn , we got to chat about his 1980s work in The Terminator , Aliens , and much , much more ... <p> Anyone who 's familiar with my writing will know that I have a great love of under-appreciated actors . I 'll use any opportunity available to praise their work , and draw attention to films and performances that sometimes pass by relatively unnoticed . <p> Michael Biehn , for my money , is the most under-appreciated actor of them all . I 'm sure most of our readers hold him in high regard , since he 's starred in several of the greatest films ever made , but to the general public , he 's less widely recognised . <p> Best known for playing father of the future , Kyle Reese , in The Terminator and D Hicks in Aliens ( I 'm well aware what the initial stands for , but I was crushed when the Special Edition finally revealed that the D stood for Dwayne , and not Duncan ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tombstone , fighting commie water aliens in The Abyss , and killing zombies in Planet Terror . <p> My own enthusiasm for Biehn 's work started when I finally saw The Terminator around the age of eleven , and thinking ( as I still do ) that Reese was one of the most heroic and tragically romantic characters I 'd ever seen , who also happened to be a dab hand with a shotgun . His portrayal of Reese was followed not long after by his turn as Hicks , and that was all it took to cement his place in my hall of worship , as I set about finding any and every film he 'd been in . <p> In an exclusive interview , Biehn spoke candidly to me at length about every film and role in his career that I chose to ask about , including his thoughts on such topics as playing a white supremacist , casting trouble on The Terminator , jumping in at the last minute for Aliens , and turning down The Usual Suspects . <p> He even took me to task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying attention to the specifics of the point he was making , which ended up making us both laugh , even if I did utterly panic for a second . There were a couple of questions that I omitted on this occasion , including his potential casting as Peter Parker , back when Cameron was set to make a film adaptation of Spider-Man , but I was still given more of an insight into his working life than I could have ever asked for . <p> During a brief chat before the interview , Michael Biehn confessed there was no way that he possessed the organisational skills to be anything like any of the official military , or police type characters he 's played over the years , reckoning that he 'd most likely run off and leave his bullets behind in real life . <p> I informed him of my plan to conduct a whistle stop tour of all the movies that had been important to me over the years , and would try not to take up too much of his time , to which he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> And with that , I set about asking several decades ' worth of questions , while fulfilling a lifetime ambition ... <p> The Fan ( 1981 ) was the earliest film I managed to find of yours , back when I had to scour video rental shops up and down the country . Was it quite intimidating , appearing in a film with James Garner , and stalking Lauren Bacall that early in your career ? <p> I had worked off that script in the casting process , and it was a really well done psychological thriller , and the cast in the movie -- I was very excited , because it was Robert Stigwood , Lauren Bacall . I mean , it was huge , you know ? Flying into New York and all that Stigwood press - I was more intimidated about being in such a big production than I was about working with Lauren Bacall or Garner . I had been working in television , and I thought I had the stuff , and Lauren Bacall certainly did n't intimidate me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paparazzi . It was the first time I 'd ever been around , where people would run up to me , and they already had pictures in their hands of me , handing me photographs saying , " Will you sign these ? Will you sign these ? Will you sign these ? " and going to these big red carpet events . <p> I was n't prepared , I was n't dressed properly , and that was really more intimidating than working with Lauren Bacall . I thought that she was just good casting . There was nothing in her work , previous to this , that made me think , " Oh , I 'm really gon na have to put my acting shoes on . " <p> It 's strange , I always think of the paparazzi as a new phenomenon , but I guess it 's been around for a while ... <p> It was new to me , and I had been working in LA in television , and this and that , and I think that it was relatively new at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous paparazzi guy in New York , trying to get pictures of Jackie O. It was an interesting documentary , but I think he went way back into the Andy Warhol days , the Studio 64 and all that stuff , and that was probably about the time ... I think it all tripped off about the 70s , early 80s . <p> Having played a bad guy in The Fan , you then went on to The Lords Of Discipline ( 1983 ) , which I thought was quite a brave move that early in your career , as you played such an evil character . What was it that drew you to make that movie ? <p> Well , what drew it more than anything else , was I went in and I had met Franc Roddam , the director , and I read for the role that David Keith played , as my agent handled Richard Gere and they had just done that thing where he was in the army ... <p> An Officer And A Gentleman ? <p> An Officer And A Gentleman . So my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read and it looked like I was going to play David Keith 's role , so they trotted out in to the studio . Me , Bill Paxton , Mitchell Lichtenstein , Rick Rossovich , John Lavachielli , and basically presented the cast to the studio heads and I remember the moment when we walked into these offices and they said , " These are our guys ? " Sharp intake of breath , and they said , " Thank you very much " . <p> My agent got a call that afternoon , or the next day , saying I got the role , amazing , then they came back and said , " No . You did n't get the role , they 're giving that role to David Keith " , who had just scored big in An Officer And A Gentleman , and he was very , very good in that . And I was crushed , and being very young at the time they asked me if I would play the role of John Alexander , so basically the lead antagonist . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really into doing research about the South back in the 50s and 60s , and the Jim Crow Laws , and I mean , I do n't think that The Lords Of Discipline story took place until the mid-60s , early 70s , when they let the first black cadet in . <p> That story was based on a Pat Conway novel where there was a secret society , supposedly , that I do n't whether they existed or not , but what I always try to convey in the character was that like the norm , back then , was that blacks were n't equal to whites , the norm back then was that blacks swam in their swimming pools , we swam in our swimming pools , they had their babies in their hospitals and so on . <p> I grew up in Alabama . I was born in Alabama during the Jim Crow Laws , and it was the norm , so the idea that this school , and what this school represented , would let a black man in was completely ... it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days everything goes - but I mean , it was so foreign to anything that any of these people thought . <p> They had to bring in the National Guard to integrate the schools in the south , in Alabama , so I played it like I thought I was fighting the right cause . I was trying to bully this guy to get him out of school , because he did n't belong there . <p> Whenever you play an antagonist you always have to have the right on your side , and I felt I had the right on my side . My character thought the people who were trying to segregate the school were wrong , they did n't belong there . It was one of my favourite roles . I was very , very into the character as far as the research that I 'd done , and I could sit and argue , and take the devil 's advocate approach to the situation , and play the Southern racist extremely well . <p> Now , you 've got ta remember , at that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then , a lot of them still are down there , but at that time , it was n't like being a racist , it was like being a white person , so there you go . I had a lot fun playing that role , I had a lot of fun in London , and I formed a lifelong friendship with Bill Paxton and Rick Rossovich . <p> I 'd forgotten that your link with them went that far back , as you 've obviously been in The Terminator and Navy Seals together . So over the years , did you spot for each other , or was it coincidence that you ended up in the same films ? <p> Well , I think that we all met there , I think I had known Rick earlier through an acting class , but I met Bill there , and he knew Jim Cameron from working with him on sets and so on , but the next big movie that came along -- there was some other work after The Lords Of Discipline -- was The Terminator . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a friend of Jim 's , was cast , and I think Bill might 've gotten Rick involved in it , so yeah , I think we were all stomping for each other . I think I called Lewis Teague when we were doing Navy Seals , and said what about Bill Paxton , and y'know , I mean we all liked each other , we were all buddies , young and hungry back then , so yeah , we were pulling for each , definitely . <p> The Terminator ( 1984 ) is next on my list , which I know is a film that there is n't a question you wo n't have been asked about , but could you humour me , and tell me about how you came to be cast , and the problem with the Cat On A Hot Tin Roof audition ? <p> Well , basically , I had worked all morning , rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed for Cat On A Hot Tin Roof for the famous theatre director here named Jos ?

I laugh especially loudly , which just makes him laugh more . <p> I mean , really , I do n't even know if we 've seen the end of it yet , let 's hope so ! You have to remember , at the time , that even after it came out , it was a hit . I mean , Hemdale made it for six point five million dollars , and they made forty million dollars , so it was a hit . But that same year , 1984 I believe , Karate Kid came out and made ninety million dollars , okay ? So you can go back and look at the list of films then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bet you that Terminator 's not even in the top ten . He 's right , it 's not ! <p> What happened was that everybody starting getting their VHS recorders , and they started buying the tapes , and the video stores started opening up right around 1984 , 85 , and that 's where everybody saw the movie , on their cassette players . <p> So it was a hit , but it had been a slow build . You know , people talk about it being an iconic movie , with iconic characters and so on - it was never that back then , and you have to remember , too , that Arnold was not a superstar . He was basically a body builder and Mr Universe and , with all respect due to him for being Mr Universe , but all he had done at that time was Conan , and people did n't take him particularly seriously as an actor . And he only had two lines in the movie ! <p> So it was n't until he went on to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went on to become not only a big , big movie star , but also the governor of California . <p> The success did n't hit like that .

It just came out slowly , and so I did n't realise it was going to be anything until ... I do n't even know when ! <p> Maybe , like , the early 90s , when they made T2 , I figured , " Okay , they 're gon na make T2 , that 's Jim ... and then they 're gon na make T3 . " And then you realise this is a big deal , but it 's very hard to pinpoint the time when I knew it was going to be very good . <p> But at the same time too , I 'll tell you that Jim used to be very open about letting us come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and call me over , " Michael , come look , I 've cut Tech Noir together " , and he 'd show me early cuts of it - the gun shot scenes in Tech Noir , and the racing stuff .

But it was n't like we were working on something like ... what 's the famous film that Brian DePalma did of the Thomas Wolf book ? Bonfire Of The Vanities It was n't like we had a piece of material that everybody thought , " This is going to be great " . <p> When my agents called me about it , they said , " Well we 've got this script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" And at that time , like I said , Arnold was not like the Arnold Schwarzenegger . He was n't somebody that people thought of as an actor , even , and I thought , there 's two strikes . So I asked who 's directing it . <p> And as it turns out , they were all immensely talented people . Gale , Arnold , Jim probably most of all .

I watched about twenty-five minutes of it , and everything was blowing up , there was all that CGI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Worthington was walking around the desert , and things were blowing up , and people were running , and the sound was so loud -- explosions just everywhere . <p> I had been watching it for twenty-five minutes , and I 'd seen nothing but bombs trying to blow people up , and they finally made it to some caves , and there were some weird people in caves , and I was like , " You know what ? I ca n't even watch it , man . " <p> And I 'm usually a person that can sit through almost any movie . I sat and watched Red the other night all the way through . I watched The American all the way through , just to give you an indication of a guy that will stick with a movie that is not necessarily turning him on . But Salvation , I just could n't do it.I just was n't interested in it , you know ? <p> And I do n't have any -- Christian Bale is a brilliant actor , and probably going to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were involved with it -- I do n't have any bitterness towards it , I just was n't interested in it . <p> I do n't think you were alone in that ! When I spoke to Linda Hamilton , we were talking about the convention circuits , and she was saying that she loves doing it , and finds it important to connect with fans . You always seem to be loyal to your fans , even taking time out when asked a question on the street by some random guys on YouTube . Is it important to you ? <p> Well , I do n't necessarily look at it as like my fan base , or a certain group , I like people to see the real Michael Biehn . People say , " Oh Michael Biehn , I love him ! I love him ! " They do n't know me . <p> I like to get up in front of a group of a couple of hundred people and answer questions about -- basically the same thing that I 'm doing with you -- answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making of and really putting history in perspective , the way I saw it . And every once in a while , stopping the urban legend that is always on my Internet sites -- that people always say that I turned down a role in The Usual Suspects , the Bryan Singer movie , and it 's just not true . I do n't know ... <p> Where it came from ? <p> Well I know where it came from , it came from the fact that when I read his script twenty years ago or whatever , I did n't understand it , I was confused by it -- it 's kind of a confusing story if you 're not paying attention , and I 'd probably had a few drinks , and thought , " I do n't get this , man , I do n't get it " , and threw it to the side . It was a huge mistake . It would 've given me a chance to meet Bryan Singer , and I still have n't met Bryan Singer , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did n't understand it . <p> It did n't make any sense to me . Even when I watch the movie now I acknowledge that you really have to stay on top of it to know what 's going on . But they never offered me the role , they said would you like to come in and either audition , or read , or maybe just meet Bryan , and I said , " No man , I do n't understand it , " and of course , I did n't know Bryan Singer was going to be Bryan Singer . I thought it was just a guy with a confusing script ! Laughs <p> I do n't really think of myself as anybody with necessarily a fan base . I 've got some fans on IMDb , the IMDb page , on the discussion boards . I think I 've got thirty or forty people that are always talking amongst themselves . I hope that what I do as an actor provides some enjoyment for people , and that 's really all I hope for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment , or some retrospective thinking to people , and that 's about it . <p> You know , fan bases , or fans and so forth ... I do like to go to the conventions to talk and answer questions about certain things that have come up , and certain misconceptions about me , and I like to talk frankly about some of the problems I 've had in the past , or working in the business . You know , once I 'm gone , people can say anything they want about me , but at least my side of the story will be out there . <p> With Aliens 1986 , you came in to it fairly late in the day , when James Remar had originally started playing Hicks ... <p> Correct . <p> Was it strange to come in that late in the day , or was it quite nice , because you had Bill Paxton and people there - was it a welcoming fold to enter ? <p> Yeah . It was actually very , very -- I got called by Gale Hurd on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said yes , and I was shooting Monday morning . Which meant that I did n't have to do that three weeks of rehearsal period , before the movie started , where they did the round table reading , and they would take all the soldiers out and march them over and over again , and have all the dinners . <p> I just jumped right in , I just did it from the word go , and so that was a relief to me , because any time anyone does an army movie , they take all the actors out and get some old worn out drill sergeant to put ' em through their paces , and I hate to do that . I really did n't want to do that . <p> So I just jumped in there and did it . The one thing I did n't like about it was they made me wear Remar 's vest , his chest plate - every actor got to create his own chest plate , and James Remar created his and he painted it . Everybody painted theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock on it , and the painted heart was right where his heart was , and I thought , " Fuck me , I 'm not wearing that - that looks exactly like a target to me ! " Laughs <p> All this camouflaged green , and then , all of a sudden , you 'd see this pink blur and think , " I 'm going to shoot at that " . I did n't really appreciate that ! But yeah , I came in late , but I enjoyed it . <p> I know that a portion of the cast went on to work on Near Dark , so I wondered if it was something you ever contemplated , or was it ever an option ? <p> Yes , yes it was . You know Kathryn Bigalow , the director called and offered me the role that Lance Henriksen played , and again , I read that script and I found it confusing , and I made a mistake , probably , by passing on it . I 'm a very linear person - I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes do n't make sense to me , it 's very hard for me to progress with them . I mean , I had real trouble with movies like Memento and Irreversible , and the flashbacks , stuff like that . <p> Again , it was a mistake that I made , because I would 've loved to have worked with Kathryn , because she went on to do the movie with Patrick Swayze and Keanu Point Break , and there was a call that was made to me about the Patrick Swayze role in that , also . That was a mistake , that I did n't do Near Dark . I look at it , and I 've seen it recently , and it 's an interesting film from a first time filmmaker , and she 's a brilliant filmmaker . <p> But there have been other , dumber , things that I 've done as far as turning down roles , but that was one that I actually did get an offer on , and I probably should 've done it .

Facing three months hard labour and a recommendation for deportation , he appealed against the conviction and had it quashed . Just two months later , he was arrested for threatening to kill someone , but again got off . He appeared to have a surprising ability to avoid punishment . <p> Up to 1915 , Won Tip had told the authorities he came from China , but with the threat of deportation hanging over him , he changed his family history to say he came from Hong Kong and so qualified as a British subject . <p> As with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideline out of processing opium for his fellow Asian smokers .

The deportation order was withdrawn and Won Tip went back to his business . <p> Burgess petitioned the Governor of Hong Kong who studied Won Tip 's documents and declared them false . But this process had taken three years and the Home Office felt too much time had passed since his appearance in the High Court to issue a fresh deportation order .

He failed to go ahead with his planned bombing , in the northern town of Suleimaniyah , when he heard his planned victims , a group of officials , talking in the accents of his home city . <p> Abu Mujahed , a self-styled " resistance fighter " in Baghdad in 2004 , was adamant that he hated al-Qaeda " almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with them , he insisted , calling them " terrorists " and " foreigners " . <p> I 've spoken to many other militants in the ten years since the 9/11 attacks and , by and large , those conversations too have confirmed what these three examples seem to indicate : when it comes to war , local loyalties beat the big ideas every time . <p> This is an important lesson not just for policymakers and strategists but for everyone interested in violence . Indeed , it is an important lesson for anyone interested in globalization which , I think the last decade actually tells us , is one of the most hyped ideas for a very long time . What the conflicts of the last ten years - those which I tentatively call " The 9/11 Wars " - tell us is that is that local identities , local customs , local cultures , local ties of blood and shared values are still much more important than any supposed convergence of lifestyles across the world . Yes , there are global economic flows and everyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baghdad , Kandahar , Peshawar , Aden , all across the complex and dynamic battlefields of recent years , people are not only very different but will fight to remain different . <p> Happily this works for us and against us . It means that " big ideas " of how other people should best run their societies are very difficult to transfer . Even convincing people peaceably is hard enough , let alone trying to do it by force . While I was an embed in Afghanistan in 2009 , a Sergeant turned to me after a particularly frustrating three day operation during which local villagers had been far from welcoming and said : " It would be so much easier if people just let us help them . " <p> Yes it would . But people are n't like that , as we found out in Iraq too . <p> On the other hand , Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda and its own ideology was as disrespectful of cultural differences as anything coming out of the West . From London or Washington , that may seem odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't . Al-Qaeda speaks Arabic , but only about a third of the world 's Muslims do . Al-Qaeda wants a new Muslim caliphate to replace modern states . But most people , from Morocco to Malaysia , are pretty attached to their nations - as recent protests have shown . Why did the tribes of western Iraq turn against al-Qaeda ? Because they did not think the foreign brand of extremism and the particularly unpleasant people who were propagating it served their communities ' - and their own - interests any longer . So they switched sides , and al-Qaeda in Iraq was finished . <p> This is most clearly seen with the violence itself . Condoning violence a long way away - say in the US when you are in Egypt - is much easier than supporting someone planting bombs on your own street . In country after country across the Muslim world , support for bin Laden and his tactics collapsed when attacks started close to home . And to come back to the theme of local activism again , two facts are worth considering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks such as 9/11 itself , the vast proportion , 95% I 'd guess , of violent activity occurs within a couple of hours travel , at most , from where the perpetrators live . <p> Two : 80 percent of Taliban militants killed or captured in Afghanistan , at least according to what US military intelligence officers told me in Kabul in June , are killed or captured within 15 miles of their homes . Islamic terrorism is not about big ideas . It is about the local contexts that allow , usually temporarily , those ideas to get a purchase . <p> In fact , the search to understand the phenomenon of modern militancy can take you even further down the scale , from communities to small groups . In 2005 I investigated a mass suicide attack in Thailand in which a dozen young men died . They were all part of the same football team . There was no obvious charismatic leader . There was no link to al-Qaeda . There was just the dynamics within a group of people that took them , swiftly but incrementally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did more for their friends - or because of what the whole group was doing - than for any cause . I 've seen the same motivation among regular soldiers fighting in a dozen different theatres . They fight for their regiment , for their mates , because they are where they are . MI5 now recognize this and focus heavily on identifying such processes . Terrorism is a social activity , a deeply abhorrent , moral unjustifiable one , but a social activity like any other .

The blades of grass pull through their split hooves and inflame the skin , which in turn can lead to scaldPhoto : Nigel Cattlin /Alamy <p> The sight of sheep grazing in green pastures as we zoom past at 70mph is for many of us a reminder that God 's in His Heaven and all 's right with the world . It is only when we slow down and get a little closer to the animals that we might begin to wonder if all might not be right after all . <p> The people who are closest of all , the sheep farmers themselves , tend to think that their sheep are fine even when many of them appear to be limping . If you asked a sheep farmer how many of his sheep were lame , he probably could n't tell you . Neither can anyone else . The first attempt to assess lameness in the British flock was not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , but even so , the percentage of lame animals was 8.4 per cent . Ten years later , that figure was raised to 10 per cent , and there , shamefully and shockingly , it remains . <p> Given that there are between 30 and 35 million sheep in Britain , which means that at any one time , the number of lame sheep must be between three and 3.5 million . They are lame because their pastures are green . Today 's sheep are descended from animals that roamed on stony hillsides . Though sheep have lived in damp grassy fields in Britain for two millennia or more , their feet have not adapted to mud and fermenting faeces . When sheep , especially lambs , walk through grass , the blades pull through their split hooves and inflame the skin . <p> All it takes is an organism called Fusobacterium necrophorum , which is always present in sheep droppings , and the animals will develop the symptoms of scald ( interdigital dermatitis ) . If the bacillus Dichelobacter nodosus is also proliferating in the pasture -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot . <p> Many sheep farmers who are aware of the extent of foot rot appear unconvinced that their limping sheep are suffering . Sheep with unbearably painful feet do n't run amok , froth at the mouth or bite people . They do n't even go off their feed . They may tend to lie down . Otherwise , they behave normally , put on weight , maybe more slowly than the farmer might wish , get pregnant , give birth . But they do limp . <p> A new disease called contagious ovine digital dermatitis adds another dimension to the sheep 's propensity to limp . This form of foot rot is so severe that it can result in the shedding of the entire hoof . Attempts to control this trio of foot infections are costly and largely ineffective . The profit margins from sheep farming have always been narrow and , to hear farmers tell it , costs have risen higher and faster as the value of sheep meat has fallen . Farmers have endured changes to the Common Agricultural Policy that made little or no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to the maintenance of the historic British landscape , we are now back in a regime of subsidies per beast rather than subsidies per farm . Any increase in density of stocking will involve dire suffering for the sheep . <p> The one reliable control for foot diseases in sheep is to keep moving them into pastures that have been free of sheep for long enough for bacteria to die out . In the Asiatic regions where sheep originated , nomadic farmers kept their flocks moving throughout the year . In Britain , farmers are sedentary and few have enough land to keep their sheep in clean pasture . In the present economic circumstances , fewer still will be able to leave pasture for the time necessary . <p> In today 's Britain , sheep are kept not for wool , but for meat . Though the British no longer eat mutton and are eating less lamb than they used to , nearly 17 million lambs are slaughtered every year . Most lambs are dead by the age of four months . Defra 's own guess is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewe 's job is to produce as many lambs as possible at a time when the market is optimal , which is why she is often required to give birth in midwinter to at least two and preferably three offspring . So , despite the cuddliness of programmes like Country File , it 's a tough life being a sheep . <p> Causing suffering to an animal is only an offence if the suffering is considered to be " unnecessary " . It would seem that the pain caused to sheep by tail-docking and castration are considered " necessary " . Castration by any of the available methods causes acute pain at the time and can result in chronic pain for the rest of the animal 's life . Attempts to improve both procedures have proven inconclusive and contradictory . Routine castration and tail-docking are still the fate of lambs in most of the developed world . <p> Before the suffering of sheep can be taken more seriously , we must take the animals seriously . It is assumed that they are , well , sheepish , insensitive and slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog . When shepherds watched their flocks , they probably knew better . <p> In an ongoing investigation of the degenerative processes of Huntington 's disease , a flock of transgenic sheep was trained to perform a series of tasks . To the chief investigator 's surprise , the sheep learnt their tasks in hours when she had scheduled weeks . She gave them names , and in days they knew which were theirs . They knew who she was , whether she wore her blue overalls or not . What was more , they were all different : each new trial was met in different ways by different individuals . <p> I went to see her and saw for myself how a sheep faced with new challenges sized them up and chose their own way of dealing with them . <p> For a year , I kept five North Country Cheviots on two acres in mid-Anglia . They were the naughtiest animals I have ever had to manage . They learnt how to bust open the gate by standing side by side and pushing against it ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat leaves off them ; they broke out into the farmer 's field , something none of my dogs has ever figured out how to do . Elsewhere , sheep have been seen wriggling over cattle grids on their backs . We may not understand their flocking behaviour , but we can not dismiss sheep as mindless , nor think they do not recollect trauma or register pain . <p> When human beings find it necessary or convenient to abuse other creatures , they convince themselves that the victims are inferior beings and unaware of their own wretched condition . We used to think that way about other humans , but we do n't any more . It is time now to consider whether we are justified in making a routine practice of torturing sheep . We may think that the Mosaic slaughter of sheep is barbaric , but it is far less cruel than allowing them to limp through life on rotten feet .

@@4304236 <h> Why state surveys asked about bras and haddock <p> From bra ownership to television interference , the government has wanted to know some strange stuff about people in the UK . Now a history of social surveys reveals why . <p> In 1941 , Britain 's fight with Nazi Germany lay in the balance . But no effort was spared to improve the war effort . In November of that year , researchers from the Board of Trade interviewed 5,000 women about their lingerie collections . <p> The survey was well intentioned - to work out the amount of steel that was being diverted from the war effort to prop up women 's corsets and other garments . But it led to unintended humour and , for a modern readership , some surprising answers . <p> It showed that on average women in 1941 owned 1.2 such items of underwear each . There were some strange variations , with housewives owning 0.8 brassieres but agricultural workers 1.9 . <p> The report explained its purpose with a lofty air : " Only with this information can the greatest efficiency in planning be secured . It was therefore felt that detailed information should be secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - foundation garments . " <p> The underwear survey is just one of a number of studies being highlighted by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) to mark the 70th anniversary of its social surveys . Others are shocking rather than amusing , such as the 1951 survey looking at " public attitudes towards coloured people " . <p> Image caption Planes and televisions did not mix well in 1961 <p> Another brings up period detail . In a 1961 survey on attitudes to aircraft noise , 78% of people complained that planes at Heathrow made their television flicker . <p> In 1981 , alarm over the amount women were drinking caused a survey to be undertaken by ONS . Yet the investigation found more than 70% of women drank fewer than five units a week . These days the average figure is eight units a week , with a unit equalling a small glass of wine . <p> In the 1990s the ONS looked at smoking in secondary schools and in 2001 turned its attention to sex and contraception - not an area where a 1950s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Kellner 's mother worked as a social survey fieldworker for the state during World War II .

" In those days bananas were almost impossible to get . But as a result of her discovery , the tiny supply Britain had was diverted to Middlesbrough to keep the girl alive . " <p> Kellner , president of YouGov , is not surprised that 1941 researchers were interested in the availability of women 's underwear . " At a time of war it was incredibly important to know what the population was up to and how rationing was affecting them . " <p> The survey is a rich source for future generations , says social historian Juliet Gardiner . " The questions are interesting because they reflect the preoccupations of the society . These worries can be quite hard for the historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rulers to measure social change , from the Domesday Book of William the Conqueror to the census , which began in Britain in 1801 . But in recent years , the boundaries have been pushed by independent organisations rather than government . <p> And such surveys can sometimes outrage the authorities , says Andrew Phelps , who managed the National Centre for Social Research 's latest sex survey . The first of these sex surveys in 1990 had to find new backers after the Thatcher government pulled the plug . <p> " It almost got handbagged by Maggie . It was seen as too intrusive - they said people would n't tell the truth . And they were perhaps worried that it would show the British in too subversive a light . " <p> The survey , now in its third decade , is today supported by research foundations and provides information on sexual behaviour that informs government policy . <p> It asks interviewees about the number of recent sexual partners , erectile dysfunction and sexuality . And at the end the respondent is asked to provide a urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not about two-thirds of people are fine with that , " Phelps says . <h> Alfresco sex <p> Dr John Walton , author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class , says Britain has a long tradition of asking the population apparently absurd questions . <p> In the 1930s civil servants from the fisheries ministry toured the country asking people about fish and chip consumption . As well as the ubiquitous cod and haddock , they found Geordies ate coalfish , while Londoners opted for hake . <p> Then there was Mass Observation , an ambitious project launched in the 1930s by the polymath Tom Harrisson . The aim was to record the way ordinary Britons lived , using diaries , questionnaires and by following people around and noting down their habits . <p> Image caption More or less attractive ? The Mass Observation project was interested in moustaches <p> Areas of interest ranged from whether moustaches made men more attractive , the speed with which people could drink a half-pint , and how much alfresco sex was taking place in Blackpool during August . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Walton . <p> " So Mass Observation decided to visit and test the legend out . They went out at night and fell over couples on the beach and noted down how many were having sexual intercourse . " <p> They recorded four such cases , only to have the study reliability jeopardised when it emerged that one of the participants was a Mass Observation researcher . <p> " I like Mass Observation because a lot of their questions are asked with blue skies curiosity , " he says , whereas many social surveys today are policy-driven by government and so can fall prey to a particular agenda or ideological fashion . <p> A lot has changed since the ONS began its social surveys . Today the organisation can call upon an army of 1,000 interviewers , far more than the number doing the job in 1941 . <p> And now the social survey is heading into new , and some might argue unmeasurable , territory - personal well-being . <p> " Overall , how happy did you feel yesterday ? " and " Overall , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life are worthwhile ? " are two questions that may surprise ONS statisticians from earlier eras . <p> So will future generations be poring over the answers in a similar way to our fascination with the 20th Century social surveys ? Undoubtedly , says Gardiner . <p> " The well-being survey will be hugely interesting to future historians . They 'll be fascinated by the idea that you can quantify happiness and be intrigued by what indices you use to do that . "

The expectation in political circles is that this review will provide justification to scrap the tax before the next election . <p> According to Jeffrey Owens , head of taxation policy at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , although governments across advanced economies have sought to raise more revenue by taxes , countries have not reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While during the 1970s and early 1980s , governments would impose very high taxes on the richest in society and often turn a blind eye to avoidance by means of the liberal exploitation of large deductions and allowances against tax , the tendency since has been to lower headline rates on the rich . <p> In advanced economies , top central government income tax rates were commonly 70 per cent in 1981 , but had fallen almost everywhere to about 40 per cent by the start of this century . The effect , according to Mr Owens , has been beneficial to the rich , especially because initial attempts to reduce avenues for tax avoidance alongside lower rates gradually diminished . " Tax systems have become less progressive in terms of design than they were in the mid-1980s , " he says . <p> The trends in income taxes have been replicated by other taxes affecting the rich .

Finance ministers today do not get credit for squeezing the rich to aim at more equality , but seek political gains from forming more efficient tax rates . <p> Measuring such efficiency is notoriously difficult , however . A UK study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested recently that 40 per cent was likely to be the revenue-maximising rate of top rate income tax and so the 50 per cent rate might not raise any new cash for the exchequer . Stuart Adam , economist at the IFS , however , notes that this estimate is extremely imprecise and the institute could be confident only that the maximising rate was somewhere between 33 per cent and 65 per cent -- a huge difference in political terms . <p> Before the rich celebrate that their incomes are safe from the taxman , there are two reasons for them to be fearful . <p> First is a new attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from income that do not count in tax calculations . Mr Owens sees that in some OECD countries -- particularly France and the US -- authorities seek to reduce the generosity of these expenditures in an effort to raise revenues . <p> Second , cross-border evasion has become more difficult as offshore locations seek to avoid being blacklisted as uncooperative tax havens . Many have signed agreements to share information with large economies , while Switzerland and Liechtenstein have agreed to levy charges on foreign bank accounts . <p> These avenues might increase the tax burden somewhat on those with the highest incomes , but there is no sign of tax systems going back to the high rates of a generation ago . As well as enjoying more rapid growth of incomes than the rest of the population of advanced economies , the rich can still feel reasonably safe in tax systems that are unlikely to squeeze them dry .

Starting Saturday , there will be a large number of security personnel and policemen who will go back to work . Now the revolutionaries of Tripoli are able to protect their own city .

@@4306239 <h> BBC Proms : Missa Solemnis , London Symphony Orchestra , Davis <h> A sober Beethoven offers a topical mass for an age of war <p> While revered and respected , Beethoven 's Missa Solemnis has never inspired audiences with the same affection as Bach 's B minor Mass , Haydn 's Nelson Mass , or even Mozart 's Coronation or C minor settings . Perhaps it 's the austerity , the monumentality of the work Beethoven knew to be his greatest that rejects the easy assimilation into secular concert life , perhaps it 's more simply the lack of big tunes to wash down all that liturgy . Furtw ? ngler famously drew back from the work 's sacred challenges as he grew older , but Sir Colin Davis is evidently determined to keep tackling a work whose performance he has likened to " failing to reach the top of Mount Everest " . <p> If last night 's performance was indeed a failure then it was one of singular ambition and scope -- an interpretation that bears the wisdom-scars of Davis 's many decades of exploration . Just as his previous Proms appearance with the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester was marked by quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what he wanted from his forces , even if they occasionally fell a little short of his vision . <p> The thoughtful radiance of the opening orchestral gambit was gilded by the first choral entry , a plosive fire of energy from the combined forces of the London Symphony Chorus ( pictured below ) and the London Philharmonic Choir . This protracted Kyrie requires the impetus of the opening plea to carry this single thought through some 10 minutes of development to culminate in the obsessive chanting repetitions that bring the chorus parts to a close . Here Davis 's choral forces guided the audience carefully through the many faces of intercession Beethoven exposes , gaining our trust before mercilessly flinging us aside for the ensemble virtuosity of the Gloria . <p> The difficulties of this high-lying work are immense for the chorus , and if the tenors occasionally sounded a little rustic ( their initial " glorificamus " prefigured an extraordinary and somewhat previous bellow at " et resurrexit " ) then their bravery and willingness to hurl themselves off musical precipices for Davis could n't be faulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " qui propter nos homines " in the Credo that was the tender equal of McCreesh 's youthful choruses in Elijah , and the full ensemble pianissimo at " et vitam venturi " had the intensity that no chamber group can achieve . <p> Moving in and out of the choral and instrumental textures , Beethoven 's quartet of soloists are unusually embedded into the Mass . Sarah Connolly , absolute mistress of her vocal colourings , brought her very sternest , most Germanic delivery to the performance , warming her tone just enough to hint at the hope of redemption that Beethoven himself never fully embraces . Soprano Helena Juntunen , by contrast , was all operatic languor -- a beautiful technical performance , but perhaps just a little too Italianate at times for absolute musical ( and emotional ) authenticity . <p> I struggled to resolve Paul Groves 's rather whiny tenor contributions with the more generous tones of the other three , and his tension was shared by leader Gordan Nikolitch 's violin solo ( why standing ? ) in the Benedictus , whose nerves seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human frailty . <p> With the anniversary of 9/11 approaching and events in Libya daily coloured with further details of horror , Beethoven 's Mass -- military echoes of war never long absent -- has a topical urgency that was n't lost in Davis 's closing . Balancing the spat violence of the chorus 's Agnus Dei with the whimpering , cringing hope of the repetitions " pacem , pacem " , the musicians left us uncertain of our fate -- a people still praying for the benediction of a deity whose existence we deny . <h> Share this article <h> Comments <p> I 'm not sure what Simon Broughton means by ' live TV directing ' but I can tell him that I watched and listened on very high-end equipment - and the sound was among the worst of the season .

I was doing the live TV directing of the concert , which means getting to know the music pretty well . And I can attest that the Missa Solemnis takes a while to get under the skin and it 's easy to see why it has n't got the popular appeal of Bach , Haydn , or indeed Verdi masses . It is serious and , at times , troubled . But in the performance itself I thought Sir Colin gave it a rugged grandeur and inetgrity which was quite compelling . And yes , there was a lot of adrenalin involved . <p> I have had the privilege of singing in the chorus of three performances of the Missa Solemnis , many years ago now , but I have never forgotten them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war horses , Verdi Requiem , Mozart , Bach , Elgar etc and glorious though many of these works are , the Missa Solemnis , for me is the greatest choral work ever written . And , yes I know all about the Matthew Passion so nobody write and tell me ! I am always incredibly moved and uplifted by this work and the solo violin in the Benedictus always reduces me to tears . Surely one of the most sublime pieces of music ever written . I have loved Sir Colin Davis all my musical life and sad to see him looking bowed down with sorrow and yet every now and then he would look up , a smile cross his face and it lifted the heart . A wonderful Prom . <p> Hi ! I enjoyed reading your balanced review . I was one of the chorus members and had the privilege of singing under Sir Colin Davis in this concert .

@@4307230 <h> Pensioners who chose income drawdown rather than an annuity to fund their retirement face a cut of up to 40pc in their income . <p> This devastating fall in pension payments is the result of a triple whammy hitting income drawdown : declines in the stock market , falling returns on gilts , which are used to calculate maximum incomes from drawdown , and a change in the rules governing this calculation . <p> Many pensioners will see their incomes cut when their drawdown plans come up for review . These reviews , conducted by the pension plan manager , have to take place five years after drawdown began , and every three years thereafter . ( New plans are now reviewed for the first time after three years . ) <p> Anyone who started income drawdown following " pensions simplification " on " A Day " -- April 6 2006 -- will be facing their first review about now . " Most of the first set of five-year drawdown reviews would have kicked off in April or May of this year , and will be gathering pace at the moment , " said Vince Smith-Hughes of Prudential , the insurer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge reductions in income can take place and what pension savers can do about it -- whether they are about to take an income from their pension pot or have already embarked on income drawdown . <p> When the time comes to start taking an income from the pension pot you have built up over your working life , you have two main choices . The first is spending all or part of the pot on an income for life -- an annuity . The second is to leave your pension pot just as it is but start taking out a regular monthly sum . <p> In either case you can take out 25pc of the fund as a tax-free lump sum . Any income from either an annuity or drawdown is taxable . <h> HOW MUCH INCOME CAN YOU TAKE ? <p> If you have a guaranteed income from other sources of at least ? 20,000 a year , you can take as much income from drawdown as you like . <p> Otherwise , when you set up a drawdown plan , the rules determine the maximum monthly income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any amount between zero and this upper limit , and you can vary your income as often as you like . <p> The maximum income you can draw is roughly equivalent to the income you would get if you used the same fund to buy an annuity ( non-index-linked and with no spouse 's pension ) . The exact figure is calculated from a reference gilt yield laid down by the Government Actuary 's Department ( GAD ) . Currently , this formula allows a 65-year-old man to draw down an income of up to 6.1pc of his fund . <p> Although the GAD figure can change monthly , your own maximum income , calculated when you start the plan , wo n't change until your next review . <p> Not many investments can produce regular growth of 6.1pc , so anyone taking the maximum income must be prepared to see the capital value of their pension pot shrink . <p> Normally , eating away at your capital like this would be something to avoid at all costs . However , at this stage of life it need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years down the line should still buy the same level of income , via an annuity , that you could have bought at the outset . This is because annuities cost less as you get older , reflecting the shorter time that they will pay out for . <h> WHY COULD MY INCOME BE ABOUT TO FALL ? <p> Many people using income drawdown will be approaching their first review , when their maximum income is recalculated . <p> This is where people face a triple whammy . Firstly , gilt yields -- and therefore annuity rates and the GAD rates -- have fallen sharply since 2006 . Secondly , until April this year you were allowed to take up to 120pc of the GAD rate . Now you can take just 100pc . Thirdly , many pension pots will have been hit by the recent weakness in the stock market . <p> The review could see a typical pensioner 's income fall by almost 40pc , said Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown , the advisory firm . " Someone who went into drawdown in 2006 at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the maximum income for five years would now be facing a drop in income from around ? 8,400 a year to ? 5,100 a year , " he said , adding that the fund value would have fallen from ? 100,000 to ? 73,063 . <p> The new income limit will apply until your next review in three years ' time . <h> WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT ? <p> There is no easy fix to this fall in income . You could decide to abandon drawdown and buy an annuity with your remaining pot . If your health has deteriorated since you began your plan , you may qualify for a better rate . <p> But buying an annuity now means cashing in your fund when it has not had a chance to recover from the recent stock market falls and when annuity rates are at a record low . Of course , there is nothing to say the markets and annuity rates will not get worse still , rather than recovering . <p> " Trying to second guess future annuity rates is a mug 's game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy an annuity when you need one -- do n't try to be too clever . Alternatively , buy a series of annuities at intervals so that you are not tying yourself into one rate for life . " <p> You can cash in your pot to buy an annuity , or vary your income , at any time . The other possibility is changing the investments in your pension pot . But while your asset mix should be kept under regular review , advisers caution against switching simply because markets have fallen or to chase higher returns . <p> " Short-term responses to volatile markets can do more harm than good , " Mr McPhail said . " You need reasonable exposure to equities to make drawdown work -- it 's best just to accept the volatility and variable income that come with it . " <p> To avoid depleting your capital by taking out too much income , Mr McPhail said it made sense to withdraw just the income produced by the fund , leaving the underlying assets intact . <p> In any case , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> WOULD I HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF BUYING AN ANNUITY ? <p> If you took out a drawdown plan five years ago , the answer is probably yes .

If your fund tracked the FTSE 100 index , it would have fallen in value to ? 88,000 now , Mr Smith-Hughes calculated . <p> But the fund would also have been depleted by the income you had taken , totalling ? 30,000 over five years . This leaves the fund worth ? 58,000 at the time of your review . At current annuity rates this would buy an income for life of ? 3,600 , whereas your income would have been ? 6,000 a year if you had bought an annuity at the outset . <h> I 'M ABOUT TO RETIRE .

Investment returns and annuity rates generally could also improve , while drawdown allows you to leave some of your pension pot to your family when you die . <p> Hargreaves Lansdown said : " Providing the fund is not depleted by excessive income withdrawals or poor investment performance , it may be possible to increase your income later in life with income drawdown .

They are called micro lens inlays . In this procedure both your eyes are laser-corrected for distance vision , your natural lens stays in situ and a minute synthetic lens is implanted just where you would look down to read . It is like bifocal specs without the specs . Stevens is studying the long-term effects of having micro lens inlays . It might be wise to see what he has to say about that in the future . Nobody wants to be a guinea pig , although having said that , I met someone who was the first in line for laser surgery in 1989 and he is still as happy as Larry with the result . <p> My next stop was The London Vision Clinic , an uber-swanky laser eye clinic in a town house on Harley Street , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an American professor called Dan Reinstein ( who also plays the sax ) . He does something he calls " blended vision " , where one of your eyes is focused for distance and the other one for close-up . This is refractive surgery , where the curvature of your cornea ( at the front of your eye ) is altered to cure any astigmatism . The surgeon creates a very thin flap of tissue in the cornea , the flap is lifted and a precise amount of tissue removed . The flap is replaced and starts to heal instantly , usually within six hours . Except in my case , it did n't . <p> I had chosen the laser surgery because it had sounded so cuddly compared with the implants . The clinic is rigorous in its pre-operative assessments and postponed my surgery for a month while I tackled my ( previously known ) blepharitis ( see box ) . <p> The surgery was painless and quick -- it takes minutes . But when I went back the day after , the professor realised I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went back the next day , and the next . It was then that he diagnosed an allergy to the preservative that is in all of the eye drops you need to put in every 15 minutes after surgery . The flap was not closing . This also turns out not to be uncommon -- about one in 100 -- and I was unlucky . It had no long-term consequences but it had meant spending a week in a darkened room . Only a great effort of will , and a lot of Radio 4 Extra , enabled me to put it out of my mind . <p> My vision has improved . My left eye , which does distance , can see an extra line on the chart than I could with my glasses . My near vision is compromised by having to do short and middle distance and I now need a bright reading light . I used to be able to read the A-Z in the dark , but that was a symptom of my myopia , Professor Reinstein said . Obviously , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and the advantage of the lens implants would have been stereo vision in both eyes . <p> Stevens told me an interesting thing : we get the eyesight we need . People who read all the time are likely to be short-sighted . Footballers are likely to be long-sighted because they need to see the ball . Perhaps their salaries are so enormous because they can only read VERY BIG NUMBERS . <p> Short-sightedness . My prescription was only -2.25 in one eye and -1.75 in the other , but with astigmatism in both eyes . Laser surgery , known as Lasik , can treat someone with a prescription up to -16 depending on their corneal thickness . <p> Astigmatism <p> Very common and treatable . A normal eye is curved equally in all directions , but in astigmatism the curvature of the cornea is not the same in the horizontal and vertical directions . This means the light rays do not focus at a single point , causing distorted vision . People with a significant astigmatism may need lens implants followed by laser surgery . <p> Presbyopia <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes less flexible , making it harder for the eye to change focus from distant objects to near . It usually starts at around 45 , until the lens loses most of its focusing ability around 65 . <p> Amblyopia <p> Another condition I have , sometimes called " lazy eye " . It means your vision is n't fully developed . When vision is decreased it can not be improved beyond a certain level by laser surgery . <p> Blepharitis <p> It is a common condition and is treated with a hot mask , a mild shampoo and eye drops . Dry eye is caused by tiny blocked glands around the eye . It is n't serious but a lack of natural lubrication affects your recovery from surgery . <p> Cataracts <p> The lens is cloudy and vision is impaired . They are more common with increasing age , but can occur at any time . You can have your cataracts out and new lenses implanted in the same operation . The surgery is available on the NHS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4309230 <h> The West is staring into an economic abyss deepened by political paralysis in the US and EU -- but Britain must stick to its financial Plan A. <p> Europe is in disarray , stock markets are plunging , the banking crisis is back in full swing , gold is at record levels , and both the UK and US are self-evidently slipping back towards recession -- not since the autumn of 2008 have things looked quite so ominous . <p> We appear to be at another pivotal moment , with Western economies once more staring into the abyss . At a conference in Frankfurt this week , Josef Ackermann , chief executive of Deutsche Bank , compared events to the Lehman Brothers catastrophe of 2008 and warned that many banks in Europe are essentially bust . His opposite number at KfW went further still and said that the present cocktail of negatives was " much more dramatic than 2008 " . <p> Back then , governments and central banks still had the financial firepower and the will to attack the problem with massive injections of fiscal and monetary stimulus . <p> Today , the fiscal armoury is exhausted , while it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " quantitative easing " would have any effect beyond adding to inflation . <p> Indeed , the parallels look alarmingly closer to the banking collapses of 1931 , which plunged the world into prolonged depression , than the storms around the Lehman collapse . <p> In Europe and the US policymakers are paralysed -- by growing Euroscepticism among electorates on the one hand and fierce Republican resistance to further deficit spending on the other . There is little or no consensus about what needs to be done . In Europe , governments are a million miles away from either of the two remedies likely to resolve the crisis : break-up of the euro or the establishment of political and fiscal union . <p> The euro debt crisis seems to have reached an intractable state of affairs , with leaders apparently unprepared to contemplate either reconstitution of the currency along lines that would allow the distressed periphery to reflate their economies out of depression , or the establishment of a United States of Europe -- where ad hoc and crisis-invoked bail-outs are replaced by clear-cut mechanisms for fiscal transfers between surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for the hills . Mass and disorderly default appears to be the only way in which events can unfold . The distinct possibility of catastrophic loss once more looms large across the world economy . <p> Against this grim backdrop , the cacophony of voices arguing that governments and central banks change tack , postpone fiscal consolidation and crank up the printing presses again grows steadily louder . To the scratched record of Ed Balls , the shadow chancellor , and the neo-Keynesian economists he takes his cue from , must be added Christine Lagarde , the newly installed managing director of the International Monetary Fund , John Cridland , director general of the CBI , and Bill Gross , head of the world 's largest bond fund , Pimco . <p> Little more than two years ago , Mr Gross claimed that Britain was sitting on a bed of nitroglycerine unless it took action on the deficit . He has changed his mind . Now he thinks there is scope for rescheduling of the austerity programme so as to avoid recession . <p> With the US economy slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched one last plea to Republicans to agree a jobs package of reflationary infrastructure spending . His chances are about the same as those of Chancellor Angela Merkel persuading German voters to accept a joint liability union -- close to zero . <p> What of our Government ? Is it time to roll out the fabled Plan B , and back off on fiscal consolidation ? In a speech to the Lloyd 's of London City dinner last night , George Osborne , the Chancellor , again made clear that he is not for turning , and he 's right to do so . Whatever action the Government takes , it will have no impact on the two underlying causes of the present turmoil -- economic weakness in the US and the eurozone 's existential crisis . <p> The solution to these crises lies in the hands of others . The UK must participate in whatever international action is taken to fight the downturn , but it can not tell the eurozone how to heal itself , nor can it break the political deadlock on Capitol Hill . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going so seriously astray is to ensure that the UK remains in control of its own affairs , and on this front the present mix of tight fiscal policy , exceptionally accommodative monetary policy and a strongly pro-enterprise agenda looks broadly correct . <p> The most important thing is to keep interest rates as low as possible , for nothing would be more guaranteed to send the debt-burdened UK economy into a tailspin than a rise in borrowing costs . Amid calls for a further loosening of the purse strings , it seems to have been forgotten that even under current plans , Britain is continuing to add to the national debt at frightening speed . <p> Something could indeed be done to alter the spending mix , so that more money is devoted to expansionary and job-creating infrastructure investment , but there is very little scope for fiscal easing without breaking the bank . What is more , something has to be kept back for the growing likelihood of complete eurozone meltdown . <p> A powerful external shock of this sort might well provide the justification for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be every man for himself . By sticking to the script now , Britain earns the right to react appropriately with temporary measures to support demand when things get really tough . It would be folly to use up whatever goodwill the country has earned in markets over the past year before the hurricane has struck . <p> Nor is it strictly accurate to say there is no Plan B. As long as fiscal policy remains under control , the Bank of England still has the scope to react to any extreme deflationary threat with further quantitative easing . The consolidation plan is also sufficiently flexible through the " automatic stabilisers " to allow for a more drawn-out fiscal consolidation in the event that growth falls significantly short of expectations . <p> And for those of an optimistic frame of mind , it is still reasonable to argue that despite the headlines and evident panic , the tell-tale indicators of financial and economic distress are still not as bad , at least in the UK and the US , as they were in the immediate run-up to the Lehman crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain just about open , and there is not yet the same complete collapse in consumer and business confidence as then . <p> Even so , nobody should be under any illusions as to what lies ahead . " Failure to tackle the imbalances in trade and credit flows during the seven years of plenty before 2007 threatens seven lean years thereafter , " Sir Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England , said in his Mansion House speech last June . " After a deep-seated banking crisis , now transmuted into a sovereign debt crisis , the need to reduce debt as the world adjusts to a new equilibrium pattern of spending and trade will mean only a gradual recovery in many advanced economies . " <p> It scarcely needs saying that so far we have had only four of the seven years of famine . And grim though this prognosis looks , it almost certainly understates the Governor 's true assessment . The private view will be more alarming still . <p> It took Europe over 40 years of economic and political turmoil to recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the First World War . Much as today , creditors and debtors tore each other apart economically in attempting to find a politically acceptable form of burden-sharing . We all know how the currency and trade wars of that era ended . <p> According to the Russian economist Nicolai Kondratiev , there is a much longer economic cycle of fast and slow growth lasting between 40 and 60 years that overlays the short-term business cycle . Not many modern economists believe in this theory , but it correlates quite accurately with the pattern of recent European history . <p> We can still hope that he was wrong -- but that 's not the way it looks right now .

" gargles Lil Wayne like a busted irrigation system on Tha Carter IV 's ' Blunt Blowin ' ' . Given that Lil Wayne was unmistakably convicted for carrying a 40-calibre pistol on his person while toking on some sensimilla in public , it 's an audacious statement . That clich ? d mistake cost him eight months in Rikers Island prison , reduced from the intended year due to ' good behaviour ' , which was laughably interpreted as working out and reading the Bible . So one can only really assume the moral lessons ' learned ' equated to reciting Psalms and bench press sessions reaching the hundreds . Yet Cash Money Records clearly believed the 28-year old 's affirmations in Tha Carter IV would be an unmistakable world-consuming success - which it no doubt already is . The record has been three years in waiting , and has defied a throng of weak , banal mixtapes and the refinements of a prison penitentiary . Not at all bad for a 5.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Initially , the record was suggested to be released as a double-disc with 2010 's Rebirth , a crass , hackneyed collection of humdrum , hillbilly ' rock ' tunes .

' As undeniably reassuring as this proposes itself to be , Tha Carter IV is as memorable and longstanding as a dissipating cloud of spliff smoke from a cross joint . The Carter collection has evolved with each release since the first was released in 2004 , culminating in the shining glory of the III instalment , a two times platinum force of nature that was effortlessly crude and desperately addictive . Now comes the follow-up : 18 tracks filled with conceptually accessible ideas , executed moderately well yet lacking the syrupy controversy of his prior exploits . <p> Having already released in 2010 the big , bass contagious blares of ' 6 Foot 7 Foot ' , which unfurled the skyscraper-high expectations of Lil Wayne 's return , a worldwide audience anticipated swagger without Rebirth 's stab at Jagger . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch of mediocre bores , intertwined with a small supply of well-crafted , radio friendly singles .

' Megaman ' sounds like a more aggressive , rejected demo version of ' Lollipop ' , and ' Abortion ' like a less funny , less impish ' Bitch Named Nina ' . Club crazy they may be , but their durability is as long as it takes for Rihanna to release a new album . <p> Nonetheless , production has the potential to prevail on the odd occasion .

But this novelty wears and tears after its first run through . Eyes roll and sighs frequent during the boringly poppy ' How to Love ' and the equally ostentatious as unoriginal ' President Carter ' . Lil Wayne 's hip hop is slowly sounding stale like a cling filmed bag of dried chronic buds . Tha Carter IV 's payoff is entirely lost by the lack of Nicki Minaj and loomed over by the pending release of Drake 's upcoming material . Wake up Lil Wayne , you 're not in jail anymore .

From this lagoon it is transferred to the Torrevieja lagoon , where it is mixed with the brine , which has come from the diapiro or the underground salt deposit in Pinoso , that consists of five wells into which high pressure water is injected which then results in the salt dissolving . The resulting brine is carried by a 50 kilometre long pipeline to the Torrevieja lagoon where it mixes with the brine already there , which has come from the La Mata lagoon . Now you know ! <p> The last few years have not been particularly profitable , with workers hours being cut to the minimum and until last winter , the site was looking to layoff a number of long time employees . The company recently invested more than a million euros to improve many aspects of the zone , including improvements to the environmental impact from the process , upgrades to the facilities used in the complex extraction technique and even discussion as to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Salt works is around seven million euro , based on the current market price of ten euro per kilo of salt . What most of can see from afar are the process of when the salt is piled up in large heaps of about 20 metres in height , called ' garberas ' or Salt hills . In this way the product , with a humidity level of 3% , acquires a generic denomination of damp salt and is perfectly suitable for any use for which it is required : de-icing roads , decalcifying water , chemical industry , food industry etc. and can be used no matter how old it my be . <p> As is usually the case , when we have something on our doorstep , we often do n't appreciate it but for those that would like to learn more , you should take an hour and visit the Salt Interpretation Centre , located across the road from the old RENFE Station and Natural History Museum . The centre offers an overview of Torrevieja 's salt industry , its history , closely intertwined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torrevieja .

Perhaps through sheer longevity and familiarity since then , her mantle is becoming one of a more gentle stateswoman of the high-octane art world . <p> Emin remains an energising cocktail of controversy , commercial savvy and compassion - recently , her always political statements have been punctuated with more revealing comments about her fears for growing old alone . Read how art has become her emotional solace in this exclusive interview with Huffington Post UK : <p> What moved you to get involved with this project ? <p> I have been working with AIDS charities for a long time and I am a patron of the Terrence Higgins Trust .

In the case of David Bowie who I met 15 years ago for the first time , it seemed quite obvious to me that he would like my work because I had liked his lyrics all my life and I can truly say that he was a massive influence on me .

With it I 've found some solace and a way in which to live out my future . And I do n't regret any work I 've made . <p> The more ( in ) famous you have become with people regarding you while you 're regarding the world , has this made it harder or easier to go inside yourself to create something you wish to share ?

@@4319233 <h> Unsolved crimes : The death of Donna Healey <h> Donna Healey . <p> West Yorkshire Police has an enviable record solving serious crimes , but there are unsolved cases which are never closed and that detectives refuse to drop . <p> The answers invariably lie in our communities . <p> In a series of articles Crime Reporter Bruce Smith asks YEP readers to help police find those answers . <p> MORE than 23 years ago a member of the world 's oldest profession mysteriously vanished from the streets of Leeds . <p> It is quite possible that Donna Louise Healey was murdered , but mystery still surrounds exactly how the 18-year-old prostitute met her death . <p> At least one person -- probably more -- knows the answer . That is the person who stored her body for almost three years before dumping it in a Leeds suburb . <p> On January 15 1991 , almost three years after Donna vanished in March 1988 from Harehills , Leeds , a builder discovered a partially-mummified body at the edge of the overgrown grounds of the then Falloden Nursing Home in Allerton Park , Chapel Allerton , Leeds , just yards from then Chapeltown Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later tests suggested that from death it had been kept in an air-tight container . Early indications were that the heavily-decomposed remains were the body of a youth in his teens . <p> Despite extensive police inquiries and the creation of a life-like replica of the deceased 's head by Richard Neave , of Manchester University 's Cell and Structural Biology section , the identity of the body could not be established . <p> Donna had last been seen alive by her family who came from Little Horton , Bradford , on the eve of her 18th birthday in 1988 . Her disappearance was reported to the Salvation Army and Missing Persons Bureau in 1991 by her mother Lorraine Wilkinson , but the police were not alerted about her disappearance until 1997 . <p> But in October 2003 -- almost 16 years after Donna vanished and nearly 13 after the body 's discovery -- advances in DNA profile tests surprisingly established the remains were in fact female . <p> Suspicious that the body could be that of long-term missing person Donna , but still far from sure , detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person whose body had remained in mortuary storage for so long . <p> A saliva sample was taken from a relative of Donna and in December 2003 it was confirmed that the remains were indeed those of the missing teenager . <p> Her death has always been treated as potentially suspicious . But police have never ruled out the possibility her death could have been innocent and that someone with her at the time may have panicked and hid the body until finally dumping it unceremoniously in the nursing home gardens . <p> Yet , why Donna died and when and where and how is just as much a mystery as it ever was over two decades ago . <p> Toxicology tests on samples retained from the remains revealed no traces of morphine or other opiates or substances , ruling out drugs as a likely cause . <p> Extensive police inquiries into Donna 's lifestyle were carried out to find where she went and who with , including contacting fellow prostitutes in the search for clues to her death . <p> It was known that Donna was believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose first name was Winston , lived in Bradford but was well known in Chapeltown , Leeds . <p> Donna 's family were kept informed of developments by police . <p> Five months later in May 2004 the head of the new inquiry , then Det Insp Chris Binns , affirmed : " The answer to the mystery will be resolved somewhere in the Leeds area . We know she was working as a prostitute and we are urging anyone who knows anything to get in touch . " <p> The case featured in a number of press conferences and also on the BBC1 Crimewatch programme . A number of callers contacted police to say they knew her , but there were few relating to her movements and life in Leeds . One of the last confirmed sightings of Donna had been when she appeared before Leeds Magistrates on April 22 1988 to face prostitution charges . At the time she was estranged from her family .

The results of this important research work is expected later in the year .

The products are manufactured and sold by Beaut ? Prestige International ( BPI ) , which had sought registration for " beauty products ( cosmetics ) , soaps , perfumery and cosmetics " . The court ruled that although the mark was descriptive under Article 3(1) ( 3 ) of the Trademark Law ( 127/1959 , as amended ) , it had obtained the distinctiveness required under Article 3(2) of the law . <p> Background <p> The three-dimensional trademark system was introduced on April 1 1997 by amendments to Law 68/1996 and is set out in Article 2(1) of the Trademark Law . Although the Patent Office has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is only the third case in which the court applied the provisions of Article 3(2) , notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3(1) ( 3 ) , in cases involving a three-dimensional container trademark . <p> " in the case of a trademark that consists solely of a mark indicating in a common way the place of origin , place of sale , quality , raw material , efficacy , use , quantity , shape ( including packaging shape ) or price of the goods , or the method or time of manufacturing or using them ; or the location of provision of services , quality , articles for use in such provision , efficacy , use , quantity , modes , price or the method or time of the provision of services . " <p> Article 3(2) provides that : <p> " in the case of a trademark falling under Items 3 through 5 of the preceding paragraph , where , as a result of the use of such trademark , customers are able to recognise the goods or services as being connected with a certain person 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preceding paragraph . " <p> Article 4(1) ( 18 ) provides that registration can not be obtained : <p> " in the case of a trademark consisting solely of a three-dimensional shape of goods or their packaging , where the shape is indispensable to the functions of the goods or their packaging . " <p> Facts <p> The applicant , BPI , manufactured and sold cosmetics under the Jean Paul Gaultier brand . It filed an international application for a three-dimensional trademark for the following shape in Class 3 on April 28 2006 ( ie , the date of designation for Japan ) . <p> The examiner in charge issued a rejection notice on June 27 2008 . The applicant objected , filing a petition for a trial hearing on October 7 2008 . <p> Patent Office decision <p> On July 15 2010 the Patent Office issued a trial decision that confirmed the original rejection and dismissed the applicant 's petition for a trial hearing . <p> On the question of the applicability of Article 3(1) ( 3 ) , the Patent Office held as follows : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or articles for use in the provision of services where the shape has been chosen for the purpose of effectively performing the function of the goods , or for aesthetic reasons . Thus , the shape was not originally adopted as an indication of source or to distinguish such goods or services from those of others . <p> Even if modifications or decorations with special features were added to the shape of the goods , these were added for the purpose of performing the function or enhancing the attractiveness of the goods , and were not originally adopted as indications to distinguish such goods from those of others . Thus , if the goods - viewed as a whole - have the shape necessary for performing their function or enhancing their attractiveness , vendors and consumers will interpret the shape simply as the shape of the goods . Even if such a shape is to some extent unusual ( in relation to the function or attractiveness of the goods ) , it does no more than indicate the shape of the goods in a common way . <p> Similar goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar function . Thus , it is inappropriate to allow one individual or entity to monopolise such a shape ; rather , anyone should be able to use it . Therefore , a trademark which consists of a three-dimensional shape that can be recognised as the shape of the goods falls under Article 3(1) ( 3 ) . Such a mark can not be registered unless : <p> the trademark is of an extraordinary shape that is unrelated to the function or attractiveness of the goods ; or <p> the shape has come to be recognised as clearly distinguishable from similar goods , among vendors and consumers , as not merely indicating the origin of the trademark relating to the shape as a result of use . <p> In this case the bottle was in the shape of a woman 's neck and torso , the upper part of which , in metal , was readily recognisable as the spray mechanism and cap . The lower portion , from the neck down , was made of pink , semi-transparent , half-frosted glass . This section could be easily identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , it was recognisable as a type of container holding liquids such as " perfumes and toilet lotions " . The court found that the bottle , if used for the designated goods , might simply be regarded by vendors and consumers as a container holding the goods . <p> The Patent Office 's reasoning on the applicability of Article 3(2) was as follows : <p> Although the trademark in the application consisted of a three-dimensional shape only , the trademark in actual use included the combination of a three-dimensional shape , a device mark and a differently shaped three-dimensional mark . Therefore , when each was considered as a whole , the trademark in the application and the trademark in actual use were not identical . <p> The goods for which the trademark was used were perfumes , whereas the designated goods covered by the application included goods other than perfume . Thus , the designated goods in the application were not limited to the goods in actual use . <p> Therefore , the Patent Office could not hold that the trademark under the application had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business among consumers as a result of longstanding use in connection with the designated goods ( ie , beauty products , cosmetics , soaps and perfumery ) . As such , the trademark was found not to satisfy the requirements of Article 3(2) . <p> IP High Court decision <p> The applicant appealed to the IP High Court , which reversed the Patent Office 's decision . The court 's reasoning on the applicability of Article 3(1) ( 3 ) was as follows : <p> Under Articles 2(1) and 5(2) , a trademark which consists of a three-dimensional shape ( including any combination of letters , devices , symbols or colours ) may be registered if it satisfies certain requirements . However , Article 4(1) ( 18 ) provides that registration can not be obtained , regardless of the provisions of Article 3 , for a trademark " consisting solely of the three-dimensional shape of goods or their packaging where the shape is indispensable to ... the function of the goods or their packaging " . A three-dimensional shape that is indispensable to the function of the goods may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods or their packaging is chosen to make the goods more attractive or to make them perform their expected functions more effectively . In such cases the shape can not be said to have been adopted for the purpose of immediately indicating the source of the goods or distinguishing the goods from those of others . <p> Where the shape of the goods is recognised as having been chosen to facilitate the function or enhance the attractiveness of the goods , and unless special circumstances apply , such shape will be subject to Article 3(1) ( 3 ) as a trademark that consists solely of a mark indicating , in a common way , the shape of the goods . <p> A shape that is intended to facilitate the function or enhance the attractiveness of the goods is desirable for parties using such a shape for similar goods . Therefore , it is not in the public interest to allow such a shape to be monopolised purely on the basis of a trademark application . <p> Insofar as it is foreseeable that the shape is likely to be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , Article 3(1) ( 3 ) applies even if the shape has special features . <p> However , registration may be allowed in the case of a three-dimensional shape that is not considered indispensable to the function of the goods or their packaging , even if it is chosen in order to promote the function or attractiveness of the goods , if it is used as a mark to distinguish the goods from those of others by indicating their source and thereby achieves sufficient distinctiveness to distinguish the goods . <p> The three-dimensional shape in the application was considered to have been chosen for the purpose of facilitating the function or attractiveness of the perfume container . The court held that the shape of the container fell within the scope of Article 3(1) ( 3 ) , being likely to be used for the purpose of facilitating the function or enhancing the attractiveness of the product in the eyes of the average consumer . <p> On the applicability of Article 3(2) , the court reasoned as follows : <p> Article 3(2) provides that a trademark which is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the shape of the goods under Article 3(1) ( 3 ) of the law can be registered if , as a result of use , it achieves distinctiveness as an indication of source . <p> In determining whether a trademark which consists of a three-dimensional shape has achieved distinctiveness in this way , all relevant factors should be considered , including : <p> the shape of the trademark and the existence of similarly shaped goods ; and <p> the period of use of the trademark , sales volumes and the duration and scale of advertising and promotional campaigns for the product . <p> The court held as follows : <p> The container part of the bottle shape was in the form of a woman 's torso with two projecting portions corresponding to breasts , a tapered section corresponding to a waist and an area corresponding to the lower abdomen . <p> As there was no other container in the same style or shape , with these special features , the three-dimensional shape was attractive to consumers and left a strong impression on them . <p> The container has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in professional perfumery magazines and general fashion magazines .

@@4319236 <p> An up-and-coming technology will soon allow genetic testing of a fetus with a simple maternal blood test early in the first trimester of the pregnancy by isolating cell-free fetal DNA in the mother 's plasma ( 1 ) . Currently , obtaining reliable diagnostic genetic information requires invasive testing with CVS or amniocentesis . Both carry a risk of miscarriage ( 2 ) and are performed between weeks 10 and 20 of the pregnancy . <p> Women considering invasive testing must weigh the risk of losing a healthy fetus against the risk of bringing a fetus affected by a genetic condition to term . By eliminating the risk of miscarriage , this new technology promises tremendous benefits . It is a long-awaited achievement with the potential to revolutionise prenatal care . <p> At the same time , this technology is igniting an ethical debate regarding both its medical and non-medical uses . In the non-medical context , there are concerns that testing will lead society down a dangerous eugenic slippery slope where parents choose early abortions for frivolous reasons and select babies for desired traits . <p> A recent publication ( 3 ) confirming the test 's reliability for determining the fetus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-medical use together with early sex-selective abortion in societies with a strong cultural preference for males . <p> Regulating early abortion is n't the appropriate way to address these ethical and social concerns .

Prospective parents should be encouraged to consider why they 're choosing to terminate an otherwise wanted pregnancy and the implications of their choices for themselves , for their potential future child , and for society . <p> The future medical use of this new technology has also raised concerns . A risk-free maternal blood test may become accessible enough to become an inherent part of prenatal care . <p> Current prenatal care involves a two-step approach . Women are offered non-invasive screening using a maternal blood test combined with ultrasound . If the results raise concerns , the screening is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This two-step approach provides women with some built-in protection from exposure to unwanted diagnostic information .

But diagnostic testing without appropriate counselling and consent threatens pregnant women 's autonomy to make informed decisions about what they wish to know about the fetus they are carrying ( 4 ) . <p> Even within today 's two-step approach , consent procedures for prenatal genetic screening are not appropriate and need enhancing ( 5 ) . The transition to a one-step approach is likely to exacerbate this problem , particularly in light of the growing tendency toward the ' medicalisation ' of pregnancy and pressures created by a medical system that favours testing . <p> These concerns about non-invasive testing are legitimate and deserve close examination .

@@4321233 <h> Bernard Hogan-Howe is an old-fashioned policeman who believes that officers should police the streets . He was a successful chief constable in Liverpool -- but can he impose himself on the Met ? <p> It is easy to see why Bernard Hogan-Howe appealed to Conservative politicians looking for a new Metropolitan Police commissioner . As chief constable of Merseyside , he built up an impressive reputation for getting to grips with the city 's gangs and for tackling anti-social behaviour . He has been publicly scornful of the last Labour government 's top-down approach to policing through Whitehall crime targets . <p> Hogan-Howe is a scourge of liberal judges and soft sentencing . He is dismissive of the health and safety brigade and has been an outspoken champion of the victims of crime . He does n't so much advocate zero tolerance as " total policing " . He believes in stopping crime and in keeping order . If you wanted a Scotland Yard chief who looks tough and talks tough ( and is n't Bill Bratton , the American favoured by David Cameron ) , then Hogan-Howe fits the bill perfectly . <p> The new commissioner was in the running for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris Johnson , the London mayor , two years ago . But he was pipped to the post by another straight-talking copper , Sir Paul Stephenson , who recently fell victim to the feeding frenzy surrounding the News of the World phone hacking scandal . <p> And therein lies Hogan-Howe 's greatest problem : never has a commissioner taken over at the Met after the forced resignation of two predecessors . The question that the new chief needs to answer is whether it is any longer possible to do the job effectively . Has it become too unwieldy , too political and too exposed a post for anyone to succeed in giving the system the shake-up it needs ? <p> Yet , while it may sound perverse given the mayhem of the summer , Hogan-Howe arguably arrives at a propitious moment for an old-fashioned policeman who wants to get back to some basic principles . The riots in London and other English cities triggered a palpable change in the public mood . <p> No longer are people prepared to stand for their police acting like a branch of the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , Manchester , Birmingham and Liverpool looted , burned and robbed , while the police -- to begin with , at least -- looked on as well . <p> Not only was that a PR disaster , especially in London ; it also fed a growing popular perception that the boys in blue have simply lost the plot . The middle classes , who would once have supported the police without reservation , have become increasingly critical of their priorities . <p> Whether accurate or not , the police have succeeded in giving the impression that they prefer soft targets and an easy life . The story last week of two police officers playing cricket on a village green who arrested a woman after she complained about balls landing in her garden seemed to describe this gap between what the public wants to see and what the police want to do . <p> The good news for Londoners -- and , by extension , the rest of the country -- is that Hogan-Howe shares a lot of these concerns . He told MPs on the home affairs select committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core mission for the police , for me it has not changed much from Sir Robert Peel , which is that the idea is to stop crime happening . If it happens , you sort it out or help the victims as best you can , and the maintenance of order allows other things to flourish .... It seems to me that no one else will do it if the police do n't . " <p> That sounds like a clear statement of what most of us expect from the police ; and yet it is an approach from which the force has stepped away over the past 30 years or more . It was only relatively recently that senior officers accepted that the gradual removal of uniformed bobbies from the streets was allowing criminals to take over and harming public confidence . While the police clearly have more functions to perform than in days gone by , it remains the case that the people they serve want to see them on the streets , not merely to reassure but to enforce order and prevent crime . <p> Hogan-Howe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheffield , the son of a single mother , he joined South Yorkshire Police in 1979 and at 28 went to Oxford to study law . But he seems to have avoided embracing some of the more progressive ideas that others of his generation bought into . <p> Unlike many of his high-ranking colleagues , he has even voiced his support for the Government 's new elected Police and Crime Commissioners , or at least for the principle of greater accountability that lies behind them . <p> In London , he will be able to discover whether the system works , since he will be directly accountable to an elected politician , the Mayor , as well as to Parliament through the Home Secretary , his other political master . He will find that the system works very well if the public feels that he is delivering the sort of policing it wants . <p> One of his innovations on Merseyside was to tackle anti-social behaviour by focusing on persistent trouble-makers and crime " hot spots " . He formed a squad that targeted the top 10 worst areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the list . The aim was to enforce the law in areas where the criminals held sway ; most of the victims of crime are found in these areas and they are repeatedly targeted . <p> In Liverpool city centre , at strategic points such as clubs , pubs and bus stations , he set up 15 scanners , of the sort used at airports , to check for knives . Another approach Hogan-Howe adopted was for his officers to visit every victim of crime . While this uses a lot of police time , it also gets officers out among the communities they serve , meeting people , picking up intelligence and generally reassuring the public that they are on their side . <p> " It 's wrong for the police service to be arrogant and say we do n't attend a certain kind of incident , " he told this newspaper in an interview . " I think what 's intolerable is if we do n't appear to care to listen , to do our best to help them through a difficult time and to take reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should do the right thing for the reasonable taxpayer . " <p> But it is often hard to get things done . Sir Paul Stephenson , whose departure had nothing to do with his lack of success as a police chief , none the less saw the seeds of the summer riots sown on his watch and battled to change an ingrained culture among officers . <p> Sir Paul wanted to restore common sense to policing and was keen to stop beat bobbies walking in pairs -- a move that would double visibility at a stroke and encourage officers to talk to the public rather than to each other . But he was not noticeably successful in getting his way : police representatives continue to defend the practice on grounds of safety . <p> The police have become distant , both physically and culturally , from the people they are supposed to serve . More police on the beat has been a constant refrain of the public . But with budget cuts and other demands on his dwindling resources , can Hogan-Howe deliver ? He managed it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction levels far higher than elsewhere in the country . If he does n't do the same in London then the gradual decline in public confidence will be hard to check . <p> While Hogan-Howe is the police chief for London , he has responsibilities that carry wider national implications , not least for counter-terrorism in the run-up to the Olympics and the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee next year . <p> With London always the destination of choice for marchers and protesters , he is inevitably in the public eye , not least because many politicians and commentators either live or work in the capital and have first-hand knowledge of its problems , and a ready opinion about how to deal with them . London is also Britain 's shop window for the rest of the world , attracting millions of tourists every year whose view of the country will be determined by their experiences there . <p> As the country 's most prominent police officer , he can set a tone that will resonate throughout the system . <p> Unlike his predecessor but one , Sir Ian Blair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's logo to make it more inclusive -- or at least Londoners hope he wo n't .

We may be tempted to treat it as a minded creature but that does n't mean it is a minded creature . <p> Last mystery <p> Those who study machine consciousness are trying to develop self-organising systems that will initiate actions and learn from their surroundings . The hope is that if we can create or replicate consciousness in a machine we would learn just what makes consciousness possible . <p> Researchers are far from realising that dream and a big obstacle stands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question - could a silicon-based machine ever produce consciousness , or is it only carbon creatures with our material make-up that can produce the glowing technicoloured moments of conscious experience ? The question is whether consciousness is more a matter of what we do or what we are made of . <p> Image caption Turing developed a test for machine intelligence <p> Consciousness may be the last remaining mystery for science , but to some extent it has been dethroned from the central role it used to occupy in the study of the mental . We are learning more and more from neuroscience and neurobiology about how much of what we do is the result of unconscious processes and mechanisms . <p> And we are also learning that there is no single thing consciousness is . There are different levels of consciousness in humans , and much of our thinking and decision making can go on without it . <p> It 's worth remembering that the only convincing experience of consciousness we have is our own . We are each aware of our own inner lives , but have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the people around me really conscious in the way I am , or could they all be zombies who walk and talk and act like humans although there is nobody home . <p> And this is creates a twist in our story . For if we managed to produce a robot that behaved just like one of us in all respects that might be a proof not of the consciousness of a robot or machine , but instead may be a convincing demonstration of how much we could manage to do without consciousness . 
@@4321237 <h> Result : <p> Chelsea 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen <p> WRAP : I can inform you that Thiago Silva has scored a late equaliser for Milan at the Nou Camp . Barcelona begin their defence of the title with only a draw . It was n't a classic live blog , but then it was n't a classic game . Chelsea will get stronger , though , as they gel and as they evolve , and Juan Mata - that 's the first time I 've seen him play a whole game for Chelsea - looked super-awesome . I leave you with an amusing stat . David Luiz : 13 games for Chelsea , three goals . Fernando Torres , 19 games for Chelsea , one goal . Maybe swap them around ? I 'll be back for Benfica v Manchester United tomorrow , while Thom will have the Etihad Invitational XI 's Champions League opener against Napoli . Night . <p> 21.35 Job done for Chelsea , then , and their long journey towards an inevitable semi-final defeat begins in earnest . They looked pretty good , actually , the front three combining nicely and not too many alarms at the back . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are , at least , a darn sight better than Arsenal at the moment . Leverkusen ran and ran and ran , and eventually ran out . They had some decent chances - Schurrle had one , Ballack another - and had either of those gone in , then , um , the scoreline would have been different . <p> FULL TIME : Chelsea 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen <p> 90+2 min GOAL ! Chelsea 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen ( Mata ) Mata tucks it away easily after Torres unselfishly pulls the ball back for him ! You could see the cogs whirring in Torres 's head as Chelsea found themselves three on one . He was at a tight angle , on the left corner of the six yard box , thought about the shot , but instead did the decent thing and gave Mata an open goal . And that 's full-time . <p> 90+1 min Kiessling wins the aerial battle with Alex , but Mikel gathers the second ball . Leverkusen look a little short of ideas at the moment . <p> 90 min Ha , ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arsenal . Rolfes tries to lift it over the top for Derdiyok , but Alex heads it away . <p> 89 min Schurrle tries to nudge it through for Derdiyok , but Alex spots the dangers and throws a foot out . Now , here 's Torres , breaking down the left . He tries to flick it across the six yard box with the outside of his foot for Mata , but it 's intercepted . <p> 88 min Kiessling with a break , but that 's the first touch of a Cunard cruise liner , and Ivanovic will pick that one off very easily . Leverkusen look like their legs have gone . <p> 87 min Leverkusen ca n't get the ball at the moment . Chelsea are passing their way to a tidy 1-0 victory , which is pretty much exactly as you 'd have expected tonight to go . <p> 85 min While we 've got time , I 'll just bring you up to speed with some other scores . Barcelona have dragged it back against Milan , and now lead 2-1 . Arsenal are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening , Stevenage are 5-1 up on Sheffield Wednesday . <p> 84 min The free-kick is deep , too deep , but Schurrle just about manages to keep it in with his head . But Anelka wins the ball , and there 's a faint hope of a break , but Leverkusen surround Anelka with footballers and snuff out the danger . <p> 83 min You do n't really get the feeling Leverkusen are going to storm the castle any time soon . But Castro wins a free-kick off Malouda 's hand . <p> 82 min Lampard finds Torres in the Leverkusen half . Mata 's making a darting run through the centre , Malouda down the left . Torres selects Malouda , whose cross meets a Leverkusen head . <p> 80 min GOAL DISALLOWED ( Chelsea ) A very late flag from the assistant on the far side . Anelka headed the ball in from Malouda 's cross , but he was adjudged offside . Was he , though ? That might exercise a few sound minds if Leverkusen manage to fashion an equaliser . <p> 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 78 min Chelsea really are motoring now . Malouda 's stepover leaves the ball for Mata to run on to . Mata , with what one presumes is an eye in his right ear , spots Lampard making the Lampard run - you know the one - and Lampard 's swooping shot from 20 yards is caught by Leno . The stage appears set for a 90th minute Lampard screamer to give the headline writers something to go on . <p> 77 min Castro slides the ball into the right channel . Bender and Ivanovic both go in for it ; Bender goes to ground , Ivanovic stays on his feet , and a goal kick results . <p> 73 min And Derdiyok 's first touch is not on the ball , but on Malouda 's shins as he stretches for the ball . " Knock yourselves out , fellas , I 've got plenty more space in my notebook , " Stephane Lannoy says , and books him . <p> 72 min Sidney Sam , who 's had a quiet game tonight , comes off for Eren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spicy tackle on Bosingwa . Credit to the Leverkusen fans , they 're still singing and jumping and doing all those strange shouty dances German fans do . Question : if you could , instantly and irrevocably , swap the Premier League for the Bundesliga , complete with players , teams and stadiums , would you take it ? <p> 70 min And Leno tips Mata 's shot over the bar ! Anelka got free down the right and squared the ball into the area , and Leverkusen were far too slow to close Mata down . He had to get the ball out of his feet , but he still managed to produce a fine save from Leno . <p> 69 min Mata tries to curl in a shot from the edge of the area ! It 's caught by Leno , but Chelsea suddenly look so much more relaxed in the final third . Torres looked buoyed by that assist ( " Andre tells me it 's worth half a goal ! " ) <p> 68 min And Leverkusen very nearly level straight away ! Bosingwa was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who chased it down and crossed from the left byline . Kiessling 's header at the near post was just wide . I 'd wager there 's more goals in this one . <p> 66 min GOAL ! Chelsea 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen ( Luiz ) Are you watching , Fernando Torres ? That 's how to finish ! Actually , Torres clearly was watching , as he laid the ball off on the edge of the area for Luiz to curl in a delicious low finish from 20 yards . No chance for Leno . Andre Villas Boas convulses with joy on the touchline . Chelsea have weathered the Leverkusen storm and emerged ahead ! <p> 65 min A huge round of applause for Michael Ballack as he comes off in his first visit back to Stamford Bridge in an opposition shirt . Renato Augusto is the man to replace him . <p> 64 min Lampard and Anelka come on for Meireles and Sturridge . Anelka was Chelsea 's top scorer in the competition last season with seven goals and only two strops , but I 'm still surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen . <p> 63 min Leno with a wonderful save to deny Sturridge ! Mata swung the cross in from the left - gosh , he 's been good tonight , and Sturridge just got ahead of Kadlec at the back post to turn in the shot left-footed . It was n't the cleanest contact , but it was heading right for the corner of the net , and Leno had to spring to his left to divert that onto the post . <p> 61 min Torres ploughs down the right touchline now , trying to sprint past Kadlec . The old Torres you would n't have seen for dust . The current Torres skews his cross straight out of play for a goal kick . <p> 59 min Schurrle with a sharp left-footed shot from the left-hand side of the area , straight at Cech ! Nicolas Anelka and Frank Lampard are stripping off their flourescent orange tracksuits on the touchline , bringing to mind a traffic warden 's naked calendar photoshoot . <p> 58 min Lovely skill from Mata to stride clear of about three Leverkusen midfielders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely to Torres . Torres with the cross from the left , but Leno comes and punches . Chelsea have conjured up plenty of attacking openings without really managing to convert one of them into a clear-cut opportunity . <p> 56 min Ballack squanders a golden opportunity to give Leverkusen the lead ! Schurrle puts him through with Kiessling retreating from an offside position and possibly distracting the Chelsea defence . Suddenly Ballack was all on his own 12 yards out . Cech rushed out , Ballack hastily pulled the trigged and fired it straight at the keeper . That 's probably the best chance either side have had so far . <p> 55 min A hairy moment for Chelsea as Bender and Kiessling combine again . Kiessling gets into the area and tries to twist inside Cole , but loses the ball . <p> 53 min Malouda spins himself out of a tight spot in the left corner , and manages to swing a cross in for Torres . Torres at the near post tries to flick it on with the outside of his boot , but Leno claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ min Bosingwa fouled on the Chelsea right , and it 's another free-kick . Stephane Lannoy strikes me as one of those typical pedantic Eurocrat referees . From the free-kick , Sturridge tries to direct a header at goal off-balance , but it 's caught by Leno . <p> 51 min Mikel goes down under the challenge of Bender . No free-kick given . Bender only has Kiessling ahead of him , and Luiz cuts it out easily . <p> 50 min Kiessling goes down easily under the challenge of Luiz , and that 's a soft free-kick for Chelsea to concede . Nothing comes from the Leverkusen free-kick , but they retain possession . <p> 48 min Leverkusen , who might consider themselves a trifle fortunate to go into the break level , playing some nice stuff in the Chelsea half . Ballack with a searing left-footed volley that is technically perfect in every aspect , apart from the fact that it flies into the top tier of the Matthew Harding stand . <p> 47 min We resume with Luiz still off the pitch being seen to . Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brings it away . <p> 46 min Luiz and Kiessling tangle on the touchline . Kiessling squirms on the ground for a while clasping his right leg . Luiz is in a spot of bother as well , and he 's going to need to get treatment . <p> HALF-TIME Chelsea 0-0 Bayer Leverkusen <p> 44 min It 's right in the zone , but Kadlec heads it away heroically . But another free-kick , this time on the right . Mata takes it , and Ivanovic 's header is straight at Leno . Golly gosh . That 's half time . <p> 42 min Sturridge with another crack from distance ! This is going to be one of those nights where he either misses a few and then knocks a brilliant one in in the last minute , or he misses a few , gets annoyed , goes for ever-more ambitious long range efforts , and eventually getting himself substituted . It was a quick free-kick from Mikel , and Sturridge held Kadlec just long enough to get a shot away . <p> 41 min Long clearance out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is ... absolutely nobody in a black and red shirt . <p> 40 min Leverkusen are struggling to get the ball out of their own half here . Mata and Meireles mess up a move on the edge of the Leverkusen area , but Meireles is simply able to step forward and reclaim the ball . <p> 38 min Stefan Kiessling has just produced the Holy Grail for all bumbling strikers - the shot that does n't even go out of play . Sam set him up on the left by lifting the ball over Bosingwa , Kiessling lined up the volley , and scuffed it horribly . Cech was able to trot over and fetch it before it went over the dead-ball line . <p> 37 min Yellow card for Castro after a tasty challenge on Cole . It 's going to Mata to swing in the free-kick , and Mikel 's header is just wide . <p> 36 min A lovely move by Chelsea starts on the left with Cole , to Mata in the centre , to Mikel beside him . Mikel finds Bosingwa on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the near-post . But that just shows how much space Chelsea are getting in between Leverkusen 's lines to pass the ball around . <p> 35 min Ivanovic has a header deflected behind for a corner . Leverkusen are getting pushed back a little deeper . <p> 34 min But Schurrle is dispossessed in the Chelsea half and Luiz can lift a long ball into the left channel for Torres . Torres 's left-footed cross is headed away . <p> 33 min Sturridge again making a nuisance of himself down the right . His cross his hooked away by Castro , and Leverkusen can break . <p> 31 min Toprak with an awful , awful pass down the right wing , and Chelsea surge again . And Sturridge 's left-footed shot from 25 yards is saved well by Leno ! <p> 29 min Bender fouls Sturridge , and it 's Chelsea 's turn to have a free-kick in a dangerous area . Mata puts it miles over . <p> 27 min Torres with the ball 20 yards out . He shifts left , shifts right , shifts left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deflected off Reinartz , back off him and out for a goal kick . Now , I know virtually everything Torres does can be perceived as a lack of confidence , but that really did smack of a ? 50 million footballer with low self-esteem . <p> 26 min Sturridge tries to thread the ball through about six players for Mata to run on to . He almost made it , as well , but Leverkusen cut it out . <p> 25 min Rolfes brought down on the Leverkusen left . It 's going to be Castro with the kick . Ivanovic heads it out for a throw . <p> 22 min Ballack goes down about 35 yards out on the right . But the free-kick is headed clear , and Chelsea can break . Unfortunately , Chelsea make the mistake of passing the ball to Mikel , who like a strange chess piece , can only pass sideways or backwards . The move slows down . <p> 20 min The corner comes in from the left , but nothing comes of it . <p> 19 min Mata releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hitting their stride . He crosses from the left , and Torres 's header is deflected behind for a corner . <p> 17 min Long ball over the top from Cole . Leno - who 's currently on loan from Stuttgart - comes a long way and punches , but the ball falls for Malouda 35 yards out , who tries to head into an empty net ! It 's well wide , though . <p> 16 min Ballack hits the wall . The ball comes back into the area , but the offside flag goes up , and that has to go down as a chance waster for Leverkusen . <p> 15 min Kiessling controls the ball on the edge of the Chelsea area . He tries to turn , his touch is a little heavy but Meireles scythes him down as if carrying out a citizen 's arrest . Not clever . Free-kick to Leverkusen in a dangerous area . And it 's going to be Ballack to take it . <p> 14 min Mata 's looked sharp . Not too much for Sturridge , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torres . There are goals in this game , I assure you . <p> 12 min It may be chaos out there , but Drogba and Lukaku look distinctly disinterested on the sidelines . One of them appears to be listening to music . No sign of either of them using an iPad yet . <p> 10 min Again Torres almost in ! His left-footed shot from six yards is blocked by Leno and Leverkusen frantically clear . Torres looks sharp . Sharp in the box , sharp in the tackle . <p> 9 min Torres flies in on Rolfes , and he 's going to go into Mr Lannoy 's book for that . Shocking tackle , really , and completely needless . Rolfes was in his own left corner , and about to clear the ball . <p> 6 min Seconds before Meireles 's disallowed goal , Toprak had the ball in the net for Leverkusen after a corner , but referee Stephane Lannoy - who 's wasting no time in making himself equally unpopular with both sets of fans - rules it out for grappling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Mata from the left . Good Lord , Barcelona are losing at home . Alexandre Pato has put Milan in front . <p> 3 min Goal for Chelsea ! No , it 's offside ! Torres backheels the ball to Meireles in the six-yard box , and Meireles backheels it into the net . If that had been given , that would have been quite a feat of choreography . He was about half a yard offside , but did he actually touch it ? Not sure . This one will run and run* ( *disclaimer : may not actually run and run ) . <p> 1 min Torres hooks a right-footed volley over the crossbar after a cross from Bosingwa ! What a start this is ! <p> 19.45 Andre Villas-Boas rests captain John Terry with one eye on the game against Manchester United on Sunday . Frank Lampard starts on the bench . Michael Ballack - ah , that 's nice - is in the Leverkusen team . Sorry for the distinct lack of pre-match BANTER , just had a couple of other bits and pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 18.45 Every team always wants to win every competition they play in , with a few notable exceptions ( Tottenham and the Europa League , Blackpool and the Carling Cup ; Stoke and the Fair Play League ) . But has one club ever been as desperate to win one competition as Chelsea are to win the Champions League ? Such is Roman Abramovich 's desire to win the coveted , cartoon-head-shaped trophy that you suspect that given the choice , he would forego Chelsea 's Premier League status in order to do so . <p> It is this competition , rather than the domestic , that he has had in mind since he took over . It is this competition that has informed the expensive purchases of Fernando Torres and Andre Villas Boas . Villas Boas , by the way , is managing a side in this competition for the first time , although this is not his first Champions League game per se , having spent several years trekking around Europe carrying the drinks for Jose Mourinho . <p> Leverkusen , meanwhile , are making their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match was also against English opposition : Liverpool knocked them out at the last 16 stage in 2005 on the way to , you know , that Istanbul malarkey . They are probably best remembered in the competition as Zinedine Zidane 's bitches , after this amazing goal won Real Madrid the final against Leverkusen in Glasgow in 2002 . <p> But what most people forget about that final is that for long periods , Leverkusen gave Madrid a real battering . They were quite a side , Leverkusen : Hans-Joerg Butt , Lucio , Carsten Ramelow , Michael Ballack , Yildiray Basturk and Oliver Neuville forming a handsome spine right through the team , and a curious , Dr Seuss-reading 21-year-old striker by the name of Dimitar Berbatov lining the bench . <p> In the last 20 minutes , Leverkusen piled forward in search of the equaliser that would take them into extra time . But they were denied - often fortuitously , often brilliantly - by a 21-year-old substitute goalkeeper who only came on in the second half after Cesar got injured . His name ? Iker Casillas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement one legend , but they gave birth to another . <p> It was n't all downhill from there , but that was the general trajectory for several years thence . Little by little that great side was dismantled . Ballack left , Lucio left , Ze Roberto left . Berbatov packed all his belongings into a luxury wheelie suitcase , blew a cigar ring at the BayArena , and left . Their replacements - among them a sulky Landon Donovan - proved unfit for the task . Three seasons ago , an inconsistent side finished ninth in the league under Bruno Labbadia . <p> But here 's the great thing about the Bundesliga . A couple of smart signings , a shrewd manager and a decent run of form , and suddenly mid-table also-rans can become title contenders . As if to prove the point , the team that finished ninth in the Premier League three seasons ago was West Ham United . <p> Lars Bender came in to stiffen the midfield . ( There 's sort of half an innuendo there , and I 'm not happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've decided to keep it . ) Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok brought youth , Sami Hyypia experience . Most importantly , they picked in Jupp Heynckes an experienced manager who knew what he was doing . They rose to fourth in 2009-10 , and then second last season , pipping Bayern Munich for an automatic Champions League group stage slot . <p> This season ? We 're not quite sure yet . Heynckes moved to Bayern Munich ; Arturo Vidal , their Chilean midfielder , was snapped up by Juventus for ? 10m . New coach Robin Dutt is young-ish , but still unproven at the highest level , and still not quite sure of his best XI and the best configuration in which to deploy them . <p> For that reason , and for the reason that Chelsea hardly ever mess up games like this in the group stage , I 'd give this game to the home side tonight . Still , anything can happen . That 's why you 're here , is n't it ? Drop us an email , please do , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4321240 <h> You are here : <h> The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex by Mark Kermode review <h> Mark Kermode 's latest book asks the question : what 's wrong with modern movies ? Here 's our review of The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex ... <p> If you 've got a sense of bafflement over how modern day cinema can give us three $1bn+ grossing films in a year , but still wo n't stump up for an individual projectionist or an usher or two down at your local multiplex , then you 'll be in good company with Mark Kermode 's latest book . <p> The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex is a fleshing out of many of the arguments familiar to those who listen to the Kermode and Mayo film programme on Radio Five Live . And , teased with the subtitle ' What 's wrong with modern movies ? ' , you might be forgiven for thinking that you 're getting 313 page of full-on Kermodian ranting . <p> But you 're not . Instead , you 're getting an impassioned argument surrounding the state of modern day cinema . Interestingly , it 's less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( although Michael Bay 's Christmas card list is rarely likely to have Kermode 's name on it ) , but rather the apparatus and system that surrounds then . <p> Firmly in Kermode 's crosshairs are 3D , multiplex cinemas ( illustrated through a painfully funny attempt to watch Charlie St Cloud at his local cinema ) , blockbuster movies , film critics , and where Britain itself fits into world cinema . <p> Take 3D as an example . The world has no shortage of anti-3D rantings , but what Kermode presents in his book is an argument . An argument very much in his own voice , with his own strong viewpoint on the matter . But an argument nonetheless , which takes in both sides of the debate , before arriving at a conclusion , albeit one more obvious than the ending of your standard rom-com . Dripping with rounded examples , Kermode is n't trying to bully you to his way of thinking -- rather , he 's being accessibly persuasive . <p> And the accessibility is key , here . This is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with his last book , It 's Only A Movie , Kermode 's writing style is chatty and welcoming , fused with energy and a love of his subject matter . <p> Ironically , the people who the book may end up appealing to the least are Kermode 's regular listeners . He captures many of the key themes of his radio broadcasts here , but there are inevitably fewer surprises for those more familiar with his work . That said , the chances are that you 'll find yourself nodding along with much of what he has to say anyway , and it 's a strong , well-researched , entertaining representation of his thoughts that you 're getting here . <p> If I had a personal favourite part of the book , it 's when he pinpoints the problem of distribution , and how it 's becoming harder and harder for small films to get a look in . Here 's where some of his arguments hold the most surprises , and you 'd suspect that Kermode would happily eschew the royalties that The Good , The Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fixed . <p> And that 's the critical thing , here . Kermode has a passion that you may or may not personally warm to , but it 's a thirst and desire for things to improve nonetheless . It might be idealistic at times , but it 's hard to criticise someone for that .

@@4323232 <h> MusicalCriticism.com <h> The new source for concert and opera reviews , articles and interviews on the web <h> Puccini : Il trittico <h> Royal Opera <p> Royal Opera House , Covent Garden , 14 September 2011 <p> A couple of weeks ago , a business-like email from the Royal Opera 's press office announced the withdrawal of German soprano Anja Harteros from Suor Angelica , the central opera of Puccini 's Il Trittico . No reason was given , but one could almost hear a collective sigh of disappointment . <p> As an appropriately grand season opener , though , and as a two-thirds-new production , there were still plenty of star turns left in this show , and we saw a very impressive performance from Harteros 's replacement , Ermonela Jaho . Best of all , though , there was a sense , under Antonio Pappano 's baton , of the sort of team work that renders such talk irrelevant . <p> There was also the intriguing question of how Richard Jones , who had already brought his characteristically sharp wit and eye to Gianni Schicchi , would deal with the first two operas in Puccini 's tryptich , traditionally viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dubious religiosity of Suor Angelica . He opts to play one reasonably straight , the other brilliantly against the grain . <p> Both are updated to somewhere in the mid-twentieth century , and Ultz 's design for Il tabarro places Michele 's barge firmly centre stage , sitting implaccably upon the ' Lady Seine ' , which Puccini was keen to have as the ' true protagonist of the drama ' . Behind are the quay and a pair of brick buildings , with a passage between them from which a few extras appear at key moments -- it 's all , typically , keenly observed and carefully choreographed . A large grappling hook whisks some gnarly looking metal skywards early on , the grim drudgery of the workers ' daily grind brilliantly evoked . <p> Lucio Gallo makes a wiry , threatening Michele , but can not , with his dry-ish timbre and tendency to go under the note when singing below forte , quite match the security of Eva-Maria Westbroek 's Giorgetta or Aleksandrs Antonenko 's Luigi . Westbroek 's gleaming soprano was a constant pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single off-target top note served primarily to underline her security elsewhere . We could have done without some of her dancing ( with the inevitable Anna Nicole flashbacks ) , perhaps , and I did wonder if she just seems too wholesome to fit into this dingy context , but she acted fearlessly and with well observed detail . Antonenko , making his ROH debut , had a bit of a shouty start , but soon settled , demonstrating a hugely impressive voice -- big , burnished , if a touch short on bite -- allied to good musical sense and solid acting . His Otello later in the season is something to look forward to , with or without the scheduled Harteros . <p> Jones 's Tabarro is played more or less as the libretto suggests , then , and no worse for it . But Suor Angelica was always going to present the most intriguing prospect . It seemed unlikely that the director would buy into the work 's miraculous conclusion ; but what would he give us in its place ? <p> The answer is a brilliantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the secular age . Gone are the picturesque chapel and cloisters , garden and cypresses specified in the libretto , replaced in Miriam Buether clinical designs with the large ward of a children 's hospital run by nuns . It 's the sort of institution that has become something of a Jones trademark , and we have prim rows of beds running down either side , lights dangling from the ceiling and , for Angelica 's confrontation with the zia principessa , a wall with door and large window descending to create a seperate space at the front of the stage . <p> I admit to having doubts at first . Would n't the nuns ' daily contact with all these children -- some , it must be said , better behaved than others -- dilute Angelica 's focus on her own abandoned child ? Would n't there be too much dissonance between the libretto 's piety and miracle-soaked setting and the sterilised atmosphere of this institution ? It says a great deal for Jones 's direction that these questions soon dissolved . <p> It says , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelica . Her grief was powerfully evoked , her slight frame shaking harrowingly to the detriment of vocal beauty . Her matter-of-fact suicide took no risks , employing a cocktail of pharmaceuticals rather than the airy-fairy herbal solution prescribed by the libretto . Her final ' vision ' , meanwhile , was staged as a brief , heartbreaking mad scene quickly unveiled as illusory . <p> Jaho 's voice is less sharply focused than ideal , lacking a steely core and tiring towards the close , but this was a powerful , bravely complete performance . Anna Larsson 's dignified but ruthless Princess was marvellous , too , replete with a Cruella DeVille-style white streak in her hair and dead animal draped over her arm . The rest of the extended cast was also very fine , directed with sharp detail . <p> Jones 's Gianni Schicchi is , of course , a known quantity . Smartly updated to the 1950s , and with the comedy laid on thick and fast , it has already been seen a few times since its 2007 unveiling , presented as a double bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , though , and benefits greatly from being seen in its original context . Gallo steps into shoes previously inhabited by Thomas Allen and Bryn Terfel but need n't fear too much by comparison . Once again , the performance was not vocally perfect , but he 's got a fine comic touch , and gives the character an interesting , slightly malicious edge . <p> Francesco Demuro , making his ROH debut , was a wonderfully lyrical and ardent Rinuccio , all flashing smiles and twinkling eyes , only let down by some over-enthusiastic pushing in his mini-aria . Ekaterina Siurina was charming as Lauretta , even if we could have done with a smoother transition into ' O mio babbino caro ' . <p> But it was as a brilliantly tight ensemble effort that the performance was most to be admired , with turns from Elena Zilio ( Zita here , and a slightly fruity Monitress in Suor Angelica ) , an evergreen Gwynne Howell ( Simone ) , Robert Poulton ( Marco ) , Rebecca Evans ( Nella ) and Jeremy White ( Betto ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pappano 's conducting . No detail of Puccini 's wonderful scores -- a mixture of mellow , slow burning passions , warm humanity and easy compositional virtuosity -- passed us by , and each work was beautifully paced , controlled with a natural ebb and flow . The playing of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House was glorious , too . <p> It 's a great start to the season , and , given the cost of staging Il trittico , it would be a risky gamble not to try and see it this time round . There 's consolation , at least , for those who ca n't : the production is being filmed for cinema and DVD release , and will be broadcast on Radio 3 on 17 September .

@@4325230 <h> Gimpel Fils gallerist Jackie Haliday recounts her first meeting with photographer Corinne Day , her influence on Kate Moss and the glory days of cult magazine The Face . <p> It was on the recommendation of Paul Hedge from Hales Gallery in Bethnal Green that I first met the photographer Corinne Day . He phoned to suggest I meet her and her long-standing agent Susie Babchick as he had just been shown the Diary series and thought I would find it interesting . It was a generous gesture by Paul and he was right . The collection of photographs documented ten years of Corinne 's life and there was a relentlessness to the work and real sense of rigour that I found compelling . In that first meeting what I liked about Corinne was that she was very thoughtful and serious about her work , while still having a great sense of humour . This led to Gimpel Fils ' first show of Corinne 's work in 2000 : Tara . It was a portrait of her close friend Tara with images selected from the Diary series and was exhibited under the umbrella of The Photographers ' Gallery large survey exhibition Diary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our current exhibition at Gimpel Fils gallery , came about during a meeting I had with the director Mark Szaszy , who was Corinne 's partner Corinne died of complications related to a brain tumour in August 2010 , and Susie Babchick . We were discussing Corinne 's forthcoming show and Susie and Mark had selected a large group of their favourite photographs by Corinne . We had them all out on my desk and it was becoming quite difficult to see how we could narrow down the selection or find a connection that would form an exhibition . I suggested we go back to the beginning , to when Corinne first started working for The Face magazine , and that we focus on her early years as a photographer without including the iconic Third Summer of Love editorial that launched both Corinne and Kate Moss . We had already exhibited these photographs in a solo exhibition 15 at Gimpel Fils in 2006 .

Included in the exhibition are photographs from the editorial England 's Dreaming , which was published in August 1993 , with a romantic sunset portrait of George Clements and a punky image of Rosemary Ferguson in a spider-web top that Corinne made herself . An ethereal double portrait of Kate Moss dates from February 1991 , when it featured in the Heaven is Real editorial . Also included in the exhibition is an edition of the National Portrait Gallery commission of Kate .

The work of his friend and fellow writer Ngugi Wa Thiong'o -- " one of the great secrets of African literature " as he describes him to me , and a former pool-playing adversary -- transported him to Nairobi without having to leave his home . <p> Okri has always been fascinated by journeys of the imagination . Born in Minna , northern Nigeria in 1959 , he was taken to London when he was a baby after his father won a law scholarship . He grew up in Peckham as , he has said , " a bit of a scamp , a wild kid and troublemaker " . <p> By the time he returned to Nigeria at the age of seven he was a mixed-up child , but one who had also come to see the world through multiple perspectives : both reality and myth .

I ask him whether there were any similar programmes on offer when he was young . " Nothing , " he replies . " You see , the period when I was growing up was post-independence . After the civil war society was just starting to settle down after a very destructive period . " Older writers such as Chinua Achebe worked in universities and had professional careers . <p> " One did not think of them as writers who solely earned their living from writing , " says Okri . " I had to turn to the rest of the world to get any kind of sustenance . " <h> Related Articles <p> Which writers did he read ? " People like Robert Frost , Dylan Thomas , the Romantics .

" They teach writing workshops . In different parts of Africa there 's a whole new writing landscape . " <p> Aspiring writers can also be encouraged by Okri 's international fame . His best-known novel , The Famished Road , won the Booker Prize in 1991 ; it tells the story of a Yoruba spirit child called Azaro who moves between a dream world and a slum . <p> When he wrote the book , Okri was an admired if not bestselling writer who had spent time homeless on the streets of England . Only after he invested everything into writing The Famished Road was he rewarded with a feast of honours , acclaim -- and sales . Through his success , Okri has shown that the writing life can have " a kind of elegance , and solidity , which is very appetising " . <p> Okri is still awed by " the sheer contradictory mass of life " in Africa . Yet he finds running though it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its magical , it 's a thread , some kind of beat , some kind of tonal resonance " . Is that thread the world of myth ?

" <p> Even though the skylines of Lagos and Nairobi are filling up with tall buildings , says Okri , and even though the streets are teeming with cars , the myths and legends of the village are only a generation or two away . " There 's just so much that ca n't be explained about your past without the sense of these myths . " <p> Okri describes myth as the " underground river " that flows through an African upbringing .

" I try to find a meeting place between poetry and the essay , because though they share certain things , they are profoundly dissimilar . " Poetry is " obscure , indirect " while the essay is " discursive " . His compact sentences make his work more suggestive , he believes . For example , " O , Ye Who Invest in Futures " is a series of rhythmical statements about Africa that makes a strong argument but is not encumbered with facts and figures . <p> It begins like this : " It is easy to dismiss Africa .

" We 're a prisoner and a slave to our eyes . We cast our eyes across Africa , and what does every news story on the television tell us ? It tells us of famine , chaos , unhappiness , cruelty , social unrest , poor education . " But surely all those problems exist ? " That is not Africa , that is just one aspect of it , " he says with passion . " People are not encouraged to read its literature , we have no way of perceiving the ordinary and extraordinary lives of the people who live in different circumstances . " <p> To some readers Okri 's aphorisms might seem a touch elliptical . Certainly they come more vividly to life when he expands on them in conversation .

@@4337237 <h> After four years in jail , is Amanda Knox about to walk free ? <h> After four years in jail , is Amanda Knox about to walk free ? <h> 1/3 <p> AP <h> 2/3 <p> GETTY IMAGES <h> 3/3 <p> AP <p> They have already spent nearly four years in jail , but in the next few days Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito will learn whether they can go free , their innocence proven , or must serve out their sentences , 26 and 25 years respectively , for the murder of Knox 's British flatmate , Meredith Kercher , who was stabbed at the flat the two women shared while studying in the Italian city of Perugia . <p> Today , prosecutors begin summing up in the couple 's appeal against conviction ; the verdict is expected within 10 days . Everything seems to be going Knox and Sollecito 's way . Earlier this month , after two court-appointed forensic experts roundly discredited evidence which led to their conviction , Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann refused the prosecution 's request to appoint new experts to examine it all over again . It was a dramatic turning point ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Knox , originally from Seattle , told friends that she hoped she would be home for Thanksgiving in November . Her friends and relatives have a spring in their step . Her support groups is beginning to crow . <p> But the outcome of the appeal is still far from certain . It is being held in the city where they were found guilty , and where Public Minister Giuliano Mignini , the chief prosecutor and the driving force behind their prosecution , continues to wield great moral and judicial power , despite being convicted of abuse of office and given a suspended jail sentence in an unrelated case in Florence . <p> The fate of the Knox and Sollecito rests in the hands of jurors in a profoundly conservative town , whose dubious view of the foreigners flocking to what the Italian press called " the Ibiza of foreign studies " seemed well represented by the cattolicissimo ( very devout ) Mr Mignini . And the prosecutor 's nightmarish description of what happened the night after Hallowe'en in Via della Pergola remains welded to the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr Mignini told the court in the first trial that Ms Kercher was killed at the culmination of a satanic rite . The murder was premeditated , " celebrated on the occasion of the night of Hallowe'en , a sexual and sacrificial rite " , the Italian paper Il Tempo reported him as saying . The killers , he added , " contented themselves with the evening of 1 November to perform their do-it-yourself rite , when for some hours it would again be the night of All Saints " . <p> Ms Kercher , he explained , was on her knees in front of a wardrobe , Rudy Guede ( the third person blamed for the murder and convicted at an earlier trial ) held her immobile and Sollecito grasped one of her arms while Knox wielded the knife . The picture of what transpired was so clear , Mr Mignini told the judge , that " the only thing missing was a video camera " . <p> The ghastly tableau conjured by Mr Mignini has clung to the case , and to Knox in particular , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macabre vision : no confessions , no witness accounts , no personal history of the involvement of any of the accused in such activities , above all no trace of the presence of Knox and Sollecito in the room . <p> All Mr Mignini possessed were the ravings of a person , well known to him , called Gabriella Carlizzi , a spiritualist blogger in Rome whose messages from " the other side " had decisively influenced a previous investigation he led . Ms Carlizzi alone claimed that both Knox and Ms Kercher , from Coulsdon , Surrey , may have belonged to a deviant Masonic sect , the Order of the Red Rose , whose rites involved human sacrifice . Again , there was no evidence of any sort for the outlandish claim . <p> The only forensic evidence against Knox was a knife which the prosecution claimed was the murder weapon -- but it is this , along with the clasp of Ms Kercher 's bra on which , it is alleged , there were traces of Sollecito 's DNA , that has been the prosecution 's undoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found not at the crime scene but in the kitchen of Sollecito 's flat , two weeks later . Knox 's fingerprints were on the handle -- not surprising as she had used it to prepare food -- while Ms Kercher 's DNA had been extracted , it was claimed , from minute traces on the blade . One of the unintentionally humorous moments of the first trial was when the police witness was asked how he had picked out that particular knife from several in Sollecito 's kitchen . " Investigative intuition , " he declared . <p> But now that " investigative intuition " looks as if it may be the undoing of Mr Mignini 's theorem : the court-appointed forensic expert told the appeal that the trace of DNA was so weak it could be anyone 's . Equal doubt surrounds the DNA alleged to belong to Sollecito and found on Ms Kercher 's bra clasp , and which was not retrieved from the crime scene until 47 days after the murder . <p> The immediate risk for Knox and Sollecito is that the jury will discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead in the horrible yet somehow persuasive visions Mr Mignini evoked during the first trial -- as well as in the lavish media coverage that preceded it -- with his depiction of decadent , atheistic foreigners getting up to sinful madness while under the influence of drugs . <p> On the other hand , the jury may resist that temptation , overturn the convictions and set Knox and Sollecito free . In that case , however , the pair will face a different problem . If they are set free , many people in Italy , Britain and the US who have followed the case with only half their attention are likely to conclude that these two ex-students , both of them white , expensively educated and hailing from comfortable homes , have got off on a technicality ; that they have finally succeeded in using their numerous advantages to twist the system their way . <p> Meanwhile , the only obvious victim-figure in the case , the drifter and petty drug dealer Rudy Guede , originally from Ivory Coast , languishes in jail , serving his term . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it deserves to be laid to rest . <p> Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were jailed on suspicion of murder on 6 November 2007 after Knox , in an interrogation session that lasted all night , admitted being in the flat at the time of Ms Kercher 's death ( though she denied witnessing or having any involvement in the murder ) . She retracted the admission soon afterwards , claiming it had been bullied out of her by police , who had threatened and slapped her . The only evidence against her and Sollecito was the now-discredited DNA on the knife and bra clasp . <p> Yet Ms Kercher 's room , where her corpse was found , was full of evidence , including bloody fingerprints , boot prints and DNA , all pointing unambiguously to Guede , the only one of the accused who has all along admitted to being in the flat during the murder . <p> That was the glaring anomaly in the prosecution 's case from the outset . " If there are four people in a room and there is a big struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lisa Lazuli , one of Knox 's British supporters , " common sense tells me that there is going to be an enormous amount of blood and an enormous transfer of DNA , and it should n't be very difficult to tie those people to the scene . " <p> The discrediting of the evidence of the knife and the bra clasp cuts the only thread linking Knox and Sollecito to the crime scene ; there are no longer any grounds for believing they were involved . Yet , for the family of Meredith Kercher , the demise of the absurd " satanic rite " story leaves them in limbo . What was the sequence of events that night ? Why did their innocent daughter have to die ? For them , the anguish of uncertainty goes on . <p> The key issues ... <p> Knife and bra clasp <p> The convictions of Knox and Sollecito depend on the claim that their DNA was found on the tip of a kitchen knife and the clasp of Meredith Kercher 's bra . Court-appointed experts discredited both of the crucial claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blood in the bathroom containing the DNA of both Meredith Kercher and Amanda Knox incriminates Knox . <p> Her lawyers argue that it is not Knox 's blood , only her DNA , and undateable , and its presence is not surprising as she lived in the house and shared the bathroom . <p> Time of death <p> Shoddy police work resulted in confusion over the time of Meredith 's death . Mignini claims it was 11pm : that was when one of his witnesses said she heard a scream . <p> But Guede claimed the time was 9pm , which helps Knox and Sollecito because another prosecution witness claimed to have seen them at 9.30pm in a piazza in town .

" <p> But while the Purple Book avoids that trap , it does little to articulate or explain the world which we now inhabit . <p> Thankfully , IPPR 's Visiting Fellow , Graeme Cooke , has written a pamphlet -- published today -- which does exactly that . <p> ' Still partying like it 's 1995 ' ( pdf ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the left blindly repeating the lessons that were suitable in the mid-1990s , describes how Britain has changed over the last decade and a half , and sets out four broad areas for new thought . <p> Central to the report are eleven trends that are shaping modern Britain . <p> To read them all you 'll have to download the report but they include the following critical observations : <p> First , the labour market is ' polarising ' with growth in professional and managerial occupations at the top and lower level service sector employment at the bottom <p> But mid-skill manual and administrative jobs are disappearing . New Labour 's approach put tritely was to encourage huge increases in the supply of skills and hope for the best . But this appears to have reached its zenith . <p> This places an onus on progressive parties to articulate how they will pursue full employment . <p> In which sectors will these new jobs come ?

This suggests that , if it was ever true , trickle down economics has failed with increased wages for bankers and other high paid individuals staying firmly in their offshore bank accounts . <p> But rather than looking for new tools of redistribution , Britain 's centre left must challenge labour market inequality by looking for a new model of capitalism which disburses wealth more evenly . As such , Vince Cable 's proposals on executive pay are an important step in the right direction . <p> Third , demographics are changing the structures of society <p> The age at which women partner and parent is rapidly changing .

The average age at which women and men get married has risen by five years from 1991 to 2008 . <p> Meanwhile , older people are the fastest growing demographic group but are divided between those who will enjoy affluence in retirement and those less independent . This means that where the welfare state priorities of the 1990s were health and education , the new priorities must be childcare and social care . <p> " ... there is a new centre-ground emerging in British politics , one which Labour can and must occupy . " <p> Cooke 's analysis suggests this is true and that what he calls the ' new sources of energy ' in the UK are there for the taking -- but the changes in Britain are profound and the challenges for policy makers , especially in a time of tightened budgets , should not be underestimated . <p> But at least we now have a starting point -- Cooke 's work will become a source of inspiration for those committed to progressive politics for years to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

@@4339233 A Ferrari estate ? You could say that . Our Continental colleagues prefer the more evocative term " shooting brake " , which conjures up images of pheasant shooting , or perhaps a spot of gran turismo Euro action to a chateau .

Not to mention a philosophical similarity to unsung British heroes such as the Reliant Scimitar or Jensen FF , to which the new Ferrari owes a bigger debt than just its name . <p> Resurrecting the rather arcane styling tropes of the fast estate actually makes perfect sense .

All sublime on a perfectly dry road , but liable to be a bit tricky when the roads turn slippery . Or snowy . When did you ever see a car like this being driven on snow ? It 's precisely why Ferrari had the Italian army air-drop a pair of FFs 2,300 metres up a ski slope in the southern Tyrol and let GQ loose . <p> Now , 651bhp and compacted snow normally go together like Marmite and marshmallow , but the hardware under that elongated body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that nothing with comparable power and performance could ever dream of pulling off . <p> How ?

The FF does n't mess with your fun , it amplifies it by using what Ferrari calls a " power transfer unit " ( PTU ) . This lightweight box of tricks ( just 40kg ) contains a set of helical-cut gears and a pair of continuously slipping wet clutches that , along with a legion of electronics , sends torque to the front wheels when the PTU figures you need it . It can even tell in advance how much grip you 're likely to need as you brake into a corner , and power through it .

@@4339235 <h> Where China Meets India <p> Among Asian nations characterised chiefly by their economic and social progress , Burma has long been the laggard . Yet this may be about to change . The release of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest last year , a new nominally civilian parliament and renewed investor interest in the country have at least given its people grounds to hope that better times lie around the corner . And as Thant Myint-U makes clear in Where China Meets India , one thing is not in doubt : Burma 's days as a neglected backwater are over . <p> Myint-U , a Harvard-educated historian and grandson of Burmese diplomat and UN secretary-general U Thant , points out that geographically Burma is the keystone in a new and potentially immensely profitable trade bridge . It is in Burma that China 's " Go West " and India 's " Look East " policies meet .

Yet as Myint-U acknowledges , Burma is beset by inefficient and corrupt government , devilled by some of the world 's longest running ethnic conflicts and imbued with xenophobia after centuries of encroachment by its neighbours . <p> To complicate matters , Burma shares its borders with relatively dysfunctional regions of India and China . India 's north-east , connected to the rest of the country by a strip of land only 21km wide in places , is home to more than 40 insurgent groups . It remains one of the poorest parts of India despite disproportionately high government spending . On the Chinese side , Yunnan is also poor and has a long history of resistance to central control , but here economic growth is starting to filter in from the east . <p> In the race for dominance in Burma , China has established an indisputable lead .

@@4339236 <h> Red Orchestra 2 : Heroes of Stalingrad Review <p> It is not often that we see a World War II shooter these days , especially considering that the genre used to be littered with them . Up steps Red Orchestra 2 : Heroes of Stalingrad , a World War II themed FPS which focuses on the Battle of Stalingrad . The sequel to Red Orchestra : Ostfront 41-45 is the third Red Orchestra game to be developed and published by Tripwire interactive . This PC exclusive is not your average run and gun war shooter though , the series is well known for its uber realistic approach and expansive , historically accurate maps . More of a simulator than a game , does Red Orchestra 2 offer enough to capture the PC audience ? <p> STORY : In a game where multiplayer is the focus , story gets a little left behind . Story comes mainly in the form of brief cinematics which are used to connect the dots before and after each encounter . Interestingly enough you get to play as a Nazi soldier which is not something you get to do in most historic shooters . It is perhaps refreshing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first couple of chapters . <p> Gunfire is probably the most rewarding sound , slap a pair of 7.1 headphones on and you will recoil at the blast of each shot fired . Red Orchestra 2 's gunfire is perhaps the closest thing to a gun range I have found so far . Voice work is also pretty good , the German and Russian voiceovers which accompany the single player campaign seems authentic enough , whilst the shouts of comrades barking out their status and the screams of anguish on the field of battle send a chill down your spine . <p> GRAPHICS : Visuals are good without reaching the heights of spectacular . A modified version of the Unreal 3 engine has been used and with it , Direct X 9 . No fancy tessellation on show here , textures are flat with any standout features such as bricks scattered on the floor and building detail actually modelled . <p> As you would expect , guns stand out with some good authentic model and texture work applied , unfortunately the same can not be said for the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , they all seem to have the same base model and animation set which is probably best described as simple . If you are looking for a ' pick me up ' at the end of the long day then you may have to look elsewhere , the colour scheme is grey , dull , and drab -- perhaps something you can not blame the developers for , after all they are re-creating the events of Stalingrad which on the face of it , looks cold and dark . <p> SOUND : Tripwire have done a great job in the sound department , capturing the atmosphere of a WWII battlefield and making the player feel like they are right in the middle of it . Maps are big with sound seemingly pinging all around the large outdoors , and sometimes small interiors . Shots can be heard from a distance to give a real sense that you are just a small part of a bigger battle . <p> GAMEPLAY : Realistic , hard , slow paced ; all words that can be used to describe Red Orchestra 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oozes authenticity , everything from the guns to the battlefield is historically correct and designed to make you feel like you are taking part in the battle of Stalingrad . <p> Much like other games , Red Orchestra 2 has two main game modes , single player and multiplayer , unlike other games though and very much like the recently released Brink , Red Orchestra employs " mingleplayer " , the phenomenon where single player plays out like multiplayer match but with a complete roster of AI team mates and opponents . The single player campaign is split into two parts , the first of which sees players fight for the German Axis . The Axis campaign is eight chapters long and contains a good number of locations , mission types and tutorials throughout . The Russian allies campaign is also eight chapters long and is an inverse of the Axis chapters , minus the tutorials . The same battles take place on the same battlefields except with objectives reversed , if you were attacking as the Axis then you are now defending as the Allies . <p> Disappointing perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staple of many good FPS games down the years but Red Orchestra 2 is not about the single player , the backbone of the game is clearly with the multiplayer . Many players will skip the single player , heading straight to the online field of battle . Those that are new to the franchise will do well to work their way through the Axis campaign and take advantage of tutorials which aim to explain and teach the complex game mechanics . <p> Match-ups are all about attack or defence and some times a mixture of both . Matches tend to be slow paced with riflemen taking cover and firing from range . Red Orchestra has a pretty nifty first person cover system which allows player to get up close with the environment and peer over to take a shot . With large sweeping maps it would be very easy for battles to boil down to a sniper-fest , but thankfully there is a varying limit on class type depending on which map the current battle is taking place on . Larger maps that allow 64 players tend to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players to take up the mantle of assault , rifleman , or if available -- tank commander/crewman . <p> Taking down an enemy soldier can be exhilarating , but first you need to take cover , wait for the right moment , dial in the sight , take aim whilst remembering to compensate for bullet drop and squeeze that trigger and hope to see the splatter of red blood which confirms sweet success . Taking an opponent down feels great because you have to put so much work into it . Other times you may think that you have your man but at the last second someone ruins your day ; suppression fire , nearby explosions , and even seeing a teammate go down will trip what can only be described as the " anxiety meter " causing colour to drain from the screen and make aiming even harder than it already is . <p> Sometimes as a foot soldier you can feel quite helpless . You run , take cover , shoot , and you feel like a real pro right up to the point where you are once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly where you just took cover . Battle commanders come armed with binoculars and can call in air strikes to ruin your day , thankfully there is only one commander per team and air strikes are not a constant . <p> LONGEVITY : The single player portion of the game is rather short lived , clocking in at around 5 hours for both campaigns combined , but the single player is n't really the reason people would buy Red Orchestra 2 . The multiplayer offers up endless hours of online combat which is only made better when teaming up with a clan . There are not a huge amount of maps available at launch but they are varied enough to offer a completely different experience from one another . <p> VERDICT : Red Orchestra 2 : Heroes of Stalingrad can be described as harsh but fair ... actually scrap that , it can be better described as very harsh and somewhat fair . If Red Orchestra was a drink it would be whiskey , a little hard to swallow at first but an acquired taste in the long run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Orchestra 2 was made for you . <p> Not for the feint of heart , Red Orchestra 2 : Heroes of Stalingrad portrays war in a way that other games have only dreamt of .

@@4340231 <h> Sherlock Holmes 's origins revealed <p> A " lost " first novel by Arthur Conan Doyle , the creator of Sherlock Holmes , is to be published tomorrow for the first time , 128 years after it was written . The Narrative of John Smith has been seen exclusively by The Independent on Sunday and provides a fascinating glimpse into the young writer 's mind . However , it also reveals that , as a young man , he found the creation of first-rate fiction far from elementary . <p> The book 's manuscript formed part of a collection of private papers that emerged at auction in 2004 and was bought by the British Library for nearly ? 1m . Written in four black notebooks , the 130-page work has now been transcribed and typeset for worldwide release to accompany an exhibition of Conan Doyle-abilia at the British Library . <p> Many years after writing The Narrative , Conan Doyle said that he would be horrified if the book ever appeared in print . But academics have defended the publication because of its contribution to understanding his later work .

His father had been taken ill due to alcoholism , and the 23-year-old had to support his mother and fund the education of his 10-year-old brother .

Conan Doyle called it a novel with a " **25;150;TOOLONG complexion " and it hints at themes that would appear in the Holmes books , such as an interest in logical reasoning . <p> An introduction to the new edition says : " The Narrative is not successful fiction , but offers remarkable insight into the thinking and views of a raw young writer who would shortly create one of literature 's most famous and durable characters , Sherlock Holmes .

In Cuba , the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Puerto Rico and Grenada , the main source is the mongoose . A bat was responsible for the only recent UK death : conservation worker David Macrae died in Angus in 2002 -- the first case of indigenous rabies in Britain since 1902 . <p> For Dr Meslin , attempting to draw attention to rabies is like wailing in a wind-tunnel .

He has been linked to many more . <p> But if the police or families expected that Duffy 's prison term would mark the end of the online persecution of grieving families , they were mistaken . <p> On the day Duffy was sentenced , four miners were trapped underground at Gleision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had perished in floodwaters , tribute sites were created . <p> But , interspersed with messages of love and grief on the sites were vicious missives , one of which read : ' I 'd rather be a dead miner than Welsh .

For the past two years , part-time teacher Michael Fitzpatrick , 42 , has been studying the phenomenon of RIP trolling from his home in Northern Ireland . <p> As the trolls spread their depraved messages , he spends three hours a day diligently monitoring their movements , picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duffy 's case , it was defacing the eyes of his victims with swastikas ) and reporting them to the relevant websites . <p> So far , Michael has collected up to 2,000 screen grabs of the worst trolling incidents as evidence for the police -- and has tracked down the identities of 12 RIP trolls operating in the UK . <p> In this complex game of cat of mouse , Michael must hide his identity . He has already been targeted with threatening videos on YouTube , another troll playground . <p> So he has removed his name from the electoral roll -- and wiped any trace of who he really is from the web . <p> He knows only too well that trolls often build fake Facebook accounts in their enemies ' names , post horrific pictures of them and defile images of their children .

I was so outraged , I decided to act . There are no grey areas when it comes to torturing the families of dead children . ' <p> He discovered that far from being lone outcasts , trolls tend to form highly-organised sects , often with links to child pornography -- although Duffy is not suspected of having any connection with them . <p> Michael has repeatedly found sexual images of children and pictures of sickening animal cruelty , including kittens being beaten and put in blenders . <p> On one Facebook page , he discovered a sect of trolls inciting a man to assault a two-year-old girl while she was in her nappy , which he reported to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ( CEOPS ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had posted a picture of himself abusing the toddler because he had ' quite a few reactions from people who seemed to like it ' . <p> Michael says : ' The average profile of an RIP Facebook troll is male , aged mid-20s to 30s , although as many as 15 per cent are women . <p> Jailed : But although Sean Duffy has faced justice , other ' trolls ' remain at large <p> ' A great many have previously been in jail for other crimes , such as violence or drugs . Many are jobless and spend their whole lives trolling . <p> ' Often they will go online pretending to condemn troll behaviour , just so they can post offensive links . <p> ' They compete for the most emotional and angry reactions from mourners -- which they call " lulz " .

Michael says : ' One technique is to scan for pages of dead and stillborn babies , steal the pictures and doctor them . ' <p> Often the repercussions spill over into the real world . <p> After Lauren Drew died , one of her friends attempted suicide with a drug overdose after she was falsely held responsible for some of the posting . <p> Yet not even the threat of having their real identities traced deters these twisted individuals from hiding behind their false internet personas . <p> Michael , who has written a book about his experiences called Crossing The Bridge , says : ' When I contact RIP Trolls on Facebook and tell them their real identities will be outed , they still do n't stop . <p> ' A common trait they share is believing they have a God-given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been bullied -- and so are redressing the balance . <p> ' What marks these people out is that they lack remorse or empathy , and believe the world should suffer for their entertainment . ' <p> Indeed , when the Mail contacted one troll -- an individual using the screen name ' The Pro-Fessor ' on Facebook , his main complaint was that his profile might be temporarily taken down for attacking memorial sites to the Welsh miners . <p> There was no repentance -- only a concern that his vile activities might be interrupted . <p> He sent a message saying : ' I have had about 45 people yelling at me about dead miners and I did n't even kill them . ' As ever , on the day we got in contact , the Pro-Fessor 's work was visible all over Facebook . <p> As a well as trolling sites about the Welsh miners , on another memorial page he expressed delight at the death of a 20-year-old man , called Dustin , in Georgia , saying : ' It must have been time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he was showering the family of Russian ice hockey star Pavol Demitra with messages to say he hoped he 'd died painfully in the plane crash that killed 43 people this month . <p> Asked why he trolls , The Pro-Fessor explains that increasing the pain of grieving families is what he does best . <p> It is a straightforward mission statement : ' I ruin family , friends and grief tourists ' view of a dead person . ' <p> But while there can be little doubt that trolls are mentally ill , there is growing pressure on Facebook to do more to stop them . <p> Facebook told the Mail it takes more steps than any other social network to keep its pages troll free and has a team of moderators , based at its European HQ in Dublin , to remove offensive material when it is reported . <p> Furthermore , a spokesman claimed the changing nature of IP addresses -- the numerical identity code that is unique to every computer -- means it 's now ' very difficult ' to track down the location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone from using Facebook . <p> He added : ' We strongly encourage people using Facebook to report objectionable content so we can investigate and take action . ' <p> But Michael thinks more could be done : ' Using the report button is like telling someone with gunshot wounds to get some milk of magnesia . In my experience , it takes dozens of people reporting at the same time before a profile is taken down . <p> ' Anyone can make as many accounts as they want in any name they want and once an account is banned another can be made to replace it within minutes . <p> ' Facebook removing content means very little when it can be put back up within minutes . <p> ' There is trolling content that has stayed up for weeks , months , just because enough people have n't reported it at the same time .

But as soon as a young person dies , all the kids rush to put up the sites to express their condolence . But they do n't realise the trolls could target them . <p> When Robert tried to contact Facebook and have the pages taken down , he was astonished at how difficult it was . <p> ' We 're not anti-Facebook .

Bullying charities also believe more steps need to be taken to curb the spread of trolling . <p> Sherry Adhami , of BeatBullying , told the Mail : ' It 's unacceptable for this to continue .

While certainly not underestimating the disincentive to vote Labour provided by any of those four options , I would argue that the greatest obstacle to the party 's return to power is much more fundamental -- and far less easy to remedy -- than any of them . It is the matter which the party thought for over a decade had been settled , but which is now about to dominate its conference with as much urgency as if Tony Blair had never been born . <p> What is Labour for ?

And this is not , as desperate political leaders are fond of saying , a problem of " presentation " .

On the contrary , they understand very well that Labour is desperately trying to cobble together a message that will have some coherence and resonance -- but that as yet it can not even decide whom it is addressing . <p> Who are the potential Labour voters now ? We know some things for sure . The old hereditary heartland support -- what used to be called the respectable working class -- has fragmented and effectively disappeared . Much of it became aspirational in the New Labour sense : property-owning , car-driving , computer-using and , for all intents and purposes , middle class even if it was not professional by qualification or conditions of employment . These ex-working class voters were the ones who defected to the Tories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win back . ( In the United States , such people are always referred to as middle class meaning " ordinary working people " , which leads to some confusion in Britain . When American politicians advocate " middle-class tax cuts " , they do not mean reducing taxes for the higher paid . ) The repudiation of Blairism by Labour 's current leadership puts the party in a hopelessly unclear relationship to this hugely important constituency . Mr Miliband talking about the " squeezed middle " does not help : he defines this as the lowest end of what could conceivably be called " middle income " and makes it clear that anyone escaping that narrow range deserves no sympathy . What signal , as they say , does this send to the truly " aspirational " who were once happy to vote New Labour ? <p> Then there are those who were left behind in the old communities which the more affluent had fled . They became an underclass for whom welfare-dependency replaced work as a way of life .

But as often as not now they vote for no one , believing that they have little stake in the political process . <p> So the party may appeal to the country on their behalf but there is little to be gained ( in the callous electoral sense ) from soliciting active support from them directly . To make " fighting poverty " ( or even the more unexceptionable " eliminating child poverty " ) Labour 's raison d'etre would be a formula for attracting middle-class intellectuals but not a solution to the problem of reconstructing a natural constituency which trusted Labour to speak for its interests . <h> Related Articles <p> These two groups of erstwhile Labour supporters are now directly opposed in their attitudes and predispositions . The aspiring ex-working classes are more likely to resent the welfare-dependent than to feel responsible for them : they are new enough to affluence to be untroubled by bourgeois guilt .

And there is the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must represent the legitimate , consistent self-interest of a substantial section of society .

It is the proper business of elected politicians to speak on behalf of those who have a stake in the country 's ongoing life and activities . In an advanced democracy , the specialised concerns of different groups should be represented fairly by political advocacy and potential conflicts between them should be addressed by government . Which is why the question is so critical : for whom does Labour speak ? <p> It began as the political voice of the trade union movement . When that formula became electoral poison it transmogrified into a student union fantasy of nuclear-disarmament and soft Marxism . And from that nightmare it was rescued by a Blairite rhetorical trick : Labour would not be a class-based party any longer -- it would speak for the whole country .

How many ordinary voters believe that Big State socialist solutions are the answer to our economic problems -- even though the free market is in disrepute ? ( It is remarkable how little parties of the Left have benefited from the present crisis of capitalism . ) <p> So Mr Miliband thrashes around in search of an identity . In an interview last week , he referred proudly to " the things I 've talked about -- the " squeezed middle " , what 's happened to young people , responsibility at the top and bottom ...

@@4341231 <h> Stephen Glover : Too powerful ? Far from it , the press is too weak <p> Nearly 20 years ago a young Tory Cabinet Minister called David Mellor declared that " the press -- the popular press -- is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon " . <p> Some months earlier , the Press Complaints Commission had replaced the discredited Press Council . The Calcutt Report , published in June 1990 , had said the new commission would have 18 months to demonstrate " that non-statutory self-regulation could be made to work effectively . This is a stiff test for the press . If it fails , we recommend that a statutory system for handling complaints be introduced . " <p> Twenty years later the Press Complaints Commission is generally judged to have failed because it believed assurances from News of the World executives that phone hacking was not widespread . The prospect of statutory regulation is high on the agenda again , and could be a key recommendation of the inquiry into press ethics being chaired by Lord Justice Leveson . But there are , I 'm glad to say , some thoughtful editors who think self-regulation should be given another try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Financial Times , who , at a meeting last week organised by Thomson Reuters , and attended by a swathe of newspaper magnificos , said that those calling for tougher laws to counter irresponsible journalism such as phone hacking by the News of the World needed to take into account the financial pressures under which newspapers are operating . <p> This , if I may say so , is a point this column has often made . " It is an existential problem . Newspapers are dying in this country , " said Mr Barber . He wants to give self-regulation one more chance . By the way , I 'm sorry no tabloid editors showed up at the Thomson Reuters bash since they are in the eye of the storm . <p> Think what has changed in the 20 years since Calcutt .

Mr Barber 's FT delivers reasonable profits , but not on its newsprint sales in the United Kingdom . <p> I know this has all been said before , including by me , but the decline of newspaper sales , and the debilitating losses incurred by some titles , are much more grievous than most politicians and critics of the press appear to realise .

" I 'll be perfectly happy not to hear another anthem for a long time , " he admitted . <p> The orchestra 's 36 musicians had just 12 minutes to sight read and master each anthem .

In general , she says , Dickens " might say that it was n't possible to write about life as it really was and bring a blush to the cheek of a young person . He felt he was cut off from doing that -- and perhaps all the more cut off as he was running a home for prostitutes .

It also re-awakened affection for the youthful fizz first on show in 1836 in Sketches by Boz , which " really enthralled me . Partly because it 's wonderfully written , but also because it tells you what Dickens was looking at in those years when we do n't know much about him .

For the moment , she has captured Dickens , in sun and shadow , with all the full-hearted exuberance , generosity and keen wit that he merits . A lifelong Francophile , he once complained that the prudish English climate denied novelists the freedom to explore all sides of life , as their French counterparts could . So might this supreme master of archetypal melodrama ever have written as a psychological realist ? la fran ? aise ? " If he was talking about sexual frankness , then he could have had more of that in his books , " Tomalin says . " But the difference , certainly from Flaubert , was huge . The whole approach to life was entirely different . Flaubert is rather a despiser of human beings . Dickens is a lover of human beings ; a relisher of human beings . " As is his biographer . @ @

@@4349237 <h> As an antidote to the vainglorious antics of celebrity architects , the Stirling Prize identifies and rewards authentic excellence in building design . <p> Any civilisation is best remembered not by its public sector borrowing requirement , but by the monuments it leaves behind . Egyptian national debts or Pyramids ? Strange , then , that architects , the designers who are tasked with making monuments of memory , are held in such low popular esteem . <p> This may be based on bitter experience -- at a domestic level , there are few transactions more likely to end in recrimination than the three-way bargain between client , builder and architect , a horrible collision of grim parsimony , simian incompetence and over-heated ambition . With public and commercial buildings , there is again an ugly mismatch between the vaulting ambitions of the architect and the leaden realities of the budget . Most new buildings are compromises : " value engineering " , a cant term for cost-cutting , is usually applied to ambitious designs and removes felicities of finish and detail . It is true that a good architect is not enough ; you need a good client , too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the moment when architecture goes pop . But architecture is more obvious and less avoidable than the other arts . Frank Lloyd Wright said that surgeons always have an advantage over architects because they can bury their mistakes . Buildings take four or five years to realise , often more , and stand around in costly rebuke of the vanity of human wishes for a long time . <p> Architecture today is coming to terms with two practical realities . First , the rise and fall of the celebrity architect . Buildings are complicated and can only be realised by a big team of engineers , quantity surveyors , systems integrators , graphic designers , space-planners , lighting consultants and interiors specialists . At best , it was a polite fiction to suggest that a single " architect " was responsible for a great design , but it became a lazy shorthand to attribute a building to , say , James Stirling , the gruff Liverpudlian-Scot . Or to Foster or to Rogers . Or , nowadays , Chipperfield or Hadid . Indeed , the trade press has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of British architecture : the man with his name over the door , or the man in the office who led the team , did the drawings and briefed the engineers ? <p> Second , while the public is becoming fatigued with many of the vainglorious antics of the celebrity architects , who exist in an international fug of design competitions , awards ceremonies and private jets , architecture is itself being upstaged and marginalised on the one hand by property developers and on the other by advancing technology . The simple fact is that most new buildings could be realised without an architect at all . As a result of this , celebrity architects have often become brands , promoting themselves as bravura shape-makers , identifiers of quality , donors of prestige to dodgy projects , a rubber stamp to make a speculator look like a good , cultured citizen . <p> The Stirling Prize exists to redress this imbalance , to identify and reward authentic excellence in building design . The subtleties of architecture are many : great building design is about managing space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all possible , simultaneously . Proportions need to be weighed against the conflicting demands of available materials and desirable details . And , of course , the result must be weatherproof and thermally efficient . Most important of all , great architecture should excite with hazard and surprise , and transform moods . The scope for variation is enormous and it is often said that designing a simple house that works well is on the very outer limits of human ability . This may be why there are no houses featured on this year 's Stirling Prize shortlist -- but the six entries are a fascinating screen-grab of current possibilities . <p> Each has at least one exceptional quality which any good building needs . O'Donnell and Tuomey 's An Gael ? ras in Derry is an ingenious and welcome intervention in the tight grain of the old city : shuttered concrete provides a monumental basis for cheerfully cheaper plaster and ply . The effect is one of novelty and continuity .

In gritty Brixton , there is Zaha Hadid 's Evelyn Grace Academy . The showy and purposefully irrational Hadid has her detractors , but schoolkids will surely find the energy of this dynamic design a positive stimulus . <p> Perhaps the most distinguished entry is David Chipperfield 's addition to Essen 's Folkwang Museum . The fastidious and industrious Chipperfield never compromises ; he may accept constraints , but his designs take great pains and achieve a breathtaking purity . Such a pity this one is in the Ruhr . Bennett Associates ' additions to Stratford-upon-Avon 's Royal Shakespeare Theatre are polite and appropriately reticent . Then there is Michael Hopkins 's Velodrome , the best building on the Olympic site . Clearly , the fundamental elegance of the bicycle itself has been an inspiration for this elegant building .

The latter part of the day will be spent going through paperwork and contracts . There 's a lot of red tape . When buying a plantation , lawyers check there 's no bad debt on the land and surveyors will need to confirm it meets the valuation . There 's also the language barrier -- all contracts have to be drawn up in both Portuguese and English so we have to work with translators . <p> We 're always on the look out for more land , so on Tuesday we did some research for new purchases and had lunch with some of our Brazil clients who are visiting the UK .

We pulled one of our staff out of a meeting , sent him out to buy some underwear and told him he would be going to Brazil for 24 hours that evening . We do whatever it takes to get a deal done .

This weekend , though , I 'm going to Dubai . I 'll probably fly out on Saturday night for a day of meetings on Sunday , as that 's when the business week starts in Dubai .

@@4351235 <h> Royal Society 's One Culture charts the collision between arts and science <p> Early autumn seems to be a emerging as the season for festivals aiming to bring the arts and sciences together -- while Abandon Normal Devices investigates and challenges digital creativity across the Northwest , London has an answer in the form of the Royal Society 's One Culture . <p> A packed programme of events offers a wide range of content , from crystal exhibitions to creating your own pop-up book , but the real strength of One Culture looks to be in its talks . These talks generally take the form of exploring apparently opposing points of view , seeking commonalities and discourse between art and science rather than deepening the divide . Topics include ' The Pre-Raphaelites and Science ' , ' Can Science-Fiction Be Literature ? ' and the intriguing ' The Stanford Linear Accelerator 3-day particle smashing diet ' . <p> To find out a little more about the festival , we spoke to Professor Uta Frith , Fellow of the Royal Society , who provided One Culture 's online introduction and is participating in the festival . The first question we had was , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving in our inboxes , " is there room for another ? " Frith is confident that there is : <p> " While there are plenty of literary festivals and a good number of science festivals taking place around the country , when we looked at what was available we realised that there are very few events that specifically celebrate the interaction of the sciences with the literary , dramatic and arts worlds . We had so many positive comments about 2010 's See Further festival of science and arts , which we held jointly with Southbank Centre as part of the Royal Society 's 350th anniversary celebrations , we felt there was definitely an appetite for a festival celebrating the interactions and reactions between these two vital areas of human endeavour . " <p> The interlinking of the arts and sciences is at the heart of One Culture . The festival is also a celebration of the foundation of the Royal Society 's library 350 years previously ( Frith herself is Chair of the library committee ) but its aims are broader and more ambitious than a two day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science to people more at home with literature events and vice versa . This ambition is encapsulated in the name : <p> " The name of the festival -- ' One Culture ' confronts the famous 1959 C.P. Snow lecture " The Two Cultures " , which pointed out that modern society suffered from a lack of communication between sciences and humanities , and reminds us that the separation of science from other cultural achievements is both artificial and unnecessary . " <p> Further questioning reveals that Frith does n't believe the separation of art and science is as extensive as is commonly perceived , for example , science seeps into literature far more than is commonly assumed . The festival boasts a number of contemporary authors who , she says , will ( hopefully ) back her up on this ! <p> Frith is pleased with the diverse lineup : " We are extremely proud that some of the superstars of science and literature have agreed to contribute to the experience and that mathematicians , astronomers and biologists will be present alongside historians of science , science writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sciences as well as in the creative arts . " <p> Those household names include Sebastian Faulks , Richard Holmes , Michael Frayn , Paul Nurse and Marcus du Sautoy . But despite having an impressive collection of speakers to hand , Frith resists the temptation to single out particular star attractions . Her advice ? Simply to turn up on the day and see what takes your fancy .

@@4353240 <h> Patients were put in danger by chaotic GP , whistleblowers claim <p> A pair of whistleblowers say patients at a doctor 's surgery were endangered when a primary care trust failed to act promptly on complaints about a GP . The women , a locum GP and a nurse , are calling for an independent inquiry . <p> They accuse the Oxfordshire PCT of mishandling their complaint by failing to notify patients adequately of the " significant risk " to their safety . Their complaints relate to Dr Mark Huckstep , who worked as a sole practitioner at the Kendall Crescent Health Centre on the outskirts of Oxford . <p> He also ran a branch surgery in the village of Wolvercote , and performed work for five nursing homes . Nurse Loo Blackburn and locum GP Dr Christine Slowther joined Dr Huckstep 's surgery in June and July last year , and were immediately concerned by the " catastrophic " conditions at the practice .

The Independent understands that complaints against him were referred to the General Medical Council . The GMC pointed out that pending any ' public decisions for this doctor ' , he remains fully registered with a licence to practise . <p> Peter Walsh , chief executive of national charity Action against Medical Accidents , said the PCT had shown a " staggering disregard " for the right of patients to know how they were affected by the substandard care . He obtained minutes from an internal PCT meeting six months after Dr Huckstep was suspended which revealed " a system for advising of any harm done is currently not in place " . <p> Dr Slowther said : " I am aware that even the most exemplary of GPs can make mistakes but the concern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and of the PCT 's detailed knowledge and assessment without timely intervention .

Four other gala screenings stand out . Firstly The Descendants , a bittersweet comedy starring George Clooney and helmed by Alexander Payne , the director of Sideways -- much more appealing than Clooney 's own directorial effort also screening at LFF , the cloyingly well-intentioned political noir The Ides of March . <p> There 's also the loopy Jacobean conspiracy romp Anonymous .

Alfalfa is available in a chopped and dried form , artificially dried in modern fuel-efficient specialist dryers or this wonderful forage crop to be made into the most popular form of long fibre - haylage .

If you live in certain areas of the country you will see it growing in the fields . At maturity it stands about 70cm high , has compound leaves with three leaflets and clusters of very pretty small purple flowers . The yield of the crop is very dependent on the rainfall and for commercial growing in a normal year allows for several cuts to be taken for drying . This year the yields are looking good . Fortunately alfalfa is relatively drought tolerant and this year 's dry spring has not affected the amount being cut for both forms of conservation . When used in cereal rotations , an extended break from cereal growing can be achieved whilst the nitrogen fixation and recycling of nutrients can support successive crops and improve grain protein . It is not the plant that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popularity , but the way in which we can now conserve it .

The plant is cut and left to wilt on the field for a day or so , depending on the weather conditions .

The dried product in its pure form will provide approximately 10MJ/KG of energy and something like 16per cent protein and as haylage about 12 per cent protein and 9MJ/KG of energy .

@@4399233 <p> The inaugural Indian Grand Prix was a major success as an event . The sheer energy , colour and vibrancy of the city of Delhi and the Buddh International Circuit were something to behold . <p> It takes a day or two to adjust to India . The air is rather too smoggy , the chaos and lack of discipline on the roads is frankly terrifying - and I am not easily scared - and cleanliness is clearly not a priority . But somehow it all works . <p> The people have a default smile you rarely witness around the world , and they are ready to politely help wherever possible . <p> Once you learn to take the whole experience for what it is , you relax and simply get on with whatever you have to do . <p> It 's a pity , then , that it was such a boring race , with relatively little overtaking and wheel-to-wheel action . <p> Media playback is not supported on this device <p> Hamilton and Massa collide again <p> The drivers seemed to universally praise the layout of the 3.2-mile 16-turn circuit , though . <p> It 's the sixth Tilke-designed track in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Abu Dhabi . Key features are the mid-sector of relatively high-speed corners and chicanes - which worked well - and the massively wide entries into three slow corners . Which did n't . <p> The theory makes sense - create a very wide track in the heavy braking zones into a hairpin therefore making it impossible to defend . <p> But in reality , as we already know from Malaysia 's wide Sepang circuit , it does n't work because the cars end up burning one racing line not a whole lot wider than a car , thereby leaving the rest of the track extremely dirty and slippery . <p> This was especially the case in India - as we also saw very graphically in the run-off areas and pit lane . <p> There really is some serious bad blood now between Hamilton and Massa , and I think that may have contributed to this latest episode <p> There has been a lot of recent construction in the area , of course , but for next year they should import a couple of the high-pressure-jet track cleaners used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race track . <p> The super-wide corner entries served only to create a number of first-lap incidents as cars reached the pinch point three abreast . <p> Talking with co-commentator David Coulthard , we agreed that actually a very wide exit can be more effective for overtaking , such as at the Adelaide hairpin at the former French Grand Prix track Magny-Cours and the Turn Four hairpin in Hockenheim . <p> As Ferrari 's Felipe Massa twice demonstrated singlehandedly , some of the kerbs were a little brutal and I am sure this will be fixed for next year . <p> Accuracy was critical in order to maximise the apex speed of the corners while playing dare with the kerbs , and staying off the ever-present dusty areas just off the racing line . It was fun to watch . <p> For me , that was the biggest story of the Indian weekend - that it was a great event that is already one of the best races on the calendar . <p> Of course , I also have to discuss Lewis Hamilton 's latest adventures . <h> ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-profile incidents , many of which have been his fault . But his collision with Massa in India on Sunday was not one of them <p> His three-place grid penalty for not lifting off while passing yellow caution flags - along with Sauber 's Sergio Perez - was pretty cut and dried . Hamilton had the DRS rear wing overtaking aid open , seeking out more speed , and put his hand up straight away for that . <p> Hamilton was clearly faster at this stage of the race and a great exit from Turn Four saw him moving partly alongside Massa . <p> What is significant here is that Turn Five is a fifth-gear sweeping left-hander with limited braking , and hard enough to get right one at a time . <p> Massa was penalised for the subsequent contact because he was looking in his mirror and so was deemed to have seen the other car . <p> That is nonsense - at 180mph , you have to look in your mirror and make a split-second judgement call as to whether it is your corner or not depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this column on the plane back from Delhi and around me were drivers and team principals , along with other people I respect , and nobody can understand the Massa drive-through penalty . <p> I stand by my instant call in the commentary box that it was a racing incident - as Hamilton himself described it . <p> Massa should have left more room but Hamilton should have eased out of the throttle - in that particular bend . There is no point in risking another front-wing change there unless you are fully alongside and have claimed the corner . <p> Hopefully we will hear what damage Hamilton had on his car thereafter because his pace was largely poor after the incident . <p> Out front , Sebastian Vettel won at a canter for Red Bull , with his first career ' full house ' of pole , leading every lap of the race , victory and fastest lap .

Eight points have been carelessly squandered . So much for Fortress Anfield . <p> On previous occasions this season the Reds have had good reason to feel aggrieved . Big decisions have n't gone their way and they 've dominated matches but failed to make it count . <p> Saturday was different . This was no hard luck story . There was no moral victory or a stack of positives to take away . <p> Swansea fully deserved their point and would have taken all three but for some slack finishing . <p> Brendan Rodgers ' side added to their army of admirers with a gutsy display . Well organised defensively and creative in midfield , they deserve great credit but the fact is they were allowed to shine by Liverpool 's acute failure to impose themselves on the contest . <p> This is the same Swansea team who have already been hammered 4-0 at Manchester City and 4-1 at Chelsea . <p> The Reds ' principal owner John Henry would have anticipated a similar outcome when he took his seat in the Anfield directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to see the fruits of this year 's ? 110million spending spree he was left feeling short-changed . <p> Of course things could have panned out very differently had Andy Carroll not spurned a glorious chance to put the Reds in front early on . <p> The big frontman inexplicably fired Stewart Downing 's cross against the bar from six yards out . <p> It was an awful miss and Carroll , who headed straight down the tunnel after being brought off for Craig Bellamy in the second half , failed to build on his eye-catching performances at Stoke and West Brom . <p> Luis Suarez also struggled to reach the heights he 's been at recently but the service to him was virtually non-existent . <p> The Uruguayan still looked the most likely to provide a moment of inspiration .

A winner would have been undeserved . <p> Reds fans showed their class by burying their disappointment to salute Swansea after the final whistle .

Since then , the Jones team has spent the rest of the year proving what a strong business its new parent company has acquired . <p> Six months on from the deal completing , Retail Gazette caught up with the retailer 's Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) Andrew White , who is confident the 90-strong store portfolio Macintosh took on earlier in 2011 is set to swell in the years ahead . <p> " Jones has been opening eight to ten new stores a year for sometime now and we will continue to do that as long as we can find sites that suit our profile and our customer , " he explained . <p> " We want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new ownership , so we are quite careful about the locations we go into . " <p> New sites for the company this year have brought some surprising results , with premium locations performing better than expected , and success in less upmarket towns giving the company hope that its brand will be welcomed by a larger demographic in the future . <p> " We recently opened a site in Crawley which is n't the usual area we 'd go for but it is trading well , giving us scope to go into less premium locations for expansion , " White explained . <p> " Opening in Fleet Street was a no brainer -- we have been very strong in The City of London from day one , but our Westfield Stratford City unit has automatically become our best performing store in the country . " <p> White explained that in the seven full weeks since the east London shopping centre opened its doors to the public for the first time , his company 's store there has regularly taken more than ? 40,000 per week . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by almost four per cent year-on-year , but budgets were down .

At the moment I 'm responsible for everything except for buying and finance , " White added . <p> " There are possibilities that this responsibility will increase further in the new year . " <p> Having been at Jones the Bootmaker for 24 years , working up from store manager to area manager , and then on to marketing and property roles , there is an argument that White is well-positioned to lead Jones on the ground in the UK under its new foreign owner . <p> Jones The Bootmaker has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his rise through the ranks , it is clear that White holds a great deal of affection for the brand and is not set to move away from the business any time soon . <p> " I love the company and have had an opportunity to progress within it rather than seeing my career held up , " he acknowledged . <p> But when pushed on his future ambitions within the company , which could feasibly include heading up Jones in a General Manager capacity , he opted to focus on areas of the business that he would rather steer clear of . <p> " Just do n't let me loose on the buying section -- that would be a disaster ! " <p> Having also bought Belgium-based shoe specialist Brantano in 2008 , Macintosh is on a mission to stamp its authority on the UK footwear market by representing a ten per cent share of it in the not-too-distant future . <p> White says there are various challenges for international retailers trying to enter this particular sector of British retail , but predicts more opportunities may arise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year retail industry collapses prove correct . <p> " From a footwear perspective , international retailers expansion to the UK is a double-edge sword , " explained White . <p> " In London our trends tend to be six months ahead of central Europe , so it gives companies early reaction to ranges that they would n't necessarily get in mainland Europe . <p> " On the other hand , some firms consider the competition is too strong , especially in the south-east when you look at concepts like the Shoe Galleries in Selfridges department store , making them think it may be a tall order to start from scratch . <p> " London is a great place to be from a fashion point of view , but it is also hard to break into .

It centres around Jo , a young girl who becomes pregnant by a black sailor . She goes on to befriend and move in with Geoffrey , a gay man . Jo 's mother , meanwhile , elopes with Peter , her rich lover . <p> The play was turned into a film in 1961 , earning Baftas for Delaney and for director Tony Richardson . A Taste of Honey is one of the first in the new wave of " kitchen sink drama " movies which emerged from the UK . Other notable films in the genre include The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner , A Kind of Loving , and Billy Liar . <p> A Taste of Honey also signalled the emergence of a new , original and female voice in British theatre .

She understood the characters she wrote about . " <p> Twenty-four years after A Taste of Honey , Delaney wrote the screenplay for Dance with a Stranger , about Ruth Ellis , the last woman to be hanged in Britain , which starred Miranda Richardson and Rupert Everett . <p> Louder Than Bombs <p> During her lifetime Shelagh Delaney was championed by several eminent supporters , notably Morrissey and Jeanette Winterson . Morrissey 's songs and sleeve designs teem with references to her work . <p> In a 1986 interview with NME , the singer , then with The Smiths , said : " I 've never made any secret of the fact that at least 50 per cent of my reason for writing can be blamed on Shelagh Delaney .

@@4434237 <h> The collapse of talks to cut America 's huge deficit reveals the chasm between the Republicans and Democrats . <p> On Monday night , a congressional " super committee " announced that it had failed to agree on a way to reduce the US deficit by $1.2 trillion . Composed of six Republicans and six Democrats , it collapsed under the weight of ideological differences between the parties . <p> Politically , the winner of this debacle is Barack Obama , who will blame the Republicans for refusing to agree to significant tax increases . But the real loser is the American taxpayer . Not only have the Republicans and Democrats let them down , but their childish spat has exposed the true scope of the political and fiscal crisis facing America . The committee was a fraud : government spending is running wild and $1.2 trillion in savings would have done little to control it . <p> The committee was set up in August , after negotiations over how to tackle the debt crisis broke down . Republicans favoured spending cuts and reform of entitlements ( unemployment and healthcare ) . Democrats preferred to repeal President George W Bush 's generous tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were playing to their constituencies . It was hoped that a select panel of 12 could rise above the partisan fray and deliver a Solomonic solution . <p> But the issue of debt became too toxic for the committee to work . All of America 's divisions have boiled down to a debate over the size of government : Republicans think it 's too big and Democrats think it 's too small . Within the committee , the Democrats demanded that the Bush tax cuts go , while the Republicans insisted that repealing them would stall any recovery . The Republicans did offer their own suggestions for tax increases ( roughly $640 billion of them ) , but demanded that these be met with cuts to popular welfare programmes . Republican Senator Rob Portman , of Oregon , summed up the impasse best : " We failed to reach agreement because ... we simply could n't bridge fundamental policy differences that reflect a broader disagreement in the Congress and country as a whole over the size and scope of government . " America 's fiscal crisis is no longer driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalism and blood feud . If anyone comes out of this looking good , it 's Obama . The president has long since given up being for anything ; his healthcare reforms and jobs programme were big disappointments . But the collapse of the debt negotiations hands him the chance to be against something : serious cuts to welfare spending . <p> Congress now has a year to debate where the axe should fall before $1 trillion of automatic cuts start in 2013 . This timetable dovetails with the election calendar , and we can expect Obama to lead the battle against Republican " attacks " on popular programmes . Out will go the Obama of the first three years of his administration : calm , balanced , bipartisan in tone . In will come Obama as Robin Hood : defender of the middle class , nemesis of the rich . It may begin to feel like Occupy Wall Street has decamped to the White House . <p> Obama 's game plan has precedent . In 1948 , Democratic president Harry Truman won an against-the-odds re-election campaign by painting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the same in 1996 . This time , the strategy might get a hand from the Republican presidential candidates . The radical politics of the Republican contest favours extreme fiscal conservatives who want to abolish the federal government . The Republicans increasingly look like economic Neanderthals , while the president is sounding like the voice of reason . <p> But if Obama is the big winner , the average voter is the real loser . Investor confidence and the value of US shares have declined . The $1 trillion in automatic cuts will probably fall more unfairly on the poor than if an agreement had been reached that included tax increases . Congress looks broken ; apathy will rise . Moreover , there 's a dawning realisation among the voters that US debt ( which has just passed $15 trillion ) is so out of control that politicians simply do n't know what to do about it . <p> The super-committee was discussing ways of reducing the deficit , not shrinking the size of the government in real terms . The difference is important . If a man pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then buys a new convertible , he is still spending too much . Likewise , the cuts that the committee were trying to find would not have dealt with the real problem : that the government is growing much faster than its citizens can afford . Even if the committee had succeeded in finding the $1.2 trillion it was looking for , the size of the federal debt would still have risen by nearly $2 trillion from 2011-2012 . <p> What America needs is not a technocratic compromise but a bold reconsideration of spending priorities . Alas , trapped between a broken party system and a president prepared to do anything to get elected , the American people are unlikely to get it .

Now it wants more QE in the UK , for the ECB to reverse last summer 's rate rises , and urgent action all round to resolve the eurozone crisis . Otherwise much worse outcomes are possible . <p> Few can claim to have been any better during the crisis of the last four years . Never mind the OECD and the IMF , the Bank of England , the ECB , most mainstream City forecasts , the Office for Budget Responsibility , Uncle Tom Cobley , Lance Corporal Warner and all have been similarly guilty of undue optimism . Hopes of robust recovery from the calamities of 2008 have consistently proved premature .

I 'm not saying that everything would have been fine but for the idiocies of the single currency , but they certainly would have been a great deal better than they are .

Meaningful resolution looks further away than ever . <p> This may or may not have been always predictable , but until very recently , it has been an article of faith in markets and internationally that the eurozone would eventually sort out its problems . Self evidently , that 's not happened and it is looking ever less likely it will . <p> Hardest of all to understand about this slow-motion pile up is why Europe 's policy elite continues to believe , as they manifestly do , that in the end everything will work out fine . The problem has been diagnosed as one of lack of fiscal discipline and competitiveness in the periphery . Once these issues are adequately addressed through reform , eurozone leaders seem to have concluded , everything will miraculously correct itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most stable currencies in the world . Well , we can all believe in fairies if we want to . <p> The reality was rather better explained by Sir Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England , to MPs on the UK Treasury Select Committee on Monday . The crisis is essentially one of large scale current account imbalances , he pointed out . Some countries have got themselves into a position where markets will no longer finance their deficits or service their debts . Borrowing more , even if they could do so , would n't help them very much ; it would only make them still more insolvent . <p> Until these countries can get back to competitiveness , a process that will take at best years , and not the few short months policymakers seem bizarrely to think possible , they will have to be supported through transfer payments , either directly from taxpayers in the surplus countries , or indirectly through monetisation of their debts by the European Central Bank . <p> Markets are looking for a clear signal from eurozone governments that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be forthcoming .

To date , Germany has given no cause for such faith . There 's been plenty of stick , but not a carrot to be seen . <p> In such circumstances , the OECD 's " worst case scenario " , where the single currency meets a disorderly and traumatic end , becomes much easier to envisage . <p> The OECD puts it thus : " If everything came to a head , with governments and banking systems under extreme pressure in some or all of the vulnerable countries , the political fall-out would be dramatic and pressures for euro area exit could be intense .

On the evidence of eurozone policy paralysis to date , it is unfortunately becoming quite hard to imagine any other . <p> Against such a potentially lethal hurricane blowing in from the Continent , whatever the UK Chancellor , George Osborne , has to announce in his Autumn Statement on Tuesday to support growth would seem like no more than spitting against the wind . <p> Certainly , it wo n't help demand much in the short term . The ? 5bn of extra capital spending for infrastructure is neither here nor there at less than 0.5pc of GDP , and in any case is going to be paid for out of cuts elsewhere .

Banks would have lent with impunity until they reached the ceiling . But if , as banks suggest , the problem is not really one of lack of credit , but of credit worthy demand , then it is hard to see the scheme making much impact . <p> Demand is the problem .

Today , on a bright , cold central European winter afternoon , I took the bus from the old town of Krakow , and rode out to see the place that in 1949 promised poor people " a better future " . In this homage to socialist realist town planning and architecture I was also retracing my own past . In 1970 , during my first year teaching in the Department of Town and Country Planning at Heriot-Watt University/Edinburgh College of Art , I came here on a study visit with my students . <p> An imposed city <p> Nowa Huta was a centrally planned city . It had an economic and a political purpose . It was to industrialise a region of southern Poland where peasant agriculture was the main activity at the end of World War II . Even when I was here in 1970 , this was still a landscape of animals and bended figures working the land . In villages wooden cottages were painted in a traditional blue , and hens strolled across the lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge Lenin Steel Works at Nowa Huta , the regime hoped to jump from field to factory in the space of a few years , and to halt the drain of people from the region by anchoring them in a new city able to provide services needed by growing families . As Nowa Huta is now home to some 200,000 it can be said to have worked . The basic economics were deeply flawed . The region lacked all the pre-requisites for a steel industry -- coal , iron ore and a local market . But , still the agglomeration has spread . <p> The development of Nowa Huta was highly specific to place and time . Part of that specificity was the political agenda . Nestling below hills , far from Warsaw 's factories or the Baltic shipyards , Krakow , a university town of less than half a million , was seen as bourgeois in social composition and conservative in outlook . It was still redolent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . Nowa Huta would be its workers ' counterpoint , looking to the future not the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was planned as a free-standing city , a few kilometres east of Krakow 's historic churches , palaces and castle . However , from the outset the two settlements began to coalesce , and within a couple of years a tram connection had been put in and was well used . Today , riding the bus out there , then the tram back , so as to see two different routes , it is clear that Nowa Huta is an industrial suburb , not a separate town . Post-socialist infill is also very evident , particularly a large retail park that seems about half-way between the two . <p> Built by heroes <p> There was ideology as well as politics . Not only would Krakow have a political rival on its doorstep , it would have a grandstand view of the building of new lives and a new society just down the road . The propaganda in the genesis of Nowa Huta was captured in the film Man of Marble by Andrzej Wajda in 1976 . It depicts the fabrication of a hero , the Stakanhovite bricklayer Matheusz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huta . Though Birkut is a fictional character , Wajda was able to weave in archive propaganda film from the days when men were drafted in from outlying villages , to live in tents and construct the promised land . <p> Of course , the design itself had to be heroic . But in the nascent communist block that meant a very formal " city beautiful " grandeur . What would it look like on a late November afternoon in a different millennium ? <p> Palc centralny <p> I stay on the bus as we pass the high-rise system-built blocks from the 1970s and 80s . I know them well : similar schemes were rolled out on the urban fringe across the Soviet Bloc . They were a doomed attempt to secure popular consent by tackling chronic frustrations about housing , out of a constrained budget . Then I see the lower blocks of the 1960s , with their neighbourhood centres still recognisable , but with uses such as casinos and internet cafes never dreamt of in those far off days . <p> Finally we reach our terminus at Palc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself .

In the centrally planned system , where wage differentials were narrow and rents low , housing was a means to reward those loyal to the regime . It could scarcely be otherwise . <p> So , I stand in the circle that is Palc Centralny , literally the hub of the earliest phase of Nowa Huta . Behind me a low winter sun , dipping away behind Krakow , still catches the upper levels of a crescent of shops , and sheds the last of its light into the radial avenues that focus here .

The general impression is of an area that while not well off , is also at ease . Not far away across Palc Centralny there are new hotels , but here in the heart of the socialist realist city the sense of being in a time warp is pervasive . <p> Heroes , hope and memory <p> Part of that time warp is the narrative that labour has dignity and that workers in the abstract are heroes .

I stood before the memorial to Solidarity . The long , straight axis focused on the steel works , and designed for orchestrated processions , now carries the name of Solidarity . It was the site of confrontations between the union and the riot police . Just like Wajda 's film , the monument connects Nowa Huta to the shipyards in Gda ? sk . I got on the number 15 tram , and left behind the monument that is Nowa Huta itself .

For though our neck gives us the flexibility to look around us and use our eyes and ears to best purpose , this comes at a price . <p> The problem is that the delicate structure of the neck , which is made up of the top seven bones , or vertebrae , of the spine , has to carry the 8kg weight of the head , which makes it prone to damage . The areas often affected are the tiny joints between the bones of the neck , called facet joints . <p> These enable the neck to move freely when we move our head up and down or turn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years go by -- hence your diagnosis of arthritis of the neck . <p> There may also be thinning or even rupture of the shock-absorbing discs between the vertebrae , commonly known as a slipped disc , which complicates the picture . <p> What has happened in your case is that your body has tried to repair this wear and tear on the facet joints by starting to produce new bone at the site of the damage , resulting in the formation of small outgrowths called osteophytes . <p> However , instead of fixing the problem , this repair simply makes it worse . Each facet joint has windows through which the nerves of the spine leave the spinal cord and travel to the head and neck . <p> The new bone formation blocks these windows , narrowing the space for the nerves to travel through . <p> In your case , an osteophyte , described by the radiologist interpreting your MRI as a bony spur , is pressing on a nerve and causing your severe pain . <p> The solution to this is an operation to remove this spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have diabetes should not exclude this possibility . No amount of physical therapies will help -- in fact , they will only flare up the symptoms , as you have found . <p> You must speak to your doctor about referral to a spinal unit . A spinal surgeon , or a neurosurgeon with an interest in the neck , will , on the basis of the story , the physical examination , and the MRI images be able to reach a decision about what is possible . <p> The surgery is skilled and delicate , but not dangerous . It would be carried out under general anaesthetic and you would need two or three nights in hospital -- but would wake pain-free . <h> I have three sons in their mid-40s , and all have different doctors . <h> The two youngest have high cholesterol levels and have been prescribed statins . <h> I advised my eldest son to have his cholesterol checked , but his doctor would not test it , and said he would not prescribe statins to someone in their 40s , even if his cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of a heart attack at 69 , I am concerned that my eldest son may be in danger unless he has a second opinion . Would you agree ? <h> Mrs Antonia A Oura , Steyning , W. Sussex . <p> I understand your concern . Your sons have a family history of coronary heart disease and need a strategy to prevent their arteries becoming furred up . <p> Even though they may be healthy at the moment and adopt the lifestyle measures to keep themselves fighting fit , action must still be taken -- this is where statins come in . <p> Cardiovascular disease causes one in every three deaths in Britain . And it 's not simply a problem for the elderly . More than 40,000 people under the age of 75 die from this cause each year . <p> The main risk factors are smoking , high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels . <h> CONTACT DR SCURR <p> To contact Dr Scurr with a health query , write to him at Good Health Daily Mail , 2 Derry Street , London W8 5TT or email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enter into personal correspondence . <p> His replies can not apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context . <p> Always consult your own GP with any health worries . <p> Doctors have a duty to calculate the chances of a heart attack in their patients by taking these risk factors into account , and a family history should be a trigger to make such a calculation . <p> Your eldest son 's doctor obviously has strong views , but he is wrong in this case . Blood cholesterol has a direct relationship to the risk of coronary heart disease and is a vital risk factor that can be modified . <p> The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) underlines the importance of reducing cholesterol levels by a combination of dietary change , regular exercise and the prescription of statins -- recommending 40mg simvastatin each day . <p> Your eldest son is already doing much to protect himself , but he needs further information : he needs to know his cholesterol level and have an idea of what his blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 20 per cent or greater risk of developing coronary heart disease in the next ten years . <p> This needs to be calculated , and not based upon whimsical views like those of his GP . I agree that he needs a second opinion . <h> By the way ... Cancer screening is n't worth the cost <p> The big question is : How do we detect cancers early , before its symptoms make it obvious ? <p> When it comes to beating cancer , evidence suggests that one of the best methods of improving survival rates is early diagnosis , followed by prompt treatment . <p> If a bowel cancer tumour is removed and has not spread elsewhere in the body , the chances are that surgery has cured that patient . <p> But once cancer cells have jumped from the primary site -- a process called metastasis -- removing the primary tumour can not cure the cancer at that stage , and chemotherapy or some other form of widespread treatment is essential . <p> The big question is : how do we detect cancers early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important question , as this country 's survival rates for breast , bowel and cervical cancer are among the worst among industrialised nations , according to a report last week by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . <p> Is widespread screening the answer ? This involves subjecting healthy people to routine tests to see what turns up . <p> The problem is that when cancers are small , they are usually ' silent ' . A good example is lung cancer in smokers . <p> Years ago , it became apparent that by the time lung cancer becomes visible on a chest X-ray , it is too late to be cured surgically , so routine annual chest X-rays of smokers were deemed useless . <p> The prospects for screening were reopened when , ten years ago , CT scanning techniques became widely available . They can detect lung cancer as small as a grain of rice . The trouble is that the technology is potentially harmful because radiation is involved . <p> Also , it is common to detect tiny lumps that turn out not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can require invasive procedures and cause unnecessary anxiety . <p> And , of course , it is very expensive -- adding more strain to our creaking National Health Service . <p> And so after debating this issue with many of my colleagues over the years , my opinion is this : let us focus on giving rapid access to tests and treatments once people have developed symptoms -- the worried well may have to wait .

@@4445234 <h> Real life renovation sheds light on Green Deal issues <p> How can the Green Deal fit different properties inhabited by people in different life stages ? Our existing buildings have a far greater negative impact on climate change than new buildings -- everyone knows that . It 's good that discussions about " the Green Deal " are really focusing the minds of politicians and industry on how to tackle this issue ; lots of people have ' instant ' opinions about how it should work . But few people have been involved in the practical issues to really understand the technical challenge , social and economic issues . Take two examples ... <p> For my part , I absolutely agree that buildings can be improved , but my experience of real projects shows that it is hard to make really effective improvements without ' proper ' building work and all the consequential disruption and decorating this entails . The propensity of householders to take this on varies according to their ' life stage ' and economic circumstances . <p> What are the practicalities of improving the thermal efficiency of our domestic building stock ? Just to tease out the issues , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed around 1900 and of similar size and construction -- both four-bedroom , semi-detached , with 225mm solid brickwork for external walls . Both properties are occupied -- one by a middle-aged family with grown up children ; the other was , until very recently , owned by a single pensioner and is now being developed by new middle-aged owners . Property 1 has been well maintained , steadily developed and improved for the last 30 years , whereas property ' 2 ' has remained in a time warp . How can we introduce legislation and incentives to bring both properties up to thermal performance standards expected today and how difficult is it to implement improvements ? <p> Property 1 is a family home and in good order throughout . Over the years it has been improved in the usual piecemeal fashion . It has an extension with some internal dry lining but only 25mm polyurethane insulation between battens and only to part of the ground floor . To improve on this would require complete rebuild of the kitchen . External wall insulation is out of the question as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . There is a conservatory at the rear with separating doors , these are not up to current thermal break standards but still provide a thermal break between the genuine living space and outside elements . A lot of attention has been paid to draught proofing and ventilation . The property has undergone a loft conversion some 20 or more years ago , with good levels of insulation when it was installed , but this would reach less than 50% of the efficiency expected today . There would be practical issues ( headroom , disruption , fittings etc ) to improve the thermal performance of the loft . <p> Twenty-five years or more ago a gas boiler was installed , the type now considered so inefficient they are outlawed . The boiler was fitted behind the gas fire room heater in a fireplace recess on the party wall and was served by an un-insulated liner in the existing brick flue . The heat loss from the boiler and liner ( accidentally ) provided sufficient heat for the room so no radiator was necessary and the gas fire rarely used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boiler with a modern condensing boiler on an outside wall has resulted in additional heat required in those rooms . No appreciable saving in fuel consumption has been recorded . <p> Current minimum standards <p> The property is now double glazed throughout but some of that glazing is nearly 30 years old having 6mm air space and no thermal break . Other units have 12mm air gap and some , including a thermally efficient insulated uPVC front door , meet or better current minimum standards . <p> Re-building the kitchen , extension and loft conversion simply to raise thermal performance to current standards is not considered acceptable to the occupier in terms of cost and disruption . <p> Property 2 had been the home of a pensioner and is now being refurbished throughout by a middle aged couple . The majority of windows are single glazed vertical sliding sash windows in need of renovation/replacement . There is some limited secondary glazing . The roof space has 25mm loft insulation -- probably installed late sixties early seventies at the same time as the electric night storage heating . The quarterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 550 per quarter . The EPC rating at the time of the sale struggled to get on the bottom of the scale . <p> So , Property 2 is identified as desperately needing improvement but what is the most suitable and cost effective of way to achieve this ? Virtually all improvements will cause disruption , but there is no real alternative . Installing loft insulation is simple straightforward and very cost effective . <p> Improvements to the heating system are also required requiring work throughout the property . Double glazing is a problem . Whilst relatively easy to install , this property include bay windows with exposed roofs and cills . So unless the bottom of the bay and the flat roof over the bay are insulated , the benefit of the double glazing is severely reduced . This means extensive work in some rooms . Property 2 has facing brick to first floor with features not conducive for external wall insulation . So , aside from the disruption , what are the problems with dry lining ? ( Property 2 is fortunate that most of its rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 100mm added to the walls ) . <p> Like many houses bought requiring major the work , the new owners are trying to live in the house to reduce their outlay . So for dry lining , room by room improvements are the only way forward . This will inevitably increase cost , require coordination with other trades and will prolong the period of disruption . What thickness of insulation is required ? Approved Document L1B recommends solid external walls be improved to give a U-value of not more than 0.30 W/m2.K A combined product of plasterboard with a bonded polyurethane insulation will need to be 72.5mm thick , plus air space and dabs ( 15- 20mm ) overall thickness of some 90mm . Using the alternative of fixed battens and with insulation between before boarding over , the thickness increases to over 100mm . <p> What about window reveals ? Is there enough frame depth to accommodate insulation into the reveals . Attention to detail to avoid cold bridging is very important , but this attention is time consuming and therefore costly to achieve a text book result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the installation ? Even for good trades people it is more difficult than expected . The dry lining must be cut and installed with ' joinery-like ' precision to deliver it full insulation . <p> What about sloping ceilings , which are common in older properties like these at eaves level ? These are difficult to access and the space available is difficult for both internal and external improvements . Quite often sections of sloping ceiling are ignored , concentrating all the warm moist air on a cold un-insulated surface producing condensation . If internal dry lining is being used , then this can be extended over the sloping ceiling area . It will not achieve the levels of insulation expected for a roof , but is better than nothing . <p> If the solution is external wall insulation and loft insulation ( ie not dry lining ) , then the sloping roof area is difficult to insulate . Filling the void between ceiling and underside of the roof covering , even if possible , will obstruct necessary ventilation to the roof void . Over plating with rigid insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be impossible to achieve to any effective standard , this makes external wall insulation a poor option in such cases . <p> Then what about the floors ? Solid floors pose a practical problem and are very difficult to improve without complete replacement . Theoretically , assuming there is adequate space with access , existing timber suspended floors can be insulated , once all the services have been upgraded or replaced , this is difficult and unpleasant work with many repairs required to floor timbers that have been damaged over the years . Given the extent of other works , the owners of Property 2 are making improvements to the timber floors , but they 've draw the line at digging out the solid floor . <p> Speed up the payback <p> So those are just some examples of considerations for improving the fabric efficiency of our two dwellings . What of new technology . Solar PV , solar thermal and heat pumps ? Can a wood burning stove assist with or provide substantial heating ? Solar panels and a wood burning stoves improve energy generation and top-up heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during installation for occupied dwellings . There 's nothing radical here , but these additions will reduce energy bills and thereby speed up the payback . Should these be used to offset a reduced efficiency where it is difficult and/or costly to improve the fabric of a building ? I leave it to the reader to decide . <p> The two houses under consideration are traditional purlin and rafter construction with gables , valleys and hips . When considered by today 's structural standards , the roof timbers will be over-stressed , so although the roofs are sound , there is evidence of curvature and it is likely that some strengthening would be required . And what of the roof covering , both are covered with Welsh slates in reasonable condition , but what damage is likely to be caused by access traffic during installation of P.V . or Solar Thermal , to say nothing of the penetration for support of the panels ? <p> Installation damage and making good is a cost factor not usually taken into account . Neither of our properties has a south facing roof surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces by gables and valleys . All these installation and practical issues make PV and solar thermal less efficient more costly and , therefore , less attractive than might at first be hoped . Consequently , neither properties are having solar installations . <p> So what do we learn ? Throughout England &amp; Wales , many of our existing properties have similarities with Property 1 . Its thermal performance is better than when it was first constructed but it is nowhere near the performance of today 's new build . Its owners are unwilling , due to cost and disruption , to embark on work that will also cause extensive decorative damage . They will continue to make any easy or necessary improvements , but their view on outlay/payback is structured by the prospect of retirement within 10 years . <p> Property 2 , on the other hand , is ripe for improvement . The previous elderly pensioner occupier did not have the savings or income to make improvements and " payback " periods were not relevant . Basic insulation and draught-proofing would have helped to a degree , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new owners , because of the poor decorative state and the need to make changes have been willing to invest in the property and bought it at an appropriate price . The changes they are making go beyond the likely scope of the Green Deal . Issues like sloping roofs and the lack of cavity walls mean that internal insulated dry lining is the best solution , but this requires skilled installation around windows and extra work to avoid the creation of cold spots on sloping ceilings . <p> The couple in Property 2 will be making a massive investment and need to take a full 20 year view on payback from their investment which is a long time for a middle aged couple . Others in their position would probably modernise and upgrade thermal performance as best as possible , but that would produce a house with relatively poor energy performance not greatly better than their neighbours in Property 1 . <p> Conclusions <p> Nobody would disagree that many of our existing homes need to be improved to reduce CO2 emissions . These are just two examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing thermal performance . The interplay between social , technical and economic factors is remarkable . In my examples , neither household start with the same needs and goals and the benefits gained are by no means equal . But their choices are still rational ones that we can all understand . <p> Social factors have a large impact on decisions . These are driven by affordability and expectations of the future . Apart from a lucky few , pensioners are unlikely to make big investments . Young single householders are mobile and will want to minimise their outlay either to pay debts , fund their current lifestyle , or to save . Young families will probably hope/dream to upsize at some time . Many middle-aged people faced with shrinking pension pots are probably going to think about downsizing in the foreseeable future . It is hard to believe that people on low incomes in their own properties will do anything that is n't subsidised or available at a very low cost . With low interest rates , high inflation and falling incomes , the prospect of voluntary massive improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely unattractive to many . <p> The technical solutions are also , perhaps , disappointing . Houses are more unique than they look because they each come with their own history . There are n't really many easy quick wins after loft insulation , cavity wall insulation ( where 's there 's a good cavity ) and draught proofing . There are no universal panaceas and every improvement requires very good trade skills and will disrupt the existing functions of a house and its decoration . By itself , decorative damage will impact the moment in time that people will choose . People will wait for their optimum time in their lives and their cycle of decoration/improvements . <p> How the economics will work is difficult to understand . If people borrow money from a scheme operator and repay it through that property 's energy bill then householders are taking on a debt that will be transferred to new owners . This could affect the saleability of a property because of its total cost and because new owners will feel they have less flexibility to make their own improvements without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given that people move as they age through different life stages with different needs , their window of opportunity is probably more like 5-10 years rather than 15- 20 years . Therefore , the issue of payback periods becomes harder and not easier . These may just be illustrations of the issues , but they do reveal the complexities that the Green Deal will have to overcome . <p> This article first appeared in SiteLines , Issue 59 , Winter 2011 .

@@4447234 <p> At some point during this Challenge , I knew I would find an Ealing Studios film I just did n't like , and which I might struggle to find anything interesting to write about . While that is n't quite the case with Pink String and Sealing Wax , this is the film that has most tested my patience while watching it , partly because of the film it is , and partly because of the film it could have been . My main knowledge of the film was that it starred Googie Withers , whose Ealing appearances I 've only yet scratched the surface of ( the female lead in Trouble Brewing ( 1939 ) , a small appearance in Dead of Night ( 1945 ) . Yet while Withers gives a strong performance around which much of the film revolves , she is also frustratingly sidelined for increasingly tangential subplots . <p> Withers plays Pearl Bond , a fascinating and flawed portrait of a character whose desires and mistakes set the plot in motion yet ultimately doom her : a working class woman in Victorian times , working in the Brighton pub owned by her drunken husband Joe ( Garry Marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pub regulars . From the moment Withers sashays onto screen , with an array of low-cut tops , bushy black hair , quick put-downs and an eye for Dan Powell ( John Carol ) , it is clear this is a character the film will struggle to contain . <p> But perhaps this entrance is so compelling because it comes after 10 minutes spent in the company of the Sutton family , led by stern patriarch Edward ( Mervyn Johns ) , with his wife Ellen ( Mary Merrall ) , eldest son David ( Gordon Jackson ) , and daughters Victoria ( Jean Ireland ) and Peggy ( Sally Ann Howes ) . The Suttons are ( some might say unfortunately ) the focus of the film , its alleged moral centre , and the pivot around which most of the narrative revolves . While it often appears the film is mocking the family ( most notably the moral binaries expressed by the father ) , it also celebrates them by showing their successes and their ability to overcome problems - problems like Pearl Bond . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' public analyst ' ( equivalent of a forensic expert ) for the local courts . He is a proud , religious and unwavering man , whose children largely live in fear of him , while his wife appears to suffer him . He mocks David 's love poetry , chastises his son for writing letters to a girl he is not engaged to , forces his daughters to recite scripture , dismisses Victoria 's hopes of being a singer , and punishes Peggy when she feeds the guinea pigs he plans to experiment on . In any other film , Edward would be an ogre - and at times the film delights in showing how his children misbehave and ignore his strictures . David gets drunk in the local pub ( where he meets Pearl ) ; Victoria performs for a famous singer and gets an audition in London ; Peggy steals money from the church collection plate to fund Victoria 's train ticket . <p> The film constantly underlines how awful Edward 's behaviour is , and how his children have to deceive him to move on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship from the music school , she wo n't be allowed to stay in ' his house , ' his wife ( for the first time in the film ) stands up to him , threatening to leave ( there is a bald statement she stays for the children , not for him ) , unless Edward relents . <p> But if we are supposed to hate Edward , or reject his view of the world , how does that sit with the film 's ultimate vindication of him , as the man who saves David and sends Googie Withers to her death ? <p> Because Pearl , while the Suttons were bickering over music schools and guinea pigs , has been cultivating David 's friendship , largely to make her lover Dan jealous . When David explains about the qualities of strychnine poisoning ( obviously an appropriate romantic chat-up technique when you are the son of a pharmacist ) , Pearl sees a way to use him as an unwitting accomplice ( she manoeuvres him out of the pharmacy after establishing where the poisons are kept ) to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as already noted , Googie Withers plays Pearl as a force of nature : fun , conniving , and a survivor . With Joe dead , and her plans unravelling , Pearl goes to Edward and threatens to implicate David : and here , despite the unbending portrayal to this point of Edward as a figure to be mocked , the film celebrates him . Confronting Pearl , he becomes a minor-key Sherlock Holmes , stripping away all the elements of her story , revealing her lies , and laying out what he will tell the police . Johns comes into his own here - so often the film has forced him to play Edward stiffly , all crisp dialogue and doubting frowns . Here , although those traits are still visible , the challenge of duelling with Pearl makes those qualities heroic - because he finally comes to the aid of one of his children . <p> Despite this last minute denouement , however , the film has made it impossible to accept Edward as a hero . The performances point to this ( Johns is uptight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and even though they are both cruel and unforgiving at points in the narrative , Pearl 's sequences are dramatic and broadly comic , where Edward is monotone and stoic . The film ends with Pearl dead ( having thrown herself into the sea ) , David married to a suitable girl ( his letter-writing sweetheart ) , Victoria an acceptable singing star , and Edward 's view of the world at least partially confirmed . David and Victoria have had minor rebellions , but Edward 's patriarchal view of the world has been reaffirmed . ( there is also an unmotivated narrative framework of a stuffy newspaperman at the Brighton Herald and Southern Weekly News - the title is emphasised in both the opening and closing shots of the film - reciting the ' official ' version of Edward 's life as pillar of the community to his secretary ) <p> Narratively , the film eventually promotes Edward .

We spent the Saturday filming the locals wander around their town without being shot at by snipers for the first time in five months . <p> On the Sunday I woke up early thinking , " Right , we need to get a good story for this evening . " It was about 7am when we arrived at the exit of the town and a congregation of opposition fighters were setting off in military vehicles towards Tripoli ; we decided to move along with them . <p> There are six large communities between Zawiya and Tripoli and over the course of the day , the rebels recaptured these towns one by one .

The battle had obviously just finished ; there were cars on fire ; people were wandering around looking astonished , praying , dancing and firing into the air .

For further information please read our Cookie Policy . <h> Newsletters <p> On July 11 2011 the Competition Commission closed its investigation into Electrolux AG and V-Zug AG in connection with restrictions on online retailing of household appliances ( ie , white goods ) by reaching an amicable settlement . The commission held that the prohibitions on sales from online stores were unlawful in principle , and that internet sales should be restricted only under certain strict conditions . This procedure allowed the commission to establish guidelines on restrictions on online retailing , drawing on the practice of the European Commission(1) and certain EU member states ' national authorities. ( 2 ) The decision also provides guidance on the commission 's practice in relation to selective distribution systems . <p> Content of amicable settlement <p> The investigation opened on September 15 2010 . Electrolux had completely forbidden its distributors ( whether members of its selective distribution network or not ) from selling household appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributors regarding online sales . Based on an amicable settlement entered into with the commission at the end of the investigation procedure , Electrolux and V-Zug made a commitment to allow retailers which were members of their selective distribution network to trade online , and also ( in principle ) to do so under a different domain name from that used for physical sales points . However , the commission authorised Electrolux and V-Zug to impose specific qualitative requirements on online retailing and to oblige their online retailers simultaneously to operate from a physical sales point . The commission also allowed Electrolux and V-Zug to oblige their approved retailers to set up their website so as to ensure that their contact details ( ie , the company name and full address ) , as well as the addresses of their physical points of sale , appeared clearly on the site and could be viewed at ' first glance ' . <p> Reasoning <p> The commission considered that the bans imposed by Electrolux and V-Zug amounted to unlawful agreements affecting competition , despite the fact that such bans appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unnecessary under Swiss law to have a binding agreement between the parties involved in order to find the existence of an " agreement affecting competition " according to Article 4(1) of the Competition Act . Rather , it is sufficient to prove the existence of some kind of conscious and intended cooperation that may objectively affect competition on the market . In this respect , the commission highlighted the fact that had the ban on online sales announced by Electrolux and V-Zug been implemented , it would have been adhered to by ' mixed ' retailers ( ie , those that trade both on the Internet and from physical points of sale ) , since their refusal to respect the announced prohibitions would have resulted in the cessation of deliveries and , subsequently , a considerable decrease in turnover . <p> The commission denied that the contemplated ban on online trading could fall within the scope of Article 5(4) of the act , which forbids the setting of fixed resale prices ( ie , retail price maintenance ) and the granting of territories to the extent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ie , absolute territorial protection ) . The commission indicated in this respect that a restriction on online trading could be likened only to the setting of fixed resale prices in qualified circumstances , notably when the ban on online sales is combined with price recommendations or with agreements that influence the price policy of retailers , or when -- in addition to forbidding or restricting the online business -- the supplier threatens to exert or actually exerts pressure on the retailers ( through threats , intimidation , warnings , sanctions , delay or suspension of sales ) so as to ensure that they apply a certain price level . Besides , the commission reiterated that , according to Paragraph 10 of its Notice on the Competition Law Treatment of Vertical Agreements ( June 28 2010 ) , online sales must be regarded as passive sales . Thus , a ban on these sales will fall within the scope of Article 5(4) if : <p> the manufacturer agrees with its exclusive retailer to prevent access to its website to customers from outside the designated territory ; <p> the retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirects such customers to the manufacturer 's or another retailer 's website ; or <p> the retailer commits to blocking any online transaction whenever the credit card of a customer is registered at an address outside the designated area . <p> The commission then examined the question of whether the ban on online trade could be considered a significant restriction of competition under Article 5(1) of the act , which could not be justified on grounds of economic efficiency pursuant to Article 5(2) . Based on certain recent economic studies , the commission first pointed out the fairly substantial price differences that can usually be observed between goods sold online and those sold at physical points of sale . The commission then indicated that internet sales significantly increase price transparency , in particular by reducing costs and by cutting the time required for a consumer to find a retailer willing to sell the desired goods . According to the commission , it is also because of this transparency requirement that market participants should be forbidden from taking measures that would make the publication of online product prices more difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary effect on the prices adopted at physical points of sale and indirectly puts pressure on the prices and margins of the manufacturers themselves . <p> The commission -- in consideration of the fact that an outright prohibition or restriction on online sales affects price competition , and after reiterating that a ban on internet sales must be construed as a limitation of passive sales pursuant to the Notice on Competition Law Treatment of Vertical Agreements ( Sections 3 and 12(2) ) -- held that such a ban amounted in this case to a qualitatively significant restriction of competition within the meaning of Section 12(2) of the notice . From a quantitative point of view , the contemplated ban appeared to be significant : with a cumulative market share of about 50% of the large household appliances market , Electrolux and V-Zug clearly exceeded the threshold at which restrictions of competition are considered to become significant pursuant to Section 13(1) of the notice ( ie , the absence of a significant restriction of competition when none of the undertakings participating in the agreement has a market share in excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , in which case the market share threshold is reduced to 5% ) . Moreover , both companies were envisaging -- more or less at the same time -- implementing limitations on online sales , with a similar aim . <p> After concluding that the contemplated agreement led to a significant restriction of competition , the commission further examined whether such a restriction could be justified on grounds of economic efficiency according to Article 5(2) of the act . Pursuant to Section 16 ( 4 ) of the notice ( which clarifies Article 5(2) ( c ) of the act ) , an agreement affecting competition may be justified , among other reasons , when it appears necessary to ensure the uniformity and quality of the contractual products or to avoid inefficient levels of sales promotion measures ( which can occur when some manufacturers or distributors can exploit the sales promotion efforts of other producers or distributors ( ie , so-called ' free-riding ' ) ) . In this respect , the commission considered that the argument regarding the fight against free-riding by online retailers at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the customer base of household appliances consists of professional buyers ( eg , construction companies , architectural practices and real estate agencies ) , which do not need specific advice when placing orders . Furthermore , the investigation revealed that Electrolux and V-Zug both had around 10 permanent showrooms spread across the Swiss territory , where customers could also obtain information about the products of these manufacturers before placing any order on the Internet . <p> In addition , and most importantly , recent economic studies show that free-riding is not necessarily detrimental to physical retail outlets ; rather , retail outlets and online retailing appear to be becoming complementary distribution channels . The commission also pointed out that it seemed doubtful in the case at hand whether an outright ban on online sales would actually be necessary in the fight against free-riding , since suppliers could , for example , try to compensate for the additional costs referred to by retailers by paying them a fixed amount . The commission left consideration of that issue open , since the involved companies made a commitment ( in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way as to oblige every approved retailer wishing to trade online simultaneously to operate a physical point of sale ; such a system could ensure that the costs related to the setting up of showrooms and the provision of expert advice would be borne by all members of the selective distribution network . <p> Finally , the commission was not convinced by the argument put forward by V-Zug that the limitation of online retailing helps prevent faulty installation of household appliances . The commission highlighted the fact that retailers doing business exclusively on the Internet may still work with specialised installers in order to guarantee delivery of a first-class service . <p> Other guidance on purely qualitative selective distribution <p> In the course of the investigation , Electrolux and V-Zug tried to justify the contemplated ban on online sales by submitting that they had put in place a " purely qualitative " distribution system -- that is , a distribution system in which the distributors were exclusively selected on the basis of objective and qualitative criteria required by the nature of the product ( Section 4(2) of the notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position regarding the conditions under which such a distribution system can be considered to be a lawful restriction of competition : <p> The selective distribution system must be required by the nature of the product ( which means that it is necessary in order to safeguard product quality and ensure its correct use ) ; <p> The retailers must be selected on the basis of objective criteria of a qualitative nature , which must be set in a uniform way and applied in a non-discriminatory manner ; <p> The set criteria should not go beyond what is necessary ; and <p> The selective distribution system must not fall within the definition of a " hardcore restriction " according to Article 5(4) of the act or contain a qualitatively significant restriction in the meaning of Section 12 ( 2 ) of the notice . <p> Following up on a recent case in which it fined Gaba International for banning parallel imports of Elmex toothpaste , the commission reiterated that technically complex products -- in relation to which advice or assistance is often necessary -- are generally well suited to purely selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company which manufactures products under different brands wishes to distribute them through different distribution channels and to position them in different price segments , it will not then be possible to justify a selective distribution system only for those products in the highest price segments if the products of the various brands are technically similar and if the way they should be used does not fundamentally differ . If a manufacturer sells certain products through a selective distribution system in Switzerland , but sells them through a non-selective system elsewhere , this will also be considered problematic . <p> As far as online sales are concerned , following the commitments made by Electrolux and V-Zug in the amicable settlement , the commission did not have to address the question of whether a retailer selling products online may be excluded from a purely selective distribution system . Nonetheless , the commission noted that manufacturers which sell goods from discount stores ( ie , retailers whose main selling point is price rather than product display or advice to customers ) would not be permitted to exclude online retailers from their distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers themselves need not meet the requirements of a supplier in terms of client advice , delivery , assembly work or customer service ; rather , these requirements can be fulfilled through collaborations with specialist third parties . <p> ( 2 ) See German Federal Cartel Office , September 25 2009 , Decision B3 -- 123/08 ; French Competition Council , Case 08-D-25 , October 29 2008 , relating to practices implemented in the sector of cosmetics and personal care products sold under the guidance of a pharmacist . <p> The materials contained on this website are for general information purposes only and are subject to the disclaimer . <p> ILO is a premium online legal update service for major companies and law firms worldwide .

@@4451237 <h> The way in which the LSE had acted with regard to Libya and the Gaddafis in the last ten years is nothing short of scandalous <h> Share by Email <p> * From <p> * To <p> * Subject <p> * Body <p> British universities have a well-earned reputation as being some of the foremost educational establishments in the world , but Lord Woolf 's inquiry into the London School of Economics ' relationship with Libya must make uncomfortable reading for that institution 's hierarchy . <p> A damning indictment that highlights " a chapter of errors " , it reveals the full extent to which the school compromised its academic and ethical standards when dealing with the regime , chasing influence and money as the Gaddafis ostensibly ' came in from the cold ' . <p> The historical excellence of the LSE is something which they are justifiably proud of , yet there must now be a cloud over that reputation following some of the revelations concerning SaifGadaffi 's application and entry . <p> Prior to completing his masters degree , Saif applied to study a PhD in 2001 and was rejected by the Development Studies Institute ( DESTIN ) as " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervising him " . <p> Undeterred he applied to the Philosophy department and chose to take an MSc as he was told that his tutor could " choose to grant ... permission to ease into some of the more formal courses in philosophy more gradually " . This apparent special treatment continued into his PhD studies , when despite Saif being rejected once again , Professor McClennen pushed for his entry , even attempting " to find an academic to ' look after ' Saif " or " a programme of taught courses for Saif for the year " . <p> DESTIN 's Professor Baker refused , pointing out with some foresight that this would be " immensely damaging to the reputation of the school " . <p> Despite Professor McClennen 's efforts , the main concern of the academics that refused to act as his supervisor during this period seemed to be the simple fact that Saif was not up to doing a PhD . <p> When Saif was eventually accepted by the Philosophy department even they stated that although Saif 's results were " not good enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we felt a great deal of good might be done for Libya ( and indeed more widely ) if SaifAl-Qadhafi was given a prolonged exposure to liberal ideas and influences " . <p> This politicisation of the admissions process had also been attempted by the Foreign Office in 2002 to get Saif a place at Oxford as they " would appreciate help in this case since Libya was opening up to the West again " . <p> While the justification often given is that ' Saif was a reformer ' , what followed demonstrates that the LSE may well have had their eye on other benefits beside those that would be enjoyed by Libyans when the liberal Saif succeeded his father . <p> Following Saif 's admission onto an MSc course in 2002 there " sprouted further ties between the school and Libya " . These included the appointment of the LSE Director Sir Howard Davies as the Prime Minister 's Economic Envoy to Libya , as well as to the board of the Libyan Investment Authority . TK Lord Woolf 's thoughts on this . <p> More disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for training ... said to come from one of Saif 's lieutenants " LSE Enterprise was " awarded a ? 2.2 million contract to train Libyan civil servants by the Libyan Economic Development Board " . <p> It may be argued that when it came to making a decision on Saif 's PhD progress and on claims that he had not been writing his own work , the school was paralysed into inaction . <p> In fact the report states that Sir Howard was seen as a suitable candidate to replace the previous economic envoy because he had a similar profile of expertise . Sir Howard , in a statement to the report said : " SaifGaddafi 's presence at the School added to the attraction , as that gave the LSE a somewhat higher profile in Libya than it would otherwise have had " <p> The rumours that Gaddafi was not completing his own essays had been raised during his time spent working on his MSc . Mary Kaldor who taught Saif told Lord Woolf that " she had real doubts that Saif'sMSc thesis ( which she had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been produced without assistance " . <p> In addition to this Yahia Said , who subsequently refused to teach Saif , has said that he was approached by purported Libyan embassy officials who " stated freely that they were preparing the papers Saif was required to provide for his MSc " . <p> By the time he came to write his PhD these suspicions had grown , to the point that Professor went to the exam hall to confirm that it wasSaif sitting his exam . <p> This was compounded by an incident in which he handed in an essay that was not on an assigned topic and then admitted on " being gently questioned after the seminar that he had had some help ( from professional philosophers in Libya ) " . Despite these issues however , Saif was promoted from an MPhil student and eventually awarded a PhD without any formal investigation ever taking place . <p> The manner in which the LSE had allowed Saif to enter despite his less than stellar academic credentials and then pass despite his apparently flagrant disregard for the plagiarism laws beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year the LSE was still in denial , the Head of the Philosophy department saying " with people like Saif , there is bound to be smoke , considering that they have so many political enemies " . This inability to appreciate the damage that was being done to their reputation can not be highlighted better than by the decision of the school to accept a large donation from a foundation of which Saif was the chairman on the very day he graduated . <p> The lack of due diligence , and the haste with which the money was taken meant that the source of the money was never fully explored . As a result of accepting this money the LSE is now linked to one company that had " previously been found guilty of paying bribes to win contracts and had been on trial for fraud " . <p> In his report Woolf states that " I am not satisfied ( and it could not have been demonstrated to council ) that the money which was the source of the donation to the LSE from Saif 's Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon private companies with favour " . <p> He also argues that the links between LSE academics and Saif left the school open to embarrassment if they refused the money , as did Sir Howard 's lucrative links with the regime . <p> Ultimately , the way in which the LSE had acted with regard to Libya and the Gaddafis in the last ten years is nothing short of scandalous . The way in which they bent the rules to allow Saif to study , looked the other way when he was accused of cheating and then accepted large sums of money with no understanding of where they came from is a clear failure of both ethical and managerial practice . <p> When these things are taken into account the accusation that it was Saif Gaddafi 's influence which awarded him his degree , rather than the University of London , look stronger every day . <p> Rupert Sutton is a Researcher for the campus watchdog , Student Rights .

At just 23 she suffered a sudden and severe heart attack . Technically she died . Doctors managed to resuscitate her but her brain had been starved of oxygen , leaving her with permanent damage . <p> She lost her memory and her mum was told to prepare for the likelihood she may never walk or talk again . Once so full of life , it had suddenly all been taken away . <p> Fergy spent the next six years in hospital in her home town of Whitehaven and for a while in Newcastle . She has virtually no memory of this time .

@@4464231 <h> Dreams Of A Life : new film explores the tragic death of Joyce Vincent <p> When housing association officials forced their way into Joyce Vincent 's flat in January , 2006 , they made a horrifying discovery . <p> Mail was heaped high inside the front door and the food in the refrigerator bore long-past expiry dates . And there , in the middle of a pile of unopened Christmas presents , were Vincent 's skeletal remains . The lifelong Londoner , 38 when she died , had lain undiscovered for more than two years , her body decomposing in her Wood Green bedsit . A new film , Dreams Of A Life , pieces together Vincent 's life and attempts to explain how someone could simply disappear without the alarm being raised . It is both a touching eulogy to Vincent , who emerges as vivacious but troubled woman , and an unsettling portrait of urban isolation , of loneliness in a crowded place . <p> " When I first saw the headlines , Joyce was so anonymous in the story and I could n't accept that someone could be so forgotten for so long , and that we just never think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The story was so lacking in details , but then it started to appear on the internet , people questioning whether it was an urban myth . I thought we had to do better than that . I felt driven to find out who she was and how it could happen . <p> " In the old days , you 'd have the milkman delivering bottles of milk . If they mounted up outside the door , people would know something was wrong . Now , there are n't those physical signs quite as much . It says something about our age , and I did n't want her to be forgotten . " <p> Morley tracked down people who knew Vincent but had lost touch -- friends , lovers , housemates , work colleagues -- and it is their recollections that form the film 's docu-drama narrative , presenting a composite sketch of a woman many of them felt they never truly knew . <p> " It took a couple of years or so , " Morley says . " I put adverts in newspapers and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived at and found people that way and then put ads on the side of a London cab and in the Evening Standard . People started to come forward . " <p> One of the most unsettling aspects of the film is that Vincent did not fit within any easy categorisation of someone ' at risk ' . She was not unemployed or elderly or addicted . She was , from all reports , an attractive , popular woman . <p> " I think it is really surprising -- if you hear her story , you might tend to think she was a drug addict or she must have been so miserable and had no friends , " Morley says . " But by finding out who she was , you start to learn that her story was n't as far away from your own life as you thought . It was interesting -- it was n't what you might expect . And it becomes even more powerful because it happened to someone that no one thought would be forgotten . " <p> Morley also tracked down Vincent 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost touch with their relative , assuming she had cut herself off from them but had , at one point , enlisted a private detective to find her . Vincent , though , had moved around so frequently that their attempts were unsuccessful . That is not to say she had no friends , though . Indeed , that she was surrounded by gifts is particularly haunting , a suggestion there were , in fact , people who would miss her . <p> " It implies she was ready to go out and reconnect with people , " Morley says . " I always read it as a hopeful sign -- we 'll never know how she died -- that it meant that she had n't completely withdrawn . People all said that Joyce was very generous and that they were n't surprised . " <p> Morley 's film only partly resolves its central mystery -- the question of how , in a city like London , Vincent could lie dead for more than two years before being found . If it offers any explanation , it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed described her as a " chameleon " , as someone who seemed to keep parts of herself hidden or compartmentalised . There was also a transience about her life -- she would bounce from one set of friends to another , the various groups rarely intersecting , before dropping off the radar for months at a time . In the end , Morley concludes , she simply slipped through the cracks . <p> " It 's weird -- as the film went on , it became clear that it was precisely the things that what most attracted people meant that she was forgotten , " Morley explains . " People who talk about how immaculate she was in her appearance . Everyone thought she had stopped seeing them , they thought she was off having a better life than they were . Ultimately , people thought she did n't want to see them rather than wondering if anything was wrong with her .

In London , people live in such stifling proximity to one another , yet seem perversely capable of ignoring those who share their space . It is as though , in their constantly overlapping orbits , people become increasingly blinkered and unaware . <p> " You 're on the Tube stuck together but no one 's talking -- it 's a way to keep boundaries but you do n't want to go to the other extreme , " Morley says . " The beauty of a city is that you can be anonymous , you can do things that , if you were in a village , everyone would know your business . But that 's also the downside -- you can disappear . It does talk about urban life ; we can be speeding along and not notice certain things happening . <p> " London can be tough to survive and that obscures some of the need people have to look at what 's going on .

@@4466232 <h> Sincerely Ambient : An Interview With The War On Drugs Charles Ubaghs , December 13th , 2011 06:09 <p> Folk or roots music is one of those misunderstood terms that gets tossed around more easily and quickly then a jelly hand grenade with the pin pulled . The lazy , the bearded , the traditionalists and the Mumfords have , over the past few decades , narrowed folk 's remit down and turned it from a music of the present into an object of the past , one whose core benchmark now rests almost solely on the ability to replicate the sounds of past giants of the genre . It 's validation via death . It 's authenticity via trumped up pantomime . Instead of a machine for killing fascists , we now get a machine to enjoy a nice cup of tea while eating in the park with our new Cath Kidston picnic set . <p> True folk music knows its past but also lives in the very real present . Guthrie and Dylan understood this . True folk is also not limited by crippling notions of form or even genre staples like an acoustic guitar . Ween , who by playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AM radio , working class , bar band music you hear pumping from every car in middle America have proven themselves to be a folk band in its purest , most unromantic form . More obvious torchbearers of living , breathing folk include Wilco , Grizzly Bear , Kurt Vile and The War On Drugs . <p> The War On Drugs is a band from Philadelphia . First formed in 2005 , the band initially consisted of leader Adam Granduciel and Kurt Vile , with various friends lending a hand where needed . 2008 saw the release of debut Wagonwheel Blues , a swirling fugue of a psychedelic roots record that took in everything from Springsteen , Dylan and Petty to Eno 's ambient works , Sonic Youth 's squall and a dash of NEU 's motorik groove . The result was an album filled with proper Americana that truly felt like it lived and breathed in the 21st century , instead of some beardy , check shirt adorned past . <p> Vile left the band post touring the album and Graduciel decided to join his friend as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years but Graduciel and The War on Drugs are back with a new line-up and a new LP , Slave Ambient . Picking up where Wagonwheel Blues left off , Slave Ambient once again dives into the vibrant present with a potent mix of staunch Americana overtones , layers of atonal loops and soft drones . It 's proved to be one of the year 's finer releases and a mighty , slightly stoned two fingers to the Mumfords of the world . the Quietus fired off a few questions via email to Graduciel to ask about how it came together . <p> It 's been a few years since your debut , Wagonwheel Blues . Why the wait ? <p> Adam Granduciel : Well , lots of touring for myself with the Drugs and also with Kurt and the Violators , Dave Hartley , current War on Drugs member made the Nightlands record which he toured on , and also the recording was really intricate and time consuming and we really explored every possible option for a song and then some . I was n't too concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to appease your fans , you 're really just shortchanging them if you do n't feel in your heart that it 's ready yet . <p> Did you find yourself missing playing the War on Drugs songs during that time ? <p> AG : Not really , no . I mean , I 'd be thinking about my songs all the time and listening to demos or whatever , but it 's also important for me to play as much as I can and grow as a guitar player and travel , and take it all in . Taking so much time recording also gave me the ability to let the songs grow and develop their own identity as I and others grew musically . <p> Americana runs rampant through your music , which is something that lots of other bands have embraced over the years . Yet instead of trying to simply ape the classics , you seem hell bent on smudging its edges through ambience , tape loops etc . Why ? What 's pushing you to do it ? <p> AG : I think the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also love to just zone out , that 's really the best way to describe it . I love tinkering with my tape machine and making loops off the board and messing it up ... Sometimes I 'm not actually working on a specific song , just building sounds that can be shaped into songs later . Playing piano , maybe along to some drum loops I 've made , picking out melodies , scribbling down some words , then I 'll continue to mess with the sounds more and eventually just write the song as it develops sonically , instead of just layering on top of a rather basic recording of it . I mean , I could 've written ' Come to the City ' with an acoustic but it would 've sounded like John Mellencamp , which is fine because I love the ' Cougs ' , but I always try to push my recordings into a different territory . <p> Do you feel like people have problems when trying to place you on a musical shelf ? You 're clearly in love with the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youth and the more experimental end of the musical spectrum . <p> AG : Yeah for sure ... I guess the best place to file a Drugs record would be in a random part of the ' rock/pop ' aisle , just slipped in behind something else -- without its own section , just placed maybe near the Stones , ' cause you 'd also find Roxy Music there , and a bit further you 'd find Neil Young and Simon/Garfunkel , and a bit before you 'd be sifting through the Spectrum reissues ... Just slipped in there for someone to innocently find . <p> Is Slave Ambient a drugs record , then ? Are you hoping people will spend their time lighting up and zoning in and out of your music ? It would mirror a lot of what you said above about how you go about writing and building your songs . <p> AG : Haha , well when I say a ' Drugs record ' that 's my way of trying to turn this band into the Dead . Hopefully it catches on . But yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record ... You can definitely smoke a jay and zone out to it , but you can also sit on a blanket by a river and read , it works well like that too . <p> Do you think the mashing up of influences means you 're generally better received in Europe ? <p> AG : Well I do n't know if that 's why but folks in the UK definitely have a fuckin ' rich history of contemporary rock music , so if they dig it , then I 'm flattered . Also , i think it 's less of a mash-up and more of a pretty sincere songwriting and recording process . <p> I do n't think there 's any doubt about the sincerity of your songwriting and the recording process , you can hear it on the album . But like you said , you 're trying to push your recordings into a different directions and those directions might be difficult for traditionalists who prefer to hear the classic ( I 'm talking about the Dylan , Young etc. ) influences to accept . Are you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to be ? <p> AG : I 'm not really too concerned with appeasing any sort of genre or fitting into a category . There will always be people who hear where it comes from and like where it 's taken ... Others wo n't . That 's fine . That 's art . I 'm proud of the extent to which myself and the band take these songs , and the patience needed to arrive at something like this ... <p> But if someone was to say that you take the old and make it sound new , would that be a fair assessment of your music ? <p> AG : No because first of all I would n't consider Desire or The River or other touchstones from the ' 70s old at all . That 's just lazy if people say that . Plus Dylan , the Boss , Petty ... Those guys are still making records . They 're not dead and gone . They 're still relevant . I 'm making music inspired by a lot of people but I 'm making it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What other influences creep into The War on Drugs ? I 've read you 're into photography but what about novelists or filmmakers ? It 's hard to listen to your music and not assume you 've read some of the big American novels . <p> AG : My favorite American author is Raymond Carver . He 's somebody I 've enjoyed since high school . Also Don Delillo ... But I 'm more of a short story guy . Godfather II remains my favorite American film . <p> How are things with Kurt , are you guys still friendly ? <p> AG : Yeah , of course . I just got off tour with him and the Violators . He played on a few Slave Ambient songs and I played on Smoke Ring . There was never , despite what lazy journalists have assumed , any sort of falling out or resentment . <p> Has your songwriting process changed at all since the line-up change ? <p> AG : Not really ... They were always my songs and at the end of the day my decision on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that someone like Kurt did n't bring his own vibe to some of them . I think at the end of the day it 's just about surrounding yourself with people whose playing you trust and respect . Robbie and Dave did n't play a ton on the first record , but what they contributed to Slave Ambient was totally irreplaceable and special . <p> Finally , and here 's the big existential question , what 's the aim ? Why should we keep paying attention to you and The War on Drugs ? <p> AG : I 'm not begging ! Haha , no , but you know , all I want to do is continue to keep growing as a writer , producer , engineer and growing within the band . Hopefully in 5 or 10 years we 'll still be making awesome music and testing our boundaries and enjoying ourselves as friends and players . Hopefully good music will prevail ...

@@4466237 <p> Whether you like it or not , the Call of Duty franchise has pushed both software and hardware in the current generation to its limits . With unmatchable sales that continue to break records year after year , the franchise has become a household name . Over the iterations , Call of Duty has continued to set the bar for the FPS genre . The big questions on the lips of gamers this year was " Will Modern Warfare 3 be a 2.5 ? " and " Will Battlefield 3 be the better game ? " <p> In the run-up to Modern Warfare 3 's release , the answer to those questions was anybody 's guess . While there was a flurry of information regarding Spec Ops , multiplayer and Activision 's new subscription service , Elite , there was n't too much to be known about the story . We got a few teasers telling us it would be set all around the world , in the midst of a " global confict " , but not much more than that . With the game now out , we played through it to see if Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games has pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous Call of Duty titles . <p> STORY : Picking up right where Modern Warfare 2 left off , the beginning of Modern Warfare 3 see 's Captain Price and co of Task Force 141 in a frantic fight to keep Soap MacTavish alive . After such a gripping start , the story takes a back seat to the epic scale and set pieces for several missions as the battle against the invading Russian Army wages on . All you really know at this stage is that Russia is doing pretty well , and it 's up to you to tip the war back into the favour of the allied forces . To do this , Makarov , the main villain , must be stopped . <p> As you play as a variety of characters from Delta Force and Task Force 141 , the first few missions failed to draw great attention . It does pick up well later on in the game with unexpected twists and turns which added some depth to an otherwise shallow story . For the first time in a Call of Duty game , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is not to be expected but reasonably well executed . It 's not the human relationships which draw that emotion either , it is watching the world fall apart , location by location . With the Call of Duty series , the story has always felt like it is n't top of the developer 's priority list , but it does n't really matter . Who watches the Terminator Films for Arnie 's fantastic acting ? Who watches Transformers to be gripped by Sam Whitwicky 's love life ? No one . Sometimes , it 's just about seeing stuff getting blown up . <p> GRAPHICS : It felt that for Modern Warfare 3 , the graphics were under most scrutiny from fans . With DICE and Electronic Arts lighting up E3 with the Frostbite 2 engine used in Battlefield 3 , many felt that MW3 's graphics were nothing short of underwhelming , with the blame going to the engine Infinity Ward has used from the first Modern Warfare . It is fair to say that MW3 did n't enjoy the same graphical leap that its main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to make a game as smooth as possible , and the game looks far better then it 's given credit for . <p> Everything has been polished , polished and polished again to make this the best looking Call of Duty title ever . It feels brighter and more detailed , making individual features such as the Parisian buildings stand out among the destruction . The grand set pieces look fantastic , most notably in London and Paris , which are the setting for some of the titles more memorable moments . As players travel the Earth in Modern Warfare 3 , all locations are visually striking , be it in Germany or Africa , New York or Russia . <p> Overall , the graphics are not the best around , but if the developers can do what they 've done here on this generation of consoles , it will be very exciting to see what will be done for the next generation ; with a brand new engine . <p> SOUND : Surprisingly , the sound in MW3 was one of its most impressive assets . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gunshots had much more grunt to them , as did just about everything else . Firing rounds from the AC130 has never sounded so good , with every thump feeling hugely satisfying . Unlike previous iterations , Hans Zimmer did n't provide the score for MW3 . Instead Brian Tyler worked on this title , and did a stellar job of it , too . Tyler , who worked on Battle : Los Angeles , brought a fresh take to the score of MW3 , which is as enjoyable as any of the previous Call of Duty titles . The voice acting in Modern Warfare 3 does n't set the world on fire , but it 's always nice to be shouted at by our pal Billy Murray , who plays Captain Price in the game . He is the star of the show , and probably the only one you 'll listen to . <p> GAMEPLAY : Good old gameplay , arguably the thing that keeps Call of Duty so ahead of the crowd , so often . Even when most know it is n't the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 still manages to nail it . Infinity Ward and Activision did n't innovate for MW3 , which will be a disappointment for some , but what they did do was take what they had and what they had learned from the previous games , and , much like the graphics , polished it . You know exactly what you are going to get with Call of Duty ; great gunplay , unrivalled responsiveness and explosions . Lots of explosions . <p> As you take control of the game 's main characters , you are often led around by Price or Sandman , which while great on occasions , it can feel like you are being taken through the game . A chance to be a leader in times of adversity would n't have gone amiss , and sometimes you will be left feeling like more of a cadet then an elite soldier . It is not until later on that you truly feel like you have earned your stripes , when you get to play as Captain Price himself . <p> That aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says on the tin . The relatively short campaign is jam-packed with action ; the whole campaign is a romp to play through for the most part . We have never seen destruction on such a grand scale in a Call of Duty title ; it really has been turned up to eleven for what could be the series ' swansong . As the credits roll , you ca n't help but feel the same satisfaction you feel having watched one of the summer 's blockbuster action movies . And we have n't even touched on the flagship multiplayer . <p> MULTIPLAYER : On paper at least , Modern Warfare 3 's multiplayer has been given a huge overhaul in comparison to its predecessors . With the revamp of the rewards system into the new Strike Packages , has the aim of making the multiplayer more accessible for all paid off ? In short the answer has to be yes . The attempts to balance elements have n't really had the desired effect , as most of the time , players suffer from the same issues of not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a couple of Strike Packages land . That said , I did n't have that problem in any of the other Call of Duty titles , so I think it 's great . The new Strike Packages add a layer to the gameplay , most notably , the Support Strike Package is a great tool for both the novice and the expert Modern Warfare player . <p> There are 16 maps in which players can pick up all of their favourite game modes and get playing . Here , it is very Call of Duty , and you really do know what to expect when playing Call of Duty multiplayer . That is until you try out the new game modes , Kill Confirmed and Team Defender , which are fantastic additions to an already stellar lineup of multiplayer . Kill Confirmed particularly impresses , where players have to grab the dog tags of an opponent that they , or their team mates have downed . Pick up a fallen comrade 's tags , and you will deny the kill for the opposing team , scoring yourself some points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff with hours of fun , and is a must to check out . <p> Of course , Modern Warfare 3 's multiplayer is n't perfect , and even a month after release , there are some serious spawning issues , and the weapon proficiency seems to help out experienced players a little too much , but we still hope that this will be addressed over time . While there has been little innovation in the multiplayer aspect of the game , it is without doubt still one of the most enjoyable multiplayer games out there , and still sets the benchmark for the genre . <p> Spec Ops has perhaps seen the biggest overhaul in the whole game . The co-op action in the Spec Ops missions is an absolute blast . Whereas before it was seen as an add-on for players , it has had a lot more attention paid to it this time around , with 16 action packed missions to earn stars on with your friends . It was easy to get bored on previous Spec Ops missions , but they entertain much more in Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on infinite waves of enemies is also great to play . With 16 maps to enjoy as you level up , it has that addictive feel about it that we are more used to getting from iOS games of late . Taking out waves of suicide bombers , juggernauts , attack dogs and helicopters until you drop will always leave you coming back for more , as will wanting to top your friends scores . As you beat waves , you earn points to spend on Survival Armories , which include Weapons , Equipment and Air Support . When used strategically , players can mix up the ways that the waves of enemies are taken on which is great fun . Spec Ops stands out as the biggest improvement to the Modern Warfare series , providing hours of fun for all involved . <p> LONGEVITY : All of the above , coupled with the new Elite social application for Modern Warfare 3 , means you ca n't help but feel you have a ton of things to do and great value for money out of this game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the videos , analysis and leaderboards are a great tool for those who wish to delve deeper into the Call of Duty universe . The multiplayer alone will keep you going for as long as you enjoy it and whilst the single player is roughly 6 hours in length , the additions to spec ops mean that there has been even more length added to a game already bursting at the seams . <p> VERDICT : Modern Warfare 3 is by no means a revolution . It is n't a graphical , gameplay or game mode innovation . What it is , however , is a very well put together example of everything that Call of Duty developers have learned over the years of making the game . The campaign 's story should have been stronger , but it is made up for by the sheer scale found within the game . While we saw no revolutionary graphical changes , what we did get was a fantastic trip around the world , which looks great and packs in the frames-per-second like no other FPS out there . Modern Warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , a massive firework show to usher the series into a transitional period where the developers will be forced to innovate and shake things up if it wants to keep smashing those sales records .

@@4468231 <h> Q&amp;A : Shigeru Miyamoto looks into Nintendo 's future <p> The creator of Super Mario Bros. has big plans for Nintendo 's future ... and very small plans for his own . <p> Shigeru Miyamoto , the head of Nintendo 's game design efforts , sat down with Wired last week to discuss how the company plans to win more fans to its Nintendo 3DS handheld , the remarkable collaboration between developers in Kyoto and Texas that created Mario Kart 7 , and another blockbuster franchise that he thinks would be a good fit for East-West cooperation . <p> Nintendo of America sought to put that disclosure in perspective , emphasizing in a statement that Miyamoto is not leaving the company . " He jokingly mentions retirement to motivate his staff to excel , " the company said . " His ability to focus on smaller projects reflects the confidence he has in all of Nintendo 's development teams ... Mr. Miyamoto will continue to provide oversight to those teams and get deeply involved in projects when the situation warrants , ensuring that the quality of Nintendo projects is maintained at a high level . But he will also be able to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The full interview with Miyamoto follows . <p> Wired : When we last left off , we were at the roundtable at E3 . And my question then was , Why are we not seeing more games on 3DS for the casual audience ? Nintendogs came out , but I expected more things like Brain Age and going after the wide audience . And your response was , you 're pursuing core gamers . So I wanted to start there -- do you see this as a strategy shift , going after core gamers again ? Do you feel like you were neglecting them in the past and want to bring them back into the fold ? What is the reason for pursuing hard-core gamers right now with 3DS ? <p> Shigeru Miyamoto : Of course , I have my own limits as to how much game software I can take care of at any one time . But when it comes to the time when we were developing mainly software for the Nintendo DS , my concern was , as you pointed out , looking beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could expand the definition of videogames . But when we started working on the Nintendo 3DS , inside myself there was a kind of shift in terms of priority . That is , I wanted to see how games can be changed when they are running on the Nintendo 3DS . When I say " the games , " I mean every kind of game including the series of videogames which were available in the past . <p> Applying that to the Wii , I wanted to see how the Wii MotionPlus could change the gameplay even when it 's applied to existing gameplay . <p> So , of course Nintendo 's main strategy has been the expanding of the gaming population . By that , what we are actually doing from the developer 's side is we are trying to expand the potential of videogames . To some extent , of course , we 've been able to do that , and now , people are sometimes talking about the element of smartphones and how Nintendo 's market share might be eroded by the element of smartphones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against each other . <p> However , when we look at how we have expanded the gaming population and how we have expanded the definition of videogames , some of that might be actually done by smartphones . When it comes to some portion of the population that we have expanded , smartphones might be able to provide some entertainment as well . So looking at the situation just like that , rather than simply trying to expand the definition of videogames in the same way as we used to do with Nintendo DS , I think , why do n't we look at the gaming population from a different perspective ? <p> More specifically : For example , there have got to be a number of people who used to play videogames but who are now , even temporarily , quitting from videogames . And why do n't we approach , for example , more female audiences ? In order to approach those people who are taking a break , or those female customers , it so happens that applying the game mechanisms that we used to make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea . And actually we 'll be able to leverage upon our own ability to make ... game know-how , the know-how that we use to make quality games . <p> Wired : With Mario 3D Land , which I played the whole thing , we finally saw with Nintendo 3DS a game where I never wanted to turn the 3-D off , I always wanted to keep going in 3-D . And I saw elements in that game that played with 3-D . But to look at every other game on 3DS , where Mario is head and shoulders ahead of them , what do you do for other people who are developing for 3DS ? Are you outreaching , trying to get them to do what you guys did with Mario ? <p> Miyamoto : Well , when it comes to Super Mario 3D Land , yes , that 's something that we really wanted to do by taking advantage of the capabilities of Nintendo 3DS . However , even though we were able to make something like that , we have no intention to force others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that I want every single developer to come up with their own ideas in order to take advantage of the capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS . <p> And for the players as well , I hope they will be able to play just as they like . Sometimes they want to play with full 3-D and sometimes not . Taking for example Mario Kart 7 , sometimes they may want to simply ease the 3-D effect and actually steer by moving the 3DS unit . That 's actually very fun . But at the same time , sometimes ... they just might want to appreciate the 3-D effect of Mario Kart . So it actually depends upon the good balance between 3-D and not 3-D . <p> When it comes to other companies and other developers , all I can say is , it 's good if they are going to study the way ... they can take a perfect balance . Once again , we do n't have any intention to force or even educate them to do something like Mario Kart or Super Mario 3D Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope that they can just leisurely and casually enjoy playing with Nintendo 3DS at their will . <p> Wired : What was your input into Mario 3D Land ? What did you see during the development process , and what did you tell the developers to do ? You know , this would be a good idea , that would be a good idea ... <p> Miyamoto : When it comes to the real attraction of Nintendo 3DS , of course , first and foremost , people can point out that it 's the 3-D . And of course I really wanted to make something which can surprise people . You know , be it Super Mario 3D Land or any other thing in the entertainment business , what we 've really got to do is find out the new , fun elements . And with that , we try to surprise people . For Nintendo 3DS , and for Super Mario 3D Land , we wanted to convey the charm and attraction of something 3-D , some things which are popping up . <p> And what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of Super Mario 3D Land , I think that has n't been largely changed ever since I started working on Donkey Kong many years ago . At first , of course , I need to know the ... technological background of what can be done , what ca n't be done , etc. , etc . But at the same time , I never forget the viewpoint of the player . So sometimes I 'm the developer , or engineer with the know-how and the knowledge of the technology . And sometimes I 'm developing the game from the perspective of the game players . So I 've never shifted my attention from that , anything at all like that . So what I 've been trying to say to the other developers as well is just the same : Be ... the developer who has technical background as well as the game players who are enjoying the videogame that you 're making . <p> Wired : It 's come out since Mario Kart 7 came out , there have been some articles about how Retro Studios was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's considered a landmark for the series because you had this collaboration between EAD and Retro . And I 'm curious as to whether you think that this would be an interesting model for more games , like a Mario platformer or a Zelda game , to have a Western team and a Japanese team working in close concert to produce a game like that . <p> Miyamoto : First of all , let me talk a little bit more in detail about how we collaborated with Retro Studios this time . Of course , they were taking care of the game designing aspect . Specifically , they were taking care of the design of the courses and the artwork about that . But when it comes to the gameplay and the control mechanism itself , that 's being taken care of by EAD once again . <p> People often say that videogames made by Western developers are somehow different in terms of taste for the players , in comparison with Japanese games . I think that means that the Western developers and Japanese developers , they are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste in their games . Mario Kart , I believe , was good in order to express that kind of different taste because we have many kinds of different courses for the Mario karts to run and race around . So for each of the different courses , we could identify : Retro is supposed to take care of this course , and EAD is going to do that , and such and such . Then , we were able to join forces in order to realize a variety of different courses , a variety of different tastes . I think that 's one reason how it worked out well between a Japanese development team and a Western development team . <p> As you know , we have already collaborated with Retro for the Metroid Prime series in the past . And I think when we talk about any other franchise , Zelda might be a possible franchise for that collaboration . <p> Wired : It did seem to me , playing Skyward Sword , that Aonuma-san and his team were maybe looking at some Western role-playing game convention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of bugs and collecting lots and lots of treasure and loot , crafting items . That seems to me something that you have n't really seen in Zelda games before or really in Japanese role-playing games , that idea of that giant inventory and that feeling of freedom is maybe something they pulled from Western games . Would you say that as well or am I really off the mark ? <p> Miyamoto : I just do n't have that kind of idea actually . Of course , when it comes to Japanese role-playing games , in any role-playing game in Japan you 're supposed to collect a huge number of items , and magic , and you 've got to actually combine different items together to make something really different . Of course , in the beginning , there 's got to be some influence from the original role-playing games that originated in the Western PC game format . <p> And when it comes to The Legend of Zelda , we look at the recent series in the Legend of Zeldafranchise other than creating the new items and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were simply making something larger . In other worse , in the course of the evolution of theLegend of Zelda , the only way that the developers were able to take was making something more . And for that matter , I think the inclusion of insect collecting and combining the different potions or medicines , for example , I think that I myself actually thought that was a good idea or direction to make a kind of change in the franchise for this time around . <p> But then , when I 'm asked , did the making of Skyward Sword have a great impact from the Western way of making RPGs , I just do n't think so . On the other hand , I also think that Zelda in the first place was a game where players were given a lot more freedom . In my opinion , the recent works of The Legend of Zelda lacked that kind of expanded freedom . With Skyward Sword one of the things I wanted to realize is going back to the basics , so that players would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So with Skyward Sword , a lot has been said about pushing the series forward with orchestrated music . One of the only complaints I 've read about the game , and this was something I noticed , is that I think in the five years since Twilight Princessand Skyward Sword ... when Twilight Princess came out nobody really said anything about this , but when Skyward Sword came out and the game had no voice acting , it makes an impression now because it 's one of very very few games in that genre which do not have the characters actually speaking in full voice . And I 'm curious , I know we 've probably spoken about this before in the past and I know Nintendo has very deliberate -- it 's not a question of technology , it 's a question of artistic style and there are reasons you do it that way . But I 'm wondering if there 's any pressure now as games keep evolving to add voices to Zelda to keep it current . <p> Miyamoto : After all , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As the director , of course I want to be getting involved , have direct hands on as many parts and as many things as possible . So it depends upon what kind of direction we are taking for certain projects . For example , if we are pursuing photorealism , I do not think that the director can do a lot -- in other words , the staff working on the forefront of development are having their hands on , and the director can not have their hands on , these details . <p> But what kind of game , it totally depends on what kind of direction I really want to take . And ... whether the voice actors should play a key role right now is one of the elements that we 've got to decide in terms of entirely what things we 'd like to make . And talking specifically about the possibility of hiring voice actors to play over the roles of the main characters , we have to ask ourselves , after all , what kind of things do we really need them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really doing anything good for the expanding of the attraction of the Zelda franchise itself ? <p> My opinion is actually against that . I mean , by having the voice actor speaking out the main character 's opinions and messages , I 'm afraid that they are going to narrow down the actual characteristics that people can imagine or apply to each character they are controlling , for example . But after all , it depends upon how much work the developer has to show , how many things the director can do , and is it going to do anything good to expand the charm or attraction of The Legend of Zelda ? So once again , in terms of all these , if you ask me , is n't it important for Link and other main characters to speak ? I just can not think so , because of , in terms of what I can do and what Zelda should do . <p> Wired : What has the reaction been so far to the directions of Mario 3D Land and Skyward Sword ? Both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do people feel like it 's going in the right direction , are there other things that could happen to these series or are you happy in general with the way it 's gone ? <p> Miyamoto : After all , from the beginning I have never forced all the developers to do what we have done this time around . From the very beginning , there were many people amongst the developers who were thinking just like I did . So I can not deny that there were n't any times that I needed to , well , rather aggressively encourage the developers to do this or do that . I can not just deny that . <p> But basically , our teams from the beginning were in the same mindset as to what we really needed to do with these games . And we had a strong conviction as to the outcome , in other words that we were doing something right in terms of the courses these games ' development should take . So I just believe that everyone is happy about the outcome by thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically , each developer wants to make something new all the time , but the fact of the matter is , Nintendo has so many franchise series . One after another , we are supposed to make sequels . But even though these two games that you just mentioned are regarded as sequels in their particular franchises , all the developers have the mindset that we were making something new , some brand-new game . Well , of course , from now on too , many developers have to work on sequels from the same franchises . But I think the result , or one of the outcomes of developing two games this time around is how they can work on the sequels as if making brand-new products . <p> Wired : You 've narrowed down -- you used to do every single game at Nintendo and have input into it and I know recently you 've narrowed down into a few games that you work on . And all of these games are big retail boxed games that are sold in stores . I see , with Iwata-san talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . I 'm curious as to whether you in the near future want to work on games that are smaller , maybe downloadable games , to raise the profile of those games . We see games by the B-teams , but in order to get more people buying games that way , do you feel there need to be Miyamoto download games ? <p> Miyamoto : I just do n't care -- as long as I can make something new and interesting , and if it can become a social topic , and spread to so many people , I 'll be working on anything . That 's my attitude . Of course , the situation today is rather different , many companies are simply looking around and seeing what 's trending , what 's hot . Inside that kind of frame , managers demand developers work on similar games . It 's rather difficult for me to say something exact , because unless I can fix my complete idea , I just can not decide which media is going to be appropriate . What kind of size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that is actually the right course for us to choose -- in other words , developers first come up with a fresh idea . And then , once complete idea is fixed , they should decide , okay , in terms of a new idea , this media is most suited , and the size of the development teams should be just like that . <p> And after all , I 'm aging right now . Yes , I 'm in a stage , in a position to be able to take some distance away from the forefront of the development teams right now and see things from a much broader perspective right now . In other words , I think I have many more options than before . In my head , myself . I am now in a position to make things much more freely right now , but the fact of the matter is I have ideas but I have not come to the stage where I can say exactly which one is going to be good for the network games , or what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have some ideas about Flipnote Studio , things like that , but I do n't have a complete idea for that . Until I can decide , okay , this is going to be the way each one of these ideas is going to be combined and take shape , I just do n't say that it 's good for digital , it 's good for download . That 's all . <p> Wired : On this topic , " Find Mii " is the most interesting thing about 3DS , or was when it launched . That was the game that my friends and I all played , and we all carried our 3DSes around with us . That 's what we did for months until we finished that game . It was this simple little thing but we loved doing it . It was just me and seven people and we would just all keep exchanging data whenever we saw each other and everyone wanted to do it . Now the system update came out and there 's the sequel which we have n't tried yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of game , that it really had all of our attention on 3DS until we had all finished it , and then we put our 3DSes down but I think it 's going to pick up again . As silly as that experience is , for some reason it 's very powerful with me and my friends . <p> Miyamoto : All the developers who worked on Find Mii were looking forward to some solid reactions from the customers . But because it was something really new we could not have strong conviction . So we had to start from something rather small . So I think everybody involved was happy with the outcome . I hope that people can look forward to something in that nature from now as well . <p> Wired : Are you also involved in -- I think Nintendo has been pretty good at pushing out that level of free content to 3DS owners , like videos or Four Swords Adventures . Are you also involved now in trying to generate more of that to keep people picking up their 3DS ? <p> Miyamoto : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so that Nintendo 3DS shall be used by the users every day . So that we wanted to include as many motives for the users to do so as possible with Nintendo 3DS . But we did so probably too fast . And then some people even said you really do n't have to purchase anything else , any software at all , now that you have the camera and the packaged software inside the Nintendo 3DS which are enjoyable enough . But of course , until now you already have a selection of packaged software and download software to choose from . <p> And you know , after all , whenever we are coming up with a new product , if the only attraction is yes , we have intense extensive file capability , it 's not interesting for the developers at all . Any time we are offering something new , we want to include some different attractions instead of simply beefed-up capabilities . That 's why we are trying to express to the public that you can do something really new and unprecedented by taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . For that matter , we still have ideas that can be expressed on Nintendo 3DS , so please look forward to them . <p> Miyamoto : I actually want to ask you a question : How did you like the new Skyward Sword when you controlled Link with the MotionPlus ? How did you feel that ? That 's the kind of thing we wanted you to feel , some unprecedented feeling of moving your body to control Link . <p> Wired : The point when it struck me how much I liked it had nothing to do with swordplay and everything to do with bug-catching . When I was creeping up on a bug and holding my hand up , very slowly , subtly ... and realizing that I ca n't just go like this and he 's going to catch it , that I had to move the net so it swept over the bug ... Swordfighting was good but the moment it clicked for me was catching the bug . <p> Miyamoto : That 's something you can not enjoy , you can not experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction available at the arcade game center . That 's the kind of thing we really want to do all the time : You can do this only on this occasion . <p> Wired : The Wii MotionPlus controller will go on even with the Wii U. It still connects to Wii U and you can still do games . Are you planning on making games for Wii U that extensively uses , one player games that use the MotionPlus controller versus the tablet ? <p> Miyamoto : Of course , I 'm not in a position to be able to say a lot about Wii U today . But Wii U is going to be the successor machine for the Wii , so of course , those controllers including the Wii MotionPlus shall be used for Wii as well . <p> Wired : You do n't have to say anything , but I did want to say if we 're talking about this that the best thing I played at E3 on on Wii U was called " Measure Up , " where the game said , draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablet . And I realized you ca n't do this on any other game system , and I realized how much fun it was , and my girlfriend destroyed me at it . She completely ruined me at this game . She 'd just be like , bam , and it would be perfect . And my circle would n't even look like a circle . I know that game was n't pushed very hard at E3 but that was the demo I played were I was , I really like this . <p> Miyamoto : After all , that can demonstrate the fact that interactive entertainment has much greater potential than we might be imagining today . The fact of the matter is , we 've been utilizing in this industry just a fraction of the possibility or working on a tiny portion of the possibility in order to inflate that as much as possible . <p> But when we look at things more calmly , there 's got to be a lot more things we can do : There are some computer devices and they can recognize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , and they 're going to give us reactions and feedback . Measuring a length is just one thing . If it 's going to be interesting , it has just that kind of small possibility , a big potential to be expanded into something really fun . After all , whenever we are trying to make a new interface , we are looking to that : How can we make it so we can expand a new horizon in terms of interactive entertainment ? <p> Wired : I ca n't get over the fact that you said earlier , I 'm getting older . And I 'm thinking , jeez . Are you going to retire anytime soon , or is that off the table ? <p> Miyamoto : The fact of the matter is that , inside our office , I 've been recently declaring , I 'm going to retire , I 'm going to retire . I 'm repeating that message . But the reason why I 'm stressing that is that unless I say that I 'm retiring , I can not nurture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my position as it is , then there 's always kind of a relationship . And the young guys are always in kind of a situation where they have to listen to my ideas . But I need some people who are growing up much more than today . <p> And then , when I say I 'm retiring I 'm not saying that I 'm going to retire from game development altogether . What I mean by retiring is , retiring from my current position and then what I really want to do is be in the forefront of game development once again myself . Probably working on a smaller project with even younger developers . Or I might be interested in making something that I can make myself , by myself . Something really small . <p> Wired : Do you have a plan as to when you 're going to do this , or is this off in the future ? <p> Miyamoto : This year , I have worked on , as you know , many projects and I think that I was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position to be able to take a little step back from the position that I 'm taking right now . Hopefully I 'll be able to work on something myself more deeply starting from next year and hopefully we 'll be able to show something next year . In other words , I 'm not intending to start from things that require a five-year development time . <p> Wired : Was n't the joke back in the day after you made Super Mario Bros. 3 , " we 're never doing another one of these , " and then after Super Mario World , " we 're never doing another one of these ! " Have the long development cycles finally caught up to you ? <p> Miyamoto : Anyway , I 'm interested in doing a variety of many other things . <p> Wired : I see . <p> Miyamoto : I 'm saying this because I have a solid reaction from the teams , the existing teams . I was able to nurture the developers inside Nintendo who were able to create something like this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skyward Sword signs in the room by now . <p> Wired : It seems like that 's been your idea for a long time -- you did n't have to make Aonuma-san the producer of the Zelda series way back in 2002 , 2003 , you could have kept doing it on your own but it seems like you wanted to make sure people were progressing and were ready to take these things over .

Laurila himself had headed up Nokia 's research team in Japan for several years . Nokia had been experimenting with motion-sensitive joypads for gaming for years , in much the same manner as Nintendo 's Wii , but the company never got anything into the market . <p> Enter FlagHunt , TrezrHunt and Bjong , all of which are variations on the same idea -- getting you to run around outside while staring intently at a mobile phone . <p> FlagHunt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two , handed a basic mobile phone with GPS , and led by a commander sitting at a laptop . The objective it to collect flags , which can only be seen by the commanders -- who need to direct three members of a team to the same location to capture it , using instructions sent to a special app on the phone . You can block out those directions from your opponent 's phone temporarily , however , by throwing a trap at them . At the end of the game , the team that 's captured the most flags wins . <p> Trezrhunt is similar , but you 're on your own against one to five other people . A series of treasures are hidden around an area ranging between 100 and 1,000 metres square , which you need to find with just the aid of your iPhone . Finding a treasure nets you points , but those can also be stolen by bumping into a white ghost on your travels . If you bump into a red ghost , the game ends entirely . Happily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts in their tracks , and earn some bonus points too . At the end , whoever has the most points wins . <p> Bjong , on the other hand , is designed to be played solo . Like Pong , balls are hurled at you and you need to move left and right to bounce them back upward again . Apples drop too , which gain you extra points if you catch them -- which all takes place in a space that can be as small as five metres across . Laurila excitedly told Wired.co.uk : " You can play this game in a bus stop ! " The field follows you , but remains the same width , so you can keep the same game going between bus stops if you want to . It 's available now in the above app stores . <p> Next year , TAZ will be launching a pair of new games -- Actiontrack and Combatzone . The former is an Amazing-Race-style game , where you have to visit certain points and accomplish tasks there . The latter is a wargames title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have everything ranging from knives to air support , " says Laurila . Expect those to land in early 2012 . <p> So far the company has limited itself to Finland , but starting in the new year TAZ will be making an assault on international markets , beginning with Denmark and Britain . <p> Profits in 2011 , Laurilla claims , have been double what the company budgeted for , so if that success can be repeated internationally , expect to see hordes of people running around a nearby park , staring intently at their mobile phones . The question is , would that be any different from today ? <p> Updated 0741 15/12/2011 : A previous version of this story suggested that Kari Laurila 's surname was spelt Lavrila , and that the company is based in Helsinki . Neither are true , and we 've fixed the errors in the story above .

The coastal fringes of Essex -- where I went the other day on a tour of local churches , inspired by the excellent new AA illustrated book Exploring Britain 's Churches and Chapels , and guided most expertly by the architectural historian James Bettley -- are something else again , a kind of island within an island , seemingly marooned in a long gone era ( the 1950s ? ) as well as a strange liminal place . <p> Coastal Essex has some of the oldest and oddest churches in Britain .

Catholics , who form the religious majority in Australia and Canada , may well not wish to re-enshrine an anti-Catholic measure . Members of other faiths may well feel that the " in communion " rule still excludes them from wearing the Crown . <p> Back in England , atheists could protest that they will remain the victims of a state religion . North of the border , Scottish Nationalists , observing that the reforms require amendment to the Act of Union , could take the legislative chance to widen the argument about being part of the United Kingdom at all . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : this act of modernising is not , in the way it is being conducted , very modern . It is being put together semi-secretly , and our Government will not disclose the legal advice it is receiving . It is also , in spirit , imperialist : the British Government decides , and then tries to push all the " lesser " countries into agreeing . <p> When the reforms do eventually reach the 16 parliaments , the government line will be that this has all been agreed and so legislators should just nod it through . The Queen may be embarrassed , but since , constitutionally , she can act only on the advice of her ministers , she will be powerless . At this point , any self-respecting Member of Parliament would be entitled to say : " Wait a minute ! You are trying to change the rules by which our head of state is chosen and controlled . Is this good for her and her heirs ? Is it good for our country ? I am going to ask some difficult questions . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir to the throne does marry a Catholic , which , under the new rules , he/she will be permitted to do . Suppose that they have a child .

" Are you asking me , " the doubting MP might inquire , " to vote for a reform which could precipitate a **28;611;TOOLONG crisis ? " <p> If , on the other hand , the law were changed to permit a Catholic to come to the throne , there would be a lot more questions . What would happen to the monarch 's headship of the Church of England ? How would he/she be crowned ?

How can you defend any hereditary system once you get really modern ? <p> With monarchy , you should agree the rules and stick to them . Not for nothing is the original act of 1701 called the Act of Settlement . It does n't much matter what the rules are -- elective , first-born , male line only , religious choice , lottery -- but they must be settled . When they are not , the personal principle which is the focus of unity becomes the point of dispute . Some people think that A should be King ( or Queen ) and others think it should be B. This is why it was so mischievous -- in the furore after the death of Diana , Princess of Wales -- to quarrel about whether Charles or William should succeed to the throne .

@@4473240 <h> Roger McGough tells of his mission to end the Poetry Society 's turmoil <p> New presidents always give off a bit of a glow , and Roger McGough is no exception . After months of civil war at the Poetry Society , marked by mass resignations and counter-resignations , the soft-spoken Liverpudlian versifier has been asked to spread a little sunshine into the organisation 's corridors . <p> He has been offered , and has this week accepted , the Poetry Society presidency , in which capacity he is charged with promoting a new era of reconciliation , in which bards bury the hatchet and return to spilling ink , rather than blood . This outbreak of mild-manneredness comes not before time , either ; McGough 's assumption of the presidency comes at the end of a catastrophic , six-month-long power struggle , in which one faction seemed to form around the organisation 's director Judith Palmer , and the other around Fiona Sampson , the editor of the society 's magazine Poetry Review . <p> First , Palmer resigned in May , followed by two fellow-members of staff , plus the president , Jo Shapcott . So seismic was the upheaval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for July . <p> Then in August , Palmer was reinstated , following a petition from more than 1,000 poets , including laureate Carol Ann Duffy . At which point , three vice-presidents , plus three trustees , promptly tendered their resignations in protest . " People I respect , and people I am close to , took both sides of the argument , " sighs McGough , spreading out on the sofa at his home in south-west London . " It was a very difficult time indeed , for all concerned . " <p> Absolutely , and no one likes to see sensitive creative souls engaged in painful , internecine struggle . But whose side was he on ? <h> Related Articles <p> " Ah , " he smiles , in a friendly , **28;409;TOOLONG voice , " I took care not to place myself either in Judith 's or Fiona 's corner .

And so it proves here . <p> " I was actually rather disappointed to find there was n't a uniform that went with the presidency , " he confides , with a twinkle in the eye . " And that it would n't entitle me to stash away lots of money in offshore accounts . <p> " But seriously , though , if you wonder why people asked me to do the job , the answer , is I 'm the soft option . The people 's choice , if you like . " <p> And you can see wherein lies the breadth of his appeal . While on the one hand , he is clad in a rather bohemian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , he walks with ramrod-straight back and almost military purpose . <p> Meanwhile , as listeners to his Radio Four programme Poetry Please know all too well , he carries his Liverpudlian accent very lightly : less heavy-duty Scouser , more mellow Mersey . In the same way , his poems deal both with old age and junior school , both with the frivolous minutiae of life and with love , loss and mortality . He 's not just your Everyman , he 's your Everypoet . <p> It was n't always so . When the young McGough ( he 's 74 now ) came to prominence , having made a name for himself with the Sixties pop group The Scaffold ( top 10 hits Lily The Pink , Thank You Very Much ) , he was not exactly clasped to the bosom of the poetry establishment . <p> " I came across the attitude , ' You ca n't be a proper poet , you 're from Liverpool ' . Or ' You ca n't be a proper poet , you write poems for children ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you were in a pop group ' . I think where I was different is that , unlike a lot of established members of the Poetry Society , I had n't grown up wanting to be a poet . It was more that I started writing poetry at the age of 18 or 19 , and , by virtue of writing poetry , became a poet . <p> " I remember being on a BBC2 programme , in which Auberon Waugh had brought out a book of what was termed ' real poetry ' -- you know , really serious stuff -- and I said that , in my opinion , the definition of a real poet was someone who writes poetry . Well , he went quite bananas about this , and , according to his daughter Daisy , he was so furious he threw a chair at me . To be honest , I do n't remember the chair -- but he was certainly angry enough to have thrown one . Of course , that kind of attitude was quite widespread . At one point , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in magazines , listing the poets they thought were Division One standard , and those who were in Divisions Two and Three . I think I was regularly in Division Three . It was done in a sort of jokey way , but with a certain , unmistakable Oxbridge glee . " <p> So if the qualification for being a poet is to have experienced suffering , then McGough has passed that test with flying colours . And although he 's well known for being a dab hand with the whimsy ( this is the man who rhymed " Gielgud " with feelgood ) , his poems have the capacity not just to tickle the reader 's fancy , but to whack them in the solar plexus . <p> When asked to nail his colours to the mast , he does admit that he prefers poems -- both his own and other people 's -- to be accessible . " From my own point of view , yes , I prefer poems that I do n't have difficulty understanding . That said , there 's always other types of poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Which brings us back to his earlier message of peace , love and understanding between all quill-pushers . <p> " Looking back on what happened at the Poetry Society , my conclusion is that this was a work environment where mistakes were made .

Since then , he has been chairman , manager and investor for a variety of European tech and consumer businesses . <p> Meanwhile , some " 40-year-old marketing directors " were offended . ( For the record , I 'm 40 too -- it 's about attitude , not age ) , but a surprising number admitted they were struggling . <p> A recent IBM survey of 1700 chief marketing officers ( CMOs ) around the world suggests I was on to something : <p> Social media was found to be the second biggest challenge for today 's CMO . But what struck me more , was that this was second to the challenges posed by " data explosion " . <p> The term " Big Data " has been part of the tech industry 's lexicon for some time and its use has certainly ballooned in 2011 . In 1953 the entire contents of the digital space totalled about 53kb ( most emails you 'll send today are bigger ) . Today Twitter alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rise of social networks , RFID data tags , e-commerce and so on has meant that the amount of data available to anyone with a PC ( or even a smartphone ) is colossal . The man responsible for a significant contributor to the data explosion , Mark Zuckerberg , suggested that people will double the amount of information they share online each year . This was coined " Zuckerberg 's Law " . <p> Why is data such a challenge ? There 's too much of it , so what should you look at ? <p> Let 's say you 're the marketing director of a consumer goods company . You know how many visited your website yesterday . You know how many people talked about your brand on Facebook or Twitter . You know which products were bought at what price , through what sales channel , and at what discount . You know who has called your call centre , and about what . You have demographic data . You 've segmented your customer base into groups of customer that think or behave differently . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You get a lot of this information every week , or even every day . <p> I once worked at such a company . It had a weekly reporting pack for consisting of over 80 pages of data . ( As an aside , there seems to be a widespread condition in which the amount of analysis being applied to a problem is in inverse proportion to the amount of common sense that gets used -- " Dormandy 's Law " , a subject for another blog perhaps ) . <p> The single most important job of the chief marketing officer ( CMO ) is being able to make sense of this information , to identify what is relevant , and to drive the agenda of the business around those things . If your CMO finds this a challenge , then you 've got the wrong CMO . <p> Even once what 's important is clear , you are still faced with how to measure it . The mere fact that you can measure something , or divide one number by another , or report on something regularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Say you decide average customer spend is important . It 's no use knowing your average customer spends ? 10 a week with you if , in fact , you 've got 100,000 people spending virtually nothing , and 1,000 very valuable customers spending ? 1,000 each . This is what actually happens in gaming companies . As a CMO or Marketing Director you had better understand this detail -- exactly what to measure and how to measure it . The most important question is : what do you do about it ? <p> We are paid to get things done . The final challenge for senior marketers is how to go from a huge amount of information , to an organisation that understands and measures the important things , to people turning up on Monday morning to deliver things that make a difference . <p> This is a challenge , and managing it takes a particular mindset .

Those who use data intelligently can use networks like Facebook and Twitter to acquire more customers more cheaply , and sell more relevant products . Netflix is using the customer data it collects to commission original shows , rather than just buy the latest series off the HBO production line . Mobile companies are saving a fortune by reducing commissions for customers who always hunt the best deal , and instead are spending it on loyal customers who cost them far less . <p> The really good news is that managing all this information will require skills that are in short supply .

Founder Kathleen Alder attunes us to the agency 's steps to refresh the image of classical music , its social media campaign for Kings ... <p> Written by : Laura Monks <p> Date : 20/12/2011 <p> WildKat PR covers all things cultural , with a strong focus on classical music and contemporary performing arts . Founder Kathleen Alder attunes us to the agency 's steps to refresh the image of classical music , its social media campaign for Kings Place Festival , and her long list of dream clients . <h> About the agency <p> What industry sectors does WildKat PR specialise in ? We work primarily in the cultural industry but we have particular passion for classical music and contemporary performing arts -- everyone in the team has had a very musical upbringing . We work with clients such as Southbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels and orchestras . <p> What is special about the agency 's approach to PR ? The classical music world is often limited to its little bubble of ' go-to ' publications -- our aim is to deliver campaigns that reach out to wider journalistic areas , from travel and lifestyle press to technology publications , education , etc . We try , too , to help artists develop all the tools they need to market themselves and we have links with a lot of other agencies such as design companies , website designers , photographers , videographers and directors , etc . In short , we are n't solely focused on press relations , but on enabling our clients to communicate directly with their audiences as well as taking inspiration from the way businesses and corporations brand themselves , applying it to cultural organisations and individuals . <p> What steps is the agency taking to refresh the image of classical music ? We 're really keen on using online tools to draw in a new audience and have run a number of interactive campaigns using social networking platforms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also try to encourage our clients to think about themselves as a brand , with key messages and targets . We see our role as being a supportive one , helping clients create the tools they need to communicate these messages with their audience . So we advise on everything from image to online presence and corporate sponsorship . <p> How do you ensure your clients get the right coverage in the press ? Our first step is always to sit down with the client to talk about what their key messages or targets are and how to communicate this effectively . We like to explore a client 's personality and interests to discover what makes them relevant and sell-able to different audiences -- what might interest a BBC Radio 3 listener wo n't necessarily appeal to a reader of Grazia magazine , so it is about tailoring our campaign to these different audiences . <h> About clients <p> Can you list some of your most well-known , or respected clients ? We 've worked with an amazing mix of artists and organisations , from venues such as Southbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place Festival and Wimbledon Music Festival to soloists and ensembles such as opera star Luca Pisaroni , conductor Lionel Bringuier and the Belcea String Quartet , as well as the label ACCENTUS Music . <p> Tell us about one of your clients you are working with at the moment . What campaign do you have planned ? Our recent work with the four day Kings Place Festival saw a wide range of coverage from previews and reviews in national press and special interest music publications to lifestyle , travel and family magazines , as well as features on national radio including a slot on Women 's Hour and BBC Radio 3 's In Tune programme . <p> To support the press campaign we launched the King of Kings Place competition -- we teamed up with Foursquare to create six locations which were hidden around the venue . Visitors were encouraged to check in at all six to win prizes , and we ran a simultaneous offline version of the competition for visitors to collect stamps from the locations . The winner received a season pass to everything taking place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 entries across the on and offline channels with a hugely positive response from people who had discovered something they did n't previously know about Kings Place . It 's great when a client gives you the freedom to experiment with new medias and exciting campaigns . <p> Do you target social media often in your campaigns ? Do you find it a useful tool , or is traditional PR more effective ? Always - though we like to be quite specific with what sites we use for which client . A lot of people in the culture sector seem to have the attitude that you can set up a Facebook and Twitter account , leave it alone , and in a month you 'll have thousands of fans -- obviously that 's not the case . We do n't manage Twitter accounts for individuals -- from experience , without the personal touch , these accounts fail . This is often different for an organisation , but we always encourage the client to take an active role in their social networking . We ensure we create unique content across all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , or giveaways via Twitter , so people feel encouraged to follow more than one channel . <p> Is there a potential client you 'd love to work for ? I know one of my staff would say the amazing mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato . Personally , I 'd love to work with the conductor Gustavo Dudamel -- I worked with him in Venezuela before I set up WildKat PR and he is such a fantastic person and musician . There is always a long list of dream clients , and in future we would like to collaborate more with brands and commercial PR agencies to integrate cultural campaigns into their work . <h> About journalists <p> What can you offer to journalists seeking a story on one of your clients ? We make sure journalists receive relevant information in a reasonable timeframe for their deadlines . Particularly within the music press , we have worked with journalists on a number of occasions , so we make sure we work closely with them to find the right story or angle . In short , we try to make writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right information , on time , with no waffle or pointless pitches , and of course we invite journalists to events , send products when relevant , etc . <p> How do you build and maintain strong relationships with journalists ? We make sure we do n't waste journalists ' time by pitching them something that they would n't be interested in -- it is our job then to find the story with each client that is newsworthy in the press ' eyes . We try to provide as much information as possible to save the journalist time , especially when they are working to a tight deadline . We are very lucky , too , to be able to meet with a number of journalists in the industry at concerts and events so we are constantly keeping in touch on the phone , via email and in person . <p> In your experience , do you think the relationship between journalists and PRs is always harmonious , or is it more of a love-hate affair ? I think , on the whole , journalists and PRs get along well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be realistic and fair in order to maintain a good working relationship . <p> How do you think the PR/journalist dynamic will change in the future ? I think it is very interesting to see how it is changing with the development of social networking . Not only is it a new channel on which we can communicate with journalists but , increasingly , artists are able to communicate directly with the press , so we are starting to see a big part of the role of a PR becoming advisory , making sure this direct communication is effective . I think now we are seeing more artists writing blogs or offering a commentary on the industry , rather than a question and answer format which can sometimes be restrictive . <h> About you <p> How useful do you find social media ? I use it ever day without fail . Facebook for personal use only ( though we do have a company page ) , but Twitter and LinkedIn professionally . I use Twitter in particular to find and share stories which I am interested in and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend networking events ? If so , which are you attending soon ? I think almost every event is an opportunity to network . Every concert I attend there is always someone interesting to meet -- the next event I am going to is hosted by Tony Hall and the Royal Ballet at Royal Opera House is organised by a great organisation called Young People in the Arts . <p> Additionally I am a member of the Hospital Club , the Sandbox Network and others which keep me in the loop in both the cultural and commercial sectors . <p> Name three guests you 'd invite to a dinner party and why ... Caitlin Moran - she is hilarious , witty and outrageous ; I think you need one of those guests at every party . Malcolm Gladwell - I think he is a brilliant writer and personality .

His cabinet member for the environment , Cllr Shahed Ali , has been running a company that owes the taxman a great deal of money . <p> Companies House records show that Cllr Ali was company secretary and a director of a firm called Last Viceroy of British India Ltd . The company , which was based at the same address as a restaurant of the same name in Frinton-on-Sea , Essex , never filed any accounts . But on 7 October 2009 its directors placed it in voluntary liquidation and in August 2010 they dissolved it . <p> Almost the sole creditors were HM Revenue and Customs . The insolvency documents show that they are owed ? 16,000 in unpaid VAT and ? 9,000 in unpaid income tax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay this bill : the company was wound up without assets of any kind .

It is now run by a company called Dinebest -- which , surely by complete coincidence , popped up at just about the same time that the Last Viceroy of India company was placed into voluntary liquidation .

@@4477239 <h> Gears of War 3 : RAAM 's Shadow Review <p> The first bit of campaign DLC for Epic 's epicGears of War 3 is titled RAAM 's Shadow . Of course , the Gears diehards will remember General RAAM as the big , ugly guy from the very first game who was Queen Myrrah 's ( the head of the locusts ) right-hand man ; her go-to-guy if you will . <p> In RAAM 's Shadow , you take on the role of Michael Barrick in Zeta squad , Emergence Day has just happened and you and your merry bunch of COGs must evacuate the city known as Ilima before the eventual kryllstorm from the locusts . On top of that , players get to take control of the uber-locust , RAAM , himself . A prequel to the events of Gears of War 1 and something that all lancer-loving , Cliffy B enthusiasts would enjoy I 'm sure , but it 's not all plain sailing . <p> Firstly , there are 4 characters within Zeta squad , as per the normal Gears squad rules , and most have been seen before in some shape or form . The main protagonist Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gears of War 2 , Lieutenant Minh Young Kim was in the original game and Alicia Valera is a new addition to the Gears of War mythology . It 's safe to say that over 3 entire games we grew close to Delta and the personalities within it , so it 's hard for the player to have that same emotional attachment with the soldiers in Zeta . At the beginning of the game there is no real introduction as to who these people are , nor is there any reference to their past , you 're simply expected to know them . Now , if you 've played the other Gears games , which , if you 're playing this , Epic assume you have , you 'll know Tai and Kim , but the others will go over your head and with Barrick being the one you control , that connection is lost unless you 've read the comics . He does smoke a cigar while on the battlefield though , that does give him some points . Barrick plays the Marcus Fenix role pretty well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of Fenix-Light . Tai is the same spiritual being as he was in the second instalment and Kim upholds his straight-laced , by-the-book demeanour . Valera however is a very interchangeable female that seemed like an opportunity for Epic to just include a lady COG . All in all , the characters are nothing to shout from the rooftops about . <p> However , the main reason people come to this party is to get down with the big , burly kryll-master ; General RAAM . It 's just a pity that this party is rather bland . RAAM was the ultimate badass from the original Gears of War and arguably the second most memorable villain in the Gears mythology . But playing as the general is terribly boring , and that goes for all of the elite locusts you can play as in those segments in co-op . At first , it 's cool , just going through the streets and becoming the powerhouse is a joy as you blow through barricades , COGs and whatever else comes your way . After a while though , it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less indestructible , there is no challenge when playing through his sections and it becomes more like a chore to repeat certain patterns in those bits . RAAM is also limited in what he can do . He ca n't sprint ( aside from this charge attack ) , ca n't go into cover and only has a few moves ; he can attack with his knife and can command kryll to tear COG soldiers up . That 's probably his only redeeming feature , the kryll . The kryll act as your weapon as you direct them to fly toward a soldier and tear them to pieces , but , similar to the initial reaction of just being RAAM , this wears thin as it becomes a fool-proof method for destruction . It 's a shame that those sections of the gameplay are n't much fun as this is the main selling point for the entire DLC . <p> Certain inconsistencies are annoying too . As this is a prequel to the first game , you would be expecting either the same arsenal from Gears of War or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience that more realistic feel , chronologically . Sadly , it 's not the case as firearms such as the sawed-off shotgun , one-shot and retro lancer ( which were first seen in Gears of War 3 ) show up . Going by Gears ' own lore , the retro lancer was n't used post Emergence Day . This goes with some enemies that did n't appear until later games in the series too . <p> The gameplay is still right on the money though , when you assume the lancer of Michael Barrick . It is just more Gears and that is n't a bad thing at all . The traditional gameplay sections of the game still feel as tight as ever and are reassuring , as Gears of War 3 is probably the best third person shooter out there . The environments are a throwback to Gears 1 with the more industrial looking aesthetic in the city of Ilima . The score also remains one of the best out there with its tension building pieces and the voice acting is pretty on point too ; look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about Zeta . <p> Not only do you get the campaign , which is meaty enough in its ( approximately ) 3 hour playtime , but there are a few other nice little additions in the RAAM 's Shadow package . There are six additional multiplayer skins , one new weapon skin and ( for all the achievement fans out there ) 250G worth of points for you to add to your Gamerscore . Four player co-op also returns , thankfully , and you can play the content in arcade mode . <p> VERDICT : Gears of War 3 was one of the best games of 2011 , no doubt , and Gears of War is one of the best gaming series of all time , I also think it 's safe to say , but , at the end of the day , RAAM 's Shadow does n't pack the punch that it promises . The characters of Zeta squad are , for the most part , bland and playing as RAAM gets pretty boring quickly . However , Gears fans will enjoy it because , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4479240 <h> Popular Festivals <p> Can there be any other band that would try and pull off something as wildly ambitious as there own version of a Christmas pantomime ( or Phantomime , if you want to get it right ) , and involve some of the best live bands in the city , national radio DJs and a mega talented arts collective ? Ok , maybe there are some that would attempt it , but there are none that could pull it off with such warped style and bravado as The Phantom Band . <p> Clash turns up unfashionably late due to shite public transport , but we 're immediately struck by what 's happened to the venue , which is usually a cavernous cave with walls of bare concrete . The entire place is decked out like a Victorian theatre , courtesy of Glasgow arts collective 85A . Onstage are Jacob Yates and The Pearly Gate Lock Pickers , dressed mostly as ghoulish police officers , and playing a kind of gothic rockabilly that resonates with the crowd . They finish with a garish tribute to the area of Glasgow known as ' Maryhill ' , and make us curse our own late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And just like a real pantomime , we even manage to get hit right in the eye socket by a flying boiled sweet . <p> With the zombie caretaker on high , shaking his fist and abusing the crowd with dark insults , the compere appears as the master of ceremonies , taking the insults up a notch and welcoming the chorus of mock hatred from the cheap seats as he introduces us to the fabulously named Take A Worm For a Walk Week . If Fucked Up had grown up reading the Viz , and had somehow acquired a dry , twisted sense of humour as well as their distortion pedals , it might somehow sound vaguely like these Glasgow stalwarts , who have already gained an enviable reputation thanks to their unforgiving and often hilarious live shows . <p> After a brief interval , the evil half-man/half bastard rabbit compere returns to the stage ( who knew it was BBC Radio DJ Vic Galloway ? ) , then thanks everyone who helped make the event happen , before introducing ' this next bunch of utter cunts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom Band . <p> Quite simply , The Phantom Band are nutty geniuses , unafraid to shift and twist from song to song , forever surprising and always delighting the listener with their gift for melody and imagination . Their difficult-for-some second album , The Wants , is a thing of beauty , a Scottish masterpiece that should , and does , sit beside all of the great and influential records that this country 's surprisingly healthy alternative music scene has ever produced . <p> Onstage , they are a juggernaut of aural delight , a dark and beautiful wall of noise that is punctuated by feverous electronics and twinkling percussion ; beguiling , hypnotic and downright thrilling . Shamefully , this is the first time I 've seen them live , and thankfully , they are as good as I wanted them to be . A brilliant live band . <p> And as a special Christmas present for all of you lovely people , let us end on another performance by Glasgow 's very own purveyors of ... oh , I du n no ... let your own ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
