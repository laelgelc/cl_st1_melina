On the other hand , the perfect slicked hair or that raised chic bun can take the same outfit to the next level , letting you outshine your competition ! But to impress with your tresses , one must not only learn to tie it right , but to nurture it , care for it , tame it when needed , and use all the hacks available to us busy women of today . Read on for our life hacks for the days that we just do not have time to indulge the innate love for our hair , and then some ideas for the days that we do have time to glam up the silken locks . After all , each day has its own potential . <p> When it comes to hair care , you are probably bombarded with a variety of different , and quite often , contradicting advice . Whether to oil your hair , or try the new hair mask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or opt for a hair spa ; it seems like almost everyone -- from your best friend to your mum -- has an opinion when it comes to your tresses . You wish you could just ask your hairdresser for an honest opinion but if you are not into hair salon small talks , Star Lifestyle has you covered ! <p> DOES MY DIET AFFECT MY HAIR ? <p> Yes , definitely ! In fact , while addressing any hair problem , the first thing you should check is the diet . Your hair cells are one of the fastest growing ones , but are also the first ones to be affected when you do not eat right . If your comb is getting fatter and fatter with hair strands , then perhaps it is due to lack of iron and protein in your diet . <p> Alternatively , excessive vitamin A can also lead to hair loss . Opt for plenty of leafy vegetables , fish and beans to get your iron fix . For protein , go for cheese , milk , lentils , and yoghurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shampoos help the shampoo mix with water so that when you massage it into your hair , the shampoo can clean the dirt off your hair and scalp . While safe to use in small concentration , frequent use of it can cause cell damage by stripping away the hair of natural essential oils and hair proteins . As a result , you might be more prone to split ends and hair damage . Sulphate-free shampoos , on the other hand , are milder , although they may not give the pronounced ' clean ' feel your usual shampoo does . Sulphate-free shampoos can retain moisture better , and so , if you are a victim of frizzy or dry hair , this is your go-to product ! <p> COLOURING ... YAY OR NAY ? <p> This depends entirely on your taste and your hair texture . Avoid colouring if you have dry hair , as dyeing tends to drain out the hair more . If you do get that gorgeous shade of brown or red , make sure you change your shampoo and conditioner to colour-friendly ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only halfway through all the winter wedding invites ! <p> If bleaching and colouring seems too harsh , you could just opt for a natural lightener to add a bit of shine to your hair . Try squeezing lemon into your hair or making a honey paste for this subtle effect . <p> WHAT HAIR OIL SHOULD I GO FOR ? <p> Oils provide hair with the necessary minerals and nutrients , and thus is an integral part of your hair care routine . However , picking one that seems to work for your hair texture can be quite daunting . <p> For starters , coconut oil can be used to protect your hair from sun damage , dandruff , and to boost hair growth . If you can not stand the coconut smell , almond oil might be your answer . Packed with antioxidants , vitamin E , and protein , almond oil also boosts up hair growth and reduce breakage .

A hydrating cream in the morning could end up feeling like a curse by mid-day when the makeup wears off because of the shine , which can give grease a run for its money . <p> For girls like us , it is very important to follow a set routine , summer or winter .

" <p> Mr Loke added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other former colonies that ultimately sent international investors packing . His government recognised history for what it was , and had no desire to rewrite the past by renaming streets or removing monuments . <p> " Hence , it is odd that Singapore should now be so reticent about celebrating its bicentennial . " <p> A post-colonial funk ? <p> I agree . It does strike me as strange indeed that more than 50 years after Independence , some Singaporeans might now find themselves in a belated post-colonial funk . <p> One would have thought that the Republic 's success over the past five decades -- with even today 's British leaders extolling its economic transformation as a model for their country , post-Brexit -- would have imbued Singaporeans , especially younger ones , with a greater sense of their promise and potential , rendering any lingering colonial hang-ups as pointless as it is passe . <p> To those who still harbour doubts , I would offer the wise words of Eleanor Roosevelt , the former American First Lady , who once said , eloquently : " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So , to my mind , Singaporeans need not be angst-ridden about marking the Bicentennial , as if doing so implies revelling in the past subjugation of their forebears . Rather than hailing its colonial masters , the whole point of the exercise , it seems to me , is for people to draw the right lessons from the past 200 years , to help set them up for the future . <p> To do so requires an appreciation of what transpired in 1819 and the years thereafter . A gripping account of this is found in the book Singapore 1819 : A Living Legacy , by sociologist Kennie Ting , who is the director of the Asian Civilisations Museum . " Singapore 's success lay , in the very beginning in Raffles ' shrewd strategy to declare it a free port , " he notes . <p> The approach at the time , taken by the Dutch and others , was to restrict trade strictly to vessels from their country , or to slap punitive tariffs on others for the privilege of selling their goods in local markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went the other way , he adds , noting : " Raffles waived customs and other duties for any trading vessels wishing to trade in Singapore . <p> " The principle was freedom to trade : any vessel from anywhere in the world , should have equal opportunity to trade their wares within the confines of this particular harbour , as long as there was a market for their goods . This laissez faire approach gave Singapore a huge competitive edge almost immediately , as it became the cheapest port to dock at overnight . <p> " Word spread and within three years , Singapore had begun to corner the market , with all manner of trading vessels -- European ships , Chinese junks and Malay boats -- particularly from Malacca -- eager to dock and trade their wares in its port ... " <p> Ting continues : " On 12th January 1823 , just before he left Singapore for the last time , Raffles wrote : ' The progress of my new settlement is in every way most satisfactory ... Every day brings us new settlers , and Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are springing up in every direction , and the inland forests are fast giving way before the industrious cultivator . I am now engaged in marking out the towns and roads , and in establishing laws and regulations for the protection of person and property . We have no less than nine mercantile houses ( European ) and there is abundant employment for capital as fast as it accumulates ' . " <p> Barely five years after 1819 , Singapore had become home to 10,683 residents : 4,580 Malays , 3,317 Chinese , 1,925 Bugis , 756 from India , 74 Europeans , 16 Armenians and 15 Arabs . By the turn of the century , the population would swell further to about 300,000 , as more immigrants made their way here , seeking a better future for themselves and their families . <p> Personally , I ca n't help but be grateful it all happened this way , for otherwise , my father 's Indian ancestors would probably not have ventured to this island , nor my mother 's from the Netherlands , and their offspring born here would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniquely Singaporean " children , including me . This is very much a part of the Singapore story for many Singaporeans today . <p> So , for me , the lessons to be drawn from the bicentennial events seem to be these . First and foremost , it reminds us all how Singapore 's fortunes have ebbed and flowed through the ages , with prosperity and success neither pre-ordained nor naturally enduring . <p> Second , the critical importance of Singapore being connected with , and staying open to , the world , trading freely in goods , capital , people and ideas . Our commitment to welcoming people and talent from everywhere , affording them opportunities to seek their fortunes here , helped set the stage for the multi-racial and meritocratic society that Mr Lee and the pioneer generation of leaders , together with their supporters , helped forge over the years . <p> Thirdly , whether intended or otherwise , the British left Singapore a few precious gifts -- the rule of law , sound systems of civil administrations and governance , and most importantly , the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disparate peoples who came here into one united people , more so and more quickly than anyone imagined possible , while also enabling us to plug and play in today 's modern world . <p> Thankfully , our founding fathers had the good sense to make use of these assets , rather than spurn them in a fit of post-colonial petulance and pique ; we , the beneficiaries , should strive to be no less wise . <p> As I see it , no Singaporean today needs or wants to glorify the country 's colonial past . But nor do we need a puerile pretence of rejecting what we inherited , if only to prove our commitment to this fledgling Republic we call our own . Far better for us to look back with equanimity , and draw the right lessons from the past , so that we are better able to chart our way forward .

@@30503231 <h> The over-use of NIDs in Bangladesh <p> Recently , the policymakers have circulated the idea of the compulsory use of national identity card ( NIDs ) for purchasing something as simple as railway tickets . Their intended objective is to discourage price scalping of the railway tickets . How the measure would be contributing to the end is unsure , in the end , railway ticket scalpers are not aliens and they can use NID cards of their own and their near and dear ones for their trade . Indeed , while price scalping is perhaps only one of the reasons of the artificial crisis of railway tickets , reserved tickets for the very important persons ( VIP ) must also have contributed to the tickets disappearing beyond the means of many ordinary citizens of this country . During the periods of high demand or the tickets such as air-conditioned berths which are in higher demand , the excesses of VIP tickets are well-documented . <p> The mandatory use of NIDs for things to do with the government or obtaining government services has become so widespread that one may be excused to call it obsessive . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying for a passport , because of the significant risk such as terrorist financing or other perennial interests being involved , the rationale behind this is convincing . However , the list of matters regarding which NID is compulsory is so long that the proper question is which those rare cases are where you can obtain a governmental service without your NID . Now with its smart version being available for many citizens , the National Election Commission is planning for its more widespread use . With the expanding list of things for which NID is needed in this country , as ludicrous as it may sound , in the near future retailers may ask for NID cards for using their loyalty cards . <p> We should perhaps look back and remember that NID in this country was introduced as a tool for voter identification during local and national elections . Then its extension as a tool for curbing terrorist and criminal activities by impersonation is perhaps warranted and , at worst , a necessary evil which many of us may be prepared to accept like air travellers in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stripping . But beyond these peripheries , the more we promote the use , and more authorities get involved with it , the bigger would be the potential abuse and the bigger concerns citizens may and should have . <p> Sociologists may be far better placed to say this but dare I say the addiction towards the compulsory use of NIDs may have something to do with our penchant for bureaucracy and papers . Very rarely our public officials are happy with fewer papers . It seems like that the more paper people have to submit to the authorities , the more important the concerned authority becomes . The bundle of papers submitted gives the authority to whom they are submitted a nice way to feel soaked up in work and important and may be an excuse to prolong the work . Even many of us who have to submit those bundle of papers often not holding any grudge may be a colonial legacy , after all , our forefathers had to be attuned to the bureaucracy of the colonial masters and their servants . <p> In many countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in this country . Even in many countries , something like a prepaid mobile SIM card , often perceived as being linked to national security , can be purchased without the need for any identity card whatsoever . That does not in itself mean that we need to follow their example , but it may give a clue that the administration of many countries is aware of the potential abuse of personal information containing papers . <p> It is disconcerting that the incidence of abuse of NIDs such as a single NID card being used for more than 1000 mobile registrations ( of course in that era when the fingerprint was not needed ) does not seem to make our policymakers appreciate the serious potential of abuse of NIDs . Our policymakers should appreciate that the more widespread the use of something like NID containing personal information makes it more prone to use . Like many other things in life , this is probably a fitting case where the less is more .

@@30537238 <h> Venezuelan crisis is more than just a domestic issue <p> Those who follow global events could not have failed to notice the tragic spectacle unfolding in Venezuela . The Latin American country has been riven by an internal political turmoil recently . The ruling President Nicolas Maduro 's hold on power has been in serious peril . A big segment of Venezuelan people has waged a street movement and are demanding that he resigns and cede power to the leader of the opposition , Juan Guaido . Maduro runs a socialist regime inherited from his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez . <p> Maduro has his bastion of support . He has so far been able to preserve the loyalty of the armed forces by bribing them with oil money , though the oil revenue has alarmingly plummeted recently . The Trump administration in the US has taken a rabidly hostile approach to Madura and is doing everything possible to undo him . <p> The recently employed US sanction has put a sever squeeze on the Maduro regime . Venezuela is critically dependent on US refineries for processing its high sulphur crude . This type of crude can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the job but then the shipping cost becomes exorbitant . <p> A complex pathology of factors has cumulatively brought Venezuela to a dire state in recent years .

On February 5 , there was a gut-wrenching footage shown on BBC television of a young boy in his teens searching for crumbs of food to survive . <p> The country 's economy , ruined by more than two decades of economic mismanagement has been the main driver of the current crisis . As the rising public discontent over his policies and the economic woes inflicted on the people began to threaten his survival in office , Maduro has used Venezuela 's oil money to bribe the armed forces and buy their support . He also has some public support but the agitation against him appears to be of greater size and fury . Recognising the gravity of the situation , he has proposed a negotiated solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this initiative is serious or a tactical ploy to defuse the crisis is not clear . <p> It is a familiar fact of global politics that when a serious problem develops in its neighbourhood , a big power , let alone a superpower , will not watch passively .

It has been wary about such regimes aligning themselves with powers in adversarial relations with US . Venezuela 's main patrons are Russia and China . Those who have historical memories will know that in Venezuela , there are reverberations of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis that had brought America and USSR to the brink of a nuclear war and apocalypse . With a leader of Trump 's mercurial temperament , the portents are ominous . The Trump administration has affirmed that military options are not off the table . To back his warning the US has amassed 5,000 of its troops in Colombia . <p> It will be helpful to briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearer perspective on the present crisis . <p> Venezuela enjoyed democratic politics for about over three decades from 1958 . When the two parties that alternated in power , the Democratic Action Party and COPEI , lost popularity and Venezuela suffered economic decline with inflation surging over 30 percent . A socialist government led by the charismatic Hugo Chavez came to power . His ascent to power came on the wave of a popular movement in 1998 . He mobilised support on a platform that promised to cure many of the country 's problems and eliminate term limits for all elected offices . Chavez could now seek re-election . His United Socialist Party won over half the seats in parliament . After his death from cancer on March 5 , 2014 , his prot ? g ?

He has portrayed himself as an admirer of and sought close relations with America . " The US is so much bigger than Trump , so much bigger ' , he said . <p> It would seem that in Latin America , Maduro 's position is weak . Fourteen Lima group nations have recognised Guaido along with Canada and EU nations like France , Germany , Britain and Spain . Their stance is clearly based on their assessment that Maduro is ruining the economy , misgoverning , defying majority sentiment , inflicting suffering on people and is bent on clinging to power at any cost . <p> Madura issued a threat that Guaido will be imprisoned .

@@30555238 <h> Ridesharing roundups <p> With the increasing number of vehicles on the congested streets of Dhaka , getting from one point to another has become quite the struggle . In this scenario , mobile ridesharing apps have gained massive popularity over the last three years , especially amongst students and the working class . These apps include the ever popular Uber and Pathao , as well as Obhai , Lily , Shohoz and so on . These apps not only provide quick and efficient transportation ( cars , micro-buses , motorbikes , CNGs etc. ) , but are also quite affordable . A few of these services also cater to women exclusively , so that they can feel safer and more comfortable during their journeys . <p> In March 2015 , Pathao was launched in Dhaka , focusing on the requirements of the locals that require a quick ride from one point to the other . According to users , the Pathao app is comparatively more user friendly , and offers a range of promo codes , which cut downs on travelling fares . Users have the added benefit of deciding between motorbikes and cars , depending on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking between male and female riders . After each journey , the users are able to rate their journey with a rating system that determines the quality of the drivers and riders in the service , but it does not allow any additional comments that might add further insight to how the riders are working . Being a local business , Pathao also allows users to pay via bKash , along with other local digital payment methods . <p> In 2016 , Uber launched in Dhaka with the intention of providing city dwellers with more options for convenient travelling . This app not only provides the usual assortment of motorbikes and cars , but also has vehicles that are suitable for a maximum of 6 passengers to travel comfortably . Similar to Pathao , this international franchise provides promo codes which cut down on the fare , but does not have options for local payment methods like bKash , and nor do they have a local customer service centre . However , in case of reviewing the trips , users have the added benefit of making additional comments , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users claim that the Uber app is not as user friendly as that of Pathao 's , and requires a little bit of tinkering . In America , Uber also provides a food delivery service , Uber Eats , which is not available in Bangladesh yet . Pathao easily gets the upper hand here , with their food delivery and courier services . Both apps have the added feature of " location sharing " that enables the user to share their real-time location with a trusted contact of their choosing . All in all , these two services are saving people more time , money and energy , along with making commuting in the city more convenient and secure . <p> In 2018 , Obhai launched it business , and unlike their Pathao and Uber counterparts , had a separate venture aimed squarely at the security and comfort of women during their commutes with their side project called Obon . The overcrowded local buses in the busy streets of Dhaka can become quite rowdy and too hectic for female passengers . Not only that , but some women do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obon , a motorbike service , was created to address these issues with their female riders . Other than that , Obhai also allows its users to book rides even when they can not access the app by contacting their call centre . The company provides CNGs and 10-seater air conditioned micro buses , along with cars and motorbikes . If Obon is not to your liking , no need to fret as there are other options for women as well , such as Lily , which ensures that their female riders are well trained and undergo proper training to handle their vehicles safely . Lily is only focused on female commuters rather than target both genders . This business is more concentrated in areas like Gulshan , Banani and Motijheel official areas , and provide working women with convenient transportation during the rush hour , operating between 7AM-8PM . The women-only bike sharing service is the first in Bangladesh to ensure the safety and comfort of women by eliminating the unease that some face while travelling with men .

It was launched back in July , 2018 , initially targeting private university students . Shuttle is yet to launch a mobile app , but the service allows female students to book a seat in an all-women vehicle through their hotlines ( open between 6AM and 9PM daily ) or registration booths ( located in university campuses ) , with each bus operating between 6:30AM-7:30PM . The service has verified and trained drivers and trip managers , who overlook every ride , making sure the bus reaches its destination on time safely . University students claim that this service is more dependable due to the presence of the trip managers , as they are constantly aware of the route and keep the passengers updated . Parents are also more comfortable letting their daughters travel through Shuttle due to these precautionary measures being taken . The fare of each ride is also affordable for university students . <p> Shohoz , which has been around since 2014 , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature in their app that would allow users to call and directly communicate with motorbikes and car drivers in the city . The website was initially used to purchase bus tickets online , and later expanded its services to providing ridesharing , and ticketing service , not just for buses , but also launches , various events and even movies , along with a food delivery service . The app-based firm emphasises customer loyalty , and tries providing additional services such as , clean application interface and an active customer care service . Also , to keep the riders incentivised , the company provides them with added benefits , maintains a cordial relationship with each rider , and pays their dues on time . This ensures the riders ' loyalty and dedication to the job , providing a pleasant journey for their customers . Similar to other ridesharing apps , Shohoz also provides its customers with promo codes and coupons , but not as extensively . <p> There 's no denying that ridesharing apps have become more and more attractive and convenient as more and more users get onto their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhaka , but have expanded towards other districts . For instance , Uber has an intercity option which reaches out till Savar and Gazipur , and Pathao covers Sylhet , and all three services ( Uber , Pathao , Obhai ) cover Chittagong . The on-demand services look to save time and money for busy city dwellers by battling the heavy traffic . Each app caters to different categories of people , and even attack social issues such as , unemployment and women empowerment . It can easily be said that these local and international companies are making our daily lives safer and more efficient .

@@30588238 <p> There are some words in the popular lexicon that we hear and read about every day but very few appreciate or understand the depth of these words . " Development " and " poverty " are two good examples . Ask anyone what these words mean to them and the answer you 'll hear will most likely be very simplistic -- for example , development being equated to high GDP growth . I got a similar answer when I asked a friend what his definition of " poverty " was . He said : " Being so poor that they can not afford basic amenities . " <p> These definitions are not completely wrong but they are certainly reductionist . While we may think we " understand " what these words -- which are now commonplace in our academic and political discourse -- mean , very few of us actually do . The definition of both development and poverty has significantly evolved over time as respected economists like Amartya Sen , who were astute enough to see through the earlier parochial views of these concepts , have continued to broaden our understanding of what they entail . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interpretation of these concepts remains one-dimensional . Development is much more than higher GDP growth , and being unable to afford basic amenities is only part of what poverty means . Things like political rights , freedom of speech and social opportunities are essential elements that we unfortunately tend to ignore when we talk about development or poverty . <p> The World Bank , in a recent report , revealed a startling finding . The international organisation found that of the world 's 736 million extreme poor in 2015 , half that population , that is 368 million people , lived in just five countries : India , Nigeria , Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , and Bangladesh . Three percent of the extreme poor population globally were found to be in Bangladesh , i.e. 16.2 million people in the country have a daily income of less than USD 1.90 . <p> This is a prime example of why thinking about development simply in terms of GDP per capita is misleading . Because the fact that Bangladesh , one of the fastest growing economies in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor population almost sounds like a paradox -- except it 's not . When you look at " development " from the perspective of non-monetary aspects such as access to quality education and healthcare , electricity , quality food , clean water and sanitation , and political and other basic freedoms -- all of which are essential to avail economic opportunities and for the realisation of human potential -- the coexistence of GDP growth and extreme poverty does n't seem much like a contradiction . What it does point to , however , is that the conditions necessary for human development of millions of people are sorely missing . It also indicates that there is stark disparity in the distribution of wealth given rising income inequality amidst tremendous growth , and the need to revamp the current development model that is clearly not benefiting everyone . <p> Which means that our fixation with 7-plus GDP growth rates stems from a very narrow outlook of development . Similarly , it is flawed to think about poverty from the standpoint of income alone , which is what we tend to do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The progress we have made in poverty reduction , food security , access to education and healthcare , etc , in the decades since independence is nothing short of remarkable . But it is equally important to acknowledge the fact that we have a long way to go before we can effectively tackle multidimensional poverty which means taking into account education , health and living standards . One of the problems is that we get too bogged down in easy-to-understand " average figures " which only give us a general picture -- essentially masking the harsh realities that many in far-flung places across the country are living in . High average figures relating to " GDP per capita " and " overall access to electricity and education " may sound appealing , but they do n't shed light on striking urban-rural disparities . The likeness for " average figures " is understandable ; the urge to know where one stands with respect to the " average " income or years of schooling is tempting . But average figures do n't always tell the whole story . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that around 90 percent of people in the country now have access to electricity -- a great achievement by all means -- but this hardly tells us anything about access to electricity in rural areas where more than 25 percent of the population still rely on fuelwood and kerosene for energy . Similarly , the fact that we have achieved near universal net primary enrollment with around 98 percent primary-school-aged children enrolled in school does n't reveal much about the quality of education which disproportionately affects children from poverty-stricken families . A USAID-funded study by Save the Children last spring found that 44 percent of students who complete the first grade can not read their first word and 27 percent of third grade students are unable to read with comprehension . Performance in basic English , math and Bangla has been found to be especially weak among poor students . Another example of the problem with an overreliance on average numbers comes to light when you compare per-capita income and income share amongst the population . Whereas our per-capita income rose to USD 1,751 in 2017-18 from USD 1,610 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent fell from 0.78 percent ( in 2010 ) to 0.23 percent ( in 2016 ) of overall income with the richest five percent 's share going up to 27.89 percent from 24.61 percent during the same time period ( BBS ) . So while the " average " individual income may paint a rosy picture , concentration of income at the top tells a different story . <p> Beyond changing our outlook towards poverty and development , there is no alternative to increasing investment in education and health -- which has shrunk as a share of our national budget and is now among the lowest in South Asia . And while social safety net programmes -- a hallmark of the Bangladesh government 's strategy to alleviate poverty -- have led to increased school enrolment and attendance , especially among girls in secondary schools , employment generation , provision of food during crisis , etc. , studies have shown that poor targeting , inefficiency and leakage lead to these programmes never reaching many of the non-poor . In 2010 , for instance , only a third of eligible beneficiaries participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , 60 percent were non-poor . The involvement of some 20 ministries means that there is duplication between programme objectives and beneficiaries . While there is no denying that social safety net programmes have transformed countless lives , we need to do a better job of reaching more of the extreme poor who are currently left out . <p> But even achieving all of the above wo n't be enough if we fail to address the weaknesses of our public institutions which are paralysed because of extreme politicisation and a lack of transparency and accountability . Even if the poor somehow successfully escape the vicious trap of poverty , we can hardly expect them to go up the ladder of social mobility without a fair marketplace where meritocracy -- and not political affiliation or " connections " -- is valued . <p> Nahela Nowshin is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star . <h> Follow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions , commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals .

After having a detail and in-depth analysis on 35,000 corporations publicly listed in the US , they found that presently almost one-tenth of all public companies fail each year , a fourfold increase since 1965 . The " five-year exit risk " for public companies traded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 5 percent 50 years ago . <p> Undoubtedly , in today 's world there are more risks enterprises have to deal with for their survival . It 's a long list that includes constant regulatory changes , technology shift in an unprecedented supersonic speed , fierce competition , rising pressure on environmental factors , volatile climatic condition , ethical challenges and sometimes even the unseen hackers ! This scary situation naturally begs the question - what is the way out for the businesses ? Management gurus and successful companies came up with the answer popularly known as " ERM " -- an acronym for Enterprise Risk Management . <p> ERM is a business process led by senior leadership through which enterprises : <p> o Identify all potential risks ; <p> o Assess the impact of risks to the operations and overall objectives ; <p> The process starts with identifying the potential risks associated with the business . Once the relevant risks are identified , the next step is to assess the impact of the risks . There are certain categories of risks which are very common in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or services . While there are other risks which can be categorised as rare , like natural calamities such as earthquake . Risks are also classified based on the severity or damage they do to the businesses . A 2X2 matrix is used to categorise the risks : <p> After assessing the risks , the next step would be to devise the ways and means to address those . An effective tool known as ATRR ( short form of Avoid , Transfer , Reduce and Retain ) is used to manage the risks . For the risks falling in the quadrant labelled as " 1 " in the figure above can be retained , meaning these are low category risks and organisations can live with those . Risks falling in the box labelled as " 2 " can be avoided if certain measures are taken . The risks placed in the box denoted as " 3 " can be transferred to others . The quadrant labelled as " 4 " refers to the risks which can be reduced if organisations take some precautions . <p> To explain the ATRR technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are certain risks which can be avoided , say a company is penalised by the local authority if the necessary licences like trade , tax and VAT licence are not renewed on time . This risk can easily be avoided by renewing those documents timely . There are certain risks which are unforeseen and beyond enterprises ' control like earthquakes . In such case businesses can have insurance coverage to transfer the risks to the insurance company . Sometimes a company faces the risk of losing talents . This type of risk can be reduced by having employee-friendly policies like better compensation , clear career growth plan for the talents , and conducive working environments . There are certain risks which businesses have to accept and face as and when they occur . An example can be unethical practices of employees . If an enterprise follows the rules and regulations strictly and has a healthy culture of ethics , it does not have to worry too much about this category of infrequent risk . <p> There are instances when despite having a risk management practice in place , enterprises suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reputed auto makers , had to pay more than $2.6 billion as penalties and settlements to federal law suits over defective ignition switches in its vehicles .

Red flags were raised over and over , however , no action was taken . By the time the company reacted in 2014 , it was already too late ! <p> This was a clear case of not paying enough attention to the risk management processes .

@@30663231 <h> The water business in the south west of Bangladesh <p> I am very thankful to this story as it is for me , for the people of Satkhira , Khulna and many remote villages in these districts . Water here indeed is very expensive . Compared to the luxury that we get in Dhaka and other cities where we have access to all purpose water for only BDT 400 a month , here a family has to pay almost BDT 600 taka just to ensure potable water.If families do not have the luxury of paying this , they then have to walk for miles in search of it . Women and girls especially are the worst victims as they are responsible for this backbreaking task . The government of Bangladesh has done brilliantly in ensuring water for millions across the country for free or minimal charge , but people in our districts are not enjoying these services even though we are equal taxpayers . Why should n't we get these services ? I have been working on this issue for the last four years and will continue to fight for the water rights of the marginalised communities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory from a time in the past <h> They say , rereading a beloved childhood book , much later in your life , helps you rediscover yourself . The day afterpoet Al Mahmud 's death , I reopened one of his poetry books , Pakhir Kachhe , Phooler Kachhe , the only collection of the poet I have ever read and owned . <p> My copy of this book is almost 25 years old . I looked for it in my shelf , not because I wanted to revisit those " good old days " , nor because I wanted to recapture memories of my mother reading it to her daughters . <p> Maybe curiosity was reason enough for my wanting to go back to those pages . I was keen to figure out why I still remember those verses of Nolok or Jhaler Pitha and why the book had such an impact on me . With so much attention on his other poetry collections like Sonali Kabin and Kaler Kolosh , I feel his children literature somehow fell through the cracks . <p> I decided to reread this book , one that has been tucked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it deserves , through the eyes of my adult self . <p> And it was indeed a mini celebration . <p> The copy that I have is a first edition , published in 1980 by Bangladesh Shishu Academy . Back then , it cost Tk 6 . Yes , you read it right -- 16 poems with full page illustrations at Tk 6 . The book was a hand-me-down from my sister , and long before we could learn to read it , my mother used to read it to us . Now , looking back , considering how sophisticated the language was , and how complex some of the poems ' content , I feel the book was meant for slightly older children . Nonetheless , the musicality of Mahmud 's words would keep us hooked , without us getting lost in the plot . <p> With themes like nature and history , social justice and identity , love and imagination , this book displays Al Mahmud 's mastery : the ability to convey a complex message in a language that is pleasing to young ears . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a poem about someone who keeps on daydreaming while her parents force her to concentrate on her studies -- was my mantra to live by . Back in those days , when we kids were repeatedly reminded that our flights of imagination would n't take us anywhere , his words made my periodic trips to la-la land , a justified affair . Instead of frowning upon children for spacing out , Al Mahmud encouraged the little minds to take off to their own world ! <p> If you are already an admirer of Al Mahmud 's poetic narration of rural landscapes , this book will confirm what you already know . With Al Mahmud , I learnt to talk to birds and trees , rivers and mountains . I was perhaps ridiculed for being absent minded , but the seven-year-old me had the courage of my convictions , and funnily enough , these poems were to blame for fostering in me the faith that it was okay to allow my head to float in the clouds . <p> In this book , Mahmud also looked at national moments from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsurge of 1969 -- and communicated those big ideas to young readers , using simple , accessible words . Long before we studied these movements in our textbooks , Al Mahmud 's sloganish phrases in the poem , Unoshotturer Chhora:1 -- Truck truck truck/ Shuyormukho truck ashbe/Duyor bedhe rakh ! -- would fire up our young minds and pique our curiosity . They sparked conversation in our home , with our parents and with each other . We would ponder : what is a curfew ? Who is Asad ? Who is Motiur ? Which side should we be on ? Who won , who lost ? These poems made us realise that history matters , allowing and encouraging us to identify with our history , politics and culture . <p> A strong sense of justice pervades Al Mahmud 's poems . While in Boshekh ( the first Bengali month of summer ) , he is furious that people who are already less fortunate pay with their lives when the storm comes , in another poem , with no title , he expresses the plight of hundreds of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In Hashir Baksho , Monpoboner Nao , or Jhaler Pitha , Al Mahmud does not just mention class and inequality -- he encourages children to learn and respect social justice and diversity . He does so , without reservations that children might be unable to grasp the complexity of such issues . Through these poems he taught his young readers that not all children had the same privileges in life . His poems are an attempt to foster compassion in children , in small daily doses . <p> Beside the poetry , what sets this book apart , for me , is the beautifully crafted illustrations by Artist Hashem Khan . A doodle-y imperfect font with just the right amount of ornamentation on the bright orange cover made it one of my absolute favourites . <p> As I flipped through the book , along with Hashem Khan 's enchanting , stylised full-page line drawings and water colours , I discovered how I , too , unleashed my creative potential to the fullest . I found the Piccasso in little me using the poetry book more like a colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making my own customised edition . <p> Al Mahmud 's poetry and Hashem Khan 's illustration balance each other , without taking anything away , allowing for the magic to be felt and read -- loud and clear . What 's particularly special about this book is that it boldly slips strong messages into children 's literature and provides plenty of conversation starters for a child and her parents . I would still like to call him one of my childhood favourites -- for all of these beautiful memories that he gave me through this book , and also for all those magical adventures he took me on . 
@@30663233 <h> Chobi Mela X : 2 decades of " persistence " <p> 20 years of anything is a rather big affair . The 10th edition of Chobi Mela has just wrapped up . Here I look to the people who put it together year after year , and the matters that pushed its presence among us through the crevices of this gridlocked city . Bangladesh is a spectacle of interest in global affairs : be it for the incumbent government 's liking for neoliberal modernisation and its distaste for opposing views , for the tensions in the country 's labour market , or for the crises of climate , environment and refugees . And while many gazes peek at us , here 's a deliberate arrangement of visualisations for the world to see . A deliberate exercise of agency ( /agencies ) by artists , curators , and thinkers to reexamine what we choose to see and to what end . <p> Courtesy : Archives Of Persistence <p> 2 . <p> Right off the bat , there are things about this edition of CM that one can not ignore . <p> On August 5 , 2018 , Shahidul Alam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " spreading disinformation and inciting violence " , as Gowher Rizvi stated recently . Alam was imprisoned for 107 days before being granted bail , and the charges filed against him under Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) Act still stand . His arrest took place in the midst of the preparations for CMX . The team was uncertain whether the festival would still take place at the proposed timeline . After his release , CM was announced to open on February 28 , postponed from the original dates only by a few weeks . The Ministry of Cultural Affairs was not officially announced as a patron this time ; Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy , the country 's national centre for the arts and culture , was not one of the venues , as it had been previously . Given the press for time and budget , all the venues were kept within Dhanmondi , and Old Town was no longer engaged in the programme . Less than 24 hours before Arundhati Roy 's scheduled talk for the fest , the organisers were forced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having attained due permissions . <p> It only makes sense that James Estrin 's piece for The New York Times ' Lens quotes Alam calling CMX " an act of defiance , an act of resistance . " <p> However , Tanzim Wahab , one of the curators of CMX , is quick to remind me that the third edition of CM was centred on the theme " Resistance " , and that this is not new to CM . <p> Courtesy : Archives Of Persistence <p> " I would rather replace the word ' resistance ' with ' persistence , ' " he says . He borrows the word from the Archives of Persistence presented in this edition , in which four different projects on the conflicts of Palestine , Kashmir , Myanmar , and Bangladesh 's RMG workers are brought together for a " conversation around the agency of photographs . " <p> Sarker Protick , another curator for the event , reminds me that it was decided while Alam was still in jail that CMX would still take place , " just as Drik and Pathshala kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about a single person ; the story is about a single person shaping a community so that it continues when the person is absent , " says Wahab . <p> The curators , who are both notable alumni of Pathshala , also emphasise their need to persist because they do not see themselves in a position where they can refuse to engage with the state . The institute 's undergraduate and post-graduate programmes are now affiliated with the University of Dhaka , and as we sit in the under-construction building for this conversation , Wahab is " critically hopeful " for what is to come for the community . <p> Photo : Sebi Berens / DRIK <p> 3 . <p> Naeem Mohaiemen 's project " What was Chobi Mela and what happens next " was one of the exhibits set up at Gyantapas Abdur Razzaq Bidyapeeth this time . A linear timeline of CM over the decades , it starts from 1989 , when Shahidul Alam set up Drik Picture Library . He has been vocal over the years about the need to recentre the " object 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographer in opening conversations about agency . Much of that politics has driven Alam 's work from the early years . Pathshala South Asian Media Institute was established for photography and digital media , and a school is perhaps the prime breeding ground that one build in a lifetime for generations to be reoriented . <p> But his work can not simply be his own when it has been about the politics of people and nurtured by a sense of community . Over the next three decades , we see how numerous other events enter into dialogues with his initiatives from different directions . The internet was launched and digitisation rapidly made its way into our sociocultural spheres ; initiatives of contemporary arts were set up in the region by various schools and corporations . And what Drik-Pathshala-Alam set out to do could no longer be kept confined within their own practices , as the community 's orientations found many currents to flow with . Mohaiemen 's CM timeline acknowledges these developments over the years . After all , CM is not just an isolated staging that takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Photo : Toukir Ahmed Tanvee / Drik <p> Over the years , the idea of the chobi has been de-and-re-constructed by the festival . What we see is not so much about the stillness of what was captured in a frame anymore ; it is also about how that frame can move within and out of us , as new media and curatorial methodologies arise . <p> This phenomenon has had many trajectories that Mohaiemen 's project can not possibly encompass . But when CMX opened on February 28 , it was hot news for recent events surrounding Alam . In the heat of the current political climate and the urgency with which CMX was pulled together after Alam 's release , the dramatics surrounding it has a lot to do about what is happening ' now ' . <p> Photo : Sebi Berens / Drik <p> 4 . <p> To many , CMX looks like it has been ' scaled down ' from what Estrin once also called " perhaps the world 's most demographically inclusive festival . " The festival may have ' shrunk ' within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions with works from 44 artists spanning 21 countries , 13 new fellows sprawled across two entire basement storeys , a record number of guest curators , and new additions of film screenings and curated projections . <p> This edition deals with the struggles of historical rhetorics in a world where wars and conflicts are affairs of global politics . Works such as those of Omar Imam , Issa Touma , Gauri Gill , and the " Archives of Persistence " all deal with conflicts that are not necessarily " recent " events , but are instrumental in how histories are told today and by whom . Mustafa Zaman 's work reflects on " a moment for truth to arrive " , and Arundhati Roy managed to still speak to an audience packed in 7,580 sq . ft. of floor space about the rage and dissent of the people for their rivers and valleys . So many references to " truth-telling " , at a time when Alam just filed his petition to challenge the state 's case against him for spreading " disinformation .

Otherwise we have to pay for the price of silence . This might be one of the very few places that tries to negotiate with silence , and see how can you still be vocal and relevant , " says Wahab . <p> I am taken back to the story Alam once told me about the first edition of CM in 2000 , when the headlining exhibition had to be moved from Shilpakala to Drik because of only one photograph of Rashid Talukder 's showing the Kaderia Bahini guerillas bayoneting a collaborator in Paltan. 10 editions later , CM still holds on to the same spirit -- to push through constraints on expression -- because these challenges are not new to it . <p> And so , we have 20 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maliha Mohsin is an independent writer , researcher and community organiser based

@@30663236 <h> The election at midnight <h> The long awaited DUCSU elections concluded on March 11 amidst repeated demands of re-election from almost all quarters . A series of dramatic events rocked Dhaka University on March 11 and 12 , which significantly tainted the credibility of the newly formed DUCSU and , indeed , the esteemed institution 's democratic nature . There is no doubt that this election of DUCSU will play a decisive role in shaping Bangladesh 's political future -- be it positively or negatively . In case you missed the details of what happened , here 's a run down of the major events of the day(s) . <h> A night of suspicion and excitement <p> 00 hours , March 11 , 2019 . Students in 20 residential halls of Dhaka University were having a sleepless night preparing for the DUCSU elections . The style of preparation was different in different halls . For instance , the students of Bangladesh-Kuwait Friendship Hall ( BKFH ) were preparing breakfast for their roommates so that they could reach the polling centre early in the morning . In the dormitories for male students , on the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the halls and the students had been summoned to the guest room of the hall by the Bangladesh Chhatra League ( BCL ) leaders . They were given final instructions about their duties during the elections ( between 8am and 2pm ) -- to guard the polling centres and maintain " order " in the queue . <p> The students became suspicious about the elections from the early hours of March 11 . Students of BKFH reported that they noticed some hall officials carrying heavy trunks and storing them in office rooms and hall union rooms . According to students , when they asked the officials what was inside the trunks , the latter replied , " official documents and the Holy Quran , " and refused to talk about it further . <h> An eerie start <p> From 7am , students in all halls started to gather in front of the hall union rooms , which had been set up as makeshift polling centres . However , signs of irregularities became apparent from the very start of voting . Journalists were barred from entering the hall premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of using transparent ballot boxes , as had been demanded by student organisations , the DU administration decided to use steel ballot boxes at the last moment . Students alleged that , on several occasions , hall provosts refused to show empty ballot boxes to students prior to voting , which aroused suspicion that the ballot boxes were stuffed . There was no provision for inking the voters after their votes were cast , making it impossible to identify who had already voted and who had not . Non-resident students , who constitute a sizeable proportion of the voters , were restricted from entering the hall premises by BCL cadres . Many of them alleged that they could not enter the campus even after showing ID cards and pay-in slips . However , BCL cadres from Dhaka College were seen roaming the DU campus and patrolling the polling centres . <h> Girls raised the alarm <p> Several incidents occurred between 9 and 11am at BKFH and Ruqayyah Hall that decisively changed the outcome of the election .

Agitated students broke the trunk and seized the ballot papers . According to the students , nine ballot boxes were designated for the hall , but only six were brought to the polling centres . <p> Although provost of BKFH , Professor Shabnam Jahan , was relieved from her position after the discovery of the sealed ballots , the DU administration termed the Ruqayyah Hall incident as " snatching away of ballot papers by students " . <p> Professor Farhana Ferdousi , returning officer of the hall , claimed that 2,607 ballot papers were snatched away by the students .

Liton Nandi , another VP candidate from the leftist panel , was assaulted by BCL cadres while he was visiting a polling centre at Mohsin Hall . Five of his followers were also injured during the attack . All of them needed treatment at the university 's medical centre .

In retaliation , students also chased several BCL cadres and found out that they were not students of DU . Infuriated students handed the outsiders over to the proctorial team after beating them up .

They kept the VC 's office and residence surrounded till 1pm on March 12 and rocked the campus with processions after processions calling the elections " a sham " and chanting slogans that they were boycotting . However , at 1pm , Golam Rabbani , who had been " elected " as the GS of DUCSU , told media that BCL did not want re-election in the hall unions where it achieved landslide victories , but wanted re-election only for the VP post .

@@30803239 <h> When disaster strikes <p> On April 24 , 2013 , Rana Plaza , an eight-storied commercial building , collapsed in Savar . On May 13 , 21 days after the incident , the search for the dead ended with the death toll of 1,134 . Approximately 2,515 injured people were rescued from the building . It is considered to be the deadliest garment-factory accident in history . <p> According to the BGMEA , at the time of the collapse , five garment factories were in operation in the Rana Plaza building . A total of 2,760 workers were deployed in five factories of the building , while the numbers are 3,900 as per reports by other sources . This year marks six years of the Rana Plaza disaster . <p> Curious minds want to know what steps Bangladesh has taken to avoid such disasters . <p> Worker safety left hanging <p> The reaction to Rana Plaza forced brands and retailers to act .

Facing the threat of being cut off by Western buyers , thousands of factory owners have invested in fire doors , sprinkler systems , electrical upgrades , and stronger foundations . Major life-threatening concerns remain outstanding in too many factories , and need to be updated . <p> Why the building collapsed <p> After the Rana Plaza collapse , a former chief engineer of RAJUK said the owner had not received proper clearance for the building , and that an extra three floors were added illegally . <p> The other reasons for the collapse include conversion of the building from commercial use to industrial use , where heavy machineries were placed on upper floors .

Initiatives should be taken to demolish old and highly risky buildings as a first step towards minimizing casualties in such natural disasters , followed by their retrofitting to make the vulnerable buildings earthquake-tolerant .

@@30851239 <h> Smart priorities for the new government 's first budget <p> Since 2015 , Copenhagen Consensus and BRAC have collaborated on Bangladesh Priorities to create a bridge between policy and research . This is driven by the belief that , with limited resources and time , it is crucial that decisions are informed by what will do the most good for each taka spent . <p> More than 1,100 pages of new research were written for Bangladesh Priorities by economists from Bangladesh , the region and the world , identifying the costs and benefits of 76 policy interventions under the 7th Plan . This research shows exactly how much each option costs all of society , and exactly what we get in return . <p> The benefit-cost analysis was widely acclaimed by economists , highly appreciated by the government , and is contributing directly to new plans and policies . <p> In the Bangladesh Priorities 2.0 ( 2018-2019 ) research exercise , we have gone much further and deeper in analysing four interventions from those 76 policy options : e-Government Procurement ( e-GP ) , e-Mutation or land records digitisation , services through Union Digital Centres ( UDCs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priorities identified among the 76 policy options for Bangladesh by an eminent panel including a Nobel laureate , for having the potential to achieve vast benefits for Bangladesh . <p> The deeper analysis includes a political economy study to reveal the constraints inhibiting scale-up of the four key interventions , which are all priorities of the 7th Plan . <p> Scaling up e-GP would mean better spending of the Tk 72,000 crore that the government spends each year on everything from Padma Bridge to pencils in government offices . <p> At present , the e-GP system has reached 50 percent of its intended usage level and it is generating Tk 400 of benefit for each taka that has been spent so far . The new evidence reveals that if scaled up , e-GP can generate Tk 755 for each taka spent . Such returns are anticipated as a result of increased competition and transparency . <p> Based on these findings , we encourage the government to allocate resources to motivate e-GP use under a whole-of-government approach in the Budget FY2019-20 . Prioritising implementation of the Electronic Contract Management System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivering tendered outputs on time . <p> The Eminent Panel ranked land records digitisation as a high priority because electronic records can make transfers simpler and reduce corruption . Moreover , it increases the security of property rights , which increases investments and will make the economy grow even faster in Bangladesh . <p> The government has made commendable progress towards digitising the mutation or khatiyan records system . It appears there has been an increase in transparency and accountability under e-Mutation as a result of SMS notification and the tracking number , but loopholes still exist . <p> The new evidence shows that at present there is still no positive return from e-Mutation investment . This is because of low utilisation . It is encouraging that the government has committed to implement the e-Mutation system across all upazila offices by June . <p> If e-Mutation is scaled up across all upazila offices , our research suggests a return of Tk 6 for each taka spent . Adding the spill-over effects toward economic growth suggests a phenomenal return of Tk 619 of benefits for every taka spent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upazilas as part of Budget FY2019-20 . This would include development and implementation of the Land Information Service Framework being designed by the Cabinet Division . <p> UDCs are seen as a hallmark achievement of the government 's Digital Bangladesh vision . These one-stop shops are making service delivery processes easier for rural citizens . <p> Our new research evidence reveals that for each taka spent , UDCs are generating two takas of social benefits from delivering three services : online birth registration , exam registration and social safety net programme ( SSNP ) . Scaling up the last of these using the civil registration and vital statistics ( CRVS ) system could increase the social benefits to Tk 3 for every taka spent . <p> Based on this research , we urge the government to consider spending money on behavioural change communication programmes to keep UDC entrepreneurs socially motivated and bureaucrats administratively focused on serving rural citizens . <p> An important point for future analysis is UDC data availability . A Digital Centre Management System ( DCMS ) needs to be made publicly accessible and used for identifying demand-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government drafts the eighth five-year plan . <p> Finally , we have studied the empowerment of village courts . At present , the village court system generates Tk 2 of social benefit for each taka spent , and manages to partly reduce the backlog of cases in district courts . <p> Empowering village courts as a quasi-formal justice system to deal with many more complicated and higher value cases could benefit Bangladesh tremendously . This would generate nearly Tk 19 of benefit for each taka spent because of the far more significant backlog reduction , and because it would make it more convenient for a village-level petitioner to access justice , without having to travel to district courts . <p> UP chairpersons need to carry out electoral duties , hindering performance of village courts . Based on this analysis , we suggest that Budget FY2019-20 prioritises training all UP personnel responsible for village courts and introducing measures that boost performance , such as the transfer of authority to other representatives when the UP chairperson is not available . <p> We hope that , as with past Bangladesh Priorities findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive attention from the newly elected government as it studies its first budget . Each is critical to promoting good governance , economic growth and public welfare , and we commend the Planning Minister for his commitment to scaling up these priorities . <p> In the belief that all of Bangladesh is helped when the policymaking and decision process is more evidence-driven , we will continue to develop the policy-research bridge . <p> Bjorn Lomborg is President of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and Visiting Professor at Copenhagen Business School .

At the pre-tournament captains conference , the India captain continued from that and stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kohli has already termed this as the most challenging World Cup ever and felt the loss against Australia at home has helped his side prepare well for the mega tournament . India were 2-0 up against Australia but ended up losing the next three to concede the series . If a team on a given day , gets together against an experienced side , and believes more that they can win , it can happen , Kohli said on Thursday ( May 23 ) . We learnt a lot from the Australia series . We were 2-0 up and we thought we are going to win one out of three , but they showed more passion , more character and more determination than us . Australia enjoyed every moment which we took a lot of learning from . If you play anyone in the World Cup , you have to have that passion and that commitment . While India and England walk into the tournament as favourites , the challenge posed by Australia , New Zealand and South Africa means all sides feel they are in with a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their strength and weaknesses , could be a deterrent and its crucial his players direct their attention to their own skill set . In the World Cup , you look at the first 4-5 games you play because you are going play nine and its how you prepare . We do nt single out any games because all 10 teams are strong . If we play good cricket we are going to be in a good position . There are too many things to focus on the teams . We want players to focus on their skills , turn up on the day and hopefully have that skill set better than the opposition , he said . India-Pakistan is a very anticipated match but we keep saying that its very different for us from the way the fans look at it . You feel the anticipation of the fans when you enter the ground but as soon as you step on the field , its all professional . Its a bowler trying to execute his skills and a batsman trying to execute his skills to the best of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to win as a team . It brings pressure because the atmosphere is different but you feel it only till you start competing . With high scores in England being a trend , it is believed the teams will breach the above-par score mark quite frequently . Kohli , however , deviated from that judgement and felt scores of 250 will be defended as well . I feel 260-280 is going to be as difficult as to chase 380 . I do nt see high-scoring games in the latter half of the tournament . Youll see 250 defended as well , he said . Not all teams are going to be at the same level . The fact that you are going to get closer to the knockout stage will have an impact as well . Teams would like to start in a balanced way and find their way in the game and then look to capitalise on the moment . I see pressure playing a massive factor in the second half .

And he 's mocked Native American religious claims to sacred sites . <p> Now , he 's free to fulfil the wish list of his former industrial clients . He 's the land bureau 's acting director , just like Cuccinelli at immigration . It 's another Trump tactic to put people in temporary charge of important arms of government , hacks who could never be approved by Congress . In the short term , they do enough damage to satisfy their big-money handlers . <p> Pendley was given this powerful perch by way of executive order orchestrated by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt , a former oil and gas lobbyist who is now doing the work of his ex-clients on the taxpayer 's dime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land -- a sentiment shared by Trump voters .

Privately , her firm helped negotiate a settlement that muffled one of Weinstein 's victims in 2004 , taking a 40% cut .

The initiative aims to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia , Europe and beyond through massive infrastructural spending . <p> However , the initiative has been the subject of controversy in many western capitals , particularly Washington , which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and trap countries into debt through " nontransparent " projects . <p> India did not join the BRI , citing concerns over China 's projects with Pakistan .

That is how an average day starts at the households that still continue the legacy of producing Jamdani saris . <p> " Paach khew jora hoise , teen khew barse " -- the master weaver utters the ' buli ' , an oral tradition that has been handed down from one master to his apprentice for centuries . And this oral instruction is all that there is in creating the mesmerising intricacies that we see in a Jamdani sari . <p> Omar Faruk , who has been in the trade for the last 38 years , knows nothing better than his craft . He grew up watching his father and elder brother work , and that was the foundation for Faruk in becoming a weaver . <p> He also observed his mother and sisters prepare the yarn , process the bobbin , make the reed , and ready the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife and sisters-in-law help in holding to the traditions of the forefathers of this weaver family . <p> Omar Faruk takes pride in the progression of life ; how he started as a ' shagred ' -- an apprentice . As years passed , he honed his skills and with increased dexterity eventually became ' ustad ' -- the master craftsman . <p> Faruk is aware that families like his and others around him are creating one of the most well recognised weaves of the country ; they have learned to value their creation , and recognise Jamdani as a ' heritage weave . ' <p> It was clear that he feels a sense of pride , accountability , and a strange bond -- a feeling that can best be described as magical . <p> " I work every day from dawn till dusk , that too on a single piece of Jamdani , dedicating all my energy to create a masterpiece that reflects my sweat and devotion . Of course , I know this is unique ! Otherwise what is the benefit of all this labour ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonargaon Upazila , 2019 <p> The mesmerising beauty of Bhargaon , a picturesque village in Sonargaon , is obvious to the naked eye . Everywhere you turn around , there 's the unblemished beauty of nature ; the fresh-water ponds ; canals making way to the Shitalakkhya River . <p> Children run around flying hand-made kites , bright against the glaring sun . With a backdrop of stunning beels , dinghies , and the rhythmic sound of the foot pedals -- it almost seems like time had stood still at the quaint village to pay homage to the ' exclusive weave ' taking place . <p> The business of the weave <p> Omar Faruk shifts a little , as if back to the natural world . He squints a bit , noticing us still hovering around expecting a scoop from him . He flinched , " This process will go on for a very long time . You will have to wait months before you get to see it completed , madam , " he said . <p> We realised at that very moment that it was time to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Faruk and his trusted apprentice Noyon Miah , marvelling at the beauty of slow fashion , its intricacies , and uniqueness . <p> A minute later , the ' Mohajon ' ( trader ) Mohammad Abu Salam stepped in the workshop with a warm smile , and we were quick to thank the lucky stars as he opened up and shared the financial aspects of this craft . <p> " The process of creating a Jamdani is very complex , it might seem like the artisans are doing the same thing for an eternity , but the emotions are slightly different for us . When an ' ustad ' gets working on a new Jamdani , he can not think about anything else . <p> He wakes up early in the morning with the designs going through his head ; he begins his day by getting into a meditative state and at the end of the day , when he can not work anymore , he gets up with throbbing fingers and a fatigued body . Yet , the course of the design stays inside his head . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that too only for essentials . The bond that he has with his ' shagred ' , is of paramount importance .

" We are working for a renowned fashion house and their patronage is what keeps us motivated , " he added . <p> We inquired about the wage structure and Abu Salam replied on a positive note -- " For these exclusive pieces we are getting around Tk 400 a day , which is somewhat good for the moment , but it would have been better if we earned at least Tk 600 to Tk 700 every day for the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 for the shagred . " <p> The wage , the weaver confirmed , was sufficient for their livelihood . <p> " We live in our own village , our own house and do n't have to commute anywhere for this profession . This bit of money will assure our children 's future and that 's all we want , " Abu Salam reassured . <p> This revelation was certainly an eye-opener for us . The marvel that is Jamdani is produced by artisans who want nothing but a slight patronage of their craft , and slight increase in their wages , for their immense dedication , and inexplicable hard work . <p> The battle against power looms <p> Abu Salam , who was once a master weaver is now also a ' Mohajon ' , major trader , and cleared for us the apparent clash between handloom and power loom . <p> " A single piece of sari , no matter how plain the motifs , takes at least a week to more than six months to generate .

They realise the difference between an heirloom piece , and a cheap copy . Thanks to all the talk about reviving Jamdani , purists now want to collect original pieces worked-on a traditional pit loom by expert craftsmen , " conveyed Abu Salam . <p> Modern technology vs the ancient set-up <p> Back at the metropolis , we discussed the dilemma between modern technology and heritage weaves with experts on Jamdani at a public seminar arranged by the NCCB and the Bengal Foundation . <p> Prof Ashoke Chaterjee , honourary adviser , Crafts Council India , clarified the situation , " We do not want modern technology , or the likes of power loom to ruin the authenticity of a handloom Jamdani weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperity of the trade , by administering a better work condition , so that the back-breaking task becomes slightly easier and most important of all by providing a link to sophisticated markets at the tip of their index finger via the Internet , " explained the Jamdani expert . <p> The debate of cultural misappropriation <p> Nawshin Khair , managing director , Aranya shared her insights . <p> " For Jamdani to regain its past glory , it must be introduced to the international market , but we must also take into account that a brand house would want to use Jamdani at many different levels , like using it as upholstery , pillow covers , lamp shades , and that maybe termed as cultural misappropriation . <p> The debate still remains , whether we should only use the Jamdani weave on saris and dresses or on everything else , " professed the expert designer . <p> Luva Nahid Chowdhury , director general , Bengal Foundation elaborated further .

" Madam , if you know the history of the Jamdani you 'd definitely want a piece , it 's the same as owning a diamond , gold jewellery , or anything that is extremely valuable .

These are largely on account of the continuous influx of people into the cities , and lack of relative capacity of the urban local bodies in handling migration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance human capital and access to basic services , while rural poverty-based SSNPs may not require this under current coverage . Housing , transportation , and labour market access are the most significant issues in the lives of the urban poor , rather than receiving food or cash via grants . Therefore , these are crucial things to keep in mind in designing effective safety net programmes for the urban poor . <p> Given the urban proliferation with the inadequacy of services provided to the residents , the rapid increase in urban population is bound to place a further strain on infrastructure and services . Strategies such as targeting urban areas based on the profiles and administrative arrangements , involving the city and municipal local bodies , and revised urban social security programmes are ways to potentially address the present chaotic situation and ensure urban social security in light of the global commitment of " leaving no one behind . " <p> The fundamental services , apart from social security , that are most wanted for urban poor and slum dwellers are : affordable housing , provision of potable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical benefits . Urban poverty is not only limited to these wants , but also include cumulative deprivations , where a particular want is a cause of other wants . The magnitude of urban poverty is enormous and multifaceted , which requires customisation of schemes for effective implementation with regard to social security schemes . The government is well aware of these issues and stated in the country 's 7th Five Year Plan that efficient urban development can play a major part in combating national poverty , mainly through ensuring better lives for the poor migrants and creating opportunities for the growth of industrial , commercial , and service activities which can become an engine of growth for the national economy . <p> The government has predominantly emphasised poverty eradication in its 7th Five Year Plan to reduce the upper poverty rate from 24.3 percent in 2016 to 18.6 percent by 2020 . The government is attempting to alleviate poverty by implementing various kinds of SSNPs . The scope and allocation for SSNPs is being extended every year following the life cycle approach of social safety nets , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence , and depth of poverty . The vision of National Social Security Strategy ( NSSS ) is to expand coverage to the residents of urban areas and to the socially excluded people through strengthening the social security system for the urban poor . However , there are equally formidable challenges in financing this strategy , and in overhauling the coordination , implementation , and monitoring systems which are in place . The scaled-up attention to issues of safety nets and social protection is not being driven only by the experts ' search for more effective anti-poverty strategies . It is simultaneously an outcome of the deepening of welfare aspirations of citizens and the pressure on the state to respond to these aspirations that will ensure social security for all including the urban poor . <p> Ashekur Rahman is Head of Poverty and Urbanization in UNDP Bangladesh .

@@51082230 <h> Govt eyes 300MW rooftop solar power <h> Rooftops of factories and public agencies to be used <p> The government is looking to use the rooftops of factories and public agencies to generate about 300MW of clean electricity through solar photovoltaics ( PV ) -- a move that can slash emissions and dependency on fossil fuel . <p> " We are considering rooftops because of scarcity of land suitable for setting up solar power plants to generate renewable energy -- and we have a lot of rooftops , " said Siddique Zobair , member of the Sustainable &amp; Renewable Energy Development Authority ( Sreda ) . <p> The move comes at a time when the government is falling behind its target of generating 10 percent of electricity by renewable energy by 2020 . The share of renewable energy is just 2.83 percent , according to Sreda . <p> Bangladesh 's current power generation capacity is 20,834 MW , with the country remaining heavily dependent on fossil fuels and conventional energy resources to meet its energy demand for a growing economy . <p> To increase generation of renewable energy , the government signed power purchase agreements with 11 private firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , only two have started operations . <p> A lack of availability of suitable land has been blamed the most for the sluggish progress , according to officials . <p> Rooftops of public agencies and plants offer good potential , Zobair said , adding that the Sreda is hoping to generate 300 MW of electricity over the next four years through rooftops . <p> Germany is one of the big proponents of rooftop solar installation . As of September 2018 , total installed capacity of solar systems in Germany is 42,000 MW , of which rooftop solar installation accounts of 71.4 percent . <p> Australia is another leading country in rooftop solar installation . As of June , the contribution of solar rooftop system is about 43 percent of total installation . <p> Using rooftops of factories 1,000 MW of electricity can easily be generated , he said , adding that the state-owned non-bank financial institution was financing projects for rooftop solar PV for 300 MW.Idcol estimates that generation of 300MW of clean energy would reduce 5.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in 20 years . <p> Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started operation , according to Md Enamul Karim Pavel , head of renewable energy of Idcol . <p> Idcol has also approved loan applications for five projects for industrial rooftop solar PV to produce more than 7MW of electricity . <p> Factories setting up rooftop solar PV will be able to consume the generated electricity to meet its own demand and channel the surplus to the national grid , Pavel said . <p> " Stations , junctions and workshops of railway offer great potential , " he said , citing preliminary estimate that 100 MW of renewable energy could be produced by utilising rooftops of railways . <p> Sreda Member Zobair said a meeting took place among top officials of railway ministry , power division and other stakeholders on the issue and the railway ministry suggested piloting rooftop solar PV in two stations . <p> Bangladesh Railway ( BR ) last week requested German state-owned development bank KfW that finances investments for energy efficiency and renewable energy in Bangladesh to run feasibility study for installation of rooftop solar PV on its infrastructure , officials said . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels on rooftops keeping our operation uninterrupted , " said Mofazzal Hossain , rail secretary . <p> He said they asked for Idcol and others for piloting at stations in Gopalganj-Kashiani section to assess the potential of solar electricity . " If the pilot project is successful , we can consider it on a large scale . " <p> BR is a big consumer of electricity and it can install solar panels on its own and can supply additional electricity to the grid . Rooftops of major railway stations and junctions have potential to produce 45 MW of electricity . Workshops and small stations have potential to generate the rest , according to Idcol . It may require investment of Tk 700 crore to install rooftop solar PV at railway and Idcol is keen to provide financing , Pavel said .

@@51139240 <h> Withdraw advance tax on import of raw materials <h> Feed millers demand <p> Start Business Report <p> Feed makers yesterday urged the government to withdraw advance tax on the import of raw materials of feed and machinery of the poultry industry , as the new fiscal measure has increased the cost of their businesses . <p> The industry operators said imports of products related to livestock and fish farming are exempted from customs tariff , duties and taxes . Therefore , the imports of the raw materials of feed should not be subject to advance tax ( AT ) . <p> The National Board of Revenue ( NBR ) introduced 5 percent AT under the Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act 2012 that came into effect on July 1 this year . <p> " There should not be any AT on raw materials of feed as there is no VAT in our sector , " Moshiur Rahman , president of the Bangladesh Poultry Industries Central Council ( BPICC ) , said at a press conference at the National Press Club in Dhaka . <p> The Feed Industries Association of Bangladesh ( FIAB ) organised the briefing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of fish feed from AT . <p> The FIAB said the exemption has been provided only to ingredients of fish meal and the benefit does not cover all the raw materials of poultry and fish feed . <p> So , instead of resolving the problems , the livestock sector faces extra complexity following the issuance of the revised notification on AT , said Md Ahsanuzzaman , general secretary of the FIAB , while reading out the association 's statement at the briefing . <p> Rahman said AT has been exempted on items which are not used by feed millers . They raised their problems with the NBR on several occasions but they have remained unresolved . <p> The prices of feed would increase unless the NBR withdraws the AT , leading to spiral in prices of chicken meat and eggs , one of the key and relatively cheaper sources of protein . <p> Prices of broiler feed already doubled to Tk 43.57 a kg in 2018 from Tk 21 in 2007 , said the FIAB , which represents nearly 60 lakh tonnes annual feed industry in Bangladesh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at source on purchase of maize , rice bran and other ingredients . <p> The NBR levied 2- 5 percent tax at source that feed millers are supposed to deduct during payment to sellers of the ingredients and deposit them to the state coffer later . <p> The FIAB said maize sellers are mainly farmers and it would be a big burden for them if they face the tax deduction at source . <p> The association also urged the government to speed up clearance of imported consignments of feed raw materials , as importers have to wait up to 42 days to have their imported consignments released . <p> Clearance time should not be more than seven days , said the FIAB , adding that they have to bear additional charges for delayed clearance from the Chattogram port . <p> Feed makers also urged the government to allow import of vaccines of avian influenza H9N2 viruses on special consideration ahead of the coming winter . <p> Poultry production has fallen in recent years after it came under attacks of the flu , the association said . <p> Industry operators said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to produce them locally for the last two years , but the approval has not been given yet . <p> The outbreak of the avian influenza usually takes place in winter . So , poultry farmers and entrepreneurs are fearing a massive attack of the disease in the coming winter season , Ahsanuzzaman said . Feed production is expected to double to 60 lakh tonnes in 2019 from 29.7 lakh tonnes in 2015 . The sector caters for the poultry industry , which produces 14.6 lakh tonnes of chicken meat annually , according to the BPICC . <p> At present , more than 200 feed mills are registered and they meet the entire local demand for feed for poultry , aquaculture , and dairy farming , the association said .

" Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server ? Absolutely , no question about that . " Mulvaney continued : " That 's why we held up the money . " Trump 's personal lawyers quickly dissociated themselves from the chief of staff 's comments . <p> Mulvaney 's description of the administration 's handling of the Ukraine aid amounted to a quid pro quo , though he later claimed his comments had been misconstrued . <p> " That 's not what I said , " Mulvaney told " Fox News Sunday " as host Chris Wallace repeatedly confronted him with his own comments . " That 's what people said that I said . " <p> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to defend the comments in an interview Sunday with ABC 's " This Week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to explain what it is he said and what he intended , " Pompeo said . <p> Mulvaney is not aware of any effort to replace him , according to a person close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations . The president has also expressed his support for Mulvaney to the acting chief of staff 's team , the person said . Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Sunday afternoon that Mulvaney still has the confidence of the president . <p> The news conference on Thursday left aides in the West Wing dumbfounded at the former South Carolina congressman 's performance and some quarters of Trump 's orbit -- the Justice Department and Trump 's personal attorney , among them -- dissociating themselves from his account . The president himself , already angry that Republicans were not defending him on Syria and Doral , was also displeased that Mulvaney only made the headlines worse , according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations . <p> Still , a swift dismissal does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outside advisers , who noted the difficulties Trump has faced attracting and retaining high quality White House staff even before the impeachment episode . The shortage of viable replacements has kept other officials in their posts months after he soured on them . <p> Even before Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry , Mulvaney was on thin ice , with diminished status in the White House . Holding the job of acting chief of staff since January , Mulvaney has frustrated aides who saw him as less willing than his predecessors to challenge the president . <p> Once Democrats began investigations meant to remove Trump from office , Mulvaney drew the brunt of criticism from presidential allies who felt the White House was n't prepared to fight back forcefully . <p> He has also clashed with White House counsel Pat Cipollone , sometimes mentioned as a potential Mulvaney successor , over strategy and tactics in response to impeachment . Mulvaney has complained that he had been iced out of the process , which the lawyer was treating as a legal , not political , matter . <p> Trump 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host the G-7 at Doral was the latest move that called into question Mulvaney 's job security . <p> Mulvaney had insisted that White House staff concluded that Doral was " far and away the best physical facility " and tried to push back at concerns raised by Democrats and some Republicans that Trump was using the presidency to enrich himself . <p> Mulvaney said Sunday that Trump was " honestly surprised at the level of pushback " on his choice of Doral . <p> That notion struck some Trump allies as hollow , because the uproar was resounding in August when the president first floated the idea of choosing Doral . They argued that the president 's aides , Mulvaney first among them , either should have persuaded him not to hold it there or devised a better communications strategy . <p> " Could we have put on an excellent G-7 at Doral ? Absolutely , " Mulvaney concluded on Fox . " Will we end up putting on an excellent G-7 someplace else ? Yes we will . " <p> Carlsbad , OCT 21 ( AP/UNB ) -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBD vape they inhaled would help like a gentle medicine . Others puffed it for fun . <p> What the vapors delivered instead was a jolt of synthetic marijuana , and with it an intense high of hallucinations and even seizures . <p> More than 50 people around Salt Lake City had been poisoned by the time the outbreak ended early last year , most by a vape called Yolo ! -- the acronym for " you only live once . " <p> In recent months , hundreds of vape users have developed mysterious lung illnesses , and more than 30 have died . Yolo was different . Users knew immediately something was wrong . <p> Who was responsible for Yolo ? Public health officials and criminal investigators could n't figure that out . Just as it seemed to appear from nowhere , Yolo faded away with little trace . <p> As part of an investigation into the illegal spiking of CBD vapes that are not supposed to have any psychoactive effect at all , The Associated Press sought to understand the story behind Yolo . <p> The trail led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaping habit prompted a career change that took her from Hollywood parties to federal court in Manhattan . <p> When Janell Thompson moved from Utah to the San Diego area in 2010 , the roommate she found online also vaped . Thompson had a background in financial services and the two decided to turn their shared interest into a business , founding an e-cigarette company called Hookahzz . <p> There were early successes . Thompson and her partner handed out Hookahzz products at an Emmy Awards pre-party , and their CBD vapes were included in Oscar nominee gift bags in 2014 . In a video shot at a trade show , an industry insider described the two women as " the divas of CBD . " <p> Indeed , Hookahzz was among the first companies to sell vapes that delivered CBD , as the cannabis extract cannabidiol is known . Now a popular ingredient in products from skin creams to gummy bears , cannabidiol was at that time little known and illegal in some states . <p> The partners started other brands that offered CBD capsules and edibles , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch was that CBD helped treat her dog 's tumors . <p> By autumn 2017 , Thompson and her partner formed another company , Mathco Health Corporation . Within a few months , Yolo spiked with synthetic marijuana -- commonly known as K2 or spice -- began appearing on store shelves around Salt Lake City . <p> Synthetic marijuana is manmade and can be manufactured for a fraction of the price of CBD , which is typically extracted from industrial hemp that must be farmed . <p> Samples tested at Utah labs showed Yolo contained a synthetic marijuana blamed for at least 11 deaths in Europe -- and no CBD at all . <p> Authorities believed that some people sought out Yolo because they wanted to get high , while others unwittingly ingested a dangerous drug . What authorities did n't understand was its source . <p> Investigators with Utah 's State Bureau of Investigation visited vape stores that sold Yolo , but nobody would talk . The packaging provided no contact information . <p> By May 2018 , the case was cold . But it was not dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to file a workplace retaliation complaint began collecting evidence of what she viewed as bad business practices . <p> During her research , Tatianna Gustafson saw online pictures showing that Yolo was the main culprit in the Utah poisonings , according to the complaint she filed against Mathco with California 's Department of Industrial Relations . <p> Gustafson wrote that while at Mathco she was concerned about how Yolo was produced , that it was excluded from Mathco 's promotional material and that the " labels had no ingredients or contact listing . " <p> Justin Davis , another former Mathco employee , told AP that " the profit margins were larger " for Yolo than other products . <p> Gustafson 's complaint asserted that Mathco or JK Wholesale , another of the companies that Thompson and her partner incorporated , mixed and distributed Yolo . Financial records in the complaint show Thompson 's initials as the main salesperson for Yolo transactions , including with a company in Utah . The records also show Yolo was sold in at least six other states , including to an address in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridge that sent him into a coma . <p> The former bookkeeper also tipped the Utah Poison Control Center about who she believed was behind Yolo , according to her complaint . <p> Barbara Crouch , the poison center 's executive director , recalled getting a tip in late 2018 and passing it along to the State Bureau of Investigation . SBI agent Christopher Elsholz talked to the tipster , who told him she believed the company she had worked for distributed Yolo . Elsholz said the company was in California and therefore out of his jurisdiction , so he passed the tip to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency . <p> The DEA offered to help but took no law enforcement action , spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger said . Spiked CBD is a low priority for an agency dealing with bigger problems such as the opioid epidemic , which has killed tens of thousands of people . <p> In the end , it was n't the synthetic marijuana compound in Yolo from Utah that caught up with Thompson . It was another kind of synthetic added to different brands . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Black Magic and Black Diamond had sickened more than 40 people in North Carolina , including high school students and military service members . Investigators were able to connect Thompson to that outbreak in part based on a guilty plea from the distributor of the spiked vapes , who said a woman that authorities identified as Thompson supplied the liquid that went into them . <p> Prosecutors also linked her to dealers charged in New York , where she pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to distribute synthetic marijuana and a money laundering charge . The only brand federal prosecutors cited was Yolo . <p> U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman called Thompson a " drug trafficker " who used JK Wholesale to distribute " massive quantities " of synthetic marijuana as far back as 2014 . She faces up to 40 years in prison . <p> Reached by phone the week before she pleaded guilty , Thompson declined to discuss Yolo and then hung up . In a subsequent text message , Thompson said not to call her and referred questions to her lawyer , who did not respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and she was the exclusive salesperson , her business partner and former roommate was involved in its production , according to the workplace retaliation complaint . <p> Thompson 's business partner and former roommate , Katarina Maloney , distanced herself from Thompson and Yolo during an August interview at Mathco 's headquarters in Carlsbad , California . Maloney has not been charged in the federal investigation . <p> " To tell you the truth , that was my business partner , " Maloney said of Yolo . She said Thompson was no longer her partner and she did n't want to discuss it . <p> In a follow-up email , Maloney asserted the Yolo in Utah " was not purchased from us , " without elaborating . <p> " Mathco Health Corporation or any of its subsidiary companies do not engage in the manufacture or sale of illegal products , " she wrote . " When products leave our facility , they are 100% compliant with all laws . " <p> Maloney also said all products are lab tested . She did not respond to requests for Yolo lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- If the FBI discovers that foreign hackers have infiltrated the networks of your county election office , you may not find out about it until after voting is over . And your governor and other state officials may be kept in the dark , too . <p> There 's no federal law compelling state and local governments to share information when an electoral system is hacked . And a federal policy keeps details secret by shielding the identity of all cyber victims regardless of whether election systems are involved . <p> Election officials are in a difficult spot : If someone else 's voting system is targeted , they want to know exactly what happened so they can protect their own system . Yet when their own systems are targeted , they may be cautious about disclosing details . They must balance the need for openness with worries over undermining any criminal investigation . And they want to avoid chaos or confusion -- the kind of disruption that hackers want . <p> The secrecy surrounding foreign hacks is not a hypothetical issue . The public still does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 election . Rick Scott , Florida 's governor in 2016 and now a U.S. senator , was not told at the time and did n't learn most of the details until this year . <p> And the threat to electoral systems is real . Federal officials believe Russian agents in 2016 searched for vulnerabilities within election systems in all 50 states . And the nation 's intelligence chiefs warn that Russia and other nations remain interested in interfering in U.S. elections . <p> Meanwhile , experts worry the White House has n't highlighted the threat as President Donald Trump argues it 's OK for foreign countries to provide damaging information on his political rivals -- a matter now the subject of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats . <p> In general , it 's up to electoral agencies to disclose when they 've been hacked . That , plus the federal policy protecting the identity of cyber victims , could mean that state election officials might not be told immediately if one of their local election offices experiences a breach . In addition , the whole situation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At least two states -- Colorado and Iowa -- have implemented policies to compel local officials to notify the state about suspected breaches involving election systems . <p> " Every American in this nation deserves to have a democracy they can believe in , and when there is not good communication on cyber incidents ... it does create a lack of confidence in the system , " said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold . " Luckily we have been able to work around the void of federal policy that has been leaving our nation in a precarious spot . " <p> But Department of Homeland Security officials say privacy is needed to ensure that officials come forward and share valuable threat information , such as suspect IP addresses . <p> Some election officials could be hesitant about public disclosures , concerned their agencies would be portrayed in a negative light . They could opt to handle any breach alone . <p> That could create dangerous delays in sharing information , said Jeanette Manfra , assistant director for cybersecurity at Homeland Security 's new cyber agency . <p> Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states . In general , communication and coordination on election security have improved in the last two years . <p> " We 've worked over the years to be able to declassify even more and to do it faster , " Manfra said . " It 's still not a perfect process . " <p> Due to the criminal nature of cyber breaches , law enforcement officials may seek to withhold releasing certain information long after the incident . When Florida 's current governor , Ron DeSantis , was briefed this year on the 2016 cyber breaches , he said he signed an agreement preventing him from identifying the affected counties . <p> The secrecy surrounding Florida helped spur bipartisan legislation that would compel reporting among federal , state and local officials and to voters potentially affected by a breach . Rep. Stephanie Murphy , a Florida Democrat , co-sponsor of the bill , said she believes voters are the victims , not the election office , and that not disclosing information about election-related breaches could undermine public confidence . <p> In June , a majority of Americans expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hackers , according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . <p> " It 's hard for me to assess if what people are doing in response is sufficient when I do n't know the full scope of the problem , " Murphy said . " And I think that 's the same issue with voters : How can they feel comfortable or confident that this next election will be free and fair ? " <p> Yet election officials want to ensure they have a good understanding of what happened before going public so they do n't contribute to the confusion that the hackers may be trying to achieve . <p> Cyber intrusions are inherently complicated , taking time to understand and contain . There is also a concern of inadvertently releasing information that could invite further compromises or undermine an investigation . <p> " It is important to be as transparent as possible , but as with any crime , the full details of an investigation are not discussed , " said Paul Pate , Iowa 's Republican secretary of state . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case-by-case basis . " <p> In 2017 , California election officials quickly disclosed the state had been notified by federal officials that its election systems were among those scanned by Russians the year before . Five days later , they had to correct the announcement after discovering the scans involved a non-election system . Secretary of State Alex Padilla , a Democrat , said it was an important lesson in making sure all the facts were there , especially considering the public is not familiar with cybersecurity terminology . <p> In the summer of 2016 , hackers accessed Illinois ' voter registration database , and officials moved fast to shut down the system and isolate the threat . State officials knew the move would n't go unnoticed and felt it was important to notify the public . <p> It became clear only later that Russian agents were involved , and the breach was part of an unprecedented campaign to interfere in U.S. elections . <p> Matt Dietrich , spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections , said it would be hard to imagine that any election office would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In 2016 , it was a story and then it was dealt with and then it kind of went away for a year , " Dietrich said .

" <p> Washington , OCT 21 ( AP/UNB ) -- Three years of simmering frustration inside the State Department is boiling over on Capitol Hill as a parade of current and former diplomats testify to their concerns about the Trump administration 's unorthodox policy toward Ukraine . <p> Over White House objections , the diplomats are appearing before impeachment investigators looking into President Donald Trump 's dealings with Ukraine and they 're recounting stories of possible impropriety , misconduct and mistreatment by their superiors . <p> To Trump and his allies , the diplomats are evidence of a " deep state " within the government that has been out to get him from the start . But to the employees of a department demoralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staff , cooperating with the inquiry is seen as a moment of catharsis , an opportunity to reassert the foreign policy norms they believe Trump has blown past . <p> " It 's taken a while to understand just how weird the policy process has become but it was inevitable , " said Ronald Neumann , president of the American Academy of Diplomacy . The group wrote a letter last month calling for the administration to support career diplomats and protect them from politicization . <p> The State Department officials parading through Capitol Hill include high-ranking diplomats with decades of experience serving both Republican and Democratic administrations . Among them : Kurt Volker , who resigned as the administration 's special envoy to Ukraine after being named in the whistleblower complaint that jumpstarted the impeachment inquiry . <p> Others who have testified behind closed doors include Marie Yovanovitch , the former ambassador to Ukraine who was pushed out of the post after a concerted campaign by Trump 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani ; Michael McKinley , who resigned after 37 years in the foreign service in part over treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council staffer who worked closely with the former Ukrainian ambassador . <p> Volker told investigators he did not believe there was anything improper in his dealings in Ukraine . But the others have all spoken of their unease and concern about Trump 's approach to Ukraine and their testimony has largely corroborated the whistleblower 's complaint , which centered on a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine 's leader , as well as Giuliani 's dealings in the former Soviet republic . <p> Yovanovitch , who remains a State Department employee , said she was " incredulous " at being recalled early from her post despite having been told she did nothing wrong . She lamented that her experience is evidence that American diplomats can no longer count on support from their government if they are attacked by foreign interests . <p> " That basic understanding no longer holds true , " she said according to the text of her opening statement to lawmakers . " Today , we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within . " <p> McKinley said he was " disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative information on political opponents . " <p> Trump has long cast career government officials as part of the " deep state " out to undermine him , associating the officials ' service under Democratic administrations as signs of their political leanings . That 's despite the fact that most longtime career officials have served under both Republicans and Democrats . <p> Mick Mulvaney , the acting White House chief of staff , argued last week that the diplomats were disparaging Trump because they were upset that he was imposing his political priorities on their work . He singled out in particular McKinley , who entered the foreign service while Republican Ronald Reagan was in the White House and had served under presidents from both parties . <p> " Elections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration , " Mulvaney said . " And what you 're seeing now , I believe , is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying , ' You know what ? I do n't like President Trump 's politics , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're undertaking on the Hill ' . " <p> Former Deputy Secretary of State William Burns called Mulvaney 's assertion " offensive . " <p> " For them to be dismissed unfairly and accused of acting out of some political motive I think is just wrong , " said Burns , who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . <p> " They are demonstrating that they are responsible , decent public servants and that they have an obligation to tell the truth even when it is n't convenient for the administration , " he said . " It gives a lie to the deep state caricature . These are n't people plotting behind anyone 's back . They are stepping up to do their jobs . " <p> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , in an interview Sunday with ABC 's " This Week , " joked , " I think Bill Burns must be auditioning to be Elizabeth Warren 's secretary of state . " Warren , a Massachusetts senator , is a Democratic presidential candidate . <p> The White House has insisted the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeachment investigation . Democrats have compelled the testimony of most of the officials through subpoenas and the State Department has so far not retaliated against those who have appeared . <p> Neumann , the American Academy of Diplomacy president , urged Pompeo to back up his staff if there are calls for them to be punished . <p> " So far , Pompeo has failed to show loyalty to the people who work for him , " he said . " But , he has another test . Does anything happen to those who testify ? If nothing happens , I would give Pompeo credit for having blocked it . " <p> Pompeo has not spoken frequently about the inquiry except to say it is unfair to the people who work for him because they are not allowed to bring State Department lawyers with them to testify . <p> " My view is that each of us has a solemn responsibility to defend the Constitution and to speak the truth . ... I hope those officers who go to Capitol Hill will speak truthfully , that they 'll speak completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their turn to talk this week : William Taylor , currently the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine , and Philip Reeker , the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe .

@@51234235 <h> In Afghanistan , Trump Creates Confusion Over US Policy on Taliban <p> President Donald Trump and President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan meet at Bagram Air Field in Kabul , Afghanistan on Thursday , Nov 28 , 2019 . ( Erin Schaff/The New York Times ) <h> After abruptly axing nearly a year of delicate peace talks with the Taliban in September , President Donald Trump put the negotiations back on the front-burner this week in a similarly jolting fashion by seeming to demand a cease-fire that his negotiators had long concluded was overly ambitious . <p> Despite a sense of relief at the prospect of resuming talks to end the 18-year conflict , Western diplomats and Taliban leaders were scrambling to figure out whether Trump had suddenly moved the goal posts for negotiations . <p> They were particularly confused by his remarks , made during an unannounced Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan , that the United States was once again meeting with the Taliban to discuss a deal but that " we 're saying it has to be a cease-fire . " <p> Demanding a cease-fire would amount to a big shift in the US position and require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little leverage to extract . <p> For much of the yearlong talks , the Taliban and the United States were fundamentally on the same page : The Taliban wanted the Americans out of Afghanistan , and Trump has made no secret his desire to end what he has called the US ' unending wars . But agreeing upon the details of a deal proved complicated . <p> In the agreement the two sides were on the verge of finalizing before Trump pulled the plug , the best US negotiators could get the Taliban to consent to was some reduction in violence . Discussions on a comprehensive cease-fire were relegated to future talks between the Taliban and Afghan leaders -- only after the United States had pledged , and begun , to withdraw its troops . <p> But Thursday , Trump suggested the Taliban position had shifted . <p> " They did n't want to do a cease-fire , but now they do want to do a cease-fire , I believe , " he said . " And it will probably work out that way . And we 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump 's declaration . While the group 's negotiators have held informal meetings with US diplomats in recent weeks about ways to go back to the table , on Friday their leaders said their original position on a cease-fire had not changed . <p> " The Americans walked away from the negotiating table , and now the ball is in their side ; it is up to them to come back if they want to solve this and get the document to signing and to the stage of implementation , " Suhail Shaheen , a member of the Taliban 's negotiation team , told The New York Times . " Our positions remain the same . " <p> It 's unclear how US negotiators could get the Taliban to agree to a cease-fire now , when they were not able to do so earlier . <p> The US military has already begun scaling back its presence in the country , giving negotiators even less leverage than they had before . Last month , the top US commander in Afghanistan , Gen Austin Miller , said the number of troops had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump , on Thursday , said he was " bringing down the number of troops substantially . " <p> For the Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani , Trump 's statements were welcome . For months , Ghani had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Americans not to give away a US troop withdrawal without a cease-fire because that would leave his government even more vulnerable . <p> The government has already been weakened by being excluded from the talks so far because the Taliban refuse to engage before a US troop withdrawal . <p> Now , suddenly , Trump gave Ghani 's position a boost at a difficult time for him , when he is stuck in a bitter fight over his reelection in a disputed vote , which is tipping the country to crisis . <p> Ghani met with Trump at the Bagram Airfield on the eve of large protests by supporters of his rival , Abdullah Abdullah . Much of the Afghan capital was under lockdown by security forces Friday morning as thousands marched to a roundabout behind the presidential palace demanding fraudulent votes be thrown out . <p> Abdullah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes in favor of Ghani . <p> Ghani and Abdullah are partners in a coalition government brokered by the United States when a similar disputed election between the two went to a stalemate in 2014 . The current power dispute dividing the country has added to the complications of resuming the peace efforts . <p> The hope is that peace talks would eventually lead to direct negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan leaders over the political future of the country after the United States commits to withdrawing its remaining troops , currently about 13,000 or fewer . <p> Keeping the peace process alive after Trump canceled talks in September has required quiet , delicate diplomacy , including work that resulted in a prisoner swap and some reduction in violence . Trump 's latest interjection in what has been a tedious diplomatic balancing act will once again have his negotiators scrambling to try to pull off what many Western officials have described as an unrealistic goal . <p> The Taliban see a cease-fire before the signing of a deal for the end of the US military presence as an existential issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forces again if they ask their fighters to stop fighting and then the deal breaks down . <p> But the government of Ghani has said negotiating the future can not happen under the barrel of a gun , demanding a cease-fire as a precondition to any talks . <p> When Trump called off the talks , the Taliban realized they had pushed their hand too far by continuing to launch attacks just days before what was expected to be a signing of the deal . In recent weeks , US diplomats convinced the group to significantly reduce large attacks in the Afghan capital as part of the prisoner swap that saw the release of a US and Australian hostage in return for senior Taliban leaders . <p> But delivering a comprehensive , declared cease-fire is always going to be difficult internally for a movement that is trying to maintain unity as it negotiates potentially divisive issues . <p> One Western official aware of the latest peace developments said he had not seen a tangible shift in the Taliban 's position on a cease-fire during the period the talks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban were forced to reject Trump 's apparent demand of a cease-fire to keep their own ranks united , that could further complicate the formal resumption of the negotiations . <p> " There 's probably now some work for US diplomats to do to clarify to the Taliban what did the imprecise words actually mean , and whether or not there is a change in position , " said Laurel Miller , a former US diplomat who is now the Asia director of the think tank International Crisis Group . <p> " The US has been looking for something in the realm of the reduction in violence , " she added , " but the idea that the US is on the same page with Ghani on cease-fire being a precondition -- I do n't see that at all .

With 2,600 residents , it is the largest community in the Westfjords , a region that is still heavily invested in fishing .

But Birgisson said the best place to fish for cod was where warmer ocean temperatures meet colder ocean temperatures , and that is increasingly moving north in keeping with global patterns . <p> Different species of fish evolved to live in specific water temperatures , with some fish like sea bass requiring the temperate ocean climates like those found off the mid-Atlantic region of the United States , and tropical fish like the Spanish hogfish preferring warmer waters such as those in the Caribbean .

So everybody 's fighting for a piece of the pie , " said Andrew Rosenberg , director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists . <p> In the ensuing discussions , Britain would accuse Iceland of stealing its fish , a Norwegian civil servant would accuse Iceland of making up its own rules , and all of the parties would accuse each other of varying degrees of fighting dirty . <p> " It does n't just stay as a fisheries management conflict , " said Malin Pinsky , an assistant professor in the department of ecology , evolution and natural resources at Rutgers University . <p> " In the Iceland case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said .

This year it raised its mackerel quota by 30% , to 140,000 tons from 108,000 tons . <p> At a meeting in October , the European Union and the two other countries criticized Iceland 's behavior , saying , " Such action , which has no scientific justification , undermines the efforts made by the European Union , Norway and the Faroe Islands to promote long-term sustainability of the stock .

Many fisheries that were n't shared in the past are now straddling borders as fish move .

" <p> In the tropics , this issue is especially acute because , as fish head toward the poles , they are n't replaced , creating a food vacuum .

However , the book which I am going to present today to the readers is simply unique . <p> This is a book which has been written in his simplistic style with a passion to educate the younger generations who often receive confusing messages regarding their political history from the traditional historians . <p> So , from that perspective , this is an exceptional book and the author should be congratulated for this socially responsible attempt to clarify the mess which has been baffling the youths . <p> The book **25;188225;TOOLONG published by Prothoma Prokashan ( 2019 ) is a historical writing about the break-up of British India into two and then eventually three nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first explains the circumstances that led to British India being divided into two nations -- India and Pakistan -- and then the eventual struggle by East Pakistan for freedom and the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation . <p> In this sense , the title of the book explains its content , since the geographical area known as India before 1947 got transformed into India and Pakistan after they gained independence from the British , and later in 1971 East Pakistan gained independence and became Bangladesh . <p> In Dr Nurul Islam 's own words " ... the book seeks to answer an often-asked question whether the partition of British India could be avoided as well as a follow up question whether the breakup of Pakistan was inevitable . " <p> The book is based on the hypothesis that when political parties are based on a fixed characteristic like religion or race , voters in an electoral democracy vote for the party that have the same characteristic as the voter , and as a result there is the creation of a permanent majority and a permanent minority . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority party to win and the minority group may then have to face inadequate opportunities in political , economic , and social spheres . <p> A major reason that led to the partition of India was that MA Jinnah was aware that the Muslims in India were a minority and , in the case of an electoral democracy , the Muslim League would become the permanent minority with very slim chances of being part of the central governing body . <p> Again in 1971 , West Pakistan and East Pakistan were separate geographical regions , and most of the population of Pakistan belonged to the Eastern counterpart . However , the civil society , military , and central government were all more dominant in West Pakistan . <p> An electoral democracy would then result in West Pakistan becoming the permanent minority , and those with power in West Pakistan would see a decline in their powers , which they did not want . <p> Historical context <p> The first part of the book explores the historical context that led to the Partition of India . India had a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Islam , but the majority were Hindus . <p> When the British ruled the region , they did not settle in India and only used the place for the purpose of resource extraction . Most of the local governing was done through " Indian natives . " However , the Muslims wanted to retain their Islamic roots and identity in the early days of British rule , whereas the Hindus were willing to learn from the British . <p> As a result , Hindus got an advantage and were able to occupy most of the administrative positions of pre-Partition India . A failed mutiny took place in 1857 , mainly led by the Muslim members of the British Indian Army . The failure led the Muslims to practise more orthodox Islam . <p> This ultimately meant that the population of India at that time contained a more progressive Hindu majority and a rather backward Muslim minority . <p> Road to Partition <p> The second part of the book explains the events that led to the Partition of India . By the late 19th century , Muslims were becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indian National Congress was formed in December 1885 , and had little participation from the Muslim community . <p> The Congress had started a movement for self-government , and later , in the early 20th century , the British government introduced a separate electorate system for the Muslims . This was so that Muslims could be more integrated into politics , and have more representation . <p> The Muslim League was formed in 1906 in Dhaka . In 1916 , the Congress and Muslim League joined forces in order to attain the institution of self-government in India . The Muslim League came up with the " fourteen-point demand , " but it was denied by the Congress , claiming that they too represented the mass of the Muslims of the country and special considerations were not , therefore , required . <p> British India saw two political parties by the 1930s -- the Indian National Congress , which consisted of mainly Hindu members , and the Muslim League with Muslim members . In order to establish self-governance , the British introduced provincial assemblies of elected representatives . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congress won most of seats . The results of this election showed that the Congress became the permanent majority since they represented Hindus , and on the other hand , the Muslim League were the permanent minority . <p> Jinnah then propagated the " two-nation theory " which said that the Hindus and Muslims were two different nations . The idea of nations based solely on religion was rather unique since the general definition of nationhood included common historical experiences and shared values , ideals , and future aspirations . <p> But here , only religion was considered to be the basis of nationality . In 1947 , the British proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan , which separated British India into three territories : Group A , B , and C. <p> Group B and C were proposed to have consisted of the Muslim Majority areas and would have considerable autonomy . The Congress , which was proposed to have Group C with Hindu majority , did not agree to the Cabinet Mission Plan and this ultimately led to the Partition of India into two nations . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the Muslims went to Pakistan and the Hindus went to India . A lot of violence took place against the minorities of the regions and many lives were lost . The trauma of this violent partition still persists in the psyche of both Muslims and Hindus who had to face this tragedy . <p> Pakistan is born <p> Part three of the book describes the creation of Pakistan . In August 1947 , Pakistan became a nation with two regions separated geographically by India . The regions were smaller than what was originally proposed in the Cabinet Mission Plan , and the country had to face many disadvantages because of this . <p> East Pakistan lost out because of the Partition since most of the industries and commercial areas of Bengal remained in Kolkata and West Pakistan inherited infrastructurally developed areas . Even though the founders wanted a parliamentary democracy for the constitution of Pakistan , the five provinces could not come to an agreement . <p> The army that Pakistan inherited from British India was nearly one-third of the former Indian army and hence relatively more powerful compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan 's land and population . <p> It also wanted a strong government so that they could have access to the resources . All institutions of the central government were located in West Pakistan and the military also consisted of people mainly from the West . <p> As a result , West Pakistan managed to get an overwhelmingly large share of the budget , even though East Pakistan housed majority of the population . The foreign trade policy and allocation of credit was centralized under the constitution of British India , promulgated in 1935 . Representation by East Pakistan was 5% in the military , 30% percent in the bureaucracy and 15% percent in business . <p> The government also transferred resources from East Pakistan , which was already poor compared to the wealthier West Pakistan . The increased entrepreneurship and investment in West Pakistan did not create employment in the East and the government in the West had no incentive to allocate resources to East Pakistan . <p> In 1948 , the decision was taken to make Urdu the state language of Pakistan . This resulted in the Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by violence on part of the government . By 1956 , East Pakistan created their own opposition political party . <p> A lot of back and forth took place in order to prevent East Pakistan from assuming power , since it was obvious that an electoral democracy would make East Pakistan the permanent majority . The disagreements of 1956 led to the implementation of martial law under Ayub Khan . <p> In the early 1960s , the government decided to ban the works of Rabindranath Tagore , claiming that he promoted Hindu culture . However , East Pakistanis considered this to be an attack on their identity . <p> East Pakistan was also left completely defenseless during the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 . In the late 1960s , Ayub Khan became unpopular to all of Pakistan due to the Tashkent Declaration , which was thought to have capitulated to the diplomatic pressure of India and given in too much to them . <p> A conference was held in Lahore in 1966 , where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman presented the " Six-Point Program " as a future blueprint for the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistani delegates . <p> Around this time , the Awami League was the biggest party in East Pakistan and Pakistan People 's Party was the largest in the West . West Pakistan did not desire an electoral democracy since the parties were based on unalterable characteristics and the majority belonged to the East . <p> The end of Pakistan <p> Part four is titled " End of Pakistan " and is essentially talking about the end of East Pakistan . The rejection of the Six-Point Program led to movements in East Pakistan . Awami League faced suppression by the Ayub government and many leaders along with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were imprisoned under the false accusations of Agartala Conspiracy case . <p> Ayub resigned after becoming ill in the face of broad-based protests from the agitating students , workers , and masses , mainly from the eastern part of the country , and was succeeded by General Yahya who arranged for a direct election to take place . <p> The AL fought in the election on the platform of the " Six-Points Program " and won all the seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority party in the National Assembly . The AL 's win meant the program would have to be implemented and East Pakistan would gain significant autonomy over their resources . <p> The West Pakistani elites tried hard to make Bangabandhu abandon the program . However , they failed . In the end , the army used force against East Pakistanis . East Pakistanis fought back with arms and the struggle for independence began . <p> About 10 million refugees went to India . These refugees created pressure on the Indian economy and the displaced Bengali youths were trained in guerilla warfare to fight back for their just cause since there were no agreements among Bangabandhu and General Yahya . <p> Eventually , India directly interfered in the war and backed the Bengali freedom fighters . The West Pakistani forces surrendered on December 16 , 1971 . <p> Bangladesh is born <p> The fifth part of the book is about the emergence of Bangladesh . Bangabandhu came to Dhaka on January 10 , 1972 , after being released by the Pakistani army , and formed the government of Bangladesh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lack of adequate administrative institutions and the economy was also backward .

Bangladeshi nationalism was meant to embrace all the cultural and religious diversity present in the country . <p> Socialism mainly indicated towards welfare liberalism of the West . The state was responsible for improving the standard of living of the people through economic growth , generating employment , and providing social security . <p> Secularism implied the separation of state and religion .

Especially now , when body positivity is an issue so highly talked about and advocated for , the need to cater to bigger women is more dominant than ever before . <p> Ayruani also noticed some recurring problems .

One of the designs , called the Bra Top , is one that acts as a bra and a tank top together , in order to avoid layering up too often .
