The other taxes are levied on gains in income generated to create the balance sheet . <p> " We in South Africa have a lot of redistributional taxes , even though we do n't have that many wealth taxes .

She did n't think she was ready for this , and yet she knew it was just the beginning . <p> " This is n't really the right time , " Kelly gently told Wyatt , persuading him it would be better , for now , to wear pants and a shirt . <p> " I ca n't be myself , " Wyatt said , a mixture of sadness and anger in his voice . " Jonas gets to wear what he wants . Why ca n't I ? " <p> Kelly knew it was true , and that it was n't fair . <p> " Let 's just try to get to know people first , " she said . <p> Still dazed , Wayne remained downstairs , enveloped in a kind of concussive quiet . The world where he was a father and husband in an ordinary , hard-working , middle-class family had just blown up . He stood there stunned , unable to hear whatever was going on around him , as if deafened by the psychological explosion . Was everyone at the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , worse , unmasked . As if the hunter , the fisherman , the Air Force veteran and the Republican had all been stripped away and the only thing left was the father - but father of what and of whom ? Yes , he was a happily married man and the parent of two beautiful boys , but it was also true he was embarrassed by one of them - and he 'd just broken that little boy 's heart . <p> From a young age , Wyatt was moodier than Jonas ; he would occasionally lash out at his brother as if frustrated just by his presence . There was something else , too . At night , when the boys were very little and she bathed them , Kelly would catch Wyatt staring into the long mirror hanging on the inside of the bathroom door . As she pulled off Jonas ' clothes and plunked him into the tub , she 'd notice Wyatt standing naked and transfixed in front of the mirror . What did the 2-year-old see ? Himself ? His identical twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Wyatt , of course . But often it seemed as if the little boy was puzzled by his reflection , unsure of the image staring back . There was some inscrutable pain behind his eyes . He seemed tense and anxious , as if his heart was in knots and he did n't know how to untie them . <p> Humans have long thought they could control the sex of a newborn , or , at the very least , influence whether a baby would be born male or female . Ancient Romans believed if a pregnant woman carried the egg of a chicken close to her breast , she would give birth to a boy . Artistotle contended that conception on the day of a strong north wind would result in a male child , on the day of a strong south wind , a female . Hippocrates ' solution , perhaps , was the simplest , if also the most painful : binding of the right testicle for the birth of a girl ; binding the left for a boy . <p> There is no shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know for sure is that we all begin life essentially genderless , at least in terms of sexual anatomy . The last of our 23 pairs of chromosomes makes us either genetic males ( XY ) or genetic females ( XX ) . But there are at least 50 genes that play a part in sexual identity development and are expressed at different levels early on . <p> Sexual anatomy , however , is determined in large part by hormones . All of us begin , in utero , with an opening next to the anus and a kind of genital " bud . ' ' The addition of testosterone drives the fetus in the male direction . An inhibiting hormone prevents males from developing internal female reproductive organs . Without testosterone , the embryo develops in the female direction . <p> Sexual differentiation of the genitals happens at about six weeks , but the sexual differentiation of the brain , including gender identity and the setting of our gender behaviour , is , at least partly , a distinct process . Again , hormones play the crucial role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains of some fetuses , causing subtle but distinct differences in brain structure and functional activity . <p> For instance , the straight gyrus , a narrow strip that runs along the midline on the undersurface of the frontal lobe , is about 10 percent larger in women than men . The straight gyrus , scientists have found , is highly correlated with social cognition - that is , interpersonal awareness . <p> These same scientists , however , caution that differences in biological sex are not necessarily hard-wired or absolute . In adults , they found that regardless of biological sex , the larger the straight gyrus , the more " feminine " the behaviour . For most males , the action of male hormones on the brain is crucial to the development of male gender identity . A mutation of an androgen receptor on the X chromosome can cause androgen insensitivity syndrome , in which virilization of the brain fails . When it does , a baby will be born chromosomally male ( XY ) and have testes rather than ovaries but also a short vagina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender identity is nearly always female . <p> In other words , our genitals and our gender identity are not the same . Sexual anatomy and gender identity are the products of two different processes , occurring at distinctly different times and along different neural pathways before we are even born . Both are functions of genes as well as hormones , and while sexual anatomy and gender identity usually match , there are dozens of biological events that can affect the outcome of the latter and cause an incongruence between the two . <p> In some ways , the brain and the body are two very different aspects of what it means to be human , especially when it comes to sex and gender . Who we are , male or female , is a brain process , but what we look like at birth , what we develop into at puberty , who we are attracted to and how we act - male , female or something in between - are all embedded in different groups of brain cells with different patterns of growth and activity . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of the interplay between sex hormones and the developing brain , and because it is a process that takes place over time , in utero , it can be influenced by any number of environmental effects . <p> The idea of a name change for Wyatt had been hanging over the family as the boys advanced through elementary school . If they were going to let Wyatt look like a girl and dress like a girl , then surely he deserved a girl 's name . <p> When they asked Wyatt what name he 'd like , he said , Raven , a character on one of his favourite television shows . <p> " That 's not a real name , " Wayne complained . " That 's a TV name . " <p> But TV names were the ones with which Wyatt was most familiar . He considered Quinn , a character on the Nickelodeon teen comedy/drama Zoey 101 , but he kept stumbling over the spelling . Finally , he settled on Nicole , or Nikki for short , one of Zoey 's sidekicks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the name out , so he tried to avoid using either . Once again , still feeling ambivalent , he left it to Kelly to sort out the details . When she called the family lawyer , she quickly discovered legally changing a name was n't nearly as simple as filling out a form . In Maine , by law , name changes are announced in the newspaper . If the Maineses wanted to keep this out of the public eye , they 'd have to petition the court to make an exception . The last thing Kelly and Wayne wanted was to make some public announcement , no matter how small , that their son was now their daughter . <p> Before any petition would be granted , however , the parents had to appear in person at the county courthouse . Seated in the small courtroom on a hot summer day , Kelly and Wayne fidgeted nervously waiting for the judge . When he finally entered , their hearts sank just a bit - he was an elderly gentleman , probably over 70 , with white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his black robe . <p> " Why are you changing your son 's name to a girl 's name ? " he asked . <p> Kelly 's back arched slightly . Their lawyer , or rather the real estate attorney filling in for their lawyer , answered , " Their daughter is a transgender child , Your Honour , and has been presenting as a girl for a number of years . The parents , doctors and counsellors agree this is the right thing to do at this time . " <p> " Why are you petitioning to keep this out of the paper ? " <p> " Due to the recent protests . . . by the Christian Civic League , they are requesting this to be kept private , " the attorney answered , referring to a local , politically active organisation with vehemently anti-gay and anti-transgender views . <p> " Maybe the Christian Civic League should appear in court to have their say , " the judge said . <p> What the hell is going on ? Wayne thought . Kelly 's eyes welled and Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such a hard time making this adjustment , knew he had to do something . He raised his hand and asked if he could say something . <p> Wayne explained that his son Wyatt had been expressing feelings he was a girl from the age of two and that his insistence that he was born in the wrong body had made it difficult for him in school . They were convinced , and Wyatt 's doctors agreed , that he should be allowed to transition to being a girl . <p> " I see no reason to deny your request , " the judge said . " You are obviously very concerned about your child 's safety . " <p> For Wayne , this was the first time he 'd shown any kind of public support for Wyatt being transgender . His instincts as a father had been tested without his even realising it , and he 'd responded to the challenge . The petition was granted , and in a matter of days Wyatt Benjamin Maines would officially and legally become Nicole Amber Maines . The middle name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Ultimately , the name change and petition were relatively easy . What neither Kelly nor Wayne knew as they walked out of the courtroom was that everyone 's life was about to get a lot harder . <p> * Nicole and Jonas Maines graduated from high school in June , and Nicole underwent sex-reassignment surgery in July . They are both first-year students at the University of Maine .

@@2105232 <h> UP Wo n't Make it in the History Books.But ... <p> 27 October 2015 , 09:29 <p> University of Pretoria students will probably not make it to history books , but at least they know what they want and how it can be attained , step-by-step . I am a University of Pretoria student ; however the basis of this argument I am presenting are not to be biased and make you feel bitter about your misjudgement of our protest . Perhaps I might be somehow biased -- a little bit , you know it happens but that 's not my intention . Call the Tuks students whatever you want ! <p> Now when you go to media , and read articles by those ' significant or popular ' columnists and commentators ; you will most probably stumble into something like ' coconuts ' , ' middle class ' , and ' bourgeoisie ' . All those to refer to students from previously white higher education institutions . The likes of University of Cape Town , Rhodes etc. not just University of Pretoria alone ; and those words indicate that those students are kind of ' whitish or their whiteness in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are claims that the government is only doing something now because the historically white universities are taking action and joining the protests . The likes of Tshwane University of Technology ( TUT ) have been protesting for years and did not get any attention from the government . Or if they did get any trivial attention , it did not resolve any of their problems . I can agree with the issue that to an extent ; nevertheless , I can also endorse the government and say they are doing it right . Why ? Because they have been failing for years to transform those institutions , and now that the students from those institutions are taking a step forward , then it is a clever step to meet them halfway . And that is when the issue of attention comes into place . If you may remember , in about a month ago there was something about #Luister , which was addressing the difficulties black students experience in those historically white institutions -- specifically Stellenbosch , in the issue of language of command . Well , not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve that issue of language . <p> Anyways , the point here is that one has to look at the Tuks protest , not just as anything discriminated from the issues of transformation within the university . We knew what we wanted and we know what we want , which is #FreeEducation , I reiterate . First thing , we are not cowards , as one Twitter user suggested . Being peaceful does n't mean that you are a coward , but it means you know how to deal with a situation which is enraging calmly -- which I must say , is not a skill everybody has attained -- even some of our students were against the #PeacefulProtest . Thanks to our leaders ( #Uprising , EFFSC , SASCO , PYA etc. ) for keeping it the way it was planned to be , peaceful . Cowards would not dare shut down the university activities , and have the attention of their ' busy ' management on them and only them alone . Remember ; on the Monday 26 October 2015 , the university was shut down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think any coward can do that -- can they ? <p> Now , what is it that the University of Pretoria protest was about -- if you may ask ? Here is the demands that were put forth by #Uprising ( which was also made of member leaders from different political parties like EFF and PYA ) . List of demands : <p> 1 . 1 . We demand Free Education . <p> 2. 2 . We demand no fee increment ( zero percent ) across the board . <p> 3. 3 . We demand that no person(s) participating in this mass protest be victimised and/or prosecuted by the University or its affiliates . <p> 4. 4 . We demand that provision be made for students participating in this mass protest action to catch up on any academic activity which was disrupted and/or missed as a result of said action . <p> 5. 5 . We demand the Food Services ( TuksRes ) must decrease their prices to be market competitive . In the interim , we are launching an investigation with the Competition Commission , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> 6. 6 . We demand that any and all financial decisions impacting on students be proposed to students no later than September each year . <p> 7. 7 . We demand that a student 's financial status shall have no bearing on their ability to retain their Residence placement . <p> 8. 8 . We demand that every person who is deemed fit for financial aid , as per the NSFAS criteria , receive such financial aid from the University . <p> 9. 9 . We demand the removal of application fees as well as residence levy fee . <p> 1010 . We demand that a seat be allocated to a student representative on the Standing Committee of the Council . <p> 1111 . We demand that no interest rate ( zero percent ) on any outstanding fees owed by a student . <p> 12 12 . We demand no registration fee . <p> 13 13 . We demand the Council convenes and ratifies this document in our presence . <p> Look at this ' beautiful ' list which is in order . First and foremost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first demand , then it makes the claims that we do n't know what we want fictitious . Look at the logic of these demands ; #FreeEducation is what we demand to one day derive to , but we understand that it can not happen overnight -- it is a process but feasible in our country ( as confirmed by the Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande on the eNCA interview earlier this week ) . So what we do , is list the demands that work in the direction towards this #FreeEducationForAll everybody is concerned about . Some notable demands from the list that are leading us to #FreeEducation are numbers : 2 , 7 ( can also be included ) , 8 ( can include also ) , 9 , 11 and 12 . <p> Why am I saying these demands are leading to #FreeEducation ? Well , we can not talk about the free education while the fees are increasing ; that 's inversely proportional or rather irrational . It should be the other way around . So ' no fee increment ' , ' no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' no residence levy ' , all those serve as demands to turn the direction of fees to R0.00 , we all want , as it means as from next year the fees will be much lesser than this year . <p> Now , coming back to the Union Buildings and all that happened there . TUT students instigated the ' violence ' , whereby they started throwing things at the Police . I was there , at first they threw water bottles and later it was the stones and there was also a guy who provoked them with a rod . A guy came past us with a dish full of stones . All those stones to be thrown at the Police ( Who are also our parents . What would you do , if your father was one of the Police who were being ' brutalised ' there ? Was it gon na be fine for your father to be in that jeopardy ? I do n't think so . The one thing that makes me fail to condone that violence , is the fact that the Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 0% increase we were looking for from the President . We are the ones who provoked them . We must not forget , they are our parents and they deserve respect ; but most importantly one of them might have been the father of one of the students protesting . Injuring a parent of one people in the same cause as you I do n't think can be condoned , for it can cause detachment . I know most people do n't think so far when they analyse things . Anyways , I am also not a Saint . I do n't really care much about those morals things , but the point I made will always remain ' true ' . It 's just my frank opinion , whether you accept it or not I do n't care much ! ) . <p> To cut short my argument ; yes , in most instances our government acts when something is shaken . So , in my opinion , like everybody else is praising #TUTStudents for their bravery and their activism . They are said to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show -- Prince Themba 's opinion again . Remember , they just joined the protest on Thursday and then they come there and want to show everybody what revolution is about , right ? If TUT came in and stood by us ' the coconuts ' and waited for the President ( Yea , he took so long . Even me I was becoming impatient ) to address us on the issue of no fee increment . Only in and if he was to say something otherwise showing that he did n't care . Or if he rejected the 0% increase in fees . If then the students started burning things and threw stones at the President himself , I would have then condoned and hailed the #TUTStudents ' bravery . But for now my ' condone ' is reserved for a peaceful protest with outcomes . Note that : ' A peaceful protest with outcomes ' . What if the President or the Universities had beforehand planned to give us 0% ? And here is high possibilities and evidence to support that thought ; consider the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the meeting , the 0% was put forward by the Vice Chancellors to the President . So it might have been something the proposed among themselves , before they even got to the Union Buildings . <p> To the University of Pretoria students , I urge them to forget about their exclusion in the history to be written or already written by people who recommend violence in the protests . Do not look for their approval and then start doing things you not supposed to do . Vandalising objections is just an unnecessary addition of funds to repair or replace the vandalised objects or building or whatsoever it is . Let 's not think that we did not contribute anything to the outcomes of the protest , I and you know better and need nobody to endorse us . There was more than 8 000 UP students at the Union Buildings -- what are you telling me ? Nobody is gon na say that , it will all be about #TUTStudents . <p> We will write our own history , which will be the unique . The freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- all the way peaceful , is n't that great ! That is history itself ! It is also to let some white folks who think we 're not rational , know that black people are not savages or barbarians -- we also know how to reason . I know this may absent some ' significant ' columnists -- but reasoning is not for white people , even us blacks we can reason . So now this thing of connecting reasoning to ' whiteness ' is a flaw , and it dehumanises black people by black people themselves -- in my opinion , taking this from the column I read . I believe in that everything is about one 's mentality ; whether you black or white , you can be barbaric and savagery and you can equally be the opposite . It 's a matter of mentality rather than a race issue . <p> Go to Twitter , check most ' famous people or celebrities ' they be giving all the credits to TUT students for the 0% increments for 2016 . It 's like if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , you do n't know -- -- and nobody is 100% sure of what was gon na be the outcome . So we can not judge the outcomes in terms of peaceful protest or violence . We are not sure , what of the two played a key role . 50-50 -- how about that ? <p> I must admit , throughout my article it 's like I am against #TUTStudents . But not really , I just used them as they are the ones trending on social media . Frankly , I have been trying very hard to condone and hail the TUT act on the 23 October , but as I said before I have failed to do that even after I received so many comments , even from some of my friends and colleagues , but NO ! -- -- and also I am unapologetic for all my opinions in this article .

In Afrikaans we say : You reap what you sow . <p> In 2007 , prior to the 2009 election and again at its Mangaung conference in 2012 , before the 2014 election , the ANC promised free tertiary education . But up until 2015 it did nothing about it . Now the chickens are coming home to roost . <p> Instead , subsidies for universities have been reduced while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get away with it ? <p> By brainwashing voters to blame anything but the ANC for their problems , from white capital to neo-colonialism and apartheid . <p> The honourable minister of higher education as the general secretary of the SACP is excellent at this . Normally he just puts the blame for any problem on " anti-majoritarian counter-revolutionary forces " . <p> But I do have some sympathy for the minister . Honourable Nzimande has for the past twenty years agitated for a popular revolution . When it finally arrived , he was on the wrong side , the receiving end of it trying to make a speech and shouting " amandlas " through the fences around parliament . <p> Who are the real authors of this mess ? <p> I must congratulate the students that this time they were not brainwashed or fooled . They immediately set the real authors of this mess , the ANC government in their sights . So they marched to Luthuli House , to parliament and the Union Buildings . <p> The ANC 's initial feigned solidarity with the students and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not fool the students . <p> At Luthuli House , Jesse Duarte and Gwede Mantashe still tried to blame the vice rectors . That quickly changed the rallying cry from #FeesMustFall to #ANCMustFall . <p> The fact that Mr. Mantashe had called these students pseudo-revolutionaries did not help much . <p> In this campaign " fees " were the rallying call , but everyone knows that it is about a broader anger at a government which only makes promises and fails voters . <p> The FF Plus condemns student and police violence . At parliament some police officers used unnecessary force - mainly because they were too few . I however saw how police officers were kicked and mocked . When the students broke through the gates at parliament I watched ANC members on that side of the House . They sat with big and anxious eyes listening how the shouting of the students kept on coming closer , right up to the doors of the National Assembly .

This follows after Solidarity launched a huge campaign during the past number of weeks against the fund 's application of this principle . <p> The " clean-break principle " entails that the pension benefits that a divorced member 's former spouse is entitled to in terms of a divorce settlement is paid out to him or her shortly after the divorce has been finalised . To date , the GEPF considered the portion paid out to the former spouse to be a debt on which the member had to pay compound interest on a monthly basis . <p> Solidarity warned earlier that this principle had an immense negative effect on the pensions and financial position of members of the fund . Solidarity has already started to finalise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court . <p> In response to Solidarity 's campaign , the fund , through its CEO Mr Abel Sithole , confirmed that the fund would review this system .

" Several of our members that have been negatively affected have recently approached for assistance .

@@2110231 @ @ @ to find cash for fees <p> Johannesburg - The deal struck for a 0 percent university fee increase this week can probably be covered by a sector education and training authorities ( Setas ) surplus -- of more than R5bn -- but any move towards free tertiary education would have to come at the expense of other government programmes or a tax hike . <p> That was the word from Treasury officials who briefed MPs after Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene delivered his medium-term budget policy statement last Wednesday while #FeesMustFall protesters clashed with police in the parliamentary precinct . <p> In normal circumstances , Nene would have been able to draw on the contingency reserve -- funds to deal with unforeseen eventualities . But the R5bn Nene had in the kitty has been swallowed up by the public sector wage increase . Although he had pencilled in reserves of R15bn and R45bn for the following two years , these have been slashed to R2.5bn and R9bn . <p> The minister made it clear that finances were stretched , resulting in a slippage in debt consolidation targets .

This is intended to keep it on an even keel and smooth out the peaks and troughs of the economic cycle . <p> Head of the Treasury 's budget office , Michael Sacks , said if the principle was applied correctly , government expenditure as a share of GDP would remain stable . <p> This would imply an increase in the higher education allocation would have to come at the cost of other programmes or , as Nene told MPs , some priorities might have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal guide would be flexible enough to accommodate policies prioritised in the National Development Plan , which included the expansion of access to tertiary education -- not the same thing as free tertiary education -- and a national health insurance . <p> The most likely source of a permanent increase in revenue would be a hike in VAT , considered by the Davis Tax Committee to be the most efficient form of tax , although it would meet with stiff resistance from labour and other sectors . <p> New taxes are announced only in the Budget in February and Nene has not ruled out the possibility of a VAT increase .

It is up to us . " <p> From hitting the ground at the tournament with a running splat , the Boks recovered to lose by just two points to the All Blacks in the semi-finals or in the words of coach Heyneke Meyer : " A penalty or drop goal away from the final . " Or the two points Bryan Habana conceded to the Kiwis by prematurely rushing an ( unsuccessful ) Dan Carter conversion attempt that was ( successfully ) retaken . Not to mention an eminently kickable penalty being overturned in favour of the All Blacks because Matfield had an opponent in a head lock . <p> A lot of " ifs " , a lot of " ors " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more between the two sides than the two points in the 20-18 scoreline . And South African rugby will be heading into dangerous territory when it starts accepting that a bronze medal at the World Cup is a pass mark .

The macrocosm is not that encouraging and it is a concern that in the fourth year of the cycle that began in 2012 ( after the 2011 World Cup ) , the Boks were poor overall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine three years in the making , they could not back up a win , losing three Tests out of four and , including World Cup games , finish 2015 with a record just over 50 percent ( played 11 , won six , lost five ) . <p> In 2003 , when the All Blacks lost their World Cup semi-final against Australia , it was the only game they had lost that year , yet when the team arrived back in Auckland it was the centre of a public outcry , and coach John Mitchell was promptly sacked . <p> That is the mark of a country that does not accept defeat -- the coach is fired because of a losing streak of ... one match ! <p> Meyer 's job is probably safe , not only because South Africa has grown sadly used to failure in the professional era ( when the Boks came out of isolation they had beaten the All Blacks on 20 occasions , with 15 defeats to the same opponents ) , and because there are no obvious contenders . <p> The SA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's look inside our borders , and that leaves ...

So it was perhaps fitting that Japan 's winning try in Brighton came from a perfectly orchestrated , pre-planned backline movement , with the wing scoring in the corner . The Boks ca n't do that . Bottom line . <p> In mitigation , it is said that the way a team tackles reflects the morale in the ranks .

Miller can travel for the show if needed , but must check with the court before travelling out of the country . Her attorneys and prosecutors told the judge they expect a trial to last more than two weeks . It has yet to be scheduled . <p> The investigation began when a channel-surfing bankruptcy judge saw Miller on TV in December 2012 and figured she had to be making more than the $8 899 in monthly income she was claiming . <p> Once the FBI and other federal investigators got involved , they determined Miller hid more than $228 000 in income from appearances on Dance Moms and a spin-off , Abby 's Ultimate Dance Competition and nearly $550 000 more from personal appearances , dance sessions and merchandise sold through her website , **27;152;TOOLONG . <p> Miller continued hawking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and telling reporters that jackets from Season 6 of Dance Moms go on sale on Wednesday . <p> Miller is known for her outspoken , brash behaviour and pursuit of perfectionism from her students .

The comment suggested that the income she 's accused of hiding was offset by business expenses . <p> Whether that 's true or not may not matter under the law . <p> That 's because when someone files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , the court can order creditors to accept less than they 're owed or otherwise agree to more lenient repayment terms . That court-imposed protection comes with the requirement that the debtor -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their income . <p> If they do n't , it 's a crime . <p> Charged with 20 counts <p> Miller is charged with two counts of bankruptcy fraud , five counts of concealing bankruptcy assets and 13 counts of making false bankruptcy declarations . Each of the 20 counts carries up to five years in prison , and a total of $5m in fines are possible if she is convicted of every count . <p> According to the indictment , Miller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2010 claiming debts of more than $356 000 , including a $200 000 mortgage on a Florida home and a $96 000 mortgage on her dance studio in Penn Hills , the Pittsburgh suburb where the reality show is based . <p> Miller received more favourable mortgage terms after filing Chapter 11 , and that 's why the alleged hiding of her income is a crime . <p> Miller did n't appear to be hiding her income in court .

@@2116234 <h> What the MTN Zakhele JSE listing means <p> Craig Gradidge <p> FILE PICTURE : Members of the Communication Workers Union take part in a picket , 21 May 2015 , outside the MTN offices in Fairland , Johannesburg . The union is demanding a ten percent salary increase , higher weekend and public holiday wages and that temporary staff are made permanent at the telecommunications company MTN . Picture : Alaister Russell <h> The scheme is due to transfer from an OTC platform to the JSE 's BEE Board on November 5 . <p> MTN has dominated headlines for all the wrong reasons since news of the Nigerian fine hit the headlines last week Monday . The company 's share price fell over 22% in the week that followed . There has been a lot of criticism directed at management for this mess as it appears to have been an entirely avoidable crisis if the company had simply followed the rules . However , it is too soon to say for sure what the reality of the situation is , and whether or not investors should be reconsidering the outlook for MTN as an investment . <p> The timing of this crisis could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowerment scheme , MTN Zakhele ( MTNZ ) . MTNZ is in the process of transferring from an over-the-counter ( OTC ) platform to the JSE 's BEE Board . There it will join Sasol 's SOLBE1 share as the second listing on that board . The OTC platform closed on October 16 2015 , and a new transaction platform is now open for verifications and registration -- an essential process for all who wish to trade , even those who were registered on the previous platform . <p> MTNZ investors who may be uncomfortable with the current developments at MTN are unable to do anything about it , and will have to wait until November 5 before they can trade . By then the proverbial horse may have bolted . Or not . The share will trade under the code MTNZBE . <p> Background <p> MTN Zakhele , with a market capitalisation of R8.2 billion , will be the first broad-based black economic empowerment scheme to list on the JSE 's BEE Segment , subsequent to the amendments made by the JSE . Outlining reasons for the listing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a change in the Financial Services Board policy in relation to the regulation of all providers of OTC share trading platforms for facilitating trading in own shares . The listing will provide shareholders with regulatory certainty for trading their MTN Zakhele shares " . <p> From November 5 2015 , when MTN Zakhele shares are listed on the JSE , shareholders and potential investors who wish to buy or sell MTN Zakhele shares may do so using the new transaction platform , via a website or through the dedicated call centre at 083 123 6869 , a toll free number for MTN subscribers . <p> Investors will also be able to use their own service providers , for example their own stockbrokers , to trade their MTN Zakhele shares , provided they have been verified to trade the shares in this manner . <p> Mabaso-Koyana explained that the trading experience on the new transaction platform would remain very similar to what it has been in the past on the MTN Zakhele OTC platform . MTN Zakhele has identified service providers who will provide shareholders and new investors with trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We know that our shareholders are mainly individuals who trade in small volumes , so it was important to continue to facilitate access to trading in the JSE environment through familiar platforms -- a website and call centre . For existing individual shareholders whose details have not changed , verification and registration on the new transaction platform is simple , all you need is your identity number and your cellphone . All existing shareholders who are black groups must complete a verification form and submit supporting documentation . " <p> MTNZ experienced significant challenges when it listed for secondary in January 2014 on the OTC platform . After that initial turmoil , trade was suspended for a few weeks while the company sorted out the issues . Those challenges were largely as a result of the outstanding performance of MTNZ which had moved from R20 a share to over R80 in the initial three years of the empowerment period . It is possible that MTNZ shareholders may be lining up to exit now but for the opposite reason . <p> There are still a few trading days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that time . However , if the current situation persists , and there is a continued lack of communication from management , the exit queue could fill up quite quickly and we could see a significant drop in the value of the MTNZ shares in the short term . <p> What should MTNZ investors do ? <p> The main concern for MTNZ shareholders is valuation . With MTN trading below R150 a share , it is possible that MTNZ could trade at a premium to its net asset value . The more-than-22% drop in the value of MTN would have resulted in a bigger drop in the NAV of MTNZ ( as a result of the gearing ) . We estimate the NAV of MTNZ to be below R80 a share with MTN trading at R149 a share . <p> The last traded price on the OTC share trading platform was R102.30 . Investors in MTNZ will need to monitor the MTN share price closely and decide if they think it will recover or if it will remain at these depressed levels for a while longer . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait for the recovery . What is important is that investors do not panic and sell at any price . <p> The longer-term concern for MTNZ investors is the impact of the current situation on the MTN dividend going forward . MTN trades on a dividend yield of over 7% , and this has seen huge dividend flow to MTN Zakhele , which used the dividends to settle debt . If the dividend were to be cut , MTNZ would lose its only source of revenue , which may result in it having to sell off more MTN shares to settle debt than currently expected . <p> MTN Zakhele issued a statement during October 2015 , stating that it is possible that MTNZ shareholders may have the option to participate in a new BEE scheme in November 2016 . This is when the existing MTNZ scheme matures . The details and terms of the new scheme will be disclosed closer to the time and require MTN management to agree to such terms and conditions . This is an additional factor for long-term investors to consider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

A tax on graduates seems to be a practical solution <p> Recent student protests over tuition fees , university staff and curricula , university autonomy and outsourcing have highlighted a number of issues facing South Africa . The agreement not to increase fees in 2016 has left the country with a short-term education financing gap . The increasing demands for free university education leave it with a longer-term , and much bigger , financing issue . <p> Can South Africa meet the funding shortfall in 2016 ? Yes . <p> Can it afford free education for all ? No . Someone will have to pay . <p> The impact of no fee increases <p> In the short term , the impact of the 0% increase is unlikely to raise eyebrows , if it is indeed a once-off . Cost estimates range between R2.6-billion and R4.2-billion , depending on the methodology used . <p> One fairly objective estimate of the cost is based on the weights from the consumer price index , where the cost of education accounts for 2.95% of consumer spending ( basic and secondary education account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now forecast at R4.35-trillion , which corresponds to R2.7-trillion in consumer spending . Applying the 1.23% weight to consumer spending gives an estimate of the cost of tertiary education . <p> Between 2009 and 2015 , tertiary institutional fees escalated at around 4% to 5% above the rate of inflation . Similarly , student numbers increased over that period , suggesting the weights above need to be adjusted upwards . For that reason , we assume a 1.5% consumer weighting . <p> Thus , the cost of university fees ( excluding bursaries ) would be close to R40-billion per annum . Given that the student protests were sparked by a 10% increase , that implies R4-billion is needed . If that is the only cost , the budgetary impact will be small . <p> If funded by government , without using the contingency reserve ( only R2.5-billion has been budgeted for the 2016 contingency reserve ) , the knock-on effect on the budget deficit would be no more than 0.1% of GDP ( R4-billion from R4.35-trillion GDP , yields 0.092% of GDP ) . <p> Is free university education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university education would require a minimum injection of R40-billion from the public purse . Such an injection implies that the deficit would increase by nearly 1% of GDP , if not funded from alternative arrangements . <p> The amount could be raised through borrowing and monetising that deficit . But monetising leads to inflation , which is bad for the poor . Thus , tax revenues , either current or future , would need to rise . <p> Also , fees are not the only cost to university attendance . To attend a residential institution , students need " study-friendly " accommodation near the institution and adequate nutrition . The overall cost to the fiscus could be as high as R100-billion per annum . Due to the fact that reduced tuition disproportionately benefits the wealthy , it is unlikely that free education will be made available for all . <p> For this analysis , we assume a cost of R60-billion , which includes the R40-billion and a back-of-the-envelope estimate of the additional amount needed by the state-owned student lender , the National Student Financial Aid Scheme ( NSFAS ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half and one-third what was required . We round the amount to R20-billion . <p> Raising an extra R60-billion in a depressed economic environment through taxation is a daunting task . The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statements suggest that South African Revenue Services still has scope to raise further revenues from clamping down on tax avoidance . <p> In addition , the government will look to clamp down on the use of transfer pricing by multinational companies as a means of avoiding tax . But these improvements in collection will not cover the additional costs . <p> Other options include an increase in value-added-tax ( VAT ) , personal or corporate income taxes or the siphoning of funds from some other activity . The VAT rate at the moment is 14% . <p> On the basis of simulations we have done , VAT would have to go up by around 0.6% to 14.6% to raise revenue by R60-billion . For personal income tax , the feasible increase rate would lie between 1%-5% , depending on the degree of bracket creep and spread assumed . On the other hand , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increases of 7% were recently agreed . <p> How about a higher education tax ? <p> The government could also consider the introduction of new taxes , such as a carbon tax , wealth tax or higher education tax . <p> A higher education tax , as in the UK , has appealing elements . It is imposed on those who have earned a higher education degree , can be scaled to earnings , and a set number of years . <p> The tax could also be applied retroactively . According to the 2011 census , there were 3.6 million individuals aged 20 and older holding a higher education qualification . If a higher education tax was applied to all 3.6 million , the average higher education tax would be about R16.667 per degree recipient per annum . <p> The actual average would be subject to whether or not every degree holder pays , payments are limited to a certain number of years post completion and whether the type and level of degree are also factored in . The average would also depend on how it is scaled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of students that complete and find jobs . <p> For the most part , graduate unemployment rates are much lower than for the rest of the population . But emigrants would disproportionately benefit from such a tax , potentially exacerbating brain-drain , and the tax could also create disincentives to the immigration of skilled labour . <p> Despite potentially exacerbating brain-drain , a higher education tax is a practical solution . It allows for both " private " returns to education and " social " returns to education . For example , social workers are paid less , and , therefore , could be taxed at a lower rate , while accountants earn more , and could be taxed at a higher rate . <p> Furthermore , it embodies the concept that education is an investment in our future . <p> But many potential pitfalls to " additional taxes " remain . Without a doubt , the combination of the required tax increases and the sheer magnitude would substantially erode disposable income . It would also lead to significantly weaker growth . <p> Koch is professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Financial and Fiscal Commission and Research Fellow , Stellenbosch University

@@2949233 <h> Pajero still an old-school SUV icon <p> . Mitsubishi 's ageing Pajero gets refreshed with a facelift and improved refinement . But it continues to provide the goods when tar turns to dirt and the adventure begins . Picture : Denis Droppa <p> ROAD TEST <p> Mitsubishi Pajero 3.2 Di-DGLS Exceed <p> Johannesburg - In its press material Mitsubishi makes much of the Pajero 's Dakar Rally-winning heritage of a record 12 victories , even though it has n't competed there in years . <p> But the marketing hype is n't unjustified because the Pajero is still one of the " real " all-terrain vehicles in the market , rather than the ever-growing number of urban soft-roaders that are n't necessarily designed to get their tyres muddy . <p> Point this Mitsubishi at a rugged 4x4 trail and it has all the tools needed to plod through picturesque pastures and duel with deep dongas with minimum chance of getting stuck . <p> The Super Select 4WD system also allows convenient shifting between two and four-wheel drive at up to 100km/h . <p> The three-door SWB derivative ( not tested here ) has even better approach and departure angles of 34.8 degrees and 36.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of offroading ability along with a family-sized cabin . <p> The 2015 model year range , in both short and long-wheelbase versions , features a number of cosmetic enhancements as the last upgrade on the current derivative before it 's replaced by the fifth-generation Pajero in about two years ' time . <p> A minor facelift sees a grille and bumper restyled with LED daytime running lights incorporated into the headlamps , while other cosmetic tweaks include an upgrade from 17 " to 18 " alloy rims and a new spare-wheel cover . <p> The headlamps get an auto-dimming function that switches from high to low-beam when encountering vehicles ahead . <p> OLD-SCHOOL HANDLING <p> Improved NVH ( noise , vibration and harshness ) levels sees the large SUV cruise along more quietly than before . However , the current Pajero is now eight years old and showing its age in terms of torsional rigidity that is n't on a par with newer SUV rivals . <p> The handling is of the old-school SUV variety : vague , with slow steering and heaps of understeer . The Pajero feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which feel like sharp-handling sports cars in comparison . <p> Like its more direct rivals , the Toyota Prado and Nissan Pathfinder , the Pajero 's talents lie more in its ability to cruise comfortably over rugged trails , where its soft springs and fully-independent suspension deliver an impressively cushy ride that copes gracefully with bumps and ripples . On a smooth road the test vehicle displayed vibrations at certain speeds however , as if the driveshaft or tyres needed balancing . <p> Comprising the SWB GLS , LWB GLS and the LWB GLS Exceed , all models in the simplified three-model Pajero range are powered by the existing 3.2-litre turbodiesel engine which runs on 50ppm or 500ppm diesel . <p> There have been no tweaks under the bonnet and the 140kW and 441Nm outputs feel sufficiently gutsy to move this big SUV along at an easy gallop . It slightly out-powers the Toyota Prado 3.0 's 120kW/400Nm and is basically on a par with the Pathfinder 2.5 's 140kW/450Nm . <p> The five-speed automatic transmission , while not having as many gears as some newer contenders , shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pajero 's interior is also showing some " senior " moments , particularly the laughably old-fashioned " calculator screen " information display . Also , the door pockets are quite thin and difficult to access because there 's not much space to stick your hand between the seats and the doors . <p> The steering adjusts only for height and not reach , which meant my knees touched the dashboard when I sat at my ideal arm distance . <p> But that said , there are some practical touches in the Pajero 's passenger quarters too , for instance the extendable flap in the sunvisors which allows you to block out the sun along the entire length of the side window . The extra-large storage bin between the front seats is a great feature too , as it takes heaps of clutter . <p> Handy too is the third row of seats which turns the long-wheelbase Pajero into a seven-seater when needed , but folds out of sight into the floor when not . <p> These rear seats stow away completely flat and do n't affect luggage space , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of the age factor this is a luxury-specced package and all derivatives come with modern niceties such as a multi-function steering wheel , Bluetooth , voice control , cruise control , automatic climate control , and a radio/CD/MP3 touchscreen audio system with USB and Aux support . <p> ABS brakes , stability control and six airbags provide the peace-of-mind , and the Pajero has a 5-Star Euro NCAP safety rating . The price includes a three-year ort 100 000km warranty and a five-year or 100 000km maintenance plan , with service intervals every 10 000km . <p> VERDICT <p> The age lines are showing but the iconic Mitsubishi Pajero is still a vehicle you 'd put on a shortlist for a continent-crossing cruise on a range of unfriendly surfaces .

@@2966237 <h> Du Preez using column to score cheap points <p> Johannesburg - On December 30 , the last Tuesday of 2014 , the Cape Times , Pretoria News , Diamond Fields Advertiser and The Mercury carried a column by former Independent Media columnist Max du Preez titled " Zuma -- SA 's one man wrecking ball " . <p> The column pulled no punches in its criticism of the leadership of President Jacob Zuma . I can summarise the gist and tone of Du Preez 's column in the following quote : <p> " The devastation caused by that one-man wrecking ball -- Jacob Zuma -- will take years to rebuild , even if he were to leave office tomorrow . <p> Sounds a bit harsh ? Well , I do n't think the serious damage this president has inflicted upon our political culture and our key institutions deserves softer condemnation . " <p> The piece hauled Zuma over the coals for crises experienced in various state institutions , as well as his own personal weaknesses including corruption allegations . It ended by dubbing time in office as " Zuma Demolition Inc " . <p> The presidency was obviously not pleased , and issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not seeking their comment , and demanding a retraction of the piece from us as Independent Media . <p> I refused this demand point blank . <p> As a company we issued a statement asserting the right of all our columnists to hold and write whatever opinions they like , and our right as a media company to publish them . Our short statement simply said : " Columns and opinion pieces are covered in the press code under comment and the practice is that newspapers are not required to seek a response to comment pieces as long as it passes the test of fair comment . We stand by Mr Du Preez and his and our independence in this regard . " <p> On that note , the matter should have been closed as far as we were concerned , except that Zuma 's spokesman Mac Maharaj wrote an e-mail to me pointing out that Du Preez 's column had stated as a matter of fact that Zuma had " a corrupt relationship " with his financial adviser and convicted fraudster Schabir Shaik , something which the column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To understand the importance of this , you need to recall that in the months following Shaik 's conviction in 2005 , the media had taken to reporting that the trial judge , Hilary Squires , had found that the two enjoyed " a generally corrupt relationship " . This continued until Squires wrote to Business Day , where I worked at the time , pointing out that he had never said anything of the sort . Even the Supreme Court of Appeal had erroneously ascribed this " quote " to Squires . At the time , a minor brouhaha resulted over this , although the higher court upheld Shaik 's conviction and Squires described their relationship as " a mutually beneficial symbiosis " . <p> Maharaj seized upon this and accused both us and Du Preez of perpetuating the untruth of a trial judge concluding there was a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Zuma . After careful consideration of the facts , and after communicating with Du Preez , I decided to issue a retraction of the " corrupt relationship " phrase in the column . Two primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found anything relating to the relationship between Shaik and Zuma is n't a matter of opinion , it is a factual claim . It therefore needs to be 100% accurate , and the information upon which it rests must be unambiguous and not open to interpretation . <p> By any reasonable interpretation , Du Preez 's assertion that " a judge " had found there was a corrupt relationship is a reference to trial judge Squires , who publically repudiated this claim . <p> This last point is important because in subsequent exchanges , Du Preez has implausibly argued that he meant the SCA , not the original trial judge . In my view , if this was the case , he would have supported the factual claim of a " corrupt relationship " finding by referring to " a court " , " the SCA " , or " judges " ( five judges of the SCA heard the Shaik appeal and wrote the judgment ) . As an experienced writer , journalist and editor , it is unlikely that Du Preez would have allowed the ambiguity of referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be aware of the ' generally corrupt relationship ' controversy of 2006 . <p> In his explanation of the use of an ambiguous phrase , Du Preez says he was referring to Justice CT Howie of the SCA , who read the court 's judgment on behalf of the full bench of five judges . This is a highly dishonest ex post facto summersault . What Justice Howie read out can not be described as the " the words of a judge " . It was the finding of a court . <p> Whether it is embarrassment at having repeated an eight-year old mistake , or sheer hubris , that makes Du Preez refuse to concede that he can make even the tiniest error , I will never know . But it is indicative of a general absence of self-reflection in our media and a refusal to hold ourselves to the same standards of probity we aggressively demand of others . It seems the notoriously thin skins of our politicians are matched only by those of our journalists and editors . <p> On reflection , the " corrupt relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of a bigger whole . Even in our correction and apology , we were unequivocal about defending the rest of the column , and upholding Du Preez 's right to express whatever opinion he holds about Zuma and his presidency . That includes his right to spew out deeply racist statements such as this : " the debt Zuma owed to those who put him in power and his obvious view that he was more of an African chief than the president of a modern democracy led him on a different path . " <p> Du Preez has since sought in public to use our retraction of that statement and our apology for its inaccuracy to score cheap political points , and to posture as the victim of censorship and thought control by myself and Independent Media . The ' letter of resignation ' that he sent to me and made public is absurdly dishonest , but also reveals a long held intention to disassociate from Independent for political reasons . While he is well within his rights to hold views and political outlooks that are different to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group if he wants to , he has disingenuously sought to present his disenchantment as a matter of " principle " . The only principle at stake here is our principled duty to be accurate , and to own up when we 've erred . It 's a principle I value , while he clearly does not . <p> Lastly , Du Preez 's resignation has become a rallying point for the malcontents and closet racists , both in and outside newsrooms and media houses , who resent the acquisition of a significant media asset such as Independent by black owners , and who have at every turn sought to challenge and limit our right to make what changes we see fit inside the group . <p> Ultimately the most disappointing , even shocking , thing about Du Preez 's public tantrum is a sense of entitlement and superiority so deeply ingrained that he asserts not only his right to an opinion , but claims the right to have his own facts too .

@@2969233 <h> Top cop in Facebook hot water <p> Cape Town - A war of words that played out on Facebook between two senior Western Cape policemen over politics is under investigation and police management has warned that officers need to watch what they say on social media . <p> This week , police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said members who used social media in their official capacity were regulated by directives . <p> " Any action or activity which may tarnish the image of SAPS is strongly condemned , " he said . <p> Traut said police were investigating whether any police regulations were violated during an online spat between Major General Jeremy Vearey , who heads up the province 's operation that focuses on gangsterism , and Ivan Myers , a former commander of the police 's dog unit in Cape Town . <p> Myers was dismissed from the position in 2007 for apparently talking to the media about malnourished dogs . <p> Facebook profile pictures of both Vearey and Myers this week showed them in police uniform . <p> A week ago , Vearey attended the ANC 's 103rd birthday celebrations at the Green Point stadium and this led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph taken from inside the stadium where seats could be seen filled with ANC supporters .

@@2969234 <p> So are African lives less important to the international community than Western lives ? Following the worldwide attention given to the Paris killings by Islamic militants , it 's a question being widely asked and generally answered in the affirmative . <p> The refrain is that while fewer than two dozen French were killed , during that same week the Islamic terror group Boko Haram slayed 2 000 Nigerians , an event that occurred against a backdrop of distinct international indifference . But it 's not that simple . Although an insidious Western imperialism remains widespread , there is in this case no easy arithmetic proof . <p> Something remarkable happened last weekend in France . In excess of three million French people buttoned down fears for their personal safety and took to the streets . It was the biggest march since that celebrating their 1945 liberation from Nazi occupation . <p> Nominally , they were marching in solidarity with a dozen satirists and the police officers trying to protect them , and four shoppers in a Jewish supermarket -- all murdered by Islamic militants . The march , however , was far more than a commemoration or show of defiance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , in that political ennui is pervasive . French politicians are as craven , uninspiring , petty and self-serving as those that one finds anywhere else . The resulting voter disillusionment and distaste have translated , as elsewhere in the European Union , into steadily dropping election turnouts -- from 82% in 1946 to 55% in 2012 . <p> Now suddenly , it seems from the posters , the chants , songs and interviews , that the marchers once more found inspiration and solace in the values of the famous revolution that more than two centuries ago brought them democracy . The 1789 overthrow of absolutist monarchy , despite the violence and excess that was to follow , was embodied in its cri de couer of Libert ? ! Egalit ? ! Fraternit ? ! <p> Sunday 's march was in similar spirit about shoulder-to-shoulder fraternity with those under attack , encapsulated in the Je suis Charlie banners and , most movingly , by the Je suis Juif banners carried by Muslims and others who were clearly not Jewish . <p> This march was about the liberty to offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- note well , African National Congress sycophants -- your president . And , finally , it was about a belated realisation that unless there was true equality in today 's France for all hues and faiths , the ghettos would continue to breed fanatics and terrorists . <p> There is then a political universality to what happened in Paris , and in dozens of other French cities and towns , that transcends the effects of just another , however shocking , terrorist attack of the kind that happens with varying degrees of severity all the time . <p> Africa correspondent Simon Allison writes in the Daily Maverick that while there are many good excuses for the fact that even Nigerian media gave the Paris killings more coverage than the killings in their own country , it is a shameful " symbol of how we as Africans neglect Africa 's own tragedies , and prioritise Western lives over our own " . <p> That 's only partly true . The French rally because they believe doing so will make a real difference . <p> Unfortunately , the Nigerian deaths stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , political and social institutions that do not function properly and will not function properly in the foreseeable future . So in response to the Nigerian killings there are no African solidarity marches , no obsessive African media analysis , no great show of solidarity by African leaders , because there would be no point . <p> To rally would be a triumph of optimism over experience . African political ennui and passivity are widespread because democracy , where it exists , is not yet vibrant enough to force the political elites in most countries to respond . <p> It is futile to expect the world to wring its hands over our tragedies when we not only sullenly accept them , but have come to expect them . If we as Africans ca n't or wo n't help ourselves , why should the world give a damn ? <p> Some of the world 's leaders descended onto the streets of Paris during a unity rally following the Charlie Hebdo killings . ( Reuters ) <p> Allison points to the " egregious hypocrisy " of Gabonese president Ali Bongo Ondimba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while violently suppressing those same rights at home . There 's another egregious hypocrisy that is even closer to home . <p> After some delay , President Jacob Zuma 's government issued a statement condemning the " calculated and barbaric " Paris terrorism . " Such deliberate attacks against journalists and the public contravene international law and constitute a crime against humanity , " he said . <p> Fine sentiments , but how credible ? They come from an administration that steadily erodes press freedom in South Africa . From a leader who has repeatedly used swingeing defamation claims to intimidate cartoonists and journalists . From a political alliance which appeared tacitly to condone populist violence when two men defaced The Spear , a painting depicting Zuma as a venal autocrat , and today argue for laws to protect presidential " dignity " . <p> There is another French lesson in all this . The Spear satirised Zuma as Russia 's Lenin . Perhaps more appropriate would have been Louis XIV , the pre-revolutionary French monarch who proclaimed boastfully : " I am the state " . <p> as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball ' around then how can the west take africa seriously ? <p> DoubtManhingi <p> I couldnt agree more . It is most galling to think the AU or any other African body has not shown solidarity with victims of terrorism on the continent . Goodluck Jonathan in January2015 finally went to Chibok , a whole 9 months after they were abducted . Not to mention Goodluck 's wife berating those using #bringbackourgirls . Ali Bongo was in France showing solidarity with the French and yet has not been anywhere near his neighbours Nigeria to do the same . It is embarrassing . <p> Sibusiso <p> Sadly there is far too much African passivity . Africa has never shaken off the shackles of tribalism , feudalism , let alone colonialism , and it wo n't get to shake off religious extremism . <p> Gary Bing <p> There may be additional factors , other than just " African passivity " . As you say its " not that simple " . As with the Sydney incident it came out of the blue seemingly , i.e. it was huge jolt to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is variously touted as an incident with global implications . i.e. a conflict between the ' West ' and radical Islam . To take the ' African ' out of this equation consider the almost regular reports of crazed mass shootings in the USA to which the world and the USA itself seems to be ' getting used to ' as it were . <p> David Klompas <p> I could n't agree more , Marthinus . <p> Zuma is an indictment on the symbol of our democratic society . He constantly contradicts himself ( at the beginning of his term he went on record to say that Apartheid is not to be blamed for our countries ills , and then tells us that South Africa 's problems began " when Jan van Riebeck landed in the Cape " ) . <p> And the scariest part about my above statement is that Zuma may easily be considered moderate when compared to other African leaders such as Robert Mugabe ( our wonderful Zimbabwean friend ) , Paul Biya ( the Cameroonian dictator who 's been in office for 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most corrupt nation in the world ) . <p> How can we expect the Western world to respect us when we do n't even have the political will required to hold our leaders accountable for their actions ? <p> Tuesday Is Soylent Green Day <p> The AU is nothing more than what the OAU was -- an old boys ' club for dictators . <p> Zolani Ngwane <p> " Unfortunately , the Nigerian deaths stand in stark contrast because they are the direct result of state , political and social institutions that do not function properly and will not function properly in the foreseeable future ... " Let us not go to the fact that many French people from the Neo-Nazi far right to the socialist far left , would characterize their country in much same words -- after all the decline in voter confidence you cited predated the recent attacks and most people would not easily credit radical Islam for that . Instead I want to appreciate the confidence , finality and certitude or , to use your words , " easy arithmetic proof , " with which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Islam that has kept your " west " on its toes for decades now . At stake , when it comes to the west , are universal principles such as " the liberty to offend your neighbor , " etc . There is , when it comes to Africa , a nativist explanation , something inherent in the very quality of its political institutions and leadership . Do n't get me wrong . Africa is in a mess . But in this case at least Nigeria , just like France and the US , is under assault by a similar force -- and it is no more locally bred in the Nigerian case than it is in the others . I remember how , shortly after the 9/11 attacks , those of us who cancelled classes and held teach-ins instead to allow students talk about the tragedy , found it difficult and perhaps irresponsible to arrive at " easy arithmetic proofs " ( there were already many of those floating around ) by making one-to-one correspondence between the " American deaths " on that September morning and the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the experiences of others in other parts of the world . Whatever one thought of American foreign policy , what ever one thinks of French internal politics and , I would suggest , whatever one thinks of Nigeria 's political institutions ( and Africa 's apathy for that matter ) , there is a new kind of violent politics that affects us all and for which there is indeed no " easy arithmetic proof .

@@2999233 <h> How Costa is becoming the new Suarez <p> REUTERSChelsea 's Diego Costa appears to stamp on Liverpool 's Martin Skrtel during their English League Cup semi-final second leg soccer match at Stamford Bridge . Photo : Eddie Keogh <p> London - No one has elbowed their way to the top quite as literally as Diego Costa . " I grew up thinking it was normal , " he once said when asked about his robust style . The arm out , the foot left in , he was at it again during Chelsea 's Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night . <p> And having got him this far , he is unlikely to change now , even after he was charged on Wednesday night by the FA over his stamp on Liverpool 's Emre Can . No wonder comparisons are being drawn with Luis Suarez , another tempestuous South American whose Premier League career was marked by controversy and brilliant goalscoring feats . <p> Speak to Costa 's former coaches at the nine clubs he has represented in the past six years and listen to the voices of those who grew up around the headstrong youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taken on by a club 's youth system , and the message is always one of wanting him on your side , as opposed to against you . <p> The sentiments are perhaps best summed up by Mario Suarez , who played alongside Costa when he was on loan at Celta Vigo in 2008 and shared a dressing room with him again at Atletico Madrid . " The way he changes from nice guy to brute on the pitch is the essence of Diego Costa , " he said . <p> That was in evidence when he appeared to spit into his glove and fling the spittle at Real Madrid 's Sergio Ramos during a clash between the Spanish rivals . <p> And last year , Costa 's family and friends told Canal Plus how their son was to be feared once the ball started rolling in the neighbourhood games he organised . " He was always a bit aggressive and we would say , ' Calm down ' , " said his father Jose de Jesus . <p> " They had to be on the same side for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa 's mum Josileide of Diego 's tussles with older brother Jair , who was considered the better player until his younger sibling began to fill out . <p> " The thing is he never went to a football school in Brazil , he only ever learned on the street , " explained Jair . " People would come from other neighbourhoods to play , sometimes they would turn up having had a few drinks and it could get violent . " <p> It was with that rough and ready football education behind him that Costa began to have trials , although the first one with Lagartense went so badly he almost turned his back on the game . <p> " I did n't want to play football anymore , " he told El Pais . " I wanted to start earning some pocket money . " <p> He went to live in Sao Paulo , where he worked for his uncle Jarminho , making trips to the Paraguayan border to buy cheap replica brands and bring them back to sell . He was every bit as streetwise off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a second trial , this time with Barcelona Esportivo Capela in Sao Paulo . He was accepted and soon a Portuguese agent working for Jorge Mendes was sent to watch him , although there was a disciplinary twist to his breakthrough . <p> He told El Pais : " I should n't even have been playing in the game because I had picked up a four-month ban for hitting a rival and then going for the referee . But the day the Mendes scout came to watch me my coach told me : " I do n't know if it is an error but you have been cleared to play " . ' <p> When Costa took his streetfighter style to Europe , there would be sparks , but the impressive thing about his rise is that he learned to stop getting sent off . <p> In his first 130 games in Spain he saw red six times and picked up 43 yellow cards . After a season on loan at Celta Vigo , he was sent to Albacete , also in Spain 's no-frills second division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Castelo was a journalist covering the club that season and is now Albacete 's head of communications . <p> " Costa was anarchic , " he says . " He was the wild man you see now , only then he did n't know how to apply the brakes . <p> " He would take on all-comers , even team-mates sometimes , telling centre back Sebastian Corona he had put his boots on the wrong feet during one game when his clearances were all going out of play . " <p> But Costa 's personality was turning him into a leader . <p> Castelo says : ' Albacete would probably have gone down had it not been for Diego that season . You could see he was destined for greater things . He played his way into the affections of everyone and he never forgot the club . <p> " Several years later , when Atletico faced Albacete in the Cup and were knocked out by the minnows , Costa went into the visitors ' dressing room and congratulated all the Albacete players for making it to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his season at Albacete and by the time he moved on to Valladolid for his third loan spell , under the guidance of Jose Luis Mendilibar , he was learning to control himself . " He will always have that little bit of nastiness all strikers need , " says Mendilibar . " It is important he does n't lose that , but he 's clever with it now . He knows when to step back from the edge . " <p> Costa 's fourth loan club in Spain would be Rayo Vallecano . He had suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the 2011-12 season but by January 2012 he was showing Rayo coach Jose Sandoval just what he was made of . <p> " When our sporting director Felipe Minambres said we had the chance to take a striker who had n't played for five months because of injury , I said , " Well , who is it ? " As soon as he told me it was Costa , I said , " Give me the phone , I 'll call him myself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew he could do a job for us . " <p> Costa came on at half-time in his first game and scored against Zaragoza , as well as getting two opponents booked . He was learning to make sure the yellow cards were not for him . <p> " Next game we played Getafe at home and his mum was there to watch him . He scored the second goal and I took him off before the end because I knew what would happen , ' says Sandoval . <p> " The whole stadium rose and sang his name . He came in next day and told me I 'd made his mum the happiest person in the world . " <p> Costa went on to score 10 goals in the second half of the 2011-12 season and Sandoval says : " The players took to him . If he went down injured in a session on a Thursday there would be panic even among his rivals for a place . No-one wanted him unavailable . " <p> Some saw him as just a thuggish forward but Sandoval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was giving him a pep talk and telling him he could be in the top three in the world , " he says . " One of my assistants said , " Quite the picture you painted for him ! " But I said I meant every word . If Costa got half a metre ahead it was impossible to stop him . " <p> Having become such a warrior on the pitch , two things were perhaps inevitable : firstly coach Diego Simeone would want Costa back at Atletico ; secondly that his agent Mendes 's good friend and client , Jose Mourinho , would begin to think about how he could land Costa , if not for Real Madrid then certainly upon his return to Chelsea . <p> Costa became the symbol of defiance at Atletico as they won La Liga . His famous collision with a post during a game against Getafe had some supporters believing they might have to win the league without him . <p> But Simeone spoke about more damage having been done to the post . Costa had his family worried as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leg . But while they fretted , Costa was videoing the treatment he was receiving and sending it to brother Jair . You can hear the physio saying : ' OK Diego , you can see the bone but it 's all fine . Pass me the staple gun . ' <p> Along with that fearlessness , Costa seems immune to criticism and that was just as well when in 2013 he turned his back on Brazil and pledged allegiance to Spain . <p> " If a Brazilian player wants to be left out of a game for his country ahead of a World Cup in his country then he is automatically discarded , " announced Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari on national television when Costa defected . <p> " If Spain win the World Cup with a goal from Costa , it will be difficult for us , " his dad told Canal Plus . He need n't have worried . <p> BBC Brazil editor Julio Gomes says : " I do n't think anyone really saw him as a traitor and those who follow European football see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back in trouble for his antics at Stamford Bridge but at Chelsea he has found his home with Mourinho , who loves big personalities . <p> They do n't come much bigger than Diego Costa . <p> Daily Mail <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@2999240 <h> Uncategorized <h> Let 's cook the rich ... err just not me ... <p> Perhaps it 's time to look beyond power cuts . <p> Mike Sch ? **25;1803;TOOLONG January 2015&amp;nbsp11:27 <p> This being the beginning of a year in which we will have many power cuts and a few state-owned bailouts , we all need to get some relief from bad news . Even the president needs a break from Julius and most businessmen just need a break even if it is the start of another slow growth year . <p> So I decided to give readers some light relief from the bad news by spreading hate -- of the rich ! Of course you need to decide whether you are on the rich or hate side . <p> American writer PJ O'Rourke said it first that we must eat the rich and in that tradition , I wish you to join me in this feast of eating the rich . <p> Misreading Tim Noakes the other day I came across some calorie data that every trader needs to know . You get good calories and bad calories . Bread , pap and orange juice are bad calories and should be avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good calories . <p> The debate about rich and poor is certainly getting a lot of attention and we need to get with the program -- hate them or get eaten . Every CEO and trader needs to know how all this fits in and that money is very important in deciding your diet or which part of your body will get served . <p> Something about being in the top 1% makes people very angry when they compare themselves to others . Many want the rich to be taxed ever more to help the 99% at the bottom . <p> Credit Suisse has collected much data which has been used by NGOs like Oxfam International to point out that the richest 86 people on the planet have the same wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion . <p> Richer folk fearing pitchforks and inexperienced chefs , have pointed out that giving away all the wealth of the top 86 people would only increase the wealth of the bottom 3.5 billion by $500 each , which in the bigger scheme of things is not much . In many cases it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ! <p> Those fearing the big black pot also point out that most of them are old now and their wealth has taken decades of hard work , luck and savings and that old rich backsides are tasteless and tough . <p> Oxfam says that it is trying its very best to keep these folks from the big burning pot on the fire and that if they just give some away to people like Oxfam they could possibly avoid being eaten . <p> The global wealth Gini was 0.893 in 2011 , according to an OECD paper . This means that just 2% of the world owns half the wealth -- a bit different to Oxfam data -- but interesting nonetheless . <p> The global household wealth averaged $51 078 in 2011 at official exchange rates and much lower using Purchase Power Parity rates . The then official exchange rate would mean that the average Swiss adult has more than ten times the average world household wealth . Assuming two adults make a typical household , it seems Heidi 's homeland is at least 21 times richer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world circa 2007 <p> With the Swiss National Bank allowing everyone with more than a few dollars to buy the now very expensive Swiss Franc , the average Swiss household with two adults is now around 26 times the average household wealth . The Swiss are certainly in the top 5% or top 3% on average . At least if we eat the Swiss we can add some nice cheese to the fondue pot . <p> In South Africa , using purchase power parity and not market exchange rates , if you lived in a small suburban home and had about R200 000 in a pension fund and say a small car and R100 000 in other household possessions such as furniture , computers and kitchen goods , that would put you in the top 5.08% of the world . Perhaps you would just need to lose an arm and a leg to help the rest of the world . <p> If you stayed in an average South African suburban house that is paid off and had R500 000 in a pension fund and about R300 000 in motor vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world in wealth terms . <p> Using data from the biggest townships in the six metropolitan areas of South Africa , if you have a " matchbox " house and an average pension fund holding , as well as R150 000 in other possessions ( a small car , laptop , mobile phone and furniture ) , you would be in the richest 7.5% of the world population ! <p> Pension Assets to GDP <p> Staying in a large house , having saved R1.5 million in pension , driving a C Class and reading on an iPad would put one in the top 2.5% of the world . <p> With over 9 million households owning their own homes in South Africa and over 15 million pension fund accounts as well as a third of households owning a car , it is clear that South Africans are on top of the world -- so to speak regarding wealth . <p> Mutual funds own 40% of the stock exchange and much of government debt and we have sizable holdings of foreign assets too . With over 22 million bank accounts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans have a more than reasonable assets base . Add some BEE holdings and stockvels to this and it 's safe to say the pitchforks are coming for us South Africans ! <p> For a relatively young country that is rather a big achievement , and certainly if one includes the wealth of a second home that one in three African households have , it is likely that as much as 40% of South African adults could make it into the top 10% of world population when measured by assets . <p> In context it seems that a fairly small R125 000 house and below average pension assets with an old second hand car and a few other items will put one in the top 14% or so . I would guess that the typical household with an own home in SA would quite easily be in the top 15% when measured by asset wealth . <p> But then for reasons that are at least partly historical and partly system dependant , South Africans have been asset rich . We love home ownership and we have always saved for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of welfare payments and the like . <p> Big earnings go to pot <p> On the income side I know that we are not doing quite as well as we have one of the highest income Gini 's . Also we are told that the bosses and the workers have some of the highest differences in reward in the world today . <p> Moreover , income distribution is very different to wealth distribution . Income is spread much fairer and the income differences are in relative terms coming down in the world as a whole but getting worse within countries , according to research by Branko Milanovic when looking at individuals across some 150 countries . <p> Global inequality is worked out using purchase power parity for each country and the individual staying in that country is then compared to the rest of the individuals in the world . <p> Firstly the global income Gini co-efficient was 0.7 in 2008 . This meant that about 8% of the world earned half the world 's income and the other 92% earned the other half . In a country like the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn 50% and the other 78% earn the other 50% of American income . <p> So one would think that South Africans are poor in a world context or at least that is how the crowds screaming outside your office would have you believe . <p> Using a total net pay of about R8 500pm ( after taxes but including pension payments ) would put one in the top 5% of the world 's adults ! That is the salary of many a factory worker , bus drivers and certainly less than a teacher gets . <p> In fact on the global database a teacher at a state school with about eight years ' experience and a four year degree would be in the top 1% of earners in the world , according to globalrichlist.com . We do not of course think of teachers in South Africa as rich but in global purchase power parity terms that does appear to be the case . <p> The poor principal would be so rich the only way he can redeem himself is by being eaten alive ! Executives at Eskom or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast of live human Sushi as they could arguably make the top 0.02% or top million . <p> But as we are busy heating the fire to cook the rich we may need to look at a middle manager in a private company or a director in the public service taking home say R300 000 after taxes . They certainly are in the top 0.25% ! <p> An interesting fact according to this data from Oxfam ; the South African who just misses out on paying personal income tax would make the top 11% of the world richest income earners . <p> So my fellow South Africans , most of you who pay taxes will have to give something up if the world ate the richest 10% . <p> We can concentrate on the differences and see big gaps between earnings but we can also see that many South Africans who have formal work end up rather on the wealthy side of the world . <p> Context is a wonderful thing and the data from actual payrolls and other administrative sources shows how rich we are in a global context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries are rich ! We are rich in assets too as both home ownership and pension assets show SA amongst the top in these categories and above the average in car ownership . <p> Perhaps it 's time to look beyond power cuts and the work at hand in the beginning of a year and take stock of what we have in assets and in what we earn to be able to afford them .

@@3023232 Aussies some new tricks <p> Gallo ImagesHashim Amla said after the West Indies series that Imran Tahir had revolutionised the way South Africa played one-day cricket . <p> There was an exchange at the Waca nets in Perth last year between Imran Tahir and one of the Proteas ' coaching staff that went something like this : <p> Coaching staff member : " That seems to be coming out nicely , Immy . Which one was that ? " <p> Tahir : " Leggie . The one than does n't spin too much . " <p> Staff member : " Oh . How many leggies do you have ? <p> Tahir : " Two . One that spins a lot , and one that does n't . " <p> Staff member : " Oh . How many different balls can you bowl ? " <p> Tahir : " About seven . " <p> Staff member : " Seven ! ? " <p> Tahir : " Yes . " <p> Tahir then proceeded to show off his variations . <p> The two leg-breaks . The two different googlies -- a big spinning one , and the other spun less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . The latter needs work . However , the top spinner is a thing of beauty -- ask Dwayne Smith who had no clue about it as the ball crashed into his pads trapping him lbw in the first One-Day International against the West Indies in Durban last month . <p> Tahir has variations of his variations , too , mainly on account of the different speeds at which he bowls the ball although he also has a round-arm googly as well and two " sliders " ( they look like top-spinners but apparently are n't ) . He could have 10 different kinds of deliveries . Only he really knows . Seven will do for now , though . <p> The key for him has been learning how to utilise all those options . Too often he wants to try a different delivery in each ball of an over . <p> It 's been his biggest problem in Test cricket , where patience is indeed a virtue . Tahir does n't have a lot of that , and so has struggled in the Test arena . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide in 2012 , he thinks he has to attack more , bowl a big-spinning googly or rip his leg-break . So his captains ca n't trust him . <p> But in the limited-overs formats it 's an entirely different player who comes to the fore . <p> Hashim Amla said after the West Indies series that Tahir had " revolutionised " the way South Africa played one-day cricket . A side that were generally conservative , once their new-ball bowlers had finished their work upfront , now has a bowler whose main aim is to take wickets . So , first under Graeme Smith and then AB de Villiers , came the realisation that there was no point setting bog standard defensive fields any more . <p> Tahir 's style pushed them into being more aggressive and with the rules of One-Day Internationals changing too , particularly the restriction on four fielders being on the boundary outside of the Power Play overs , South Africa have set more attacking fields , and Tahir has thrived . <p> " Immy , in a way , is kind of our key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . <p> " It takes unbelievable skill to do the things he is able to do , " said Kirsten . <p> The attacking option Tahir provides after the two new balls have lost some shine has been a crucial part of the side 's strategy since he made his debut at the previous tournament in India . <p> There was a lot of hype surrounding his selection , but four years ago the management decided to " hide " him ahead of the World Cup . He made his ODI debut in South Africa 's opening match against the West Indies in New Delhi and , after a nervous first spell of two overs that went for 13 , he finished with 4/41 from 10 overs . <p> That World Cup may have ended badly for South Africa , but Tahir had quickly established himself in the side , ending the tournament with 14 wickets from five matches at an average of 10.71 . <p> So it was a little strange that Tahir was n't part of South Africa 's ODI plans after the World Cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did make his Test debut in late 2011 against Australia . <p> He only returned to the ODI set-up in 2013 when South Africa faced the land of his birth , Pakistan , in the UAE . <p> As De Villiers has grown more accustomed to the captaincy , so he has learned to use Tahir in different ways . <p> Because he is such an attacking player , the South African captain is n't afraid to throw him the ball in the batting Power Play , and in the last few years he 's become an option at the " death " too . <p> Tahir , whose 19-year career has seen him represent 28 different teams , has also learned to go beyond merely operating on feel and instinct . <p> " I 've learned that you must have a plan before the game , " he said in an interview earlier this season . <p> The team 's performance analyst , Prasanna Agoram , has played a major role in assisting Tahir develop better strategies . <p> " I must give credit to Prasanna . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has helped to show me how and where to bowl to the ( opposition ) . <p> " Before that I just used to bowl . There were no plans and I did n't know what to do . You go on a non-turning wicket and you 're trying to spin the ball . Obviously that 's difficult . " <p> Tahir 's skill and improved know-how have been apparent when looking at the numbers besides the wickets column . <p> Among spinners since 2013 , his economy rate ( average runs conceded per over ) is 4.50 , bettered only by Saeed Ajmal , Sunil Narine and Mohammed Hafeez -- who have all faced questions over their actions -- and Sri Lanka 's Rangana Herath . <p> In the last 10 overs of an innings , his economy rate ( since 2013 ) is 5.29 . <p> If , as bowling coach Allan Donald recently stated , South Africa are looking to be " unpredictable " at the " death " , then that kind of number from Tahir may see him increasingly become part of South Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outstanding job , " mused Kirsten about that option . <p> Tahir , 35 , is skirting under the shadows somewhat of South Africa 's much more renowned pace attack .

@@3023239 <h> Frank Talks : Is Curro truly about race ? <p> 08 February 2015 , 20:15 <p> As the news filtered that a Pretoria privately-owned primary school named Curro private school had begun its new school year with sweeping changes unlike any other institutions of learning in the country , I initially sided for eerie caution due to the delicacy of this sudden furore surrounding what had transpired at the heart of our capital . Needless to say my opinion on this matter had n't been far removed from my initial point of departure . Racism is still very much alive and kicking . <p> The Curro foundation school had just instituted a class segregation system based upon racial lines for the new school year citing concerns of a growing influx of children of colour being enrolled at the school . In fact , so disconcerting was this development that the school actually folded as a result of rising pressure from the school governing body among other deeply concerned parents . <p> Who felt their school was proverbially going to the dogs as their children 's privileged educational experience was being overrun by these outsiders so to speak . Basically the chickens had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franon artistically as would an Italian Renaissance painter ; overlooked the canvass of the post-colonial complex with vigorous conviction . Inasmuch as Fanon dedicated his life 's work on issues on race and the indignation suffered by his people , for the better part of history . His experience , like mine or any other for that matter ca n't and should no longer be muted at dinner tables nor at social and political gatherings . <p> The harsh truth now stands visibly naked for all to see . To put it simply , the divisive elements of these very hardened truths have met the full scrutiny they so rightly deserve . Their mask of incredulity have masqueraded through history for far too long . Enough is enough actually . If not for humanities sake - for their children 's sake so they can show themselves to us and not unto us like their forefathers did . <p> The elemental issues of race have not only degenerated our conceptual orientation within the broader society at large but now it turns out we can have primary institutions of learning like Curro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely recite if ever their alphabets front to back- back to front - let alone discern what is clearly right or wrong with our society . How sick and demented are we ? <p> That we allow race to remain a fixture in the youngest of the youngest of our kind even at the very onset of racial integration ? Herein lies a deeper psychological problem . For race has truly reared it 's ugly head once again it seems . Therefore , the succinct question arises : Is being black being different or is being black made to be different ? That my reader , I shall leave to your own measured devices . <p> To be more candid about it , Dr Chris van der Merwe , the founder of the school belatedly went further in search for moral qualifiers for this inherently obtuse system by insisting it was n't an issue of race but rather trying to establish unique educational experiences based on racial lines . The architects of Apartheid would n't be anymore the prouder of such a system of racial division . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the learners guidebook then I do n't know what does . <p> Given the fact that the rainbow nation facade has taken another bitter blow to it 's already faulty armour , and like a wounded soldier South Africa 's narrative has yet another moral question to address . Do we soldier on the " good fight " of false pretensions shielded by a nation building pretext ushered under post-1994 euphoria or do we rewrite the whole edifice of race completely and start anew ? <p> These are rather searching questions that require a nationally driven debate of critical proportion . While the agencies of these hardened truths that now visibly stand stark naked as Fanon emphatically unpacked in his seminal text must stand trial with their sins on their sleeves . If not in the physical sense , they ought to search deep down within themselves for humanness ; compassion , love , honesty reflection and contemplation . Basically , humanity must prevail here . We like them , must also awaken deep inside ourselves a sense of heated and rather necessary reflections too . In order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly true that their reflections must appear to be naked - absent of any visible garments that may hide in plain sight - so must their true objections and honest feelings about what South Africa do they like we want our children 's children to grow up in ?

By thinking deeply of our loved ones . <p> However pointed this write-up may have been , lest we forget , othering goes both ways because clearly the rainbow nation narrative much like its apparatuses of transition such the Truth and Reconciliation were necessary but hardly sufficient devices for change .

No , not just a victory over the Bulls at Loftus , but the manner in which the Cape side 's forwards dominated the scrums and physical battle to record one of the biggest upsets between these old foes . <p> The odds were stacked against Allister Coetzee 's team as the Bulls had 13 Springboks in their match-23 compared to the four of the Stormers . But no one gave the tight-five of Steven Kitshoff , Scarra Ntubeni , Vincent Koch , Jean Kleyn and Ruan Botha the script , and they proceeded to outsmart the Bulls as they never took a step back in the scrums , competed well in the lineouts and were relentless in carrying the ball up or tackling to secure a memorable 29-17 win . <p> And they were backed up by the powerful loose trio of captain Duane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked tirelessly on defence and carried the ball strongly up the middle . <p> Not even a second half wobble that brought the Bulls to within three points could deny the Stormers as replacement No 10 Kurt Coleman slotted a difficult late penalty and a drop goal . <p> " It was an absolutely pleasing result for us , especially in light of the fact that we had been written off completely .

He also made Vermeulen 's try with a lovely dummy and well-timed pass . <p> Fullback Cheslin Kolbe and wing Dillyn Leyds were n't far behind as they dealt superbly with the aerial onslaught from the Bulls kickers , and were dangerous on the counter-attack . <p> " We 've always been striving to get the balance right , but the big thing was that we played in the right areas .

What started out as a poor man 's Grand Theft Auto quickly blossomed into the direct-to-DVD equivalent of higher-budgeted , more serious games . Anarchic and not giving a damn , Saints Row is essentially a Tex Avery cartoon in the digital flesh , a no-holds barred extravaganza of violence with no limits . But for all of its anarchic tendencies and emphasis on chaos without consequences , Saints Row games have always had a direction worth following and revelling in . And with the standalone Expansion Gat Out Of Hell , that very direction has been drop-kicked into the inferno . And it 's a costly mistake . <p> It all starts out innocently enough . After the events of Saints Row 4 , the Saints find themselves jetting around the universe , until a Ouija board sucks in the Saints leader and sends him off to hell where he 'll be wed to the charmingly naive daughter of the big D himself , Satan . Ready to rescue the boss , series stalwarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves ready to tear Hell a new inferno . Along the way , players will gain access to new angelic and demonic powers , team up with the likes of Vlad the impaler and a sadistic William Shakespeare while shaking down Hell in order to find the boss . <p> In any other game , that would sound like a ridiculous premise . In Saints Row , it 's not only par for the course , but one of the more mundane setups that the franchise has delved into so far . Despite the fact that Hell looks like it was ripped straight off of an Iron Maiden cover and the city of Stillwater has been dipped in brimstone in order to create a different palette , the entire product feels lacking . <p> It 's a far cry from the super-powered mayhem of Saints Row , stripped down to its bare essentials that is disappointingly light on any content outside of some cosmetic differences . Clothing stores are nowhere to be found , so forget about giving Johnny or Kinzie some new threads . There are zero homies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio station to listen to and the lack of a mission structure only helps to emphasise these points . <p> It 's easy to blame this on the standalone expansion pack nature of the game , but at $20 , it still feels like a severely gimped experience with a vastly scaled back approach to the Saints Row formula . <p> The bulk of the gameplay comes from players needing to gain the attention of Satan . To do so , they 'll need to fill a bar up that is known as " Satan 's Wrath " , which will eventually progress the story . To get that bar filled up , players will need to engage in the usual antics of a Saint , such as collecting fraudulent insurance from the damned by literally throwing them underneath the bus , causing mass mayhem with designated weapons and flying through races with your new angelic powers , which are merely re-skinned variants of Saints Row 4 's powers . <p> At least that much is unspoiled , as players can still find themselves pouring lead into numerous demons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb-stomping their faces into a higher plane of existence .

It 's not even the most charming of games in the franchise either , with the musical number of the game being the only highlight in a tale with jokes that are painfully obvious and rarely funny . <p> As an add-on that comes with the newly released Saints Row 4 : Re-Elected package , it 's an average bonus that will tide you over until the next and more fully-featured sequel .

I bought it because I 'm a sucker for Saints Row . The campaign is shorter that most that 's what she said jokes . But not too bad for the asking price . Takes even longer than three hours if you complete all the challenges . The endings though seemingly signifies that the game is ready for a reboot and I have to agree . Though stripping all the super powers in the sequel might be a big risk on their side . Hopefully they bring back the poop lorry . <p> Dutch Matrix <p> What Saints Row needs is a reboot . IV is/was a bit of fun on the side , but as a fan , I want a revamped game engine , a bigger city , a new city to be honest and maybe see some of the cast return . And a return to its gangster roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt think the map needs to be bigger though , #4 already felt distracted with the size of the map and if they can keep the same feel with a new game engine , then sure . <p> i just want the opportunity to create and decorate my own evil gangster lair , sims style . <p> Dutch Matrix <p> You do realize that the map inbetween 3 and four was the same , right ? <p> Matthew Holliday <p> yeah , but it was still more distracting in 4. the time spent on casual running around to fetch this and collect that in 4 felt more than 3 <p> So much hate .... I actually like the change in direction the franchise has gone . This way , the game does nt just feel like gta . But instead , a conglomeration of many different titles . You already have the open world crime aspect . Then they added super powers and heaven vs hell . We got the alien invasion bit . What other gameplay mechanics would you like to see next ? Im thinking a dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Robert Emporio <p> It 's possible there will be yet another tonal shift in Saints Row 5. 4 started out as an expansion of 3 , which was the start of the goofiness .

Photo : Oupa Mokoena <p> Johannesburg - The public health system , by its very character , is not kind to the millions who depend on it . The poor and uninformed are often given sub-standard treatment . <p> " They are taken for granted by staff who are either too uncommitted , exhausted or disgruntled to care enough . Their ignorance is exploited and many go home to suffer worse fates than what had sent them to hospital in the first place , " human rights activist Jackie Ntini said . <p> Women bore the brunt of the system 's shortfalls . They had many more health problems than men . <p> " They take men and children to hospital ... and when it goes wrong they care for the sick relatives who 've been failed by health care facilities , " Ntini added . <p> " The high numbers of mothers and babies lost during and immediately after childbirth is the biggest failure . <p> " Some do not die but are maimed and left with serious injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care organisation , Imphilo Yabantu , which had treated and provided counselling for many Chirwas and Maphumulos ( whose stories are featured below ) , she said . <p> They were victims of the multitude of problems which have bogged the system down .

@@3042238 <h> Health care <h> Second group of South Africans sent to West Africa <p> 17 February A second group of South African health workers are being deployed to countries affected by the latest Ebola outbreak by the government , in collaboration with the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa ( Aseowa ) , to help contain the disease . The Right to Care organisation , which partnered with the national Department of Health to send the first batch of health workers almost a month ago , says 20 nurses and three paramedics are expected to leave for Sierra Leone on 20 February . " The health workers have undergone pre-deployment training given by the African Union AU and Department of Health officials . On arrival in affected countries , they will undergo further intensive training for two weeks before embarking on their duties , " the organisation said . The AU 's commissioner of social affairs , Dr Mustapha Sidiki Kaloko , commended the South African government for sending health workers , saying that the 835 African medical personnel so far deployed by Aseowa had had a positive impact on reducing both new infections and deaths from Ebola . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AU member states , we are finding solutions to African challenges by Africans , " said Kaloko . " By representing South Africa on the mission , you will also be representing the AU and Africa in general . I am very sure that you will ? continue to make a positive impact . " <h> Emergency treatment <p> The organisation said the first group , which comprised nine professional nurses and a medical doctor , was stationed at the Goderich Emergency Ebola Treatment Centre on the outskirts of Freetown , Sierra Leone . " Since their arrival , the South Africans have already seen six discharges and lost two patients . One 36-year-old man was a typical patient . He arrived with a confirmed Ebola diagnosis . He began treatment and then ' crashed ' as often happens , but treatment was successful . He recovered and was released , walking out on his own . The youngest patient so far has been a four-year-old boy . He has been moved from the intensive care unit and is now recovering , " said Right to Care . It said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of service at treatment sites supported by the AU . When they returned to South Africa they would be observed for three weeks before they could resume normal duties . Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said while Ebola cases were decreasing , the South African effort implemented by Right to Care and supported by the South African government , the private sector and the AU was able to address Ebola fatigue . " South Africa 's involvement , which began last year , has been extensive and has included mobilising both a domestic response to prevent the entry of Ebola into South Africa as well as an external health and humanitarian assistance programme to support affected countries . " <h> Cash and in-kind contributions <p> He said the Department of Health had mobilised cash and in-kind contributions amounting to almost R60-million . " This has included setting up a diagnostic laboratory which has tested more than 6 000 specimens of those suspected of Ebola infection . The laboratory teams rotate every five weeks and are also training local personnel . " We have also provided 16 000 protection suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators , autoclaves for sterilisation and food . South Africa can be very proud of our courageous health care workers and all those that have supported the Ebola response , as they assist fellow Africans to win the fight against Ebola , " Motsoaledi said . Right to Care 's Professor Ian Sanne said South African health workers were on duty for long shifts each day , sometimes in full protective clothing and at other times working in the laboratory or fulfilling other duties . " They are learning to treat a highly infectious disease effectively . The knowledge they gain will be useful in knowing how to better treat other crisis outbreaks . " AU director of social affairs Dr Olawale Maiyegun said the most important and effective intervention with significant impact was the decreasing number of Ebola cases . Aseowa had made a huge difference . " Before their intervention , Ebola was chasing us . Thanks to Aseowa , we are now chasing Ebola .

Failure to quote that this started under our political and ideological leadership is PLAGIARISM . <p> Those who claim that we stole the struggle for economic freedom from the Youth League are also misled , because we came with it and Left with it and currently the only ones who can speak with authority about the contemporary meaning of the struggle for economic freedom in our lifetime . That is why we called the ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS . <p> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality that when it was adopted in 1955 , the Freedom Charter was never a programme of the ANC , such that when it was adopted by the ANC in 1956 , it led to a split which genuinely questioned the notion that South Africa belongs to all who live in it , black and white . This is the question that must still be answered because since dispossession by Colonizers , it looks like SA belongs to white people only . They own everything and control our lives and the lives of politicians of the ruling party . <p> What you said here in our absence , and when the police were assaulting women , breaking their jaws and fracturing their chins , pulling us by our private parts , is not consistent with what the Freedom Charter says , and we are here back in these chambers to expose you to that reality . <p> The NDP : Vision 2030 is the official programme of the ANC , adopted in your 53rd National Conference , and this program is light years away from the Freedom Charter , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . What we know about the Freedom Charter , which the ANC government will never implement are the following : <p> The Freedom Charter says ' the mineral wealth beneath the soil , the banks and monopoly industries shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole " and in your address here , you never said anything about transfer of banks to the people , but complained about banking fees . You never said anything about the transfer of Mines and Minerals to the people , but referred the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act because white monopoly capital in the form of TOTAL and Exxon Mobil said they do not agree with the Act . <p> Private capital , in the form of banks , continue to hold millions of South Africans under debt and many live in homes they do not own , they drive cars they do not own , and use household furniture they do not own . South African banks own many of the houses South Africans call their homes . This is the state of the nation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be controlled to assist the wellbeing of the people " . What we know is that the ANC Is committed to free-market capitalism and will never control trade for the benefit of the people . Many goods and services imported into South Africa do not have tariffs , even on areas where the rightwing and neo-liberal Godfathers , the World Trade Organisation say you can have tariffs . <p> In fact your NDP attributes blame to the organized trade union movement and its demand of minimum wages for the high levels of unemployment . Like GEAR and ASGI SA it advocates for a flexible labour market . <p> The Freedom Charter says ' land shall be shared amongst those who work it ' . What we know is that the ANC has dismally failed to redistribute land and will continue to buy land from those who stole it , despite their admission that the willing-buyer willing-seller approach to land redistribution has dismally failed . <p> It is not a secret that only the EFF campaigned on the banning of foreign ownership of the land . It is only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no foreign land ownership in South Africa . Thus , your proposal to implement this demands is as a result of how sharply we had raised it in society broadly . However , you went on to say you will be limiting private ownership of land to 12 000 hectors . <p> All credible indicators in South Africa , illustrates the fact that our country has 14 , 753 000 ( about 14 million seven hundred and fifty three thousand ) hectares of arable land . With your formula Mr. President , if we were to allocate this arable land at 12 , 000 hectares per person , only 1229 people will have land . That is not even 1% of the people of South Africa . <p> Langa alone is equals to 309 hectares , Gugulethu equals 649 hectares , Umlazi equals 4 746 hectares , Mdantsane quals 4 555 , and Marikana equals 1 754 hectares . All these combined amount to a little over 12 000 hectares , meaning for you Mr. President , one person can own the townships of Langa , Gugulethu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this proposal you are declaring this year the year of the Freedom Charter ? <p> With your formula , an arable land the size of Soweto would only be given to 2 people because Soweto is 12 000 hactres . The Freedom Charter says " LAND SHALL BE SHARED AMONGST THOSE WHO WORK IT " . <p> Let us take it further , the Freedom Charter says , " All shall have the right to occupy land wherever they choose " . <p> But homeless people in the Lusaka community in Mamelodi East when they occupied unoccupied land your government sent police to forcefully remove them . In Nelmephius , where 7000 people had singed up for houses , your government not only sent police to forcefully remove them , it also sought a court interdict to disallow them from occupying unoccupied municipal land . <p> In Sasolburg , Zamdela , when homeless people occupied unoccupied land , again your government sent police , not blankets , water , or electricity ; and many were arrested and today face criminal charges , all for asking to call South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land clause of the Freedom Charter because it has no commitment to the homeless . It also has no commitment to genuine decolonisation . If you do not know Mr. President , land occupation struggles are happening everywhere in the country , under the bridges in big Cities , and by the road sides in major towns and metropolitan areas . In addition , you still need to build over 2 million homeless people houses least you perpetrate their hobo status into a permanent condition . <p> The Freedom Charter says ' the doors of learning and culture shall be opened " . What we know is that the ANC government has dismally failed to provide free quality education at post-secondary level and has not built adequate capacity to absorb the entirety of students who exit the secondary schooling level . <p> An average of Forty Nine percent of the learners who should have set for exams in 2014 dropped out of school ; your government can not tell us where they are , what are they doing and under what circumstances . Mr. President , the is the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own government , only 204 522 new entrant opportunities at universities were available this year . This is despite the fact that of the 532 860 grade 12 pupils who wrote matric in 2014 , only 403 874 pupils passed with marks that allow them to study in tertiary universities either for a degree , diploma or a higher certificate . Your however , government can not tell us what will happen to those who can not find schooling ; a number totalling -- 199 352 . This is the state of the nation . <p> We are told that thousands of students at Wits University have no place to stay , they sleep in libraries and corridors of university buildings like all the hobos you keep shooting at in the townships . This is the state of the nation . <p> It is a fact that in the academic year 2015 , 90 000 students applied for admission at the University of KwaZulu Natal , and only 7000 could be admitted and still the University can not give Financial Aid to all academically derserving but needy students . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tot system and contract labour shall be abolished . " Your own government in 2013 reported that " the number of children affected by child labour still remains .. at an estimated 821 000 " . What is the state of these children Mr. President ? Tell us , why are they not in school ? <p> In 2012 the labour movement reported that " Checkers employs about 73,000 workers and only 35% are permanent earning a minimum of R4,000 -- 60% are supplied by Labour brokers earning a minmum of R1,800 . " " Pick n Pay employs 36,538 , only 16,000 are full time earning a minimum of R4,500 . The rest are part time earning a minimum of R2,000 . " " At Woolworths it 's estimated that the ratio is 70% casuals and 30% permanent . " This excludes workers in hotels , restaurants , mining and construction sectors " . What is the state of these workers Mr. President ? And tell us , have they realised the Freedom Charter ? <p> The Freedom Charter also says , " Slums shall be demolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads , lighting , playing fields , cr ? ches and social centres " . What we know is that 21 years since the first inclusive elections with the ANC in power , more than 15% of the South African population lives in slums and informal settlements without basic services . In fact those with houses like in Zamdela , Mothutlung , Mohlakeng and Malaulele do not have basic services . <p> The people of Malamulele are part of Limpopo 's 2nd biggest local municipality called Thulamela , and the biggest is Polokwane . Due to lack of infrastructure inherited from apartheid , this 2nd biggest Municipality . <p> Your Government is refusing to give the people of Malamulele a Municipality because they are poor , forgetting that the poverty of Malamulele was worsened by lack of Government services and infrastructure . <p> The Malamulele Town has not seen many changes since 1994 , the villages of Shikundu , Mphambo , Madonsi , Mavambe , Jimmy Jones , Mahonisi , and all the villages have not seen real development and they are within their right to demand a Government which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you that your attitude will never take this country forward , and if you continue doing what you are doing , such will lead to political and social instability . Do not reduce genuine demands of the people to tribalism , because without proper explanations of what causes their continued suffering and exclusion , people will always look for easier reasons . <p> The Freedom Charter says " South Africa shall strive to maintain world peace and the settlement of all international disputes by negotiation -- not war " . Yet your government Mr. President in involved in the illegal wars in Chad , the DRC and Central African Republic . It also voted for the brutal killing of Maummar Gaddafi in collusion with imperialist forces . <p> The Freedom Charter also says " Peace and friendship amongst all our people shall be secured by upholding the equal rights , opportunities and status of all " but your government killed workers in Marikana and continues to do everything in its power to undo peace through police brutality including in this parliament . <p> You shall be known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Marikana , right to this honorable house . You shall be known as the president whose rule violated the fundamental rights of members of parliament to hold the executive accountable . <p> You shall be known as President the hooligan because you use hooligan tactics to silence the opposition duly elected to represent aspirations of ordinary and poor South Africans . Only a program based on the mission of economic freedom in our lifetime can truly change the lives of our people . And that program is only found in the EFF . <p> When you are telling a so called good story here , the children on Zenzele informal settlement do not have water . <p> When you are telling a so called good story here , the children of Sxwetla sleep side by side with rats . <p> When you are telling a so called good story here , Mineworkers continue to suffer indignity in the belly of the earth <p> When you are telling a so called good story here , Mothutlung does not have water . <p> When you are telling a so called good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling party are fighting over who should steal more . <p> When you are telling a so called good story here , the women of Princess Magogo have no sanitary towels . <p> We have to save these people by removing you from political office and take political power on behalf of the people . <p> Whatever it takes , and however long it takes , by whatever revolutionary means , we will take over this country with the aim of total liberation and emancipation . <p> No amount of violence and harassment will stop us from taking over this country on behalf of the people . <p> We will do everything in our power because we are a generation with a mission , a generation of ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS .

@@3051235 <h> News <h> Deflation fears could still overwhelm the risk of inflation <p> Deflation is a contraction in the volume of money and credit relative to available goods and services . <p> At the start of 2014 , most investors were forecasting stronger global demand and rising bond yields . A number of market participants even anticipated that inflation would surprise on the upside . Instead , bond yields have fallen and the threat of sustained low inflation , if not deflation , has emerged . <p> This is despite unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and a Fed Funds rate that has remained round the zero-bound since December 2008 . Whereas central banks will be doing their utmost to prevent deflation in the months ahead , it remains to be seen whether they will be successful . The US economy -- which is generally expected to perform better than most -- may aid global growth or risks being dragged down by weakness elsewhere . If US growth flags , it runs the risk of being pulled along into a deflationary scenario . And so 2015 may be another year of weak global growth where deflation fears could overwhelm the risk of inflation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reality is that most economies are battling high ( and rising ) debt levels . Not to mention ageing populations and weak growth , which will make it even harder if not impossible to pay outstanding debts . This enormous debt burden is having a debilitating effect on the demand side of the economy . <p> Impact of the oil price drop <p> The collapse in energy prices , oil specifically , has compounded the situation . The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) ' s failure to negotiate a cutback in oil production set in motion dramatic further declines in prices which in turn compelled producers to increase supplies in an attempt to sustain revenues . Furthermore , geopolitical and competitive motives accompanied the decision , leaving a big question mark over the continued relevance of OPEC . Given fragile global growth and commodity price declines , a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations has been the result . This challenges the credibility of central banks that are already battling to meet their inflation objectives , despite extraordinary stimulus measures . <p> There is a real danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deflation fears will become more widespread in 2015 . Continuing declines in inflation rates may promote and reinforce deflationary psychology . The euro area seems particularly vulnerable because it has faced speculation about deflation for more than two years . This is a much more significant threat in the euro area than in the US , because the economy has no real momentum and unemployment remains stuck at record levels . Euro-area inflation expectations were on the slide even before the collapse in energy prices , a trend that the latest developments have certainly reinforced . In a concerted move to prevent an entrenchment of a deflationary scenario in the euro-zone , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) recently announced quantitative easing ( QE ) measures that surprised on the upside of market expectations . While the market reacted positively to this announcement , the question remains whether or not this renewed and enlarged stimulus programme will ultimately have the desired impact and outcome . <p> Another year of weak global growth coupled with ongoing declines in commodity prices will clearly be deflationary , especially as many parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflationary trend would cause real rates to rise . This development is particularly daunting considering that rising real rates and slowing nominal GDP growth imply that debt to GDP will likely continue to rise . <p> Given this background , central banks will be compelled to maintain easy monetary policies for longer , if not indefinitely . Policymakers in a number of countries may attempt to revive their economies through currency devaluation and other reflationary measures , even more QE . The Bank of Japan is already engaged in large-scale QE and the ECB has now joined in with its own programme of government bond purchases , both in an attempt to engineer a weaker currency and forestall deflation . Chances are that countries like China may join them in devaluing their currency . China 's economic fortunes have recently shifted : producer prices decreased 3.3 % in December of 2014 ( see graph below ) and the country has been registering declining economic growth . Japan 's ruthless attempt to export deflation , aside from largely failing to generate either inflation or strong domestic demand , is putting pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other countries ( notably other emerging markets ) react to maintain competitiveness . <p> All such reflationary efforts will involve significant monetary ( quantitative ) easing . Monetary expansion could lift asset prices , especially equity markets , and hopefully confidence . A combination of falling oil and commodity prices , low interest rates and aggressive monetary easing may provide an uplift to global economic growth . If this transpires , will this growth be sustainable or would it fizzle out too ? <p> Financial markets and QE <p> Financial markets have largely been the beneficiaries of quantitative easing , in fact they have become addicted to it . Every reason for the market to rally can to some extent be pinned on some anticipated stimulus . When the " injection " fades , markets anticipate another round of stimulus as central banks are damned if they do not , especially given the challenges they face and notably deflation . On the other hand if the economy picks up nicely , such as the US did during the second half of 2014 , markets believe a virtuous growth cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hedge to negative outcomes . <p> The deflationary spectre that looms as we enter 2015 will again raise questions about QE . One is whether continued easing efforts will work , because the weight of a reversal in asset prices would be far larger than any asset purchase or interest rate reduction that central banks could undertake .

Whether they will win or lose this battle will make all the difference to the financial markets . Risky asset prices will collapse if they do not .

@@3057234 <h> The new BMW i8 <h> I have to be completely upfront here , this was no easy road test to write . <p> Sure , this is the premium sports car showing us the way of the future . It is a R1 755 000 BMW i8 that comes with just about every luxury fitted as standard kit . <p> How hard can it be ? Go out , drive the car , and simply tell everybody what you experienced . But there are so many things I had to consider while writing this test and I am going to do my best to talk them all through with you . <p> Perhaps I should start with the hype and interest around the car . It was off the charts , I could not go anywhere in the i8 without people swarming around the car . So from that point of view , BMW have achieved their objective of people noticing they have done something different . <p> But it is not just different for the sake of being different , with its ultra-dynamic proportions , elegantly sporty lines and low-slung silhouette , it is also the world 's first sports car to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The BMW i8 also backs up the show by featuring LifeDrive architecture developed specifically for BMW i , with a passenger cell made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic ( CFRP ) , an advanced drive system technology , high-voltage battery power , dynamic chassis control , crash and structural functions integrated into the aluminium Drive module along , with a kerb weight of just 1 485kg , a drag coefficient of 0.26 and a very low centre of gravity of less than 460mm for that much sought after well-balanced weight distribution . <p> You also get " suicide " doors that open upwards for that extra wow factor when you arrive anywhere , and full LED headlights and LED rear lights as standard , with laser lights becoming available as an option from November 2015 production and on the floor at your i Dealer from January 2016 to announce your presence on the road in no uncertain terms . <p> Sliding inside the i8 , and I say slide because typical of a real sports car getting in and down low in the car is not an elegant affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready to hit the road in the best that BMW has to offer . <p> Of course , you can still spend a few rands on extras , such as the DriveAssist package with High Beam Assist , rear view camera , Surround View , Speed Limit Info display and Collision and Pedestrian Warning with City Braking function . Internet access comes with more standard features that include Intelligent Emergency Call , BMW ConnectedDrive Services with Concierge Service and Real Time Traffic Information . Mobility services developed specifically for BMW i , include <p> BMW i Remote app and BMW TeleServices . <p> But that is the steak so to speak , what about the sizzle ? I wish I could say you punch the start button and the i8 fires up with a raucous bark like a sports car should . It does n't . It merely indicates to you on the instrument cluster that the car is on and ready to go . In absolute silence . <p> Using the Driving Experience Control switch and eDrive button allows you to choose from various driving modes that see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the EU test cycle and a top speed of 120km/h , to a Comfort mode that offers a nice everyday balance between dynamics and efficiency and claims a combined range of up to 600km -- again in the EU test cycle ; and a Sport mode with added boost function provided by the electric motor and systematic energy recuperation for the high-voltage battery , with Eco Pro doing duty in both all-electric mode and hybrid mode . <p> Staying on the technical side of things , the lithium-ion high-voltage battery can be recharged when stationary from any conventional domestic power socket via the BMW i Wallbox and the charging process can be monitored and controlled remotely by means of the BMW i Remote app available on your smartphone . <p> Right about now , I started with my battle to figure out which mode I would use , if I were to own this i8 as an everyday car and not just as a brief road test offering . And then how it would be best to give you a realistic idea of the actual fuel consumption I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed too good to be true . <p> So first things first , no matter how long I left the i8 on charge , the best range it offered me on electricity alone was 30km . I am not sure why . And because I could and with a lot of restraint -- because who wants to drive such a sexy car slowly and in silent mode ? -- I used electric power only for doing the morning school run and going to gym and I used no fuel . <p> The stuff millionaires are made of . Picture : BMW <p> So that fuel number was 0.0 litres/ 100km , but there is a cost to the electricity you consume charging the car . <p> I did my best to figure it all out , but the onboard computer said I was using 6kWh of electricity in this mode and by my calculations that would be about R6 per hour , which is a whole lot cheaper than petrol per hour . <p> For basic cruising around on the highway and stuff when the battery had charged , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the number I felt was most representative . But when you switched to Sport mode and the petrol engine started to aggressively charge the battery and you made liberal use of the power on tap , the fuel consumption numbers went easily up to 10.0 litres/100km and beyond and the battery average usage fell to under 3kWh . <p> So exactly what fuel consumption figure you will get will depend on how you make use of the power options available to you and that is the end of that . <p> Getting to make full use of the potent and rather sweet sounding 170kW/320Nm three-cylinder 1.5 litre petrol engine that powers the back wheels and the 96kW/ 250Nm electric motor that drives the front wheels through a six-speed Steptronic transmission results in rapid forward motion when combined . <p> To be honest , this gearbox felt dated and it is not the sharpest or fastest shifting unit in BMWs tool shed , but for everyday use it is fine and with launch control utilised the i8 still ran off a 0-100km/h time of 4.49 seconds , rushed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1km mark at 231.17km/h before hitting its self-imposed electronic speed limiter at 250km/h . <p> The in gear acceleration times between 60 and 100km/h , 80 and 120km/h and 100 to 200km/h are equally good at 2.28 seconds , 2.89 seconds and 12.07 seconds respectively . <p> All round , I was impressed with the amount of instant urge available when you floored the accelerator . <p> Obviously this is dependent on the amount of battery charge available , but the i8 does a great job of keeping the battery on the boil when you are away from a wall socket , so this is not an issue , like with other hybrid vehicles I have tested . <p> Handling was firm and sporty thanks to sophisticated chassis technology featuring a double-wishbone front axle and a five-link rear axle along with Electric Power Steering and Dynamic Damper Control as standard . Even with this technology onboard and mixed size 20-inch wheels under the car , the relative narrowness , for the sake of efficiency , of the tyres married to a slight bit of understeer when pushed hard ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In wrapping up , the BMW i8 comes with a two-year/unlimited mileage warranty and a five-year comprehensive full inclusive maintenance plan and eight-year/ 100 000km battery warranty to complete a very complete and exclusive package that is showing the way of the future .

@@3060231 <h> The ' ape Times ' , SONA and a ' new era ' in newspapers <p> OPINION : Long-time loyal Cape Times reader Ed Herbst looks at how the newspaper has changed over the past year , and draws parallels between it and the SABC . <p> " No longer could the executive trample constitutional rights underfoot . Two court applications immediately ensued and are ongoing . The press gallery in an unprecedented display of revulsion , rose in protest . The leader of the opposition , Mmusi Maimane found his true voice , perhaps for the first time . " Tony Leon , Sunday Times 22/2/2015 <p> " We 've embarked on a new editorial direction , taking leave of many long-standing features and columnists as we embark on a new era in the Cape Times ' proud history . " -- Aneez Salie , Cape Times 20/2/2015 <p> Experience over the last 25 years has shown that when the ANC gains control of a newsroom , certain ineluctable processes unfold and the SABC and the Cape Times provide obvious case studies . <p> First , there is the ritual purge of senior , often white , independent-thinking staff . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney Mthombothi and Allister Sparks , the ANC , angry that President Thabo Mbeki was not getting hourly coverage and that the Jali Commission findings on prison conditions were getting too much coverage , brought in Snuki Zikalala . He quickly drove out credible news people like Allister Sparks ( he must be getting used to this ) Max du Preez ( ditto ) , Sarah Crowe and others . An obvious , **28;1147;TOOLONG example of this race-based hatred was the sentiments he expressed about whites in an interview with Angella Johnson which was published in the Mail &amp; Guardian on 17 October 1997 under the headline ' Snuki-sikelel-iafrika ' . His penchant for walking around the SABC newsrooms saying that he saw " too many white faces " was made a matter of undenied record by then 50/50 producer Danie van der Walt in issue number 143 of the SABC 's house magazine , ' Interkom ' in September 2000 . And in a letter headlined ' Making patriotism a virtue ' ( Business Day 31/7/2001 ) he lashed out at the " white liberal media " and accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the antithesis of the reconciliation for which Nelson Mandela strove clearly did not disturb or deter him . <p> The same purge occurred in what was once the happiest and most effective regional SABC news office , Sea Point in Cape Town , when Jeffrey Twala and Kenneth Makatees took control in 1998 and Twala walked around the news office saying that it was too " leely white " . When a white reporter protested that she and her white colleagues treated their black counterparts with respect and would never dream of referring to them as " pitch blacks " or " coal blacks " or " midnight blacks " he shouted that she should not " take it personally " . We were constantly told that our presence hampered transformation . <p> Underlying sentiments <p> The way in which Karima Brown and Vukani Mde articulate their feelings in this regard at Independent Media is more subtle and nuanced but you could be forgiven if you thought the underlying sentiments are somewhat similar . Here is how Gill Moodie summed it up on her Grubstreet website : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new group op-ed and analysis editor , sent out an opinion piece written by them to the different titles saying that the controversy around the new owner of the company , Dr Iqbal Surve , was a sign of a ' fight-back ' from a ' small but very privileged and racial definable minority ( that ) still controls the tools of public discourse ' . These people were against transformation , the piece said , especially of media ownership and were demonising Surve with a ' relentless agenda of disinformation ' " . <p> While Sparks was a common denominator at both the SABC and the Indy , Tony Weaver was the latest and most high-profile victim . <p> First we had the spectacle of Chelsea Amor Lotz , immediately dubbed the ' Media Mata Hari ' , tottering around in her red , skyscraper-stiletto heels holding up a placard which was a clear reference to Weaver : " Fire all racist reporters " . Two other posters held up by her group were more explicit . " Away with Man Friday " and " Fire Tony Weaver " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you were a down table sub of alliterative inclination your headline might well have been ' Media Mata Hari mangles Manuel ' . <p> Then we had the various attempts to get rid of Weaver . First he was told by editor Gasant Abarder after he had been part of a team which brought immense lustre to South African journalism by producing a memorial tribute to Nelson Mandela which was hailed by TIME magazine as one of the best in the world , that he should go home for a few days and " think about it " . This made it clear he was not valued , still less wanted by the new Indy management . Then there was the nefarious attempt to discipline him over the now notorious Pick ' n ' Pay photo manipulation suggestion . Finally they paid him to leave and take his Man Friday column to Die Burger . <p> The second predictable consequence of an ANC takeover of a newsroom is that both corporate performance and the product suffers . <p> The findings of the Sisulu/Marcus Commission into Snuki Zikalala 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North Gauteng High Court on 24 January 20011 provide irrefutable proof of that contention as do the subsequent findings of the Public Protector and the PricewaterhouseCoopers skills audit . <p> Decline in standards <p> The loss to Newspaper House of the institutional knowledge and skill of an experienced sub-editor like Glenn Bownes is evident at the Cape Times and the Argus which provide regular evidence with typos , misspelt words and bad grammar of the decline in standards . <p> A mind boggling example of the product deterioration in the " new era " which heralds the arrival of Aneez Salie as editor , was the top half of the fold on 17 February . I have been a CapeTimes reader since 1978 but I have never known a cartoon to dominate the front page as it did that day . There was a slight problem though -- the cartoon covered the C in the masthead reducing it to " ape Times " and you can see what I am talking about on Gill Moodie 's invaluable Grubstreet website . <p> You could not make this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdosing on whoonga . There is no way that would have got past people like Bownes , Weaver , Alide Dasnois or Janet Heard . When readers raised concerns , Salie 's response was that it was no mistake but was deliberately done " out of deep respect for Madiba " . That has about as much credibility as state security minister David Mahlobo 's suggestion that it was necessary to place a signal jammer with an effective range of 30 metres in the room next to the press gallery because there was a very real chance of Boko Haram scaling the parliamentary ramparts and enslaving our women . <p> Another startling example of the " new era " reporting occurred the next day but it is typical , as I have illustrated previously , of the " new era " approach <p> Have a look at the front pages of the country 's leading newspapers on Grubstreet . <p> With the exception of the Cape Times all the big city newspapers focused on what had happened in parliament the previous day -- the response to the events the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DA parliamentary leader Mmusi Mmaine 's suggestion that President Jacob Zuma was a " broken man " but others used the signal jamming aspect or Zuma ' s giggling as their lead story <p> Took SAPA <p> The Cape Times took Sapa copy for its front page , an article predictably placed below the fold and not much bigger than your hand . Its headline , ' Mbete was n't aware device used would block reception ' reflected another facet of the " new era " approach -- do as little damage to the ANC as you can . <p> So what did the Cape Times consider to be more important than the previous days ' events in parliament ? An email thread about a " ruined romance " which , of course , reflected " white racism . " <p> The front page picture choice was also telling . Die Burger went with a front page which featured the three party leaders in the previous day 's debate but the Cape Times picture choice reflected a pervasive " new era " theme which seeks to portray the Democratic Alliance-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case it was teachers -- not in a mud school or one where children down in pit latrines but an overcrowded informal school . <p> The third inevitable consequence of an ANC takeover of a newsroom is that the most talented newsroom staff leave . <p> At the SABC it was people like Jacques Pauw who left saying that it had become " nothing less than a state broadcaster . " At the Indy , Moshoeshoe Monare , the editor of the Sunday Independent , resolved his ethical dilemma succinctly , elegantly and eloquently . On 15 December 2013 he nailed his colours firmly to the mast in an op-ed column headlined ' Editor 's note on editorial independence ' . Two months later he resigned making it clear that he did not consider that the conditions in which editorial independence could thrive existed at Independent Media anymore . The gesture by former Cape Times editor Ryland Fisher was even more persuasive . He left before he started . His appointment was announced by Iqbal Surv ? in November last year and , to the best of my knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth invariable consequence of an ANC takeover of a newsroom is that credibility is lost . <p> Evidence of this can be found in the fact that the SABC has less than half the audience for its flagship evening television news bulletin than the equivalent e.tv bulletin which has not received hundreds of millions of rands courtesy of the taxpayer . <p> The clincher was last year 's SABC 's market research report , Project Kindle , which assessed the opinions of viewers throughout the country . The objective was to establish how credible the SABC 's television news bulletins are and the answer was pithily summed up by Phylicia Oppelt a decade ago -- " SABC TV news sucks " . Across the board , the Project Kindle interviewees said the SABC product was inferior in every respect to the eNCA 's ' Zero Propaganda ' news bulletins and did not engender respect and trust because it was politically tainted . <p> The Cape Times has a lot of credibility to lose . And it seems hell-bent on doing so . <p> As somebody who has been steeped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of images . When I think of the CapeTimes I remember how proud I was some 35 years ago when Stoffel Botha 's assault on English language newspapers was at its height and the Cape Times carried those grainy black and white photographs of Marianne Thamm and her colleagues standing , in protest , with their placards outside Newspaper House . <p> I have been reading Gerald Shaw 's book , The Cape Times -- an Informal History ( David Philip , 1999 ) which deals extensively with that era . <p> Proud heritage <p> In his foreword the late Jakes Gerwel wrote , " In the end however we are left with the record of an institution that has become a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa . The book paints an intriguing picture of the battles that were fought within the newspaper and against outside forces to build and develop the tradition which the country today cherishes as part of its proud heritage . " <p> As I mentioned earlier , I have been a Cape Times reader for 36 years and , in my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current news -- to overwhelm the top half of the fold . That changed on 12 February when a picture of the demolition of District Six houses exactly 49 years years previously dominated the front page of the newspaper . <p> As part of this new narrative at the Cape Times Aneez Salie now ensures that there is an almost daily reminder in the newspaper of the evils of apartheid , an approach that both Dr Pieter Mulder and Rhoda Kadalie have expressed concern about . <p> In a way , though , it provides the perfect visual metaphor for the once-respected institution of which Gerwel wrote . <p> Under Iqbal Surv ? that edifice has been reduced to rubble . <p> * Opinions expressed in posts published on The Media Online are not necessarily those of Wag the Dog Publishers or the editor but contribute to the diversity of voices in South Africa . <p> A question : with the number of excellent reporters now unemployed ( or underemployed ) and the number of news-junkies left gasping for a decent newspaper , would n't now be a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality reporting and analysis and a combined subscription fee for both print and digital editions ?

I am so SICK of the anti-white bias in the media , not just Independent Newspapers , but many others as well -- and judging by comments online , MANY others are also sick of the racism . If a group of journalists starts a new paper with NO racist reporting , you 'll very quickly build a loyal following . <p> Paige Turner <p> Astute summing up of the situation .

@@3060239 <h> Nombona : simply too good to be typecast <p> Zola Nombona ( pictured ) is one of those rising talents that people do n't usually talk about , yet she is constantly working . We have seen her as a presenter , as well as an actress in sitcoms and dramas like Single Guys and Intersexions . She even played the lead in the local movie Ingoma , which released a few weeks ago . Now putting her talents to the fore in the comedy series Ithuba Lokugcina , Nombona explains why she is in a good space . <p> " I am happy that people are loving what I do so much that I am literally stepping off one set onto another . I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunities that came to me . I think people who saw me on Single Guys thought that I was funny and could only do that , but with starring in productions like Ingoma I also showed a serious side .

They have a heroic professor who thinks he has the formula to solve their problems , but as it turns out he signed on for a whole lot more than he initially thought . <p> " It was my playground because I love comedy . I have a healthy sense of comic timing so when I am in comedy I am happy . <p> " We shot on a tight schedule in December and I worked with the most amazing cast and directors .

So the fact that it has decided to port the NX1 's APC-S 28MP sensor and most of its features into the newly-announced NX500 is great news for consumer photographers looking for a little bit more power in a compact form . <p> The camera is aimed firmly at the top end of the prosumer market , the crowd with cash to spare who wants a good camera but is still scared of a real DSLR . And we 've had a chance to get hands-on with a per-production model . <p> The NX500 comes in three colour varieties : black , white , and brown with a handgrip that is kind of a leather knock off . The rest of the camera is finished in silver metal , giving it a very retro appeal . <p> The Samsung 's 3inch Super AMOLED touchscreen display worked well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I have never been a fan of articulating screens , it does make it easy to shoot from unusual angles .

You are also able to use the touchscreen for touch-to-focus . The NX500 uses Samsung 's NX AF System III hybrid auto-focus , which worked surprisingly well . For those users coming over from a cellphone to a camera for the first time , it will feel right at home .

This is where you will find the photo playback , ISO options and a way into the camera 's myriad menus . <p> The NX500 supports the advanced Wi-Fi 802.11n for remote control and instant transfers of high-res photos and videos .

Substitue Daniele Verde 's shot over the bar from distance was the best they could muster for some time . <p> And 12 minutes from time , Samp doubled their advantage .

Last year , the once illustrious studio faced serious financial woes , but a new licensing deal could be the break they 've been looking for . <p> Crytek is , at the very least , back above water . This is thanks to the biggest licensing deal the studio has ever secured , and one which Crytek co-founder Faruk Yerli described as " huge " . Right now they 're not willing to divulge exactly who the deal is with , but Crytek 's PR department do n't want to understate the important of it . <p> " A lot of people are under the impression we had to find a new investor or something , but that was n't the case .

There 's a little bit of bad blood between them and Microsoft following the underwhelming performance of Ryse : Son of Rome , so has Sony maybe taken the opportunity ? <p> Or maybe it 's not console manufacturers at all , but rather a licensing deal for the adaption of a brand new IP .

Your guess is as good as mine . <p> The publisher is expected to reveal details about their new licensing partner soon , so we wo n't have to wait long at all .

Schalke are the Ajax of the 21st century . <p> Since the Champions League started in 1992 , only four clubs have fielded three teenagers in their line-up in knockout ties . Nantes did it as a one-off in 2002 and Arsenal once in 2006 , when Cesc Fabregas was their biggest young star . <p> Ajax had three teenagers in their team for the 1995 final against Milan -- match-winner Patrick Kluivert , plus Clarence Seedorf and Nwankwo Kanu . They would do it seven more times before 2003 , turning to future internationals such as Wesley Sneijder and Nigel de Jong along the way . <p> Now Schalke have taken over .

My relative has been using generic drugs from India for his high blood pressur ... <h> SA losing out on generic cost savings <p> The medical scheme industry can save in excess of R1.5 billion per year in medicine expenditure if the lowest priced generics in the market were prescribed and dispensed where possible . <p> This is according to Discovery Health ( DH ) which states in its submission to the Competition Commission 's Health Market Inquiry that various factors in the local market prevent the optimal usage of generics . <p> The local medicine sector is wrought with complexities such as price and fee regulations as well as lagging patent approvals -- to name a few . In this environment the generic market plays an important cost saving role for health care funders and consumers who can pay significantly less for a generic product compared with the brand originator product . <p> DH estimates that the optimal use of low cost generics can save its Discovery Health Medical Scheme alone around R520 million per year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall market in terms of volume , but because of their low cost , around one-third in terms of value . This growth is supported by government procuring mass volumes of generic products via tenders , while the private market for generic drugs is also growing , according to the Deloitte 2015 Life Sciences Outlook Report . <p> Not enough <p> The substitution of branded medicines by generics in South Africa has increased from 44% to 60% for in-hospital medicines and from 52% to 73% for out-of-hospital chronic medicines . <p> DH says this substitution rate should be higher and more in line with the international average of 80% to enlarge the benefit of generics as cost savers . Also , many generics still seem to be relatively expensive in South Africa . <p> The average generic price difference relative to brand innovator medicine in the local market is around 33% , which is smaller than in most international markets . <p> There are generics where the cost variance between the two are much higher . Take for instance Coversyl , where the price difference between clones or generics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see below ) . This can amount to a tremendous saving if the lower cost generics are indeed used , but it often does n't happen . <p> Comparisons between generic and clone prices of medicines to the brand originator prices <p> Source : Discovery Health submission to Health Market Inquiry <p> A fly in the ointment seems to be that generics are often not prescribed by doctors , even though they are available . According to DH anecdotal evidence suggests that some doctors mistrust the efficacy of generics . <p> Mediclinic says in its Health Inquiry submission says it ranks the products in each product category by price and recommends cost-effective alternatives to doctors . However due to the clinical independence of the doctor and the patient 's right to choose , the doctor or the patient may reject any recommendation to use cost-effective alternatives or generics . <p> Life Healthcare found that in specific environments like ICU , for example , some doctors have resisted conversion to generic drugs . <p> When generics are dispensed DH says it often occurs that the more expensive generics are given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is despite the regulation in the Medicines Act , which states that dispensers must dispense a cheaper generic medicine , i.e. not a branded medicine , unless specifically forbidden by the patient to do so . <p> " One reason cited for this by pharmacists is that the lowest cost generics are often in short supply , and they thus prefer to dispense products for which supply is guaranteed . Another reason is likely to be the fact that some manufacturers pay pharmacies various marketing and data fees to incentivise them to dispense their products , " states DH . <p> Venlor for instance , despite being the most expensive antidepressant of the generics in the venlafaxine medicine class , remains the most widely dispensed venlafaxine product in the market . <p> In April and May 2014 , Venlor experienced a stock shortage and was replaced with the cheaper alternative , Venlafaxine Adco . This drop in market share was soon reversed when Venlor was restocked. ( see graphic ) <p> The use of Venlor and Venlafaxine Adco as generic substitutions to Efexor <p> Source : Discovery Health Medical Scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of factors such as consumer preferences and doctor prescriptions , but also to pharmacists ' dispensing fee income which is based on a percentage of the product price , as well as rebates and marketing fees that are paid by manufacturers to pharmacists for dispensing some higher priced generics more frequently over lower priced generics . <p> The clones come out to play <p> The competition for generic usage is aggravated by so-called clone products of originators that are manufactured prior to patent expiry . " The company releases a product identical to the original , but with a different brand and package . It is priced at a discount to the originator , but typically higher than generic equivalents . These clones compete for market share with generic equivalents . " <p> Scheming schemes <p> Medical schemes can also be a deciding factor in the dispension of medicine , not only through their formularies but also through reimbursement models . <p> Formularies define the pharmacy products for which the medical schemes will pay . Products not included on the formulary must be authorised by the patient as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pocket . If certain generics are not on the list , it will not be covered and scheme members are left to choose the formulary options to avoid carrying the cost themselves . <p> The Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa ( PSSA ) gives in its submission to the Health Market Inquiry an example of a scheme that proposed a new dispensing fee model two years ago by offering pharmacists a substantially higher dispensing fee when a branded medicine , as specified in the schemes formulary , is supplied rather than when another similar priced or even lower price product is supplied . Despite this being in contrary to the requirements of the Medicines Act . <p> On the other hand there are schemes that have a performance-based reimbursement model that reward pharmacists for supplying low-cost generic medicines . This is seen as an incentive to pharmacists to lower the cost to the patient . <p> Provided the active ingredients are identical in both the chemical composition and dosage , then the generic is precisely the same as the patented original . The fact that the original may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest difference . They will do the job equally well . The " some doctors " who distrust generics need to refer back to their chemistry studies . I find that most pharmacies do not offer one a generic , and moan when I ask for one . Profit under attack , shame . <p> The article suggests that all generics are the same , which they are NOT . Even the same ingredients and cohesive agents prepared under different conditions yield different results . Quite often generics are not as good as the branded product and reference needs to be made to evidence based medicine as to the efficacy of the drug . A low cost drug might result in higher hospital episodes that a more expensive generic or branded product would avoid or lessen . One further point , its the doctor that can get sued not the medical scheme trustees if the better drug is not used . <p> With full justification too . Our own personal experience is that some generics simply are seriously ineffective and do not do the job at all . Invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one has to go upscale to a more recent medicine to get better . The so-called costs saving just disappears into thin air . In addition newer branded medicines tend to have fewer and less severe side effects than old , outdated past their sell by date generics . Generics do work sometimes but not all the time . <p> We have found clones to be at least more effective . <p> This article is basically a load of crXp . If generics worked as well as they are touted ( simply propaganda ) then there would be no R&amp;D in pharmaceutical companies . <p> It was found that fully 10 present of 1,500 India-made drug samples collected from 22 cities throughout Africa contained insufficient levels of the key active ingredients . ( POOR QUALITY DRUGS AND GLOBAL TRADE : A PILOT STUDY ; NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH ; September 2014 ) We are reassured that the Medicines Control Council approves and registers these products . It is also supposed to evaluate the safety , quality and efficacy of the generic products . But how do they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the purity , stability and quality of the chemicals of all the products initially and on a continuous basis ? Do they have the capacity to check safety , quality and efficacy of the product with clinical trials ? In real life they can only detect problems if patients do not respond to therapy or die in observable numbers and it is noted and reported by somebody . I suggest people should carefully consider why doctors and patients are not always keen on all generics . They are the primary users of medicine and are the only ones with practical experience with these medicines . They may have noticed a few things that the promoters of generic medicines do not know and never mention . <p> In India , millions of people are dispensed with the generic drugs at 1/10th the cost of the same product in South Africa .

@@3146230 <h> oThongathi serial killer convicted <p> Durban - The man known as the oThongathi serial killer , Sphiwe Patrick Khoza , was convicted in the Durban High Court on Wednesday and was expected to be sentenced on Thursday . <p> Judge Piet Koen found that the State had proved Khoza 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , and referred to cellphone records that had linked the serial killer to the scenes of the crimes . <p> Khoza had pleaded not guilty and elected not to testify in his defence . <p> The court found that he had lured three women , separately , to oThongathi through social media , killed them , raping one of them and then stealing their cellphones . <p> On May 31 , 2013 , the 36-year-old lured Cornelia Ndlovu to the Kwatiba area in oThongathi , robbed her of her cellphone , assaulted and raped her , strangled her with a belt and bound her hands and neck . <p> He then covered her body with branches and left . <p> It was discovered a few days later . <p> Cellphone records show that Ndlovu , a 44-year-old domestic worker from Hillcrest , and Khoza had more than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calls " , all cellphone calls to her were not answered . <p> Judge Koen said cellphone towers showed that Ndlovu travelled from Durban to oThongathi and records also placed Khoza in the area where Ndlovu 's body was found . <p> Her cellphone was found in Khoza 's possession at the time of his arrest , and cellphone records show that he was using her cellphone after her death . <p> The judge said the only reasonable inference , from the cellphone records , was that Khoza had killed Ndlovu . The post-mortem report reflected that Ndlovu had been raped . <p> His second victim was Philisiwe Hlatswayo , a school teacher , whom he had lured to a sugar cane plantation in the Amazinyama area in oThongathi on June 7 , 2013 , where she was robbed of her cellphone and FNB bank card . <p> The State produced cellphone evidence again linking him to the scene of the crime and also showed Khoza used Hlatswayo 's cellphone after her death . <p> CCTV footage retrieved from the FNB branch in oThongathi clearly showed Khoza withdrawing money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank card was still being used after her death . <p> Her hands and neck were also bound and her body was partially charred as Khoza had set it alight . <p> Her body was found the next day .

@@3146235 <p> The recent appointment of Billy Domingo as director of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival is one more notch on his impressive resum ? in the music industry . Having started in theatre as a young man in the late 1960s , Domingo finessed his craft in the music industry while working behind the scenes for music productions and as a tour manager for one of the country 's biggest music exports : Lucky Dube . <p> " I toured with Lucky Dube for many years around Africa . And I was a part of the artistic direction of Faranani theatre production in 2002 , which Mandela attended at the Royal Carre Theatre in Amsterdam , " he says . <p> With plans to extend the event from a two-day festival into a two-weekend spectacle and to focus more on South African acts , Domingo spoke of his 16-year journey with the show dubbed " Africa 's grandest gathering " and of its future . <p> How did you come to establish the jazz festival with Rashid Lombard in 1999 ? I had been at Sun City for almost 20 years , until 1997 . I started in 1979 as the senior assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then came back to Cape Town to retire , but Rashid came to find me to tell me that he had this vision of doing the jazz festival and he wanted to start an events festival called espAfrika Events Social Marketing and Productions Afrika . And he asked if I would consider joining with my production skills and theatre management style . So we hooked up in the late 1990s and the rest is history.Today , we 're both still shareholders in the company and I think in three or four years ' time we 'll meet up again and do something in Angola or Morocco or somewhere . That 's just our madness . <p> How are things going at espAfrika after Rashid 's resignation from the jazz festival last year ? Rashid and I started the festival but now he 's moved on , I 'm carrying on and the show 's going on . So it 's no big deal . The team is stronger than both of us . I 've been directing festivals for nearly four decades . We 've sold out tickets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There 's a wide range of musicians performing this year . How does the festival select who performs ? We have five stages , so our talent director , Lindsay-Ann Rhoda , sits together with the team and we collectively look at who has achieved what and then showcase that . I do n't ? influence the team , but as festival director , I do say : " These are the people that should be recognised . " And for the real , pure jazz on Rosies stage , we have people who talk to us and say : " Hi guys , these are the opinions of the people out there . " And we listen to them . We 're not always going to get it right , but maybe in the next few years we 'll get closer to what people want . <p> What has been your greatest lesson when it comes to putting on the jazz festival ? From my experience of working and producing shows , I 've learnt that it 's time we recognised South African music . After hearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided to stage the show , which will be the headlining act on Friday . So the focus is going to be tremendous because I think there are a lot of Mahotella Queens-type acts out there that need to be recognised before they pass on . I 'd like it if we actually had more African acts ; I want to give some more South Africans an opportunity to play . <p> What are your highlights for this year 's festival ? I grew up in Ottery in Cape Town , and the first band I ever saw and danced to was Pacific Express . That is such an amazing band -- it featured the late Robbie Jansen -- so I thought : " Why do n't I put that band back together ? " And again , on that idea of " while they 're still alive and kicking " , why not get them together to perform ? And because Basil Coetzee was one of the band 's original members , one of the jazz festival 's stages is named after him , I thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I got hold of Zayne Adams who died in February , and Issy Ariefdien and Jack Momple , and we put it together . And the other highlight for me is Cape Town rap group Prophets of da City , whom I saw perform at the Berlin Wall during the apartheid regime . They were part of the revolutionary sound . <p> The line-up for this year features music genres besides jazz , and it incorporates other aspects , such as a fashion showcase and a photography exhibition . Does the name " Cape Town Jazz Festival " really represent the event ? It 's not really a jazz festival anymore ; it 's a lifestyle festival now because people take ownership of it . The festival has to be the conduit that allows us to create jobs.We have the focus schools programme . What we do is start about an eight-week programme where we bring together schools that have facilities in music and arts and get the top students from these schools to attend workshops given by us.So all these catch phrases like " jazz festival " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my love for the last 25 to 30 years has been a transfer of skills . Also , we hire about 2700 people across the board . We employ staff over the two to six months leading up to the festival . So this is great for tourism , it 's great for the Western Cape and South Africa . <p> Can you explain the music genre choices on the line-up ? I 've got all types of people coming ; I have the younger and the older generation . So I think that boils down to having respect for the genres and the different types of music in our country.We got asked recently in an ? interview : " Why did you bring Beatenberg ? " Because they 're a band and they have a sound and an audience . I think it 's great that we can educate people about jazz . Plus , the different genres of music at the festival allow families to go and listen to what they want to . <p> Beatenberg <p> People also asked : " Why are you putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not . Bra Hugh is a legend and he represents what we want on stage . <p> Any learning curves ? Timing is always a problem for me , and the overrunning of shows . So what I 've done is shortened the set-up time and will be making artists aware that they have X amount of time left to perform -- to avoid the overrun.The other thing is that last year people complained that they could n't get tickets . I 've rectified that by selling tickets in November . I 'm still sold out . We also had toilet shortages in the past and we 've put more toilets in the back yard . We ca n't address every issue and this event is never going to be easy to programme but I 'm proud that the team is strong . <p> What can audiences look forward to in upcoming years ? I think we 've been sold out for six years , so by next year we will definitely be running the festival over two weekends and making it a bit longer . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from the film side.There are so many beautiful music videos to be made and it 's important for young emerging artists to ? understand that genre .

@@3146239 <h> SCA chastises Home Affairs <h> The Supreme Court of Appeal has severely criticised Home Affairs for ignoring repeated court orders and gave the department until 1 July to reopen the refugee reception office ( RRO ) in Port Elizabeth . <p> The court also ordered Home Affairs director general Mkuseli Apleni to report in writing once a month to the Somali Association of South Africa and the Project for Conflict Resolution and Development about the progress made to ensure compliance with the court order . The two organisations , represented by Lawyers for Human Rights ( LHR ) , in 2012 and 2013 obtained court orders setting aside the closure of the Port Elizabeth office , but the department ignored both court orders . <p> The reception office was closed in 2011 ; severely curtailing refugee services for the majority of asylum seekers due to the long distances they must travel to continuously renew their permits . The situation was exacerbated by Home Affairs ' unwillingness to allow files to be transferred to the remaining offices in Pretoria , Durban and Musina . <p> Home Affairs based part of its decision to close the office on plans to open a reception office at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the office was repeatedly delayed and it is now only expected to open early next year .

The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable leather sofas to ease into , some tasteful throw rugs in muted colours on the floor , and just the occasional bit of bric-a-brac from a full life scattered all around the room .

The eye notices a club made from what looks like what may have come from a very large , extinct herbivore . There is a laundry basket-like creation , covered in faux hyena skin . And sitting on a bookshelf is something that looks remarkably like a human skull . Ah , these are some of the props for Plewman 's upcoming one-man role in Defending the Caveman . <p> Plewman is taking this work to various locales in South Africa . And despite his many performances of this work , this will be his first time he will appear in Caveman in Grahamstown . This year , of course , the festival will have a special focus on satire in South Africa , and Caveman should fit right in and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plewman has travelled down this particular paleontological excavation on stage before . To be exact , he has done so 1,544 times already in Rob Becker 's play . When it originally appeared , it ran for five years on Broadway . It has subsequently been a hit around the world -- and in a variety of languages as well . Plewman adapted the original American-flavoured text so as to have it successfully interrogate the local Weltanschauung -- finding the inner South African Alley Oop and Mrs Oop . ( In staging the work , Rex Garner had originally directed Plewman , and Plewman says that Garner is one of his original theatrical mentors -- still a lifetime friend . ) <p> At first blush , when one hears about Defending the Caveman , it is easy to think about it as a kind of dramatisation of the speculations around the origins of human behaviour that were popularised in books like Robert Ardrey 's African Genesis and The Territorial Imperative , Desmond Morris ' The Naked Ape -- or even certain chapters in Carl Sagan 's The Dragons of Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or another , had attempted to explore how the genetically-wired psyches of early hominids continue to affect how contemporary homo sapiens -- us -- respond to the threats , fears , rigours , challenges and opportunities of our modern era . <p> Defending the Caveman , however , does its thing a bit differently . It takes the tack that contemporary , reciprocal male and female responses to one another also have similarly deep roots in human evolution . And these come out in ways that are both unexpected and deeply revealing of those inner truths . " And from understanding , we can forgive . " He says that some people have even told him that watching this show helped save their marriages -- and , in one extraordinary case , even brought a divorced couple back together to remarry after they had seen the play together as friends . <p> He also insists Caveman should not be seen as a kind of staged adaptation of the ideas contained in that more recent bestseller , Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus . It is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real key to the play is that here is " a man who has found a great truth , and he must tell everyone about it . " That very night , from the stage . <p> Plewman , himself , was last on stage at the Market Theatre and at the Grahamstown Festival in an unusual , even eerie one-man show , The Last Moustache . In this work , his character was an actor who had been coerced into becoming Adolph Hitler 's public doppelganger and stand-in , with the action set in Hitler 's Berlin bunker in the final days of World War II , just as the Germans were about to surrender . <p> Over a long , successful career , Plewman , of course , has been around the theatre for forty years -- reaching all the way back to works like Chorus Line , in its original London Production . He met his American-born-wife in Chicago in South Africa , just by the way . He says he had to do everything in that show , all the dancing , singing and acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads . Great training for a successful , versatile career , of course , he adds . <p> Then , when he played the lead in a South African , live stage production of Singing in the Rain , he went off to learn tap dancing -- after he had auditioned and won the role . That 's chutzpah . And so how did he avoid coming down with a permanent cold or the flu throughout the run of that show ? He explains that his secret was that he insisted that they heat the water that had to pour down upon him , night after night after night . Clever , that . <p> Asked about his favourite stage moments , right off the bat he mentions Paul Slabolepszy play , Pale Natives , although he is quick to add that his experiences with Rex Garner -- and , of course , Caveman , are right up there too . After all , if someone were to come up to you and offer you a part where you would have years of steady work in a great role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plewman 's career has taken him through dozens of other live musicals , comedies and farces , films , television , corporate gigs and voice-over work , as well as all the plays and television scripts he has written , and managing a theatre . And there have even been the books he has written along the way as well . There is , for example , a health and exercise book for older people -- fittingly titled Fitness for Old Farts -- designed to help the over-60s crowd stay fitter and healthier into their golden years . Perhaps indicative of the times , this volume has become a non-fiction best seller locally . <p> In our conversation , Plewman settles back to reflect on a lifetime in the theatre , as well as the contemporary challenges now faced by the theatre industry , from competition from other media , from the changing texture of audiences less and less familiar with live theatre , and from the decline in actual physical spaces for theatre to take place . Along the way , we puzzle over why , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tunes that are really singable . Or , as he says , nowadays , " one leaves the theatre whistling the furniture instead of a tune . " <p> Over the years , Plewman said he found a niche -- and a growing knack -- for light comedies and farces , rather than works about societal struggles and the anger that had so often found a home in a venue like the Market Theatre in an earlier time . That leads to reminiscences about the quality of South African comedy and satire -- then and now . There was the late Robert Kirby , for example , a comic with a carefully controlled , yet intensely bitter energy about him , even as he used a bit of clever sleight-of-hand to amplify his social and political criticisms . Today , however , not having political commentary -- something that is just about people and how they deal with each other would seem to have a real place . That there is still so little of it may be due to the fact that South Africans seem not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone like Trevor Noah seems to have come closest to finding this groove . <p> Speaking about what he has not yet been able to do as an actor , he regrets he has yet to perform Shakespeare -- or ballet for that matter . He says he 'd love to have the role of Falstaff , for example , if such a thing were ever possible some day yet . He would be pretty good at that , given his expansive presence and that well-trained voice -- although he would need a " fat suit " to be the convincing jolly fat man with an eye for the ladies . He adds that he would still like to perform in My Fair Lady , as either Henry Higgins -- or Alfred P Doolittle . <p> In speaking about the theatrical universe more generally , Plewman says his personal philosophy is that a play , any play , must present a compelling total experience to the audience . The audience should be able to enter a theatre with a sense of gradually increasing anticipation -- the venue itself should invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clean , and the work must be staged as best it can be . But there is a role for imagination in adversity . When The Last Moustache was on at the Market Theatre , because the entire area was a construction site with the theatre being rebuilt and a shopping mall , office buildings and a hotel being built adjacent to the theatre , to take advantage of -- or at least play off -- this chaos , Plewman says he had signs placed around the theatre as one came into the building , warning about bomb craters and pointing the way towards the bomb shelter ( the actual venue ) -- all written in faux German . Or , as he says about an experience and a challenge like that , " You must use what you 've got ! " <p> While he has been delighted over his continuing success in the world of theatre , he laments the growing absence of local theatrical venues around the city ; the disappearance of those theatrical " angels " of an earlier era who supported the form because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works that will pull people into the theatre - works that speak to audiences in their current lives .

" And his voice trails off into a moment of reflection . <p> About the magic of the art form , he recalls a famous actor he once met who had said to Plewman about his own career and experience , " I learned from a man who learned from a man who learned from a man who learned from a man who learned from Shakespeare . " That 's history -- and a real sense of connection .

PEC was successful in the arbitration proceedings , successfully resisted an application to review the single arbitrator 's decision and successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel .

That registration was reinstated on 3 April 2012 . But the legal status of the company in the intervening period was rendered uncertain given the differences in the language between the Old and New Companies Act . <p> Under the Old Act , an affected company or third party could in terms of section 73(6) or 73(6A) apply either administratively ( i.e. via an application to CIPRO ) or judicially ( i.e. via an application to court ) for reinstatement which would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered " ) .

This led many to argue ( including NSC ) that the omission signalled an intention on the part of the legislature to abandon the regime of retrospective reinstatement . <p> In its application for declaratory relief , PEC asked the court to declare that the reinstatement of NSC occurred with retrospective effect both as regards the revesting of its property as well as a validation of " all acts done by or against it from the date of its deregistration until the date of its reinstatement " . In the alternative , PEC asked for an order in terms of s 83(4) of the New Act ( which authorises a court to make " any other order that is just and equitable in the circumstances " ) directing that the reinstatement should have the aforementioned effect . <p> NSC resisted the application arguing that whilst reinstatement to the Companies Register by the CIPC has the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validate any of its ' corporate activity ' during the period of its deregistration . <p> The court a quo held that while reinstatement under s 82(4) retrospectively re-establishes a company 's corporate personality and restores its assets to it , the section does not validate acts carried out during the period of deregistration . However , Binns-Ward J went on to opine that once reinstatement has been obtained under s 82(4) , the courts retain the ability to validate ' corporate activity ' during the period of reinstatement by granting additional relief under section 83(4) , when it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to do so . <p> This turned out to be one of several conflicting High Court decisions on the issue , reflecting an intermediate position where others have reflected either no retrospectivity or full retrospectivity . <p> Brand JA , writing for a unanimous bench , reasoned that having regard to the various judgments , the following is evident : <p> Only one judgment suggests that the section 82(4) connotes no retrospectivity but is incorrect because it , wrongly , assumes that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Act which does not explicitly reference retrospective reinstatement ? in fact the New Act provides a whole new framework insofar as re-registration and reinstatement is concerned ; <p> Prejudice to third parties may follow whether one retrospectively validates the corporate activities of a company , or if one declines to do so ; <p> An application in terms of section 83(4) ? a costly exercise which entails an application to court ? can not be what was contemplated to remedy an administrative deregistration ; <p> Complete retrospectivity resulting from an administrative process was a feature under the Old Act ; <p> An application for reinstatement under section 82(4) does , indirectly , require an advertisement process which allows third parties the opportunity to contest such reinstatement ; and <p> The very wording of section 82(4) suggests that reinstatement under that section has automatic retrospective effect . <p> The SCA therefore ruled that NSC 's reinstatement occurred retrospectively through the operation of section 82(4) . <p> In a final act of clarification , the SCA went on to opine that even where a company is reinstated retrospectively through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of section 83(4) , for relief from the potential prejudicial effect of such an outcome . <p> The judgment has important implications for commerce in South Africa as administrative deregistrations are commonplace . As a rule , neither the affected companies nor the public at large are made aware of the deregistration with the consequence that many third parties continue to transact with these companies on a business-as-usual basis . It goes without saying that this could lead to significant prejudice for those contract unwittingly with a deregistered company . <p> Not only does the judgment alleviate the position of those parties seeing to reinstate a company 's registration but it has definitively clarified an important aspect of the New Act , which to date , has caused considerable confusion and uncertainty . <p> Earlier this year , the Council of Ministers and the Shoura Council approved the adoption of a new Companies Law that would completely replace the existing Regulations for Companies . <p> Some comments from our readers ? ?

@@3158235 <p> There are many things that will make you stop and rethink who you follow on Twitter . Ignorance , bigotry , pictures of food for no particular reason , retweets of cats wearing hats or Vines of horses dancing to Kiswahili Christian music . <p> Another thing is a soiled sanitary pad . <p> One recently popped up on my timeline and my first reaction was to exclaim " vile " out loud much to the dismay of the person sitting next to me . <p> This reaction was to a photo taken by some UCT students as part of their campaign that poses the question : " What if rape was as disgusting to you as menstruation ? " It 's a good question . Much as that photo had been unexpected why would I have had such an adverse reaction to something so natural ? <p> Yes , my name is Kagure and I have a period every month . <p> Please hold your applause , despite my martyr attitude during that time I am not the first and only one and I will not be the last . <p> Aunt Flo . The Red Visitor . That " TimeOfTheMonth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered " unclean " for going through a process that forms part of the cycle of life . We are more comfortable with a man randomly blowing his load than we are with the idea of a woman shedding the lining of her uterus . <p> Even outside the idea of bearing children , which is not the only justifiable reason to embrace the idea of having your period , there are other reasons to embrace this time . It is a monthly spring clean in which oestrogen is released and this adds to strong bones , which is only one of the many magical things that happen . <p> It is a completely natural process that women navigate every month . They have done this for decades , this commitment in itself is commendable . <p> But despite this natural occurrence we have done everything to hide it from society .

And when you buy sanitary pads they 're sometimes wrapped up so tight in a plastic bag that you 'd think you 'd just engaged in some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of being unclean , evidence of this can be found in various religious , media and social notions .

Too much hair , too much sweat , too much anything is not a good look on a woman . <p> Rupi Kaur 's photos were deleted after Instagram claimed they violated the company 's " community guidelines " . This project sought to demystify the period and make something that is innate " normal " . <p> Tampon and pad adverts have taught us for years that we must be delicate and discreet during a time when all some of us want to do is thunder through the world and possibly hug a packet of party-sized crisps and weep . <p> Well that is me anyway . <p> Tampon adverts show us blue " blood " , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get shot and the blood covers everything . How about an advert where a woman slays a monster , Kill Bill style , which then gushes blood and she uses a tampon to soak it up ? Now that product I would buy . That resonates with me far more than playing volleyball on the beach or being able to go roller-skating ( why does buying tampons mean I must suddenly be active anyway ? ) <p> We should not be so appalled by our period . I am not saying you must live tweet about it while posting no-filter selfies for a week , but when I mention my period in polite conversation do not look at me like I have just thrown a turd at you . <p> I have not . I 've just mentioned something that happens to me every month since I was 12 . <p> This especially goes to the women because we 're all in the same boat . <p> And as for men , in a world of equal parenting not knowing how to buy your teenage daughter tampons or sanitary pads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days where we clap for being able to say something other than " lady products " . <p> We need to stop shying away from the idea of menstruation . We live in a world where we barely flinch at images of people getting shot , mass mobs being incited to violence , people beaten to a pulp or people being sexually assaulted in increasingly bizarre and brutal ways . These are the things that should shock us , not something that has been happening every day since the beginning of time . <p> We should not be ashamed to talk about our periods any more than we should be ashamed of talking about having a cold , growing our hair or putting on deodorant . There are far worse things to be outraged about . <p> " What if rape was as disgusting to you as menstruation ?

@@3158238 @ @ @ @ blackout <p> Kamohelo Mokotjo of Bafana attacks during the International Friendly match between Swaziland and South Africa at Somhlolo Stadium . ( Photo by Duif du Toit/Gallo Images ) <h> I have just returned from Swaziland and Nelspruit , where I was lucky enough to get the opportunity take in both of Bafana Bafana 's international friendlies against Swaziland and Nigeria . <p> My trip to Lobamba and Mbabane in Swaziland was a fascinating one . I stayed at a lovely bed and breakfast on top of a hill in Mbabane , the only real minus was that it was a 35-minute drive to the stadium in Lobamba where Bafana were playing . This would actually have been fine too had it not been for the fact that if you think the people of Johannesburg drive like maniacs , you should take a trip to Swaziland . Somehow I survived to tell the tale of a near-death experience , as a bakkie with dysfunctional headlights almost ended my existence . <p> Thus I remain one of only a few thousand people able to tell the tale of the game against Swaziland , as it was not broadcast on television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor SuperSport saw fit to show a game involving South Africa 's national football team . <p> But anyway , it was great to see so many players get their Bafana debuts , and particularly to see one man making his first Bafana start . Kamohelo Mokotjo looked a class above anyone else in Lobamba , especially in the first half , where his eye for a pass and movement off the ball showed exactly why he is a star in the Dutch Eredivisie . <p> Bizarrely , Mokotjo was not even deemed worthy of a substitute 's appearance against Nigeria in Nelspruit . South Africans really deserve to see much more of this classy midfielder , and I hope this does not prove a one-off appearance under Shakes Mashaba , who already stretched the boundaries of sanity when he described Mokotjo as " heavy and sluggish " after he was last with the squad for September Afcon qualifiers against Sudan and Nigeria . <p> Having said all this , Bafana Bafana did play well against Nigeria , where Bongani Zungu was a revelation , giving by far his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also superb -- he has made a welcome return to Mashaba 's starting XI . <p> Inside this week 's Phakaaathi , we cast our eye over Bafana 's performances against both Swaziland and Nigeria , and Serero is our star man . Special mention must also go to Thabo Mnyamane , the Tuks striker scoring a fine goal on debut against Swaziland . <p> We also profile Thulani Hlatshwayo , who captained Bafana for the first time and scored his first goal for Bafana against the Swazis . He then retained the armband for the Nigeria game . Hlatshwayo has certainly made a decent case to get the captaincy whenever Dean Furman is not around . <p> Elsewhere in this week 's Phakaaathi , the Champions League is on the horizon again , and we look ahead to the challenges facing Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns in Casablanca and Lubumbashi .

@@3164238 <h> Buhari : From despot to ' democrat ' <p> The newly elected president of Africa 's biggest democracy is a former military dictator and political prisoner who once waged a draconian " war against indiscipline " but now insists he is a born-again democrat . <p> Muhammadu Buhari , a 72-year-old Muslim , managed to persuade Nigerians he is a reformed character who respects civil liberties yet still wields enough of an iron fist to beat corruption and the insurgency by Boko Haram . <p> His first spell in power was a generation ago in a very different , pre-internet era , when democracy had a less steady foothold on the continent . Buhari , who served as a minister in the 1970s , ousted elected president Shehu Shagari on New Year 's Eve in 1983 and ruled a military government until August 27 1985 . <p> The strongman sent soldiers into the streets with whips to enforce traffic regulations and ensure commuters formed orderly queues at bus stops . Civil servants arriving late at their offices were forced to perform frog squats . Tens of thousands of immigrants from other West African nations were expelled . About 500 politicians , officials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption . <p> Critics of the regime , including Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti , were also put behind bars . Buhari passed laws allowing indefinite detention without trial and imposed a decree to restrict press freedom , under which two journalists were jailed . The execution of three young men , retrospectively convicted of drug trafficking , led to an international outcry . <p> The war against indiscipline was carried to " sadistic levels , glorying in the humiliation of a people " , wrote Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka . <p> In one bizarre episode , Buhari fell out with Britain , the former colonial power , after attempting to smuggle Shagari 's former adviser , Umaru Dikko , from London to Lagos . Dikko , who had fled to Britain after the coup , was found drugged in a crate at Stansted airport . <p> Imprisoned for 40 months As part of antigraft measures , Buhari also ordered that the currency be replaced . Prices rose while living standards sank , leading to a palace coup by General Ibrahim Babangida . Buhari was overthrown and imprisoned for 40 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buhari fought and lost three elections , including one in 2011 against Goodluck Jonathan of the dominant People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) .

The former army general , now wearing traditional robes and thick-framed spectacles , worked hard to bury his reputation . He said : " Before you is a former military ruler and a converted democrat who is ready to operate under democratic norms and is subjecting himself to the rigours of democratic elections for the fourth time .

He can spring a surprise like taking Nigeria under sharia law . Once a dictator , always a dictator . He 's tried to be a born-again democrat , but we have not seen that in his utterances . Many people are afraid that if he wins , they will go to prison . " <p> But Bola Tinubu , the national leader of the APC and former Lagos governor , said : " I think leaders must take responsibility , not like Jonathan today , who says he has never done anything wrong -- he will give you excuses for why , blame it on somebody else .

His reputation as an incorruptible , modest-living politician made his pledges to tackle government graft believable . <p> Jonathan , on the other hand , could n't escape the fact that Boko Haram has grown in strength during his five years as president . <p> Recapturing territory Only six weeks ago , the Nigerian army , with soldiers from neighbouring countries , launched operations to recapture territory lost to the Islamists who had declared a caliphate on Nigerian soil .

Some are also believed to be responsible for blowing up ATMs . <p> It is thought some of their accomplices , who are still at large , robbed a cellphone shop in Hyde Park , Johannesburg , two weeks ago . <p> National police spokesperson Lieutenant General Solomon Makgale said : " Most of the suspects responsible for the robberies in Gauteng and the Western Cape are currently behind bars .

In so doing it has become an embarrassment " . <p> Add to that Eskom 's failure to maintain its generation infrastructure , unreliable , ageing equipment , too many people demanding too little electricity and the problems appear insurmountable . <p> The good news is that the first power produced from Medupi 's unit six has come on line , but this is still a small step in the greater power output that South Africa needs to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's role in all this public angst and turmoil ? <p> Eskom 's recently dethroned chairman Zola Tsotsi believed he needed to play a leading role in designing , guiding measuring and enabling the changes needed . But somehow he got his brief horribly wrong and was summarily fired . <p> What is clear is that the chairman 's responsibilities at Eskom must be closely aligned with the policies of the Department of Public Enterprises and presumably with the country as a whole . There is more . Ngubane might also have to work with a brand new Eskom board . <p> Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown says she is working on replacing the current members . <p> No wonder then , that many commentators are asking if the man chosen for the job has been handed a poisoned chalice or at best a glass of sour milk . <p> In a contemporary sense the 74-year-old political campaigner , born and bred on the outskirts of Durban , schooled in Mariannhill and trained as a doctor at UKZN , has had a chequered political career with as many ups as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders led to his demise as KZN premier . Formerly a member of the IFP , Ngubane resigned to join the ANC in 2006 . <p> In recent years he 's been tasked with babysitting the country 's troubled parastatals , not always with success . <p> His controversial unilateral decision-making as chairman of the SABC board landed him in hot water and resulted in a vote of no confidence . <p> His second stint on the SABC board was even more disastrous . <p> After months of conflict with board members over Ngubane 's reinstatement of the SABC 's questionable chief operations officer , Hlaudi Motsoeneng , the board faced imminent collapse and was dissolved by Zuma . <p> However , he did have better luck in 2010 with the Land Bank , which had a turn-around during his chairmanship . <p> As one political commentator put it : " This Eskom appointment is the biggest gamble of the lot . If it does n't work , God help us . " <p> Turning Eskom 's fortunes around is as much a gamble for Ngubane as it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be losing patience with its leader 's choices of people for top positions and the fallout that inevitably seems to follow . <p> While Zuma and Ngubane are both home-grown KZN political warriors , they have had spats in the past . <p> The gloves came off when in an address to the SA Institute of Race Relations in 1998 Ngubane warned that the passing of the Employment Equity Bill would bring about an entirely new system of what he called " bureaucratic meddling " in the affairs of private business . <p> In a fit of pique the ANC local government under Zuma thereafter described him as a " desperado " and the number one enemy of transformation , black empowerment and democracy . <p> Have feelings changed -- or is Zuma 's appointment of his old adversary simply a last ditch stand to avoid a complete blackout of the country 's electricity grid ? <p> Observers are already asking if Eskom is so far down the tubes , that even one notch up from complete disaster would offer a glimmer of hope . <p> The unfolding Eskom drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskom chairman Zola Tsotsi vacating the hot seat , and the new incumbent already entering centre stage , is far from over . <p> There is little chance Big Ben knows how the lights work .

File photo : Paulo Whitaker <p> Rio de Janeiro - When Italian oil services company Saipem SpA spent $300 million at the start of the decade in Brazil , it joined a long list of foreign companies jockeying for business with Petroleo Brasileiro SA . Now it 's struggling to get paid . <p> Saipem is one of at least five European companies that spoke about late payments , delivery delays or other difficulties in Brazil during fourth-quarter earnings calls . While day-to-day operations are functioning , Petrobras partners are also facing decision-making obstacles that are inhibiting planning , said officials at partners Galp Energia SGPS SA , BG Group PLC and Repsol SA who asked not to be named . <p> It 's a stark reversal from five years ago when a wave of European and US oil-services companies eagerly flocked to Brazil to build plants and set up offices .

Today , Petrobras is slashing spending as oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit markets because of a sweeping corruption scandal . <p> Siem does n't know if the four to six vessels it had marked for Brazilian contracts will be needed now , Soerensen said . <p> Saipem executives said in a February 16 earnings call that some payments from Petrobras were late . Norway 's Aker Solutions ASA CEO Luis Araujo said in a March 17 interview that the company was asked to delay equipment deliveries . Vallourec SA , a French oil-pipeline maker , and Alfa Laval AB , a Swedish oil industry engineering firm , also cited a difficult business environment in February conference calls . <p> US oilfield-service providers Halliburton and Schlumberger Ltd echoed similar concerns . Houston-based Halliburton sees activity continuing to decline in Brazil , President Jeff Miller said in a conference call earlier this year . The spending cuts Petrobras has announced will create " challenges " this year , Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said . <p> Brazil 's President Dilma Rousseff said on Tuesday that Petrobras 's recovery would proceed by publishing a long-delayed audited financial statement by the end of April .

On the same day , shares and bonds rallied as the company signed a $3.5 billion lending arrangement with China Development Bank . <p> The fallout for European and US companies shows how far the corruption scandal has spread . In addition to cutting an investment plan that was once the global oil industry 's largest , Petrobras is also selling $13.7 billion in assets . <p> The state-run oil producer is grappling to assess the magnitude of losses from a scandal in which some of its executives are accused of taking kickbacks from builders in exchange for awarding inflated construction contracts . That 's delaying the release of audited financial results and in turn preventing it from selling bonds overseas . <p> Norway 's Odfjell Drilling Ltd last week said it may end a partnership with Galvao Oleo &amp; Gas SA , a unit of a Brazilian holding company Grupo Galvao , and is reviewing its operations in Brazil after the company was linked to the scandal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with the Norwegian company to undo the partnership . <p> Management overhaul <p> " It 's a prerequisite that it can be completed in accordance with our anti-corruption guidelines and international laws and regulations , " Odfjell spokesman Gisle Johanson said by phone on March 27 .

@@3193235 <h> Amplats spin-off given short shrift <p> David McKay Tue , 14 Apr 2015 16:50 <p> miningmx.com ? THE prospect of Anglo American Platinum ( Amplats ) choosing a listing of its non-core platinum assets has drawn heavy criticism from an analyst who believed that investors would be foolish to take up shares in the firm . <p> Amplats CEO , Chris Griffith , said last year that the company would consider listing its underground mines and even its Union section , which it is also selling , if it couldn ? t find a buyer for the assets . Although unconfirmed by the company , it is thought the group is seeking a book value of about R10bn for the mines which exclude the smelter facilities . <p> However , buyers have been hard to find , especially at that price : Northam Platinum , Royal Bafokeng Platinum , and African Rainbow Minerals have lost interest in the bidding process , while a fourth and perhaps the most willing suitor , Sibanye Gold , thinks the price is too rich . <p> As a result , the Plan B that Griffith referred to last year is being considered as a Plan A option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mines to an empowerment partner , with a further 30% to 40% sold in a book-build exercise , and the balance retained by Amplats . <p> However , Leon Esterhuizen , an analyst for CIBC Capital Markets in London , questioned the possible success of an IPO of the mines saying that listing the mines when there were no buyers probably confirms it to be a poor proposition . <p> ? Why would investors be willing to take the risk in full knowledge that several companies with detailed access to the data had baulked at the price ? ? he said . <p> ? If these assets hardly make sense in the hands of Amplats , how will it be able to make sense in the hands of another company that has to pay away as much as 20% of the revenue line on the offtake agreement ( for smelting and refining ) ? ? <p> Esterhuizen added that R10bn seemed too much for such an out-the-money option , particularly as Amplats would want to increase output at much lower cost from other assets . <p> ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a BEE vehicle , as well as hold on to a large chunk of stock , the value proposition for prospective investors will be even further diluted . <p> ?

@@3206230 <h> The role played by Black Twitter in South Africa <p> For those of you coming late to the party , according to Wikipedia Black Twitter is " a cultural identity on the twitter social network focused on issues of interest to the black community " , and the movement began trending in the United States around 2009 . <p> People to the likes of Feminista Jones described it as a " collective of active , primarily African American twitter users who have created a virtual community " that allows them to bring about and discuss a wide range of socio-political issues with some humour . Through the movement they are able to give each other moral support and share their experiences as strangers who all bare similar stories , but they also engage in recent events and pop culture happenings . <h> Tackling racial issues <p> Overtime other people and groups who are not black were also able to participate in the discussions since twitter is an open platform , and others found that although their colour was different they still had common human experiences . Black Twitter serves to encourage open and critical discussions especially about race relations and indifference . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises awareness against issues faced by their diverse black communities . <p> In the South African context Black Twitter seems to carry a different tone because it appears to be intended for a niche market of black young middle-class twelebs ( twitter celebs ) . In comparison to their US counterpart the movement here is not just for any black person with something to say , but for a few intellectuals who are very equipped and versed when it comes to issues of culture , current affairs and politics , thus it 's known to be an exclusive community that proves difficult to break into . Hence Pontsho Pilane ( 28 July : 2014 ) remarked in her article that " being black does not give you a default pass into this realm " . <p> I find that especially in this context not many people know of its existence and that some of those who heard of it do n't understand the purpose it serves . In essence Black Twitter gained popularity in South Africa around 2012 when users tackled issues that grabbed the attention of mainstream media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popular South African musician and Helen Zille had a showdown on twitter that raised many eyebrows , but now the so called ' twitter wars ' have become common practice . <p> The participants of the hashtag appear to be holding all kinds of people to account for behaviour they consider uncharacteristic . This ' thing ' exists in a country with an apartheid backdrop where most people react to debates about race as though they are profanity , thus people fear being politically incorrect or ' ruffing up feathers ' . <p> Black Twitter users not only hold white people to account , but also other black people whom are regarded as not being ' black enough ' , hence there are ' levels of blackness ' observed which are used to criticise behaviour regarded as below par . <h> There are two different ways to think about the role played by Black Twitter in this society : <p> First of all , one can either think of it as a space that permits black people who did n't previously have the platform to openly express their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They get to hashtag rare relatable moments that are sometimes humorous ; they discuss latest popular soapies and etiquettes practised by many black families . In hindsight they are now slowly dominating the mainstream platform that sometime fails to engage in critical issues about race and indifference . They evoke relevant debate and leave a memorable trademark through their sometimes controversial approach because users engage in current socio-political concerns . Their banter about race relations forces those who pay attention to confront the wounds that remain unhealed in order to have an honest debate that could alter the way we see and think of each other . <p> But on the other-hand , despite their sometimes light approach to serious issues , the participants could easily be perceived as elitist watchdogs that segregate those who choose to be a little different from what 's considered the ' norm ' . Black Twitter users often marginalise black minorities who were socialised within contexts others consider to be ' white ' , thus the backlash they are subjected to can sometimes prove to be demeaning since it questions their authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people should be able to choose how they express their blackness and who they want to be without criticism . No one has the license to impose any expectations of blackness . Why should others take liberty devaluing other people 's character ? The most common remark that one comes across when deciphering through those who have received backlash from Black Twitter is that " you do n't mess with black twitter . " Henceforth users are n't always very kind when black people wear their blackness in a manner that is considered ' white ' . <p> I believe that all people 's perceptions and ways should be respected even if you 're not seen to be fitting the status quo. #BlackTwitter is a thing that continues to make heads roll . <h> About Rebone Masemola <p> Rebone Masemola is a Social media and strategy Learner at Digital Marketing Agency , Johannesburg .

This latest spate of violence is shocking . There 's no denying that . But to take those devastating tragedies and expand them like a blanket over the entire country and then to colour our nation in the blood red violence is simply not an accurate reflection of the facts . <p> While South Africa does have the highest crime rate in the world , it also is one of the best performing young democracies in the emerging world . Our centre has held for two decades . While our Gini coefficient is high and climbing , so is that of the rest -- national inequality is at an all-time high globally .

Yet , while these were going on , millions upon millions of South Africans were going about their daily tasks mindful of the interests of their children , their brothers and sisters and their friends . These millions of South Africans were working towards a better future for themselves and those they care about .

The fact is , South Africa is in a crisis . The economy is not growing , youth unemployment has skyrocketed and the relationship between the ruling elites who run the place is dangerously bad .

Every day I hear complaints about the lack of leadership in the country required to deal with our issues . Every day I hear someone complain about our inability to work together towards a common future . In those narratives , the " other " is always at fault .

Are we facing doom in a rather more literal way , as well ? <p> 00:27 -- From the editing , it 's implied this research is being conducted within the Baxter Building . ( There are other shots within the trailer of a military facility , so that 's also a distinct possibility for where all this is taking place . " The Baxter Building is an iconic Marvel location in Manhattan , serving as the headquarters of the Fantastic Four . The design is a neat mixture of the old and -- the original facade of the building , seen at the bottom of the frame , gives way to a much larger building composed of glass and steel . <p> 00:29 -- It looks like a new project has begun under the stewardship of Reed . Are they building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not all about Reed , as there are several shots in the trailer which establish the team future team and the dynamics that exist between them and their future nemesis , Doom . In fact , you can spy Sue and Victor Domashev ( aka Doom ) working side-by-side through the metal apparatus . <p> 00:30 -- We know Domashev is a world-class hacker , so it 's possible he was brought onto the project for his superior coding abilities . <p> 00:32 -- This looks like a college library . Is the project associated with a particular New York faculty ? Or is Sue still in college ? From the headphones , it looks like she 's busy studying while Reed is possibly trying to catch her attention for reasons beyond the secret project in hand . <p> 00:39 -- I 'm unsure why Michael B. Jordan ( Johnny Storm ) has a broken arm in this scene -- my bet is it 's something to do with the following scene and to imply he 's the risk-taker of the group . This short exchange with Domashev also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their first encounter . Maybe Johnny knows from the get-go than Domashev should n't be trusted . <p> 00:40 -- Here 's Johnny racing a modified car which has the ability to ' flame on ' in its own way . The first teaser showed him hunched over an engine , presumably it 's of his own design . It might also explain why he 's on the team . Maybe Johnny is the team 's expert engineer . <p> 00:41 -- Dangling from his rear-view mirror is a fire flower , which is of course the power-up which enables Mario to shoot fireballs . Foreshadowing , people ! <p> 00:47 -- There 's a lot of character shorthand going on in this trailer -- who might be in love , who 's the risk taker , who 's the bad egg -- and Ben Grimm 's fleeting appearance sets him up as the no-nonsense , blue collar muscle . We 're still not sure of his profession or why he ends up on the mission . Yes , he 's a childhood friend of Reed but surely he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a sign . It 's possible he has a military background like in the source material . <p> 00:52 -- This looks like it might be the first iteration of the teleporter under Reed 's supervision . It 's high-tech , but not as advanced or sleek as the one glimpsed later in the trailer . This still looks like it 's been built by hand -- there are nuts and bolts , exposed wires , and the metal has visible weld marks . <p> 00:54 -- This is a nice shot of four of the five lead characters , with only Ben Grimm missing out . It 's seems as if their hard work has culminated in a successful test . <p> 01:00 -- Maybe the first test involved inorganic or non-human test subjects . This looks like it takes place moments before the first real manned mission . Johnny and Victor have donned white suits , which are reminiscent of the Future Foundation , a Marvel team derived from the Fantastic , created by Jonathan Hickman and Steve Epting . <p> 01:05 -- It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team definitely consists of Reed , Ben , and Victor . We think the fourth might be Johnny , but we 're not exactly sure . <p> 01:08 -- The men in suits , along with Dr. Storm , are watching from the safety of an enclosed room with protective glasses . <p> 01:13 -- Note the teleporter does n't just relocate the crew with the machine itself making the journey . Makes sense . They need to get home somehow , rather than just beam back . <p> 01:19 -- The team find themselves in the N-Zone , an alternate reality . Presumably this place holds the key to averting whatever threat is facing earth . It appears to be a hostile planet , with molten lava violently bubbling under its crust . It 's a place of violent and unpredictable geology . Perhaps a quake or a landslide leads to Victor falling off this cliff . Reed stretches -- again more foreshadowing -- to save his life , but he falls all the same . Why does n't Doom die ? Has he already undergone some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lava of this planet is the very thing that brings about his particular deformaiton . <p> 01:25 -- Reed 's suit design implies this is still the same trip . Something has gone horribly wrong . Have they teleported back as a violent eruption was occurring ? <p> 01:32 -- Individual shots of the team 's respective abilities follow . They 're being quarantined in a secret military facility -- " All I want to know is where are my children , " says Dr. Storm -- and studied by a team in hazmat suits . Elder says only four survived . Who do they think is dead ? Doom is the obvious candidate . <p> There 's probably a fear of infection and general danger around the team following their disturbing transformations . <p> Most of them look painful , playing up the influence of David Cronenberg and the body horror subgenera director Josh Trank has acknowledged . Reed 's ligaments awkwardly contract and collapse around his underlying bones . He does n't simply have the consistency of rubber ; his human body is being pushed beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes in pain when he flames on . It 's highly unlikely it 'll be painful throughout the film -- he seems to be harnessing the power quite effortlessly later on -- but perhaps this is still a part of the initial metamorphosis . <p> 01:36 -- Sue Storm possesses the ability to become invisible , but the trailer goes on to elaborate her powers , suggesting Trank is a presenting a much more powerful version of Sue than we 've seen on the big screen before . <p> 01:37 -- It appears the Thing is ' hatching ' from a rock mass . Perhaps Ben did n't get transported back with the original team , but a big rock cluster did , and maybe they were n't entirely sure this was Grimm . It looks like Ben molecularly fused/spliced with the rock formations found in the N-Zone . <p> 01:43 -- Despite some of those early shots obscuring them , that 's still the ever-lovin ' blue-eyed Thing . <p> 01:44 -- In addition to invisibility Sue also possesses the ability to force fields and other invisible energy constructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability -- she crushes these metal containers with ease . <p> 01:51 -- The hero shot . We 're still not entirely sure why that plane is being sucked into the N-Zone , but perhaps his is the threat that is facing earth -- our reality is being torn apart by something here in the N-Zone , hence the reconnaissance mission . <p> It 's also worth taking a closer look at the suits for each of the members , as they 're designed with their respective powers in mind . ( Well , the Thing appears to be naked . ' Nuff said ! ) Reed 's suit appears to be modular , lashed together with bungee cords , to accommodate his power . Johnny 's has vents to regulate his internal temperate and release the flames . And Sue 's ... err , Sue has gloves . <p> 01:52 -- This appears to be a more refined version of the previous machine . Is this Reed 's second , more refined iteration which he builds to return to the N-Zone , avert the disaster ? <p> 01:55 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first teaser trailer . She 's tracking down Doom , the hacker alias of Domashev , presumably to bring him onto the team . <p> 01:56 -- Johnny appears to be pressing something on his suit at the same time as activating his powers . Trank has described these uniforms as ' containment suits ' , but are they actively ' containing ' the team 's new powers ? Maybe they 're designed to regulate them before the team fully knows how to control them . It also gives us a better look at how Johnny 's suit is designed with his ability in mind . <p> 02:03 -- Domashev does n't die from that fall . Look closely at the mouthpiece and compare it with the suit the team wears on its first trip . There 's a definite similarity , implying Doom is fused with his suit . Also , look beneath it , and a turquoise energy pulses below the surfaces . It 's similar to the cloud that engulfs the machine as it teleports . It 's possible Doom know possesses this ability himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02:04 -- This energy bubble in Manhattan also resembles that surrounding the teleporter . Is a rip opening up between our world and N-Zone ? <p> 02:11 -- Johnny attacks what appears to be Sue Storm . She protects herself using an energy shield . Why have brother and sister turned on each other ? It looks like the same corridor we see elsewhere in the trailer . Is she protecting Ben , who Johnny thinks is a danger , or possibly even Domashev , who she thinks is still to be trusted ? <p> 02:13 -- Yep , the Thing is definitely bullet proof . <p> 02:14 -- We 're back in the N-Zone , and while we 're sure Johnny does n't die this scene definitely implies he 's in some sort of trouble . It 's possible Sue volunteers for the second-trip into the N-Zone and finds Johnny there , wounded . <p> 02:16 -- These are two of the most interesting shots in the entire trailer . We see the Human Torch flying through the N-Zone , chasing or racing alongside a blue UFO which flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse shot reveals this blue object to be Sue Storm , again demonstrating the power of her abilities . It appears she 's encased herself within a psionic field and is propelling herself through the air . Effectively , Sue Storm can fly in the new movie . Sue 's abilities reflect the way in which her character developed into a more active hero in source material , too , where she uses her psionic ability to create a variety of constructs and can even use them to explode objects . <p> 02:18 -- Doom appears to be on the floor , and there 's no real insight for this . It 's pretty obvious . It 's clobberin ' time . <p> Josh Trank 's Fantastic Four comes out in the UK and Australia on August 6th and a day later on the 7th in the US . <p> Daniel is IGN 's Games Editor over in London . He writes about movies , too . You can be part of the world 's most embarrassing cult by following him on IGN and Twitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Despite the trials and tribulations , the annual ' great trek ' to Germiston is a rite of passage for breeders and a pilgrimage for those in search of their next champion at South Africa 's sales Mecca . For mere mortals like me , along to observe rather than to join the auction fray , three days , 450 of the best South African bloodstock has to offer , plus the top breeders and selectors in the business is more or less the equivalent of a three day Christmas . <p> Sales prep ( photo : Candiese Marnewick ) <p> Germiston came alive as yearlings , grooms , feed and sales paraphernalia started arriving as early as 8 April and stud teams got to work setting up their sales yards . I love the individual touches of the entertainment areas , flower baskets , personalised name boards and bridle numbers and how each stud puts their individual stamp on their draft . With the best coffee and squidgy biscuits in town Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backworth has beautiful , ornate name boards , Summerhill kit their draft out in gorgeous , gold piped sales bridles , Piemonte have the prettiest bridle numbers in town and there 's any combination of quarter marks , glitter and dazzle to ensure that every yearling is shown off to perfection . <p> The week 's events were formally kicked off with the TBA 's Gr1 awards on Tuesday , 21 April . Opting to host these at Germiston rather than at Emperor 's Palace this year was very well received . It was convenient for everyone to attend and the food and atmosphere were great . The tireless Graeme Hawkins manned the mic with his usual aplomb and in a season that included imported stars such as Alboran Sea , Harry 's Son , Ertijaal and Majmu , it was gratifying to see our homebreds more than holding their own . Guy Murdoch and Drakenstein Stud Farm were the big winners on the night , taking home 3 trophies apiece .

My congratulations to you all . <h> Nice touches <p> The nerves and anticipation were at breaking point and the three-day roller coaster ride began when bidding officially opened at 1pm on Wednesday , 22 April . When one is focussed on your catalogue and trying to select a champion from dizzying hundreds on offer , it 's easy to forget about the auctioneers on the rostrum , but the team of Steve Davis , Andrew Miller and Graeme Hawkins did sterling work . <p> Chris Norris ( left ) with TBA CEO Kevin Woolward ( photo : Chris Norris ) <p> The TBA 's Kevin Woolward was only officially installed as the CEO last September , but is already making his presence felt .

The handsome colt by Gimmethegreenlight out of Albizia attracted competitive bidding before the hammer fell at R1,7 million to Simmerton Stud . Freshman sire Gimmethegreenlight 's progeny have been very well received , fetching R900k at the CTS Premier Sale , R950k at Val de Vie and now achieving R1,7 million . In fact , Gimmethegreenlight finished 5th on the overall sires log by aggregate for the NYS and if they run as good as they look , we 're set for some exciting racing . <p> Top colt -- Lot 41 Arabian Dynasty ( Dynasty-Arabian Jazz ) <p> Lot 41 produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ascot Stud 's Arabian Dynasty ( Dynasty-Arabian Jazz ) which came with a nice back story . Millard trained granddam Arabian Lass , who raced for the interests of Mr P Ekon , for 4 Gr1 wins in South Africa as well as two ARCSA Champion awards . The filly was subsequently sold to Robert Sangster 's Swettenham operation for stud purposes . A few years on , Millard purchased Arabian Lass 's daughter , Arabian Jazz on a buying trip to Australia and brought her back to South Africa . The filly raced in the interests of Rose and Ashleigh Parker before retiring to the Ascot Stud paddocks . I thought it rather fun to see the colt knocked down to Tony Millard and continue the association to a third generation . <p> An unnamed Silvano colt out of Blushing Fairy ( Lot 68 ) consigned by Ascot Stud as agent caught the eye of Form Bloodstock , who had to go to R2,2 million to secure the exceptionally handsome bay .

Jessica Slack explained that Crown Office is blind in one eye and an absolute stud favourite , so she was delighted to see the colt go to such nice people and quipped that he would look great in Shadwell 's blue silks . <p> The day finished on a high , when Lot 150 , Klipdrif 's Dynasty colt out of Firstnightbliss fetched R2million from Gavin Smith Racing . A somewhat dazed-looking Smith admitted , " I got pushed , but I really wanted him and just want to thank my client for pushing through .

Consigned by Cheveley Stud and signed for by John Freeman on behalf of Jack Mitchell , this is another colt with a lot of provenance . Jack Mitchell was school friends with Wilfred Koster and paying a visit to the farm back in 2006 , picked out a colt in the paddock . He turned out to be the first produce from Hunter 's Glen by freshman sire , Badger 's Drift . John Freeman was asked to assess him at the 2006 Grand West Yearling Sale , approved and the gavel duly fell his way . Among his 9 career wins the colt , named Ivory Trail , beat Pocket Power in the 2009 Champions Cup and lowering Sabre 's 57 year-old race record in the process .

While the rest of the auditorium gaped , Steve Davis deftly presided over the bidding which heated up between Rattray and Angus Gold . Gold finally reluctantly conceded defeat and the hammer fell Rattray 's way at R4,75 million , setting a new South African record for a filly .

Alesh enthused , " He 's an absolutely gorgeous colt and I just had to have him , " confirming " He 'll be going to Charlie Laird .

Leaf and Mitchell have subsequently formed a friendship and resolved to buy a horse together . It turns out that One Direction is that horse . Jack said " Legislate is owned by myself , Gaynor ( Rupert ) and Dennis and Gael Evans . Here we 're putting the whole July 2014 group back together again . Gaynor bred him and he 'll be raced between myself , the Evans ' and Michael Leaf . How 's that for a story ?

Pippa Mickleburgh related that Sports Chestnut is no longer around and that this was her last foal , making him a particularly special individual . <h> Stats <p> A few days on , the aggregate has settled at R126 527 500 .

Leading sire by aggregate was Silvano ( R21,36 million ) , with Dynasty topping the list by average at R1,2million . The top priced lot was also the top priced filly in Lammerskraal 's Savannah Cat ( R4,75million ) . The top priced colt was Ascot 's Arabian Dynasty ( R4,25 million ) . <p> It was a very strong catalogue and buyers had their work cut out , with one pundit struggling with their longest short list in memory .

@@3267232 <p> WARREN DICK : Hi I 'm warren Dick , the editor of Mineweb and today I 'm joined by Lazarus Zim , chairman of Northam Platinum and the chairman elect of the Zambezi Consortium . Good to speak to you today Mr Zim . <p> LAZARUS ZIM : Hey Warren , good evening to you and to the listeners . <p> WARREN DICK : So we wanted to just understand a little bit more about the transaction . Who and what are the Zambezi Consortium ? <p> LAZARUS ZIM : Warren , the Zambezi Consortium is a conglomeration of a number of players , ranging from strategic partners , women 's groups and employees of the company both in the two mines , one is Zondereinde as well as Booysendal and then in addition we 've got the communities there in the region of Zondereinde as well as Booysendal so it 's a very broad based grouping . <p> WARREN DICK : So it consists of a couple of parties there and as I understand it the idea is to fund an empowerment consortium into the ownership of Northam Platinum , the listed company . As I understand the ownership strucure , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consortium owning 35.4% of Northam Platinum . Is that correct ? <p> LAZARUS ZIM : It will be 31.4% and what 's happening is that the transaction is already on the go with a listing today . We have one week of trading , and then on Monday next week we will close , at which point essentially all the shareholders of Northam have been given an opportunity or letters of allocation to be subscribed into preference shares into Zambezi . We will raise a total of R4.6bn , of that , we will then pump in R4.2bn into Northam for the application of 31.4% of Northam . <p> When we arrive above the 35% remember that we only have 4% of the company in the hands of the Toro Trust , which is an employee share incentive scheme . So if you look at that plus the Zambezi Consortium it means that the total amount of empowerment in Northam now goes above 35% . <p> WARREN DICK : Ok I got you . So from the money you raise from the preference share issue , those will then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> LAZARUS ZIM : That 's right . <p> WARREN DICK : And in return , as I understand it , can anyone buy the preference share as it is ? <p> LAZARUS ZIM : Yes indeed . The idea behind today 's listing was also to create a platform where everybody or anybody who wants to invest in Northam can then enter through Zambezi . So these are tradable and the preference shares will exist for a 10-year period . <p> WARREN DICK : Ok , great . Now a preference share is a little bit different because it promises to pay a rate of interest that is not typically common with common shares . So what is the referenced interest rate on preference shares and what can investors expect to get in the way of distributions or dividends ? <p> LAZARUS ZIM : Warren , the coupon value is quite attractive , it 's prime plus 3.5% which is more than anything that you can find on the market at the moment . And the idea behind that was to make the return on the preference share to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in Zambezi is quite unique . This is the first time in the country that you have a combination of a black empowerment transaction and a fund raising -- capital raising for the company at the same time in a listed institute , in a listed vehicle . So this is an unprecedented transaction on its own . Now what we had to do was find a value accretive way to the shareholders to fund empowerment . It 's fully underwritten but we have been encouraging the shareholders , and indeed a number of analysts have also been encouraging the shareholders on the listing fundamentals to follow their rights as much as possible . <p> WARREN DICK : Now I believe from some comments that you 've given to other media houses is that it 's going to be a little bit of a different model in terms of the way the consortium works with the company . In fact I 've read that it 's suggest that you 're going to be very active participants with the company in terms of sourcing deals and being able to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what you see happening there between Zambezi and Northam together in this journey ? <p> LAZARUS ZIM : All right . The key thing really is that Zambezi is a resource platform so , for holding the platinum shares and for the empowerment . I 'm already on the board of Northam as well as deputy chairman and we would expect some of the Zambezi Consortium members also to join the board , but having said that it should not detract in any way from the normal corporate governance where you have a CEO and an executive team who are in charge of the business operationally , and then the board playing its role of non-executives and the majority of the members of the board also being independent . So the corporate governance structure of the company as such will be intact . So where a Zambezi Platinum member stumbles upon an opportunity in platinum he or she would have to direct it to the CEO and management and then they would analyse it in the normal course of business . If it makes business sense , yes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of it . <p> In fact , let me also add that there is a restraint -- all of us have signed a restraint of trade , that for the 10-year period , there would be a lock-in , none of us will be in a position to exit or to invest in any other platinum businesses .

@@3267234 ? Lamprecht <h> ' SA tax laws have not kept pace with digital economy ' <p> Source rules , treaties should be reconsidered -- PwC . <p> Ing ? **29;785;TOOLONG May 2015&amp;nbsp15:23 <p> JOHANNESBURG -- South African tax laws have not kept up with the growth in the digital economy , often leaving local multinationals at a disadvantage when they compete against their global counterparts in this arena , PwC argues . <p> It believes specific tax provisions and tax treaties should be expanded or changed in an effort to level the playing field and to ensure the fiscus collects its fair share of taxes . <p> The call comes amid international efforts to find a solution for tax leakage in the fast-growing digital economy . Governments globally are under pressure to broaden their tax bases and increase revenues as a result of dwindling economic growth . <p> Locally South Africa has already started taking steps in this regard with the introduction of legislation that requires foreign suppliers of electronic services to register for VAT from June 1 , 2014 . <p> VAT <p> Matthew Besanko , associate director in the tax services practice , says the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net is still quite narrow . <p> These services include educational services , games , e-books and music amongst others . <p> Besanko believes it is time to broaden to scope to also include intermediary-type services that are provided from offshore , software and online advertising . <p> Much of the revenue from online advertising flows outside South Africa and is n't taxed locally . <p> Direct tax <p> But while there seems to be general consensus about how VAT should be imposed on foreign electronic service suppliers , the debate around corporate tax is somewhat more controversial . <p> Cor Kraamwinkel , associated director in the corporate international tax division , says ten years ago securing a taxi through an offshore service provider like Uber , seemed impossible . <p> " What the digital economy is bringing to the world is the ability to render service and provide value from a distance -- remotely . " <p> Kraamwinkel says historically , most direct tax systems assumed that a business had some physical presence in the country . <p> If a business sold goods from Europe to South Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely have been able to compete on equal footing with its South African counterparts with a physical shop and employees . <p> " So there was method and logic to the system of not taxing the foreign entity and taxing the South African entity . " <p> Where South African multinationals compete against their global counterparts , the tax debate is even more complex . <p> Kraamwinkel says in South Africa a foreign service provider ( like iTunes or Google ) without a physical presence in South Africa is not liable for direct tax in South Africa . <p> This is not the result of any " fancy planning " but simply what the current law requires . <p> " It is a foreign service and the source of that service is not in South Africa . So just by complying the foreign service provider pays no tax in South Africa . " <p> Yet if the same customer acquired the same service from a South African-based service provider , the South African-based service provider would have paid 28% tax , he says . <p> Kraamwinkel says although there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service income -- South Africa 's compendium of anti-base erosion provisions , is quite sophisticated for a developing country . <p> The challenge in the e-commerce space is that it is difficult for legislation to keep up with the quick changes in technology , he says . <p> While businesses can deal with sophisticated legislation , inflexible or out-dated legislation is possibly a bigger concern . <p> Kyle Mandy , head of national tax technical , says South Africa 's tax rules need to be rewritten to capture the digital economy . <p> This will ensure that companies like Amazon and Apple pay direct taxes on income sourced in South Africa where they are operating in the local economy . <p> Mandy says the source rules have to be re-considered . This was also one of the recommendations made by the Davis Tax Committee in its interim report on base erosion and profit shifting ( Beps ) and the expectation is that it will be on the radar screen to be addressed this year . <p> It is also important to ensure that tax treaties provide appropriate taxing rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mandy says unfortunately there is nothing South African can do about this in isolation . <p> " That 's a global issue that needs a global solution to it and it 's something the OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are working on . " <p> But even if South Africa was to introduce new source rules , many foreign multinationals would still be able to escape tax in South Africa because of the way tax treaties are written at the moment , Kraamwinkel says . <p> The complete solution , lies not only in South African tax legislation -- which is a must-have to protect the tax base -- but also in a multilateral instrument whereby the harmonisation of rules globally are addressed , he says .

Users of iPhones will see glossy cover videos and photos tagged with map coordinates . Most important for impatient smartphone users , the company says , the so-called instant articles will load up to 10 times faster than they normally would since readers stay on Facebook rather than follow a link to another site . <p> Facebook has gone to unusual lengths to court the publishers participating in the project , some details of which were previously published by The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news publishers can either sell and embed advertisements in the articles , keeping all of the revenue , or allow Facebook to sell ads , with the social network getting 30 percent of the proceeds .

The social network , which has more than 1.4 billion active users worldwide , captures more attention of mobile users -- and prompts more visits to news sites -- than virtually any other service . <p> Publishers have little choice but to cooperate with Facebook , said Vivian Schiller , a former executive at NBC , The New York Times and Twitter who now advises media companies and brands .

" On the other hand , he said , " we 're trying to get out stories to as many people as possible , and at the same time , continue to build a core , loyal , enthusiastic audience . " <p> Facebook has a long history of changing the algorithm that determines what people see in their feeds . Zynga , the mobile gaming company , built its business on Facebook only to lose much of its traffic when the company changed the rules to make a user 's game activity less visible to friends . <p> Last year , Facebook decided to downgrade the prominence of viral content like cat videos and promote " high quality " news content .

" And second , helping people be informed about the world around them . " <p> The Atlantic is going into the Facebook deal with its eyes open , Bennett said , referring to the prospect that Facebook might be in a position to dictate less favorable terms if its importance to publishers increases . <p> Five American organizations are initially participating in the instant articles project and will publish one item each on Wednesday in the new format : BuzzFeed , National Geographic , The Atlantic , NBC News and The Times . <p> Four European outlets are also joining : The Guardian , BBC News , Bild and Spiegel Online .

" I think that our bundle of content will get even more compelling when it loads faster . " <p> Declan Moore , chief media officer of the National Geographic Society , said the appeal of instant articles was the speed with which items , even those with complex video and interactive maps , loaded once a mobile Facebook user clicked on them .

The greater arc of the story encompasses a group of British Joburg-based car owners , under Saker 's direction and accompanied by the Union Army , chasing De Wet and his troops across South Africa . <p> Ultimately , motorised transport that carries its own fuel and spares and is driven by owner-mechanic-drivers runs to ground horses and riders that need food and water .

Fox makes the characters very believable , and has given them a fictional voice that rings true -- probably due to fanatical research , which included writing to every Saker in the phone directories of Gauteng and the Eastern Cape . <p> " There are 10 years of research in the book , " says Fox . " I found quite a lot of contemporary writing , such as a monthly column in the SA Motorist from a driver mechanic who was with HD Saker , chasing De Wet . He was very colourful . Harm Oost 's book , Wie is die Skuldiges ? , was rich in detail and personal information . Oost added a lot of detail to the events from the rebels ' side and revealed quite a lot about how they suffered for their convictions . <p> Hider Saker was a much more opaque character with little available information about him , but there was enough to construct his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them particularly military but thrust into a bitter civil war . " <p> If there is one criticism of the book for a modern-day South African audience , it is that the main characters are all white . <p> When asked about this , Fox says : " This was very much an internecine conflict based on political and international issues that only affected the white population . In all my research , the only black participants I came across were a farm worker who guided De Wet to a crossing over the Vaal River and another who reported Oost 's whereabouts to the government forces . The rebels , the permanent forces such as the Cape Mounted Rifles and the Active Citizen Force were all composed only of whites .

@@3276235 nationals that recently swept across South Africa once again highlights core questions of identity , nation and what it means to be African . I have followed the news and read several commentaries . Achille Mbembe and Trevor Ncube have been among the brave non-South African voices that made a contribution based on their experiences of the different manifestations of xenophobia -- or Afrophobia , as they would like to call it . <p> These and others have been very helpful to those of us tracking issues from afar , but I feel that there is still something that is not being discussed . The dominant arguments on the matter do n't challenge us to collectively face this problem . They they do not necessarily hear the concerns of other . <p> I think the South African brothers and sisters who took to the streets and engaged in violence against foreign nationals have some form of grievance . There is a need for a genuine audience to listen and take up their issues . <p> My starting point is that the acts of violence are committed in the name of jobs and economic wellbeing . Foreign nationals are seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of South Africans . We need to look at patterns of production and accumulation and see how foreign nationals have historically contributed to the South Africa economy -- if they did . <p> Historically , South Africa has benefited from migrant labour , especially on the farms and mines . Labour-recruiting stations for South African mines were established across the sub-region . Migrant labour was mostly underpaid ; it was not accorded the rights and privileges that the unions demand today . <p> The official process of recruiting foreign nationals to serve the needs of mines and farms may no longer exist , but it continues by informal means and continues to serve the goal of capital -- profit maximisation . Today we have the massive exploitation of labour , with disastrous consequences , as seen at Marikana . <p> Any attempt to look at acts of violence against foreign nationals living in townships as separate from struggles for better pay and better jobs is misguided . There is a close relationship , but there is a gap in articulation , mostly because of the way the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital accumulation that should be under scrutiny . <p> Why do businesses prefer to employ foreigners ? Not because they work better -- that is just patronising . It 's because they are not unionised , and can easily be underpaid because they have no recourse . <p> When South Africa attained freedom in 1994 , expectations were high that with the end of colonisation and apartheid the sub-region was now ready for integration . Indeed , by then , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) had become a model of integration for other sub-regions , such as the East African and the West African blocs . Instead , efforts towards economic integration in Southern Africa slowed down . <p> South Africa has played a major role in the sub-region , but its focus has mostly been on ensuring stability by facilitating dialogues , quelling coups and peacekeeping . Pretoria 's budget for diplomacy across sub-Saharan Africa is probably the biggest of any country on the continent . But South Africa has not focused on social and regional integration , which was originally the hope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure stability to allow business to operate with no disruptions . <p> South Africa is a sub-imperial force and an important intermediary for international capital . It has long worked by that logic , ensuring that the sub-region has peace and stability , intervening where its economic interests are under threat , as in Lesotho . It has not taken advantage of its advanced economy to pursue a model of regional integration that would ensure wider , equitable growth . Instead , working closely with the representatives of capital , it has pursued and defended its own economic interests . <p> One of Jacob Zuma 's first trips into Africa as president of South Africa was to Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo . It is telling that he was accompanied by businessmen with interests in mining and agriculture . Since the late 1990s , South Africa has financed shopping malls housing mostly South African retail shops and supermarkets , which have become a permanent landmark not only in Southern Africa but all the way to Accra , Ghana . <p> In the extractive sector , mining houses owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , extracting primary commodities but with limited reinvestment in downstream and sidestream value chains . In some cases , companies use mostly South African labour on six-week rotations . In brief , South African companies have pursued a model of foreign direct investment in the rest of Africa , without reforming the model or attending to the concerns of their fellow Africans . <p> Many African countries are currently experiencing very limited prospects of growth in national savings . This is because , despite widespread GDP growth , the share resources going to locals is insignificant , thanks to investors like South African companies who are quick to repatriate their profits . <p> Ncube laments the fact that South Africa did not play a decisive role in constraining Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe . I see it another way : that was probably never South Africa 's objective . Instead , they had huge economic interests to protect . One of the immediate outcomes of the South African-negotiated Government of National Unity was the awarding of a contract to resurface Zimbabwe 's major highway from Plumtree to Mutare via Bulawayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tender , on a build , operate and transfer basis , to South Africans -- despite the fact that there had been a consortium of local businesses asking government for a similar deal . <p> I am sure there are many other cases across the continent . I would like to submit to South Africa 's president that the answer to his question is that these are chickens merely coming back home to roost . If the economies near South Africa 's are not growing , labour will continue to flock to Egoli . <p> To be fair , South Africa is not entirely responsible for the mess we are in . The governance records of many African countries leave a lot to be desired . But that does not affect my main argument about the role of South Africa on the continent and in particular Southern Africa . I have said that South Africa is a sub-imperial power , meaning that it does not have the capacity of an imperial power like the United States , for instance , but is in a position to act as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Brics group not just because it is an economic powerhouse but because it has the capacity , to quote South African Airways , to " take Africa to the world and the world to Africa " . It provides an excellent launching pad for many would-be investors into Africa , taking advantage of South Africa 's influential position in both SADC and also at the African Union to ensure a conducive business environment . South Africa has chosen to subordinate itself to the dictates of international capital and to preserve the status quo beyond its borders on behalf of business , rather than being the champion of the developing region . <p> So what is to be done ? The first imperative is to create jobs -- honestly , this is a no-brainer . The doomsday prophecies of the collapse of the rand will always be there , but without the ANC taking a lead on being a developmental state it can only work on the margins , tinkering with welfare reforms , which in themselves may inhibit economic growth . Beyond that , I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Currently the SADC is engaged in an attempt to roll out an industrialisation strategy . Although it has not yet been expressed officially , everyone knows that its success or failure will rest with South Africa . Is South Africa interested in a programme to assist member countries to industrialise , which may reduce their dependence on goods imported from South Africa ? We will see . <p> The creation and roll-out of an industrialisation strategy that benefits from agriculture and mining could create millions of job across the sub-region , lessening the lure of crossing the Limpopo in search of greener pastures . South Africa 's goal should be to help African countries grow their productive capacities -- in other words , create incentives for people to stay in their countries . <p> Xenphobic violence ca n't be treated as an isolated event or as South Africa 's unique problem . It is systemic and regional in nature ; those calling for a conference or summit on issue are absolutely right . South Africa 's current diplomatic efforts ( sending ministers to different African capitals ) is commendable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coherent South African and regional strategy , this is like patching together a badly damaged road -- just wait for the next rains and see what happens . <p> Next time , it may not just be the seven lives we have counted in this round . <p> Tendai Murisa is the executive director of AfricaTrust , a foundation for democratic governance and development on the continent .

Ask for hand sanitiser , disinfecting wipes , paper towels , soap and facial tissues -- and use them often . - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze , and encourage sick colleagues to the same . If you do n't have a tissue handy , cough or sneeze into the inner part of your sleeve at the elbow . - Keep anti-viral tissues on hand ( e.g. from Kleenex ) .

@@3282235 <h> Mathe Group receives Recognition Award from REDISA <p> 18 May 2015 17:12Awards <p> The Mathe Group received a Recognition Award from the Recycling and Economic Development Initiative of South Africa ( REDISA ) on Friday , 15 May 2015 to mark its contribution towards recycling used tyres that are becoming a major environmental hazard in South Africa . <p> Dr Mehran Zarrebini , head of British investment group PFE International - which is part of a joint venture with the Mathe Group - and also owns Van Dyck Carpets , received the reward in Johannesburg . He said that this was a completely unexpected and much valued acknowledgement of all the work that the Mathe Group and its dedicated employees had done to establish a sustainable business . <p> This is the first time that the awards have been presented by REDISA . REDISA was created in 2012 as an independent body to oversee and facilitate the recycling of the more than 60 million used tyres that have built up in South Africa over the years . <p> It supports and promotes tyre recycling , providing the collection and depot infrastructure required to collect waste tyres from across the entire country and deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste management fee on new rubber charged to manufacturers and importers . <p> Zarrebini said that the Mathe Group had been working with REDISA since September 2014 . <p> " REDISA has enabled us to focus on our core strength which is the manufacturing of rubber crumb . Prior to being registered with the organization , we had to source and collect tyres from various locations in KwaZulu-Natal . This was very costly and we were unable to secure a steady raw material supply . Since we started working with REDISA , this problem has been eliminated and we can concentrate on manufacturing as well as on developing new and existing customers , " he said . <p> The award , he added , would be proudly displayed in the new premises that the group plans to open in Hammarsdale in KwaZulu-Natal in July . <p> A multi-million rand investment by the joint venture partners has seen the construction of a completely new automated 2500 sq/m factory and a 1000 sq/m warehouse . It will be fitted out with R20-million worth of state-of-the-art equipment which is due to arrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was formed by Vusumuzi Mathe in 2010 , currently operates from a small factory in New Germany . It began manufacturing small quantities of rubber granulate from used truck tyres in late 2011 . Once it had secured a permit to manufacture at full capacity in 2013 , it began ramping up production . <p> In 2014 , a joint venture was formed between Mathe Group and PFE International Inc . <p> The Mathe Group had supplied Van Dyck Carpets with rubber crumb since 2012 for the manufacture of acoustic underlays which are used under floor coverings to minimise noise between different levels in apartment and office blocks . <p> " There was synergy from the start since Van Dyck was trying to source rubber crumb locally instead of either importing it or buying it from other provinces . This has really been a win-win situation for both organizations since the Mathe Group was looking at increasing its sales of rubber crumb and Van Dyck Carpets wanted to cement a relationship for its rapidly developing secondary industry , " Zarrebini explained . <p> Secondary processing has been a priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on developing unique and differentiated products for the flooring industry globally . " We have placed a strong emphasis on manufacturing product utilizing recycled content . We also realise that there is an increased preference from consumers to source products that are manufactured sustainably , " he explained . <p> Although there has been a steady increase in the production of rubber crumb since the first quarter of 2014 , a substantial increase in capacity is expected towards the end of this year as the new plant comes on stream . An increase in the secondary processing side of the business at Van Dyck Carpets will correspond with this . <p> Zarrebini said the growth of the Mathe Group was a true success story . When the joint venture was formed last year , the company employed 12 people . This has since more than doubled to 29 as the small , original operation is now operating seven days a week for 24 hours at full capacity . <p> He pointed out that , as recycling of waste tyres for use in secondary products was relatively new in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When we relocate to the new premises , we will be able to leverage from the very active skills and development programs taking place in Mathe Group 's sister companies . Both PFE Extrusion and Van Dyck Carpets are active in the development of their employees in areas of adult education training , supervisory skills development and so forth . The idea is to incorporate Mathe Group into the overall group to create uniformity with regard to training across all the subsidiaries , " he concluded .

@@3285233 <h> Zuma , ANC bigwigs linked to arms graft <p> INDEPENDENT MEDIAA top cop involved in investigating the controversial R70 billion arms deal of 1999 has maintained ANC and government officials including President Jacob Zuma most likely received bribes to influence the awarding of multimillion rand arms contracts . File Photo : Jeffrey Abrahams <p> Pretoria - A top cop involved in investigating the controversial R70 billion arms deal of 1999 has maintained ANC and government officials -- including President Jacob Zuma -- most likely received bribes to influence the awarding of multimillion-rand arms contracts . <p> Colonel Johan du Plooy , the former Scorpions investigator whose investigations led to the conviction of Zuma 's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik for corruption , on Monday directly linked the president to arms deal corruption based on his investigation into Shaik and documentation discovered during other arms deal-related probes . <p> Du Plooy appeared before the arms deal commission , where he insisted -- despite rigorous cross-examination by evidence leader Simmy Lebala SC and often hostile questioning by commission chairman Willie Seriti -- that there was a possibility that the president had influenced some ministers in the inter-ministerial committee chaired by former president Thabo Mbeki . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly received by other ministers were enough to raise red flags about his role and those of other bigwigs like the late former cabinet ministers Joe Modise and Stella Sigcau during the arms deal process , he said . <p> Du Plooy admitted there was no clear evidence which indicated there was direct influence at the level of the inter-ministerial committee , but said close relationships , such as that between Shaik 's brother Chippy and consultant Fana Hlongwane and ministers , made it possible to influence decisions at the highest level . <p> Chippy was the SANDF chief of acquisitions at the time of the arms deal . Hlongwane was Modise 's special adviser and is alleged to have received more than R150 million in " commissions " from BAE Systems . <p> Pushed on whether it was possible that Zuma influenced the inter-ministerial committee even though he was not part of the committee , Du Plooy maintained that " it is not impossible " that Zuma might have used his position in the ANC to influence the decision-making . <p> " There is no direct evidence showing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what we have is that President Zuma financially benefited by helping Schabir Shaik become a BEE partner to a company that was later awarded the contract . <p> " After a meeting with the company , the shareholding of the company changed to include Shaik , and Zuma got money from Shaik . Because of his position in the ANC at the time , it is not impossible that he could have influenced those in the committee , " said Du Plooy . <p> The court had accepted during the Shaik trial that Zuma benefited financially from the arms deal through payments from Shaik in exchange for his influence during the arms procurement process , he said . <p> He also alluded to documentation which alleged that BAE Systems , one of the arms deal successful bidders , had financially supported Sigcau 's daughter during her stay in London as one of the red flags that created suspicions around SA politicians ' role in the process . <p> " There is no direct evidence that minister Sigcau influenced the decisions of the inter-ministerial committee , but there is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidders which shows they considered her to be important to their bid being successful , and were financially supporting her daughter . <p> " While you do n't have evidence that she influenced the process , you can not ignore these red flags about her financially benefiting from the process , " said Du Plooy .

@@3285235 <h> Black graduate , your degree alone is not enough <h> We need to teach , prepare and support black graduates to take risks <p> I teach students who fall into three categories . There are those whose lives are already taken care of , regardless of how well or how badly they do at university . <p> These are students who are largely middle class and have had at least two or three generations of family financial stability . They may not be wealthy , but they have extensive social networks and that thing called " social capital " , which gives them preferential access to professional and business opportunities . <p> The second type of student will invest everything they have in university degrees because it is the primary asset to get ahead in life . These students come to university believing that if they play by the rules the system will reward them . Playing by the rules largely means studying , participating in student societies , perhaps even running for student representative council positions and doing some kind of community service . <p> These students will do these things because , as their university career guidance officer will tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruitment , they must demonstrate that they are " rounded " with a range of leadership and academic capacities . <p> These students will care very deeply about their university as an education brand ; they are as invested in their education as in the name of the university they will show possible employers . They know employers will probably judge them as much on the university they attended as on what they studied . For this student , the university brand and degree is their social capital and it is also the foundation of future professional networks . However , once they start working , they will realise just how limited their networks are and how this makes it hard to start a business . They will realise they are always a retrenchment away from downward mobility . <p> The third type of student invests in university education but does not realise that the basic education system has set them up for failure . These students will arrive at university believing they are among the top students in the country , but they will struggle academically . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poor matric marks and subject choices ( such as maths literacy ) will become hindrances in tertiary education when they find their degree options severely limited . Typically , these students will find themselves graduating with an undergraduate degree that opens very few career opportunities . <p> Now , I try to explain these observations to many of the black students I encounter . I tell them , " If you are black , the chances are you fit into category two or three . " I try to explain to them that , as things stand , our universities train them to fit into the system , to not be disruptive , to never innovate and to largely administer paperwork for the parents of the type-one students I described at the opening of this article . ( In my previous column I alluded to some of this ) . <p> Now , typically , the response I get from black students when I talk about this is a kind of scepticism or boredom . Sometimes I become more direct : " Look , black people , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you a glorified clerk for a capitalist unless you use your education to think innovatively and politically . " <p> I can not count the number of times I have had this conversation . <p> But one should not be surprised because , in many ways , black life has been a struggle to fit into the white economy , not take it over . We need to teach , prepare and support black graduates to take risks . This is what Youthlab , an independent youth organisation in Gauteng , is doing . It is a pity the ANC does not do this -- instead , every youth-support institution from Umsobomvu to the National Youth Development Agency has been corrupted.

So I understand that what the Commission is saying is that they 've got some electronic messages between different traders , for example . <p> WICHARD CILLIERS : Yes , between Interbank traders . So let 's say a trader at Investec and a trader at Barclays and a trader at JP Morgan -- they are just saying that between them they are talking electronically and giving orders or information between clients away about where orders are , what stock prices are , what volumes they are seeing in the market . <p> SIKI MGABADELI : OK . When does it become problematic , though , because when you are in the course of obviously doing this you want to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever price -- where is the thin line where collusion might take place ? <p> WICHARD CILLIERS : It 's such a difficult thing -- where collusion becomes involved . Obviously the Competition Commission feels that somewhere there 's collusion . I am not aware of anybody doing anything wrong at this stage , but obviously the Competition Commission feels there is something going on and they are looking at it . But it 's a very thin line . I 'm not sure exactly where it 's crossed , because each client deals with a bank imperviously , so they do n't want their information going across multiple banks . So I think that 's where the line is . My information I give to a certain bank is privy to that bank only , and they are not supposed to go and give that information across to other banks . <p> SIKI MGABADELI : Is there any similarity here between this particular programme and what we saw in 2001 , when the rand slumped something like 37% against the dollar ? <p> WICHARD CILLIERS : More or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in 2011 2001 . At this stage I think it 's about banks maximising profits ... and not necessarily trying to push the currency in a specific direction , weaker or stronger . So I think it 's sort of similar , but not entirely the same as happened when Deutsche led a lot of unsold money out of South Africa , depleting our reserves in 2001 . I think this is more about Interbank maximising profits and -- I listened earlier -- like David said , one or two points here more and there adds to the profit for banks . And that 's what -- they are trying to maximize profit .

But the data does not back up the claims <p> Does Zimbabwe have the highest adult literacy rate in Africa ? The country 's Financial Gazette recently reported as much , claiming that " Zimbabwe leads Africa in having an adult literacy rate of over 90% " . <p> In 2013 a blog which aims to " encourage excellence across this amazing continent " , The African Economist , released a list which also placed Zimbabwe at the top . <p> Is Zimbabwe 's literacy rate 90% ? And does it rank top in Africa ? <p> Official sources show literacy rates above 90% <p> The Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency 's labour force survey estimated that 97% of people over 15 were literate in 2011 . This figure is based on the percentage of people in this age group that had completed grade three of schooling . <p> The country 's 2011 Demographic and Health Survey estimated that 96% of men aged 15 to 54 and 94% of women aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a nationally representative household survey but it only applied to certain age groups . <p> Respondents were considered literate if they had attended secondary school ( generally aged 15 and older ) or could read a whole sentence or part of a sentence in a reading test . <p> UN , based on Zim figures , puts literacy at 83.6% <p> To see where Zimbabwe 's literacy rate ranks in Africa , we consulted the most recent global literacy list produced by the UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( Unesco ) , released in June 2013 . <p> Unesco 's Institute for Statistics estimated that 83.6% of Zimbabweans aged 15 and older were literate in 2011 . This estimation was based on Zimbabwe 's 2011 Demographic and Health Survey results . <p> A senior statistician and policy analyst at Unesco , Nicole Bella , told Africa Check that they had " made some re-estimations to include older age groups which typically have much lower literacy levels " . The organisation does n't consider people who can only read part of a sentence to be literate so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The only country in North Africa with higher adult literacy rates than Zimbabwe , on the Unesco figures , was Libya ( 89.5 ) . <p> Countries measure literacy differently <p> But using this data to rank countries should be done with caution . A specialist in education indicators at Unesco 's Institute for Statistics , Friedrich Huebler , told Africa Check that one of the problems with international comparisons is that " countries apply different definitions of what it means to be ' literate ' " . <p> For example , the Zimbabwean Demographic and Health Survey figures are based on the number of people who attended secondary school or were able to read a whole sentence or part of a sentence in a reading test and South Africa 's household survey on self-assessment in reading and written skills . In short , they are not measuring the same thing . <p> There is a further snag . The United Nations does not recommend using educational attainment as a proxy for literacy , as was done by Zimstat : " There are numerous cases where people leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a lack of practice . " <p> However Huebler told Africa Check that surveys which ask respondents to declare whether they are literate , or not , are also problematic . This method : " frequently yields higher literacy rates than even very simple assessments of literacy skills , " he said . <p> Zimbabwe 's 2011 Demographic and Health Survey used a literacy test to measure literacy but the literacy rate in South Africa and Botswana ( which Unesco estimates was 85.1% in 2012 ) was determined through self-declaration , where respondents had to say whether they were literate or not . <p> Data also dates back to different times <p> A further challenge is that there are often large gaps in the available data . Unesco does provide estimates for what they think literacy rates will be in 2015 but these estimates are based on data from different years for different countries . <p> Huebler said that many countries ' literacy rates are based on national censuses which are usually only carried out once per decade . <p> For example , Unesco 's literacy estimate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya 's estimate of 72.2% is from 2007 and Niger 's estimate of 28.7% is from 2005 . <p> Conclusion : The data does not back up the claim <p> The Financial Gazette claimed that Zimbabwe 's literacy rate was 90% and that it was the highest in Africa . This differs from the estimates of both Zimbabwe 's official statistics agency and Unesco . <p> Zimstat put the literacy rate at 97% but this figure is based on the percentage of people who have attended school up until Grade 3 . This does not necessarily prove whether a person can read or write . <p> Unesco 's estimates , based on a nationally representative survey which tested reading skills and determined educational levels , put the figure at 83.6% . <p> Comparisons of literacy rates are stymied by how literacy is defined , how people are surveyed as well as differences in the period covered by the data .

@@3294239 in central Johannesburg has power even when load-shedding brings the rest of the country , including the chamber 's own members , to its knees . <p> This is thanks to the 100 kilowatt ( kW ) platinum-based hydrogen fuel cell unit , which hums quietly in one of the outer quads of the building . <p> Fed by the Egoli Gas network , the unit powers a building that houses about 340 people , including businesses that rent space from the chamber . <p> At its peak , the office block draws 120kW , according to the head of information service at the chamber , Jeannette Hofsajer-van Wyk . <p> The whole building can not be linked up to the fuel cell system because of its age and resultant complications with its wiring . <p> But 70% of the organisation 's critical equipment is hooked up to the generator , so the chamber can stay up and running when the power goes down . <p> Steady performanceThe fuel cell unit has performed steadily , " with no hiccups " , since its installation and launch in mid-December last year , according to Hofsajer-van Wyk . <p> Proponents believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a cleaner way to provide baseload electricity but also because platinum is the catalyst in many fuel cell designs , which could increase demand for the country 's enormous platinum reserves . <p> Baseload refers to a permanent level of energy that a power plant can produce at a constant rate . Power from renewables such as wind or solar is more intermittent . <p> The chief challenges to the adoption of fuel cells are the capital costs involved and the need for gas as a fuel . <p> Besides the chamber 's unit , which is a phosphoric acid fuel cell , Anglo Platinum is using a fuel cell to power 34 homes , linked to a mini-grid , in the rural community of Naledi Trust near Kroonstad . <p> Off the gridImpala Platinum aims to use fuel cells to eventually take its platinum group metals refinery in Springs off the national grid . <p> The first phase of the project , which will be completed in 2016 , will see 1.8 megawatts ( MW ) provided by fuel cells , with the excess heat that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . The second phase will see 22MW of power supplied by fuel cells . <p> Cellphone giant Vodacom uses fuel cells to power about 200 of its 10 000 baseload stations around the country . <p> Essentially , these green generators , through an electrochemical reaction using hydrogen and oxygen , produce electricity , with water and heat as by-products . <p> Depending on the technology used , the feedstocks can vary from pure hydrogen to liquid petroleum gas , methanol and biogas . <p> Fuel cells are often associated with cars and long-standing efforts to replace the internal combustion engine with this much cleaner technology . But the mass commercialisation of hydrogen powered cars has yet to gain real market traction , given the high cost of putting fuel cells , loaded with pricey platinum , into cars , and the need to establish a substantial network to supply hydrogen gas . <p> Stationary baseload fuel cellsAnthea Bath , the chief executive of Mitochondria Energy Company , the firm that will help bring Impala 's plant online and was a partner in delivering the chamber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the country , both as a source of power and as an opportunity to establish a fuel cell manufacturing industry and value-added chain . <p> Bath said stationary baseload fuel cells in particular could play a key part in the growing market for distributed energy -- or power that does not rely on large central generation plants and extensive grids . <p> This was particularly attractive to parts of Africa where distributed energy could leapfrog power infrastructure bottlenecks . <p> Bath said the cost of running a mine in Africa on diesel ranged between R4 and R6 a kilowatt hour . Depending on the price of gas , the cost of running a fuel cell to power a mine could be in the range of R2.70/kWh to R3/kWh . <p> Fuel cells have a high upfront or capital cost , relatively low operating costs , a long life , high overall efficiency and are readily available . When the additional heat produced by fuel cells is used for co-generation , their efficiency rates can be as high as 90% , she said . <p> " When all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levellised cost , the fuel cell competes well with the grid in South Africa today for industrial and commercial customers , " Bath said . <p> Business senseMitochondria 's local projects made business sense to its clients . " We would not be pursuing technology if the economics did not work , " she said . <p> But , in South Africa 's case , there is a caveat and that is the availability of a gas network . The economics of a fuel cell changes substantially when access to a gas network is not assured and there is access to the Eskom grid . <p> " We believe that , despite our current views of Eskom , South Africa still largely has a strong grid and fuel cells may not always be the best solution , " Bath said . <p> This was particularly the case when fuel cells were used as a back-up and did not run all of the time , which made them expensive . <p> In Vodacom 's case , its fuel cells are used for backup power , at a capital cost of R60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cost , the company had also experienced problems in obtaining spares locally , with maintenance and support , and with the availability of fuel . But fuel cells were far cleaner and quieter than diesel generators , which were also prone to theft of fuel , he said . <p> Logical solutionBath said fuel cells were a logical solution for telecoms in other parts of Africa , where electricity grids were limited . She added that , with the further development of fuel cell technology , the capital costs would decline . <p> Christo Fourie , the head of the recently established new industries unit of the Industrial Development Corporation ( IDC ) , said the corporation was looking at the potential of the development of fuel cell technology , among 18 other burgeoning sectors . He said the IDC was aiming to shortlist four industries , by June 30 this year , to be prioritised for pro-active development . <p> Fuel cell technology is in a race against other candidates such as renewable energy components , technology for improved healthcare delivery and water related technology , including desalination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Policy Action Plan , has identified fuel cells as an important potential industry because it could add to the platinum value chain and promote beneficiation of the metal . <p> But , Fourie said , for the IDC to build new industries , the business case had to make commercial sense . " It has to be commercially viable , " he said . <p> According to the IDC , the capital cost of fuel cells are currently about four to five times more than a similar capacity diesel generator but , based on current knowledge , fuel cells had a longer lifespan , depending on their application and use . <p> Capital outlayAccording the IDC 's estimates , the capital outlay for fuel cells could be about R35-million to R50-million per megawatt . Fourie said fuel cells had two main constraints : the absence of low-cost manufacturers and a cheap supply of fuel . <p> According to the IDC , there is significant latent demand for power and the improvement of existing power supplies in sub-Saharan Africa .

@@3303237 <p> Road traffic enforcement may change radically in April next year when the long-awaited Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act ( Aarto ) takes effect countrywide . <p> It will also be used for the enforcement of Gauteng 's controversial e-tolls , but that is only a small part of it . <p> The most important features include the demerit points system that will see the driver 's licences of habitual transgressors suspended or revoked and it being a civil , rather than a criminal process aimed at relieving the burden on the courts . <p> Aarto has seen many false starts since its promulgation in 1998 . <p> At first it was only implemented on a pilot basis in Johannesburg and Tshwane and previous efforts to roll it out countrywide were strongly opposed by , among others , the City of Cape Town . <p> The demerit points system has not been tested and the pilot projects saw massive administrative problems with at least one court challenge ruled against the authorities and another pending . <p> Registrar of the Road Traffic Infringement Agency ( RTIA ) registrar Japh Chuwe says , howevr , that things have changed for the better . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> RTIA is the department of transport agency tasked with Aarto implementation . It took several years for it to be properly established and in the early years it was hopelessly underfunded . <p> Chuwe is confident that RTIA now has the necessary capacity to implement Aarto successfully . <p> He says the legislative amendments to be effected before countrywide implementation are at an advanced stage and will make the implementation easier and less costly . <p> Currently all Aarto documents have to be served either in person or by registered mail . Apart from being very expensive , this has been a huge issue in terms of reliability . Aarto functions within strict timelines . An infringement notice , for example , has to be responded to within 32 days to qualify for a 50% discount . If not , a courtesy letter follows with a R60 administrative fee and a further limited timeline for payment . If that is not complied with , an enforcement order follows and the eNatis account of the vehicle owner is blocked , affecting all the vehicles they own and preventing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a huge issue for fleet owners . <p> In Tshwane and Johannesburg , the service by the Post Office has been a huge issue , according to Ren ? Venter , manager of Avax SA 466 and Cornelia van Niekerk , owner of Fines4U . Both businesses administer traffic fines on behalf of corporate and private clients . Sometimes the notice is issued after the discount period has lapsed and often the notice is never delivered due to faulty addresses in the eNatis database , they say . <p> An amendment will be made to the act to provide for electronic service of documents by the Post Office and other service providers , says Chuwe . This will be a more formal process than just sending an e-mail into cyberspace , as the agency will have to get proof that delivery has indeed taken place , he says . People who do n't have access to e-mail will still get their notices through traditional methods . <p> The contact details of vehicle owners will be updated through a Fica-like process that the department of transport will embark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an infringement may result in the refusal to issue licence discs , but also in the blocking of all eNatis transactions relating to the owner of that vehicle . <p> In practice , this has had a huge impact on especially fleet owners in Johannesburg and Tshwane , according to Venter and Van Niekerk . Fleet owners usually stagger licence renewals and even vehicle replacements . The non-payment of one infringement on one vehicle -- that the owner may not even have been aware of due to defective service of documents -- can result in licence renewals , registrations and de-registrations being withheld for the whole fleet . Car dealers are especially vulnerable in this regard . <p> Chuwe says the amendment will provide for only the relevant vehicle 's eNatis transactions being blocked . It will be vehicle-based , not owner-based . <p> Warrants of execution The current act provides for warrants of execution for outstanding fines . In short , if you do n't pay outstanding traffic fines , the sheriff will come to your house , take for example your TV or couch , and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has never been tested , will be scrapped in total . The process will end with the enforcement order and eNatis block , says Chuwe . <p> Rehabilitation The amendments will further provide for rehabilitation programmes . Chuwe says the ultimate aim of Aarto is to change the behaviour of motorists to improve road safety . He says the system will automatically flag habitual offenders guilty of risky behaviour , like skipping a red light . Such drivers will have to undergo rehabilitation programmes in order to reduce their demerit points or restore their driver 's licences once they have been suspended . The agency hopes this will result in improved driver behaviour . <p> Demerit points Chuwe says the non-payment of e-tolls will not attract demerit points . <p> Drivers who approach a prescribed threshold of demerit points for other offences will be warned of the pending suspension of their driver 's licences . Once they exceed the threshold , their licences will be suspended for three months for every point above the threshold . At a certain point , the licence will be cancelled and they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply for a learner 's licence and thereafter a new driver 's licence , Chuwe says . <p> Fleet owners have been very concerned about real-time access to employees ' demerit point status . Chuwe says interested parties will have real-time access , although they need the permission of the driver to access the information . <p> Operators like vehicle rental companies will have limited access to driver information , for example a mere " yes " or " no " to indicate whether a specific client should be allowed behind the wheel . <p> Ready for roll-out ? Johannesburg Metro Police Department ( JMPD ) director Gerrie Gerneke earlier told Moneyweb that problems with Aarto , including the reconciliation of funds to be transferred between issuing authorities and RTIA , have been resolved . He believes the system is ready for the countrywide roll-out . <p> City of Cape Town member of the mayoral committee JP Smith said the city will attend a meeting with the Western Cape provincial government within the next week or two to decide whether it will support the roll-out . The decision will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in place for a successful roll-out . He says inclusion of the demerit points system and reduced reliance on the Post Office for the service of documents are in his view deal breakers . <p> President of the South African Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association ( Savrala ) Marc Corcoran says Savrala welcomes all measures aimed at improving road safety . <p> It however remains concerned about the current administrative burden on members to redirect infringement notices to foreign drivers . " We believe some of the shortcomings in Aarto have been addressed and would like an updated report on those changes , " he said . <p> Venter and Van Niekerk are less optimistic . Venter says the devil is in the detail with Aarto . She says RTIA does not stick to timelines with regard to especially the redirection of infringement notices . Redirection happens when the owner of a vehicle informs RTIA that someone else was driving the vehicle at the time of the infringement and should therefore be held liable .

There are 25 listed senior bonds with a face value of R40 billion , and these lenders are first in line to be repaid . Then there are junior ( subordinated ) bonds , with a face value of R4 billion , which most asset managers wrote down to zero when the bank was placed under curatorship . <p> The curatorship was part of a rescue package organised by the SARB . The package included the SARB taking over R17 billion in non-performing loans made by the bank to customers , for which it paid R10 billion , but the senior debt holders had to agree to take a 10-percent ( R4 billion ) knock on the value of their investments . <p> In the agreement announced this week , this 10-percent " haircut " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least part of the toxic R17 billion from defaulting Abil account holders . <p> Nazmeera Moola , an economist and strategist at Investec Asset Management , says the announcement means that , for the junior debt , major lenders and the curator have agreed in principle to a settlement of 37.5 cents in the rand . <p> But , she says , the new debt instruments that are issued to cover these loans will probably trade at a discount on the bond market . <p> The lenders will still have a claim against what is known as the Abil " bad bank " : effectively the toxic part of Abil that was left behind after the better performing parts were ring-fenced in a " good bank " to enable its continued existence . <p> However , the SARB and the senior bond holders will be first in line if the " bad bank " is left with any assets .

@@3314237 <h> How a US rate hike will affect you <p> May 30 2015 at 06:25pm By Liz Still <p> REUTERSUS Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen <p> Most of the managers of your retirement fund investments and other investments are preparing for a likely increase in United States interest rates later this year , but at least two investment experts say the expectation may be premature . <p> A number of asset managers presenting at a conference held by Boutique Collective Investments , a collective investment scheme manager whose funds are largely managed by small independent " boutique " managers , predicted that the current unusually low interest rates in the US could start rising in September or October this year . <p> The first steps of the US government towards slowing its " easy monetary policy " -- a series of measures aimed at allowing the US economy to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008 -- occurred last year , when it stopped its " quantitative easing " programme in which it bought its own bonds from the market , flooding the financial market with money . <p> An increase in interest rates will mark another step in the unwinding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US to emerging market equities and bonds , and is expected to result in investors returning to home-grown US investments . Even if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , Janet Yellen , decides to increase US interest rates by only 0.025 percentage points , it will be a significant event , because it will signal the return to a " normal " economy in the US , where savers are encouraged to save and borrowers have to pay real money to invest in businesses or homes . <p> On Friday May 22 , Yellen announced that an interest rate hike " would be appropriate this year if the economy improves " . However , she has noted that the decision will depend on a continued improvement in labour market conditions and confidence that inflation would increase to two percent in the medium term . <p> The prospect of a US interest rate hike has made both global bond and equity markets more jittery , as it is possible that a hike will suck money from emerging markets . Many South African fund managers are positioning their portfolios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio would have a relatively high exposure to cash , and would hold equities that offer value but are less likely to be sold off quickly . <p> But some fund managers at the BCI conference highlighted features of the US economy that show that , despite the gloss , there are causes for concern , and that it has not improved to the point that an interest rate hike is imminent . <p> In a panel discussion on the outlook for global equities , Clyde Rossouw , a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management , said it was important to understand that much of the recent growth in the US economy since 2006 had been created by just 12 of the 50 US states . <p> He says that , collectively , the " shale states " -- Texas , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Louisiana , Pennsylvania , Wyoming , New Mexico , Colorado , Arkansas , Utah , Kansas and West Virginia -- have created 20 percent of the six-percent cumulative growth in US gross domestic product ( GDP ) since 2006 ; that 2.2 million jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states ; wages have grown 4.3 percent in the shale states compared with a decline of 1.2 percent for non-shale states ; electricity production has grown 5.8 percent in the shale states versus a decline of 2.6 percent in the non-shale states ; and housing has increased 11.6 percent versus a decline in the non-shale states of 6.2 percent . <p> Rossouw says that sharply lower oil prices in the past year have caused oil and gas companies to cut back on drilling and exploration . Few new wells are being dug , and the number of rigs in operation has dropped . He says that because so many of the positive signals for economic growth have been due to the impact of the shale industry , it is vital to fully understand the wider impact of the collapse of this industry . <p> Kevin Lings , chief economist at Stanlib , has also sounded a cautionary note on a glib reading of US employment statistics . In an article published in Standpoint , Stanlib 's investment magazine , Lings draws attention to the fact that , despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2009 to 5.5 percent in February 2015 , a breakdown of the gain in employment by age reveals some interesting trends . <p> He writes that , since the start of the US economic recovery in 2010 , the US has employed more people in the age bracket 65 years and older ( just over two million ) compared with people aged 30 to 54 ( 1.6 million ) . " In fact " , he writes , " more people aged 70 or older have gained jobs since March 2010 than people aged 35 to 44 . " <p> He says that this trend in the age composition of employment is partly due to demographics and the ageing of the US population . However , the change over the past four years has been so dramatic that demographics alone ca n't fully explain the trend . <p> A consequence of older people being employed is that they are less likely to spend on consumer items , such as cars , furniture and basic appliances . Older people are also more likely to accept more modest salaries . Lings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US economy , despite its low employment levels . <p> This week it was announced that the US 's GDP had expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of only 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 over the previous quarter . This figure is cause for concern and , like the questions raised by Rossouw and Lings , raises questions about the depth of the US recovery .

" Pandora Blake shrugs and eats a mouthful of scrambled egg . We 're having breakfast in a small caf ? off Tottenham Court Road . <p> Blake , a feminist porn producer and performer , has just finished describing a porn film she came across online that was tagged " brutal ass-banging " . From the looks our fellow diners have been giving us , it seems clear that not everyone is as relaxed as she is . <p> Porn is this year 's hot topic . Over the past six months , we 've been treated to debates , articles , documentaries , books - and now a play at the National Theatre .

She Said . Revolt Again , part of the RSC 's Midsummer Mischief season , We Want You to Watch is a harrowing , yet bitingly funny investigation into the effect that internet porn is having on society . <p> The play is set up as an interrogation - literally : the set foregrounds an interview room against a backdrop of a blown-up image <p> of a woman 's face , her eyes grotesquely obscured by open mouths . Cans of " tinned sex " sit in neat rows . We click the identikit porn-spam off the shelf and this two-dimensional woman who sees nothing but must take everything screams - but in pleasure or pain ? <p> The actors are mid-scene as I arrive at the Short Street rehearsal rooms .

The woman on the table is brashly ordering them to dance . To the right is director Caroline Steinbeis , holding a clipboard . A lone man sprawls on the floor . <p> RashDash are renowned for performances that incorporate movement and music . " I think we 'll always choose a subject matter that feels like it needs to be articulated physically , " says Abbi Greenland , who along with Helen Goalen founded RashDash , but in this show , the need was particularly acute . " There 's a bit in the show where we say what it feels like to watch extreme porn and then there 's a movement sequence . Because it feels like that 's a much more articulate way of saying what it feels like than words . " <p> At the heart of the play are two women who struggle to express what they want and what they hate . They repeat themselves and each other . They interrupt , they desert thoughts half-expressed , sentences trailing off , or exploding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're talking about sex , " explains Greenland , " so we 're talking about something that is articulated by bodies and not by words most of the time . " <p> I 'm reminded of Greenland 's words the next day , as I struggle to put into words what I mean by " extreme porn " . Blake pulls me up , pointing out that the BDSM porn she produces , despite its depictions of " negotiation and after-care and affection and tenderness and real relationships " , could arguably be considered extreme and is in fact illegal . This is how we get on to the brutal ass-banging . " Most people would see that and think it 's misogynistic , it 's violent , " she says . <p> " But if you actually watch it , the performers are having a great time - they 're clearly mates , if not lovers . The guy behind the camera is their mate . Everyone is giggling back and forth , and when at one point she starts squirting all over the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like ' please f**k me in the arse now ' . " <p> Blake is right . This is not what I would expect from something positioned as a " brutal ass-banging " . But why then , have those words <p> been chosen ? It may be further evidence that porn is a form of bodily articulation , and that therefore words will always fall short . But there is another possibility : perhaps the grammar of porn renders it incapable of conveying or even conceiving of intimacy . Perhaps intimacy within porn simply does n't make sense , because porn is sex with the humanity excised . <p> RashDash are keen to emphasise that the show is not anti-sex . Rather , " the strong stance on porn is all about making sex better , making our imaginations better " , says Greenland . " Sex is n't misogynistic , " she points out . " So either the form 's wrong or we just have n't found a way of making feminist porn . " <p> The show 's radical solution to this impasse is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tiny percentage " of the porn that 's currently out there that is not overtly misogynistic , explains Goalen , but the play wants us to ask ourselves if it might not " be better just to wipe it all away and see what else we could imagine .

" I want to create a porn industry that 's more varied , more dynamic , that has more healthy depictions of real-world sex and more depictions of intimacy . I want to create a porn that is queerer and has more body diversity . But I do n't want to do that by banning the stuff that 's already there . Or by telling people they should n't make it " . <p> The judgement over what we consider to be an " acceptable " manifestation of desire is necessarily subjective . One man 's harmless <p> turn-on is another woman 's degrading subjection . For this reason , RashDash do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start censoring some things and not others , it 's really tricky , " says Greenland . " Somebody gets to police desire - I would worry about who got to be in charge of that decision . " <p> Currently , the Authority for Television on Demand ( ATVOD ) is in charge of that decision . Myles Jackman , a leading obscenity lawyer , tells me that feminist porn has been hit disproportionately in comparison to " mainstream male fantasy " by ATVOD 's enforcement of the legislation . <p> Jackman recently defended Itziar Bilbao Urrutia , who produces female dominatrix porn for the website she runs called the Urban Chick Supremacy Cell ( UC-SC ) . Jackman successfully argued that UC-SC , " partly a feminist treatise , partly an art school project , and partly pornography " , was not " TV-like " and therefore did not have to comply .

So for Blake , the answer to the problem is clear : " Buy feminist porn . Production is controlled by market forces : if people are n't buying it , people wo n't be able to make it . " Flood the market with feminism ; drown out the sexism , she theorises . <p> RashDash are unconvinced by this argument . When they were researching the show , they made a deliberate effort to search out feminist porn . <p> " It 's easy to find porn that feels violent and damaging and degrading " , says Goalen , " but we wanted to find things we did n't feel <p> like that about , because this is n't a simple issue where feminists hate porn and other people do n't .

He was instructed to return to the hospital , obtain an original copy of the death certificate and present it to the Building Bargaining Council the next morning . <p> The council immediately sprang into action and the system kicked in . As the contractor was registered and up to date with his payments , the following happened : a coffin was paid for , the body was collected and within two days returned to the Eastern Cape in the company of eight additional family members , all paid for by the council . I doubt very much if a non-registered contractor would have gone to this trouble . So please ensure your contractor is registered and compliant . <p> Last week 's column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry over the next few weeks has invoked a plethora of comment . The following comes from a consultant I have recommended to quite a lot of you over the past few years .

A big problem with the inspectors from the authorities and the councils is that they are not knowledgeable enough or they are incompetent and totally inefficient -- they unfortunately have the mentality and attitude of all civil servants , where hard work and dedication are not in their vocabulary .

I 've had three lots of plumbers here and shown them the photographs of the plumbing system during construction , but nobody has been able to solve the problem . I 'm at my wits end . Please can you recommend a fundi ? " <p> Brenda , this is one of those where I am damned if I do and damned if I do n't . To be honest , I have over the years walked away from many alteration contracts where bathrooms are to be added into roof voids .

It is relatively easy to pour a concrete slab on top of the existing structure , giving you a sound base to work from . Your architect will then specify the correct materials to use to ensure that the new bathroom is constructed from the correct materials and waterproofing components . <p> I hate to say this , as I am sure that you have spent a fair amount of money on your renovations , but if the basics are not correct there is no fundi in the world who is going to sort out the problem .

@@3348236 <h> Massive e-toll tender collusion in question <p> Outa has questioned why the government has failed to address a ' massive tender collusion ' and price fixing scandal which inflated the costs of the freeway upgrade by billions of rands . <p> This ' crucial issue ' was highlighted by the e-toll review panel earlier this year , the Civil action group said . <p> On Wednesday ( 10 June ) , deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said that thousands of motorists had called to ask if they can benefit from the new e-tolls dispensation and the discounts it offers . <p> Ramaphosa was answering oral questions in the National Assembly . <p> The deputy president announced the new dispensation for the implementation of the e-toll system in May after the initial system launched in December 2013 , was largely rejected by the public . <p> The new dispensation would see the current fee of 58 cents per kilometre , reduced to 30 cents per kilometre for people using e-roads , while the monthly cap for e-toll road users has been adjusted to R225 , from R450 previously . <p> Motorists will have to pay their outstanding e-tolls upon renewal of vehicle licences , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with road users given 6 months to pay these off , the deputy president said in May . <p> Outa dismissed Ramaphosa 's answers in the National Assembly as sheer propaganda . <p> It noted that the vast majority of the submissions to the e-toll panel , set up last year to assess the economic impact of the toll system , rejected the scheme and supported either direct transfers from the fiscus or a fuel levy . <p> Ramaphosa said the e-tolls dispensation safeguards the interest of the fiscus to build and maintain roads . The new e-tolls dispensation aims to be fair , affordable and sustainable which draws from the GP advisory panel , he said . <p> He said that a fuel levy was considered over e-tolls , " but it would be impossible to exempt buses and taxis and would affect the poor " . <p> Outa said that input provided during the e-toll panel engagement session in February , saw a further reiteration of the delegates rejection of the hybrid-funding model by an overwhelming majority of the people and associations who attended , including ANC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-toll review panel highlighted , was the massive tender collusion and price fixing scandal which inflated the costs of the freeway upgrade by billions of rands , and which has yet to be addressed by the authorities , " said Wayne Duvenage , Outa 's chairperson . <p> " Yet government 's reluctance to take a principled and ' unpopular ' position on this matter appears to be missing . " <p> " Outa 's research has estimated that the Gauteng Freeway upgrade has cost society an estimated R7 billion ( 65% ) more than it should have , and while the deputy president admitted that Sanral was R20 billion in the red , why was nothing said about any plans and measures needed to recover the GFIP construction overcharging ? " Duvenage said . <p> Outa highlighted a concern that in February 2012 , Treasury contributed R5.7 billion toward the GFIP project , which lowered the tariff from 40 cents to 30 cents . The bonds raised from GFIP were R20 billion before this injection , leading to a question of why government still reflects these bonds at R20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear there is a lack of clarity around the accounting between traditional national roads , toll concession roads and GFIP business units , " Duvenage said . <p> &lt; Even if you follow a fitness routine and you often choose healthier foods , you may not be <p> seeing the weight come off the way you hope .

One of the facts this arrogant government is not stating is that the poor are already affected ( negatively ) by etolls through raised food costs that major food retailers are charging to recover the costs of etolls . And YES , this undemocratic government is not accounting for the price fixing scandal which inflated the costs of the freeway upgrade by billions of rands . And then they expect us to buy-in in this fraud -- frankly these etolls are a BIG fraud ... just another arms deal type fraud .

@@3348239 economies had been growing at an average of 5% a year all through this century , there were no grounds yet for over-enthusiasm , Carlos Lopes , the Executive Secretary of the United Nations 's Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) said here on Thursday . <p> This growth " has not translated into decent jobs and the elimination of large pockets of poverty and pervasive inequality , " he told the African Union 's executive council at the organisation 's summit in Johannesburg . <p> Lopes noted that Africa had weathered the global finance crisis of 2008/2009 better than most and so " the narrative shifted from that of a ' hopeless continent ' to that of ' Africa rising ' . " <p> This was the background against which the AU had celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013 and adopted its Agenda 2063 as a long-term vision for continental development . <p> Agenda 2063 was an improvement on past African development plans because it had arisen from wide-ranging consultations with all sectors of society . However , even extensive consultations did not by themselves lead to high quality plans or even implementation . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions once again if we do not construct a reality that matches the aspirations of the continent , particularly its too much neglected youth and women , " Lopes warned . <p> He said that Africa 's leaders should themselves firmly drive the continent 's destiny to ensure Agenda 2063 became a reality , unlike past plans such as the Lagos Plan of Action and the Arusha Treaty and Nepad ( the New Partnership for Africa 's Development ) which were visions not accompanied by continental frameworks but implemented instead at the national level . <p> These plans were sometimes not given the opportunity to succeed because of competing and more powerful external forces which had imposed a different pathway for Africa 's development . <p> These outside plans saw the African state as being the root of the problem and tried to roll back the states . Lopes said that since the global economic crisis the world had realised that the state and the market had to work together for development to succeed . <p> He said the most important component of Agenda 2063 was its clear commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to industrialise for sustained growth , generating jobs and the extracting maximum value addition from its natural resources . <p> It also required proper infrastructure that crossed national borders and connected whole regions , to underpin Agenda 2063 . Lopes said the reality of Africa was still 54 countries and eight recognised regional economic organisations , so it was important to synchronize these . <p> Fifty years was also a long time and much could change in that time so it was wise for the AU to have broken up Agenda 2063 into ten-year development plans and to reinforce the process through a monitoring tool such as a set of African development goals . <p> AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma said that the ten-year plan would be adopted at this summit and would set the AU on the path to implementation of Agenda 2063 . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

" <p> Elsewhere , commuters were forced to step off taxis as they found their routes blocked by the protesting drivers . <p> Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said that they had been called out to Main Road after there were reports that a few taxis were blocking the street . <p> When police officers arrived , they found around 50 vehicles blocking off the flow of traffic at the circle near the Golden Crust bakery . <p> He confirmed that gunshots had been fired but there had been no reports of deaths or injuries at the time of going to print . <p> Police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several drivers and eventually took in two men for questioning . A firearm was confiscated and police were set to conduct an investigation into whether it was fired during Thursday 's chaos . <p> According to the Delft-Cape Town Taxi Association , the protesting drivers were rivals belonging to the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association who have clashed frequently over the right to operate along the Delft-Cape Town route . <p> Speaking to the Cape Argus at the taxi rank , one of the Delft association 's executive members -- who did not want to be named , fearing that he would be " added to the hit list " -- said the organisation had received numerous death threats since last week . <p> " So this morning we stopped all of our drivers from going out , I did n't want any blood on my hands .

@@3372231 <h> #TheFutureByDesign : Social media shopping and the rise of the ' buy button ' <p> a #TheFutureByDesign feature by Kai Botha . E-commerce is a US$220-billion industry , with growth of almost 20% per year . As more people access the internet on mobile devices , the trend is towards making mobile purchases -- so-called ' m-commerce ' . For marketers to reach these customers , there is a channel that is wide open for development : social media . <p> It 's been a long time coming . Two of the world 's social media giants , Facebook and Twitter , began rolling out beta versions of a ' buy button ' in late 2014 , laying the foundations for greater e-commerce and social media integration in 2015 . <p> Facebook and Twitter are banking on convenience , impulse buying , once-off promotions on fleeting trends and limited products . And why not ? People post ill-advised and impulsive content all the time on social media -- what 's to say they would n't make ill-advised or impulsive purchases just as easily ? <p> The concept is simple : manipulate people into buying things quickly and with ease from the comfort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and email address , and then are able to buy any offers that pop up on their feed with just one or two clicks , without ever having to leave the page . Once the purchase is entered and confirmed , the information is sent to a merchant for delivery . <p> According to Lou Kerner , a social media analyst and investor at The Social Internet Fund , it 's a great strategy , especially for the likes of Twitter , because it does n't force people to change the way they use the platform . " Twitter is about what 's happening right now , and so as long as e-commerce follows that approach , using sales with a short lifespan or that offer a limited number of items , it should work extremely well , " says Kerner in an article featured on Internet Retailer . <p> What this all entails is that the ritual of buying becomes simplified and convenient . Time and convenience is everything to the millennial consumer . Imagine sitting at a bar with a group of friends , having a chat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home appliances or whatever you want , shuffle past you ( complete with price tags ) in between your conversations . Social Media shopping is a lot like that -- the convenience of interacting with your social community and shopping at the same time . <p> The hope is that e-commerce becomes a significant revenue driver , but it 's not all too clear yet where the revenue will come from . For example , Twitter will be exploring and testing several different revenue models in the beta phase . <p> Benefit for merchants <p> The ' buy button ' acts as a clear call to action , with pressure to act quickly on fleeting offers on a platform that has as an already captive and receptive audience . Thus , the ' buy button ' makes redundant a problem that all retailers face : how to get consumers into the store . <p> Benefits for advertisers <p> A ' buy button ' is also great news for marketers and advertisers , in that it could ( and should ) be able to display concrete revenue figures in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct correlation between ROI and social media ad spend . <p> Benefits for consumers <p> Besides the obvious convenience , will consumers buy in to the ' buy button ' ? There 's no simple answer to this . Firstly , there 's the security factor . Is your personal data safe ; or will Facebook 's or Twitter 's data archives be the victim of the next big data leak ? 2014 saw a spike in data security paranoia and has taken centre stage with consumers . <p> From mass data leaks at Target to the notorious hacking of Sony ; social media data security has become paramount . In a blog post announcing the new ' buy button ' test , Facebook declared that none of the credit card information people share with Facebook will be shared with other advertisers and that people can decide whether or not they 'd like to save payment information for future purchases . <p> Similarly , Twitter declared its intentions to keep consumers ' card information secure , private and safely stored . Secondly , there 's the price bracket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is to make a R3,000 purchase on a social media platform . So yes , consumers may buy into the ' buy button ' but perhaps only within a certain price bracket . <p> Peer influence will presumably play an important role in whether the ' buy button ' is widely adopted . The social media mob is fickle , easily influenced and susceptible to trends ; and so the ability to share a buy button post with followers and friends in real time would potentially validate its use . If a friend recommends or shares a ' buy button ' post on your timeline , you may be more likely to make a purchase based on your peer 's opinion . <p> Other social media platforms <p> Twitter and Facebook may be leading the trend of greater Social Media ecommerce integration , but they 're not the only ones . In 2014 , Pinterest announced a ' Gifts Feed ' , which uses Product Pins to show purchase details like pricing , availability , buy links and store location on the pin itself . Although this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it still marks a step toward greater Social Media Shopping integration . <p> Although Instagram does not yet boast a click-to-buy feature on its platform , it has enormous potential and opportunity for buying power given the rise of m-commerce . According to a study conducted by L2 Think Tank , Instagram has amassed more than 150 million followers in three years -- half the time it took Twitter . It has 15 times more engagement than its parent company , Facebook . It now has 300 million active monthly users , up 100-million from March 2014 . It has also begun the process of handing out verified accounts . These verified badges will be for public figures and brands . The badges ' will make it easier for people to identify and follow the authentic brands they care about , ' says Instagram in a public email . <p> A visual-based platform , with fast growing traction , coupled with a direct messaging feature , makes Instagram an obvious choice for consumer brands and advertisers , with 93% of prestige brands maintaining a presence on the platform ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy button ' has the potential to significantly alter e/m-commerce and social media integration , disrupting the traditional lines of path to purchase as well as significantly altering social networks ' roles in the interaction between consumers and businesses . Marketing as we know it , as well as the ritual of buying , may be changed forever . <p> Kai Botha used to be an ad man , but is now an aspiring writer and full-time social media analyst by day ( for Ornico ) .

@@3372232 <h> Varsity heads lost in transformation <p> INDEPENDENT MEDIAProfessor Jonathan Jansen , vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State File picture : Willem Law <p> The vice-chancellors of the universities of Cape Town , the Free State and Wits seem to have lost the plot , writes Lesiba Seshoka . <p> Johannesburg - There are of course numerous reasons why the current crop of university vice-chancellors should not be allowed to sit for the " tough " transformation examination . Some of them have simply failed the most basic arithmetic and the reasoning of others defies logic . <p> Take Jonathan Jansen , the outspoken vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State . A couple of weeks ago , I had the privilege of listening to him speak at the Marketing , Advancement , Communication in Education seminar at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University . <p> Like all his colleagues , he argued that transformation was necessary but could not happen overnight . <p> For a professor of Jansen 's standing not to understand that the period between 1994 and now can not be tantamount to " overnight " boggles the mind and defies logic . <p> His reasoning is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation was not an event but a process , and that it could not happen overnight . <p> If one were to approach him on this , Jansen would of course argue that he did not mean it in the literal sense but some figure of speech called a metaphor . <p> But what metaphor is this that seeks to equalise 21 years with " overnight " that is the dictionary equivalent of " sudden " , " rapid " or " instant " ? <p> A lazy carpenter is said to often blame his tools . <p> When Jansen passed the buck to the schooling system for being too mediocre to allow him to produce black professors , I nearly fell off my chair from shock just from the realisation he may as well be a lazy carpenter unable to make good with what he has . <p> As Nelson Mandela put it , " it is what we make out of what we have , not what we are given , that separates one person from another . " <p> He went on to pass the buck on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , arguing that if he were the basic education minister , he would fire all its members and rehire them . <p> What an ignorant professor who does not seem to be living in South Africa and who appears not to be cognisant of the complexities of his country 's labour relations regime ? <p> But is charity not supposed to begin at home ? Jansen is unable to deal decisively with racists at his own institution that humiliate black people on a daily basis but believes he can deal with at least 300 000 black teachers who , in his thinking , are lazy and incompetent . <p> Should n't he be the first to go for failing to deal with racism as well as to transform his own institution ? <p> The more Jansen spoke and I listened to him , the more I was convinced he was a white man trapped in a black skin . As with many other vice-chancellors , he perceives himself as a voice of reason , of course with faulty logic . <p> It is a logic that sees no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a logic that sees everything wrong with a student 's admiration of Adolf Hitler and nothing wrong with practising Hendrik Verwoerd 's apartheid-style policies in higher education . <p> It is a logic that he thinks can deal with a 300 000-strong flock but unable to deal with a handful of rotten racist potatoes on his farm . <p> This was almost the same shocking reasoning advanced by University of Cape Town vice-chancellor Max Price that it takes at least 20 years to produce a professor . <p> Does it really take 20 years to produce a professor ? If so , how many black professors have the universities produced in the past 21 years of the new dispensation ? <p> This comes from a man who when confronted with human excrement splashed over the Rhodes statue lost his wits and eventually succumbed to pressure to remove the statue . <p> Like the biblical king of Babylon , Belshazzar , who failed to understand the writing " mene , mene tekel , upharsin " on the wall , Price dismally failed to understand what the faeces on the statue signified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Rhodes statue per se but what the statue represented in terms of lack of transformation at UCT . <p> He danced , clapped and sang to the dismay of many who watched with interest and were held captive by the unfolding drama . <p> Unlike Belshazzar -- whose astrologers could n't interpret or understand the writing on the wall , which only Daniel could -- the whole of the South African nation could interpret what Price , a qualified medical doctor from Wits , with a string of qualifications from the London School of Hygiene and Oxford , appears not to understand . <p> It is comprehensible to think that someone with qualifications from a school of hygiene could believe the the best way of dealing with unhygienic conditions brought by human excrement on a statue was to remove the statue itself . <p> The implication is that each time human excrement is splashed on a building or artefact , followed by a chorus and some drum majorettes , that artefact or building should fall . <p> Being the problem that he is , in transformation terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But more worrying is the manner in which he and Adam Habib , the Wits vice-chancellor , dealt with the delinquent students during this troubled time . <p> Habib had to deal with a student leader , Mcebo Dlamini , who told all and sundry he drew his inspiration and admiration from Hitler . <p> Habib later recalled the student leader who was president of the Student Representative Council , albeit for different reasons . <p> It is , however , interesting that the recall happened almost at the same time as the uproar over the student 's remarks on Hitler . <p> The message the public is getting is that Habib realised it would take him a longer time to deal with the poor student leader and he quickly pulled an ace up his sleeve . <p> The ace was that Dlamini was found guilty of misconduct earlier and sentenced and an opportune time had arisen to shelve him . <p> Not wanting to be outdone , Price pulled a similar one . <p> He had not charged the unfortunate Chumani Maxwele for splashing human faeces on the honourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , accusing him of uttering some bile against white members of his staff . <p> Is it simply a coincidence that the two vice-chancellors separately found something outside the main issue at hand to deal with their delinquent students ? <p> Or it is perhaps " the copy and paste " approach to solving problems that is the issue ? <p> The answer is clear . The two are part of the same network of racists who receive a mandate from the same source . <p> At the University of the Free State , Jansen 's territory , four white students duped black cleaning staff to eat food they had urinated on . <p> After all the fury , a " reconciliation " ceremony was held and the issue put to an end . <p> As Suntosh Pillay puts it , " black people are constantly asked to forgive , to forget , to move on , to work harder , to endure , to be patient , to reconcile , to stay calm , to pretend " . <p> However , more importantly , one needs to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to utter bile against Africans suggesting their standards will fall once they come on board . <p> Why are they keeping their pay cheque for pulling racist rants on the imperative transformation of higher education ? <p> Jansen correctly argues in an article published in a daily newspaper : " Our universities for the most part are mediocre , and the reason a handful are more competitive has nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with the privileged relationship between race and resources over many decades . " <p> He correctly acknowledges that many of the white professors in the country did not qualify for their positions according to international standards , but were made professors due to being white at the right time in history . <p> What has he done about this mediocrity as a vice-chancellor of a university ? <p> Should not there be an audit of this mediocrity from top to bottom ? <p> As a society we should know whether the current crop of vice- chancellors have the credentials they claim to have and whether their record of publication is really up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mediocrity that is our professorate as per Jansen 's claim . <p> However , why would someone of Jansen 's stature want to leave his mediocrity at home to go and address the " mediocrity that is Sadtu " ? <p> Should charity not begin at home ? But can Jansen 's academy of mediocrity deliver the quality black professors required in the establishment or would they deliver mediocre black professors ? <p> At universities , students are required to write and pass a certain number of tests to qualify for the final examination . <p> Many of our current vice-chancellors do not qualify to write the final transformation exam for they have simply failed basic arithmetic and defied logic . <p> To them black means mediocre , backwardness , darkness , while white privilege represents purity or God in whose eyes the reputation of their institution matters . <p> It is up to us as society to decide whether we want to continue to mourn or we want to , in the words of one Zwelinzima Vavi , to " organise " ourselves and confront the charlatans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higher Education that would make the axe fall , it is us who have the power to let the axe fall ! <p> * Lesiba Seshoka is executive director , corporate relations , at the University of KwaZulu-Natal . <p> ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

These have enriched the working class in general , providing for sustainable and revolutionary solutions to challenges caused by capital . <p> Today , Cosatu is proud that the Department of Health 's Human Resource Strategy has factored in , among others , the importance of the perennial supply of Cuban doctors in all rural-based provinces . <p> It is on record that more than 23 407 South African doctors are spread across the world in countries such as Australia , New Zealand , Canada , the UK and US after completion of training because of other " pulling factors " . <p> Cosatu argues that a full staff complement at all health centres is a pre-condition to have an efficient and effective health system . <p> The extensive and changing burden of diseases across the globe need international collaborations to enhance human beings ' lifespan . <p> Cuba has without failure played that role in the interests of the South African masses . <p> Every year , students across all provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such government programmes . <p> This must be done to further cement South African/Cuban revolutionary collaboration and co-operation . <p> Cosatu vividly recalls the words of Nelson Mandela when he said in 1988 : " If today all South Africans enjoy the rights of democracy , if they are able at last to address the grinding poverty of a system that denied them even the most basic amenities of life , it is also because of Cuba 's selfless support for the struggle to free all of South Africa 's people and the countries of our region from the inhumane and destructive system of apartheid . " <p> The Cuban delegation to South Africa must be utilised to rekindle the revolutionary relations to solve challenges in all aspects of our society , such as in the health system , the combating of the communicable and non-communicable diseases burden , exploring construction ideas and other important exchanges of ideas and tactics . <p> The visit , to be carried out under the theme , " The Cuban Five Heroes ' Tribute to African Solidarity " is welcomed by Cosatu and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANC , the SACP , the South African National Civic Organisations , mass democratic movement structures , progressive civil society and the active participation of the Friends of Cuba Society that today we are celebrating all the strides we have made . <p> Many Cosatu affiliates have been active and financially supported the struggle , calling for the release of the " Cuban Five " and for the US embargo on Cuba ( which has been in place since 1961 ) to be lifted . <p> The five 's ordeal began in September 1998 , when they were arrested by the FBI and held in US jails . They were placed in solitary confinement for the entire 17 months before their trial . <p> Their mistrial lasted six months . The US government could not prove the main charge against Gerardo Hernandez ( conspiracy to commit murder ) , but the jury nevertheless found them guilty of all charges . <p> The peace treaty signed in 1988 and observed by Chester Crocker , the then US assistant secretary of state for African affairs , led to Namibian independence in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Cuban comrades were sentenced to " four life sentences plus 77 years and imprisoned in five separate maximum security jails spread across the US without possibility of communicating with each other " . <p> During this period their relatives were unable to visit and see them due to visa denial problems . <p> Two in particular were " being prevented from receiving visits from their spouses , with their entry permits to US repeatedly denied . This in effect meant that they were denied from visiting their spouses for nine and 11 years respectively . " <p> Their names remained engraved in the minds of all workers in various workers ' parliaments throughout the hard years . Many may recall that workers wore various T-shirts depicting their faces to demand their release from US jails . <p> Many workers carried placards depicting their faces in workplaces , in front of government offices and at the US embassy . <p> And the Cuban Five campaign was led robustly on all platforms until they were all released . <p> The central executive committee of Cosatu recently eloquently appreciated all the platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological work with theoretical and practical approaches . <p> Cosatu joins all Alliance-led masses in welcoming the Cuban delegation in South Africa . <p> Cosatu welcomed this week the working visit by Cuban Vice- President Salvador Vald ? s Mesa in South Africa . <p> We wish to receive the Cuban delegation this month to cement the revolutionary relationship the South African working class has shared with the people of Cuba . <p> Cosatu reiterates what Nelson Mandela said that " inasmuch as Cuba was a home from home for many South Africans during the dark night of our oppression , we now welcome you home to the sunshine of our freedom " . <p> Cosatu pays its respects to all former MK members , the leadership of the Congress Movement and all progressive forces who made it possible for South Africa to be free . Accordingly , social and economic justice for workers and the working class in particular are key inscriptions of our Bill of Rights and the constitution of South Africa . <p> Cosatu remembers the Cubans ' unwavering dedication to the revolutionary struggle for freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Cuba to celebrate with us the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Charter on June 26 . <p> Forward towards the radical economic transformation ! <p> * Sdumo Dlamini is president of Cosatu . <p> ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

Whatever the reason , he is deeply mistaken if he imagines anyone in South Africa -- from across the political spectrum -- would have any reaction other than the deepest revulsion to the cold-blooded killing of innocent worshippers , " said the director of the foundation , Dave Steward . <p> Roof shot and killed the nine African American worshippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churchgoers for more than an hour in their Bible study group . <p> Steward said the incident was reminiscent of the brutal killing by gunmen of 11 worshippers at St James 's Church in Kenilworth in 1993 , and the " white-wolf " Barend Strydom , who shot and killed seven black South Africans at Strijdom Square in Pretoria in 1988 . <p> He said it was a reminder that underlined the importance of combating racism and hatred with all the resources at our disposal wherever it occurred . <p> Anti-apartheid activist , clinical psychologist and academic Saths Cooper said the US shooter probably had no relation at all to Rhodesia or apartheid South Africa , they just suited his purpose and ideology because they were societies premised on racial superiority . <p> " This shooter obviously looked into the past ( of South Africa and then Rhodesia ) for justification of his beliefs .

@@3372240 <p> For Meyiwa , much of the blame for the lack of results rests with the police who , he says , have continually tried to reassure him that they are doing their best . <p> But so far they appear to have achieved nothing except the botched arrest of Zamokuhle Mbatha , who lives in Vosloorus on Gauteng 's East Rand - near the family home of Senzo 's lover , Kelly Khumalo , where the killing took place . <p> Mbatha , who said this week that he was suing the police for R10-million for wrongful arrest , believes his arrest is responsible for his inability to find a job . <p> He said the stigma of the accusation against him was impossible to shake off . <p> " Most of these people are strangers , but feel I owe them an explanation . How do you explain something that you do n't know ? " <p> Mbatha said he kept a low profile now , often spending his days locked in his one-room shack three blocks from the Khumalo house . <p> Meyiwa , sitting in his home in Umlazi , KwaZulu-Natal , said he wanted to hear what the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the killing had to say for themselves . <p> They include Khumalo , her mother , her sister , Zandi , Zandi 's boyfriend , Longwe Twala , and two friends , Mthokozisi Twala and Tumelo Madlala . <p> " The place where Senzo was killed is known , " he said . <p> " I wish to ask national police commissioner General Riah Phiyega what 's going on , because the people who were there know the truth . I wish Phiyega could put pressure on the investigators to pull up their socks . <p> " Why are the people who pointed fingers at Mbatha not arrested , because they lied in order to shift the focus of the investigation away from what really happened ?

Even Senzo himself wo n't rest until his killers have been put behind bars . " <p> Meyiwa said detectives had visited him two weeks ago and told him that a suspect arrested for an unrelated crime might provide clues to his son 's death . <p> The officers told him they were still piecing together information to see if the suspect was linked to the murder . <p> " Someone has been arrested , but not in relation to Senzo 's murder , " he said . <p> " The police said they are still doing a DNA test to check whether he is linked to his murder .

For example , the type who sweeps you off your feet and then , just days later , acts like a complete stranger . You 're left wondering if you were just a one-night stand or if you said something that put him off you forever . Half the time , it was n't anything you did or said -- he 's just preoccupied with his other life ( the one he 'd move mountains to protect ) . <p> Sarah Symonds , former mistress and author of the controversial Having an Affair ? A Handbook for the Other Woman says the signs that you 're dating a married man are usually painfully obvious .

It 's simply because he would n't want any paper trail linked back to his affair . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 's that ' Denzel Washington type ' that you 've been praying for your whole life . <p> Here are the top 12 warning signs that will tell you he 's probably already taken : <p> You met at a social gathering . . . Men , although not all , usually go to bars , parties and boys nights out hoping to strike it lucky . Comedian Loyiso Gola once said that women must be super suspicious of those guys who approach them at a party at 3am when the mood is dying down and everyone 's preparing to go home . Be especially cautious if the guy is very quick to whip out his phone to save your number . <p> His ring finger is two-toned . . . If you meet him in a nightclub setting for instance , it 'll be difficult to see that untanned ring on his finger where his wedding band usually sits . But if you 're fortunate enough to meet him in broad daylight , stretch out your hand to indicate how pleased you are to meet him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ring tan mark . Doing this before you look at his shoes or belt , to check if he 's your type , will save you from heartbreak down the line . <p> He never answers certain calls in front of you . . . He does n't know you well enough to ascertain whether or not you have psychotic tendencies , so he 'll never risk losing his family by speaking to his wife in front of you . The same goes for replying to your texts and WhatsApps . He 'll read them , but will only respond hours or even days later ! Just to prevent you nagging , he may even deactivate the blue ticks in his WhatsApp settings ( the option that tells you when someone has read your messages ) . <p> He only ever calls during the day , while at the garage filling his car or on his way somewhere , but never after he 's just woken up . . .

You could go days without hearing from this guy and then suddenly he 'll call on a Monday afternoon and ask you to meet him at a restaurant on the outskirts of town . I mean what are the chances that you 'll bump into someone he knows there ? That 's another red flag . He always decides on the venue and it 's usually somewhere where you wo n't find crowds or a lot of activity , like a five-star hotel bar . Also , his weekends are out of bounds because that time is set aside for his first lady and the children . <p> He has multiple cellphone numbers . . . And this is not to say that you should be highly suspicious of any guy who has three numbers or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you his other numbers or if the number that you have is constantly off . Furthermore , his text messages to you are always professional and bear no sign of a romantic relationship . This is his way of covering his back should he ever get caught ! <p> He discusses current affairs more than his personal life . . . Does your partner play his cards close to his chest , never giving away too much about his friends , his family or what he does for a living ? This is merely to protect himself in case you know some of the people in his life or go digging into his past . <p> He avoids talking about your future together . . . This is only because he does n't want to be insensitive , or honest and tell you there is n't one . <p> He 's never invited you to his place . . . There 's a good reason why he wo n't ever invite you to his home , and it 's not because it 's untidy as he keeps telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your place . " It 's more convenient because your linen is always so crisp and clean , " he says . And he never wants to spend the night and cuddle , because he 'd rather face your anger than infuriate his wife and raise her suspicions by missing ' curfew ' . Besides , you knowing where he lives would be a dangerous move in case you showed up at his house unannounced on those many occasions when he 's mysteriously not answering your calls or messages . <p> His social media accounts are very discreet . . . How many times have you met someone you thought could be a potential boyfriend and then went straight to Facebook to cyberstalk him ? A cheating married man knows that an active social media account is as good as going on a radio station to talk about his life . Firstly , you will expect the two of you to be friends or even follow each other on these social media platforms . Worst of all , you may even want to tag him in your pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very things he 's trying to avoid . Even if he has a social media account , it probably does n't even have a profile picture and his status was last updated three years ago . <p> He told you he was in the process of finalising his divorce . . . This right here , is the most popular lie spread by married men who want to con women into falling for them . Anyone who is in the process of finalising a divorce should have no trouble letting you in on what 's happening in his life , right ? If he continues doing all of the above , even after this confession , know that his wife is still very much his Mrs. <p> There 's never any celebration of special occasions in your relationship . . .

We read texts and messages , we read social media feeds , we read journalism , we read gossip , we read commentary . A lot of the time we spend staring at our phones we are reading . <p> And yet most of us do n't consider our phones to be our primary reading device , despite evidence to the contrary ; when asked " what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore ? -- we might look a bit guilty , as the title of the last book we finished escapes us . While people do read e-books on their phones via apps like Kindle and Kobo , they are in a minority . Many people find the temptations of Candy Crush and Facebook to be too great a distraction and prefer to do their reading offline via printed books and e-readers ; many more people do n't make it off their smartphones and into the book at all . <p> While reading fiction has long been a minority pursuit , the ubiquity of the e-book -- the static electronic copy of a print book -- has restricted the growth of new forms of writing that could be native to smartphones and tablets . Publishers are , understandably , fixated on preserving their business models ; they publish books . Fiction writers are fixated on the publishing industry ; they write books . The margins are low in publishing , perhaps too low to attract the kind of new content providers that we are seeing in television currently , where multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the other hand , the Internet has facilitated a dramatic explosion of self-publishing . The success of the online writing portal Wattpad , with its 40m users in the coveted 18-30 age bracket , has been spectacular . Wattpad 's founder , Allen Lau , says that 85% of Wattpad users read and write their stories on their smartphones and tablets . <p> But even Wattpad , with its emphasis on publication by chapter and ongoing feedback from readers , resembles the magazine serialisations of Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins more than it does any truly native form of writing for the new devices . And the main difference between today 's writers and their 19th century forerunners is that while Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens got paid for what they wrote , the only way Wattpadders can hope to make a living is to transition to a traditional publishing deal . <p> Audiobooks have also found huge new audiences via the smartphone . Audible , Amazon 's audiobook division , is now experimenting in commissioning audio drama content from writers . They are clearly hoping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , NPR 's Serial . <p> Outside the box And there are more unusual ideas too -- my Bath Spa University colleague Naomi Alderman and the games company Six to Start scored a big hit with their audio narrative app for runners , Zombies , Run ! , last year . The fitness game encourages you to run by describing the hordes of zombies at your back -- and with more than a million sales under their belts , this form of storytelling works . <p> So , new forms of storytelling native to the new devices are proliferating , but are difficult to find unless you already know what you are looking for . Other recent projects that demonstrate some of the potential : there 's Karen , Blast Theory 's compelling take on the perils of life coaching , which uses interactive video to take you directly into Karen 's life . And also the text message story Lifeline , about an astronaut crashed on a distant planet who needs you to help him figure out how to survive . These two examples demonstrate two different business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen was created with support from the Arts Council England and BBC digital platform The Space ; Lifeline costs about R35 in the app stores . <p> As the intersection between creative writing and technology deepens , as the book moves beyond the e-book -- beyond the static electronic copy -- what shape will storytelling take ? As we shift more and more of our content consumption onto our smartphones , will text as we know it -- literary text -- survive in a landscape that privileges more visual forms of storytelling ? <p> As we move into what theorist Florian Cramer calls the post-digital age , do writers need to leave the book entirely and think in completely new ways to create stories truly native to our new reading habits and devices ? These are all questions ripe for writers and technologists to explore . <p> Kate Pullinger is professor of creative writing and digital media at Bath Spa University <h> Why TechCentral ? <p> We know that as a prospective advertiser , you are spoilt for choice .

@@3375239 's Edge Catalyst Preserves the Original 's Spirit <h> Having faith in DICE . <p> By Ryan McCaffrey <p> I love the first Mirror 's Edge so much that I literally cheered when the reboot , now called Mirror 's Edge Catalyst , was announced at E3 2013 . Needless to say , I 've been tracking Catalyst 's progress closely . I 'm ready to be extremely excited if returning developer DICE can successfully recapture the free-running , first-person , gun-free , primary-color-palletted original . Conversely , if they screw it up somehow , I 'll lead the pitchfork-and-torch mob to DICE 's door . <p> Good news : we 're tracking toward the former happening rather than the latter . I finally got to play the new Mirror 's Edge , and I came away very happy . DICE does n't seem to have screwed it up . They 've doubled down on the de-emphasis of firearms . In fact , they even do the original game better : you ca n't even pick up a gun in Catalyst . <h> You ca n't use guns , but what you can do is run . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open world of the city , now called Glass , in glorious first-person . The controls , I 'm pleased to report , have been simplified from their somewhat complex predecessor . L1 ( on PS4 ) does " up " motions like jump , while L2 executes " down " motions like slide . One face button handles lighter attacks , while another pulls off heavier moves . RT bashes through doors . <p> My 12-minute timed hands-on allowed me to tackle one of three missions in any order I chose . I could take Faith on a Race , Delivery , or Billboard Hack . The first is self-explanatory -- DICE has incorporated the popular ( and excellent ) time trials into the main game this time , rather than segregate them into a separate game mode . Laudably , you can simply hold down X for a few seconds at any time in order to restart , so if you screw up and want to take it again , you 're spared a few inconvenient button presses and a trip to the menu . <h> I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billboard Hack , meanwhile , challenges you to simply reach a hard-to-get-to area , not unlike trying to get to an orb in Crackdown . It 's not timed -- which is good , because it took me a while to clamber my way up the various ledges , walls , and scaffolding I needed to scale in order to reach the marker . I can see this being an alluring mission type . <p> I was most excited to try a Delivery , which would allow me to fight some of Glass ' armored authoritarians who stood in the way of me delivering a data stick to a drop box . And fight I did , but my short hands-on was n't enough time to figure out any nuances to the melee combat system . I simply mashed each attack button and the guys dropped . And at one point , I triggered some sort of special finishing move without realizing it , which pulled the camera out to third-person and let me watch Faith put the knockout hurt on a bad guy . I 'll need more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or see if it 's just that clunky . <p> Finally , Catalyst is powered by DICE 's own Frostbite engine -- the same tech that now powers Battlefield and , really , most of EA 's premier offerings . I was n't blown away by sharp , primary color-driven color minimalism of of Catalyst 's look , but that may simply be because it 's not new anymore . I can report that Catalyst sticks to the aesthetic blueprint designed by the original Mirror 's Edge . In fact , that sentence still rings true even if you remove the word " aesthetic , " and that 's exactly what Mirror 's Edge fans like me have been hoping for .

It was also the sector 's top property stock in terms of overall returns for last year . In the second half of last year , Fortress achieved a 19.64% distribution growth compared with the six months until December 2013 . <p> The second best performer was Resilient Property Income Fund , which declared distribution growth of 16.3% . This breached the Markey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accretive acquisitions of lower LSM ( living standards measure ) regional malls and also from strong returns from its stakes in property funds . <p> Arrowhead Properties also did well .

" They are cheaper to finance than malls in SA are , " she says . <p> Growthpoint Properties , the largest locally based real estate investment trust managed 7.5% distribution growth .

Growthpoint 's assets are worth nearly R100bn . <p> He says Growthpoint has a clean and easy to follow company structure . <p> Growthpoint 's disclosure and corporate governance are among the best in the listed property sector and the company has won awards for them .

Retail landlords who need a healthy spending consumer are also under threat . <p> Ian Anderson , the chief investment officer at Grindrod Asset Management , says listed property enjoyed a strong bull run over the past few years . In 2014 , its returns were slightly abnormal because of some outlying features . <p> Most of the listed South African funds became Real Estate Investment Trusts ( Reits ) . This involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad in larger property markets . SA has become one of the top ten largest Reit markets in the world . By becoming Reits , foreign institutional investors were attracted to the SA funds . Various larger South African Reits joined Reit indices . This prompted foreign index trackers to invest in South African Reits . <p> This boosted the larger property stocks ' share prices . <p> There was also a fair degree of consolidation last year which boosted capital growth for the listed sector . <p> This year South African funds are finding it harder to buy out rival funds . Fewer companies are willing to let go of their portfolios than there were in previous years . <p> Interest rate hikes in South Africa and in America will also put downward pressure on reits ' share prices . South African investors will need to choose their reit investments carefully and try to buy into funds with qualities which suggest their returns will grow this year . This could be owning popular malls or having exposure to assets that are performing well in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@3378235 <p> Kaizer Chiefs unveiled their marquee signing of the offseason on Tuesday when they named Siyanda Xulu as one of their latest recruits . <p> Not only will the defender 's arrival kick off the post-Stuart Baxter era at Amakhosi , it will also -- perhaps most importantly -- herald the beginning of Steve Komphela 's Chiefs . <p> There 's little doubt that the signing is an important one , and one that could have a transformative effect on both the Glamour Boys and Xulu himself , while also helping Chiefs retain their place as favourites for the 2015-16 PSL title . <p> But beyond this , what exactly does the transfer mean for all of those involved ? <p> Despite the business that may still be done over the coming weeks , could Xulu 's switch already be considered as the signing of the season ? <p> Can Xulu 's move be a launchpad for a return to the Bafana Bafana starting XI ? <p> Komphela and Chiefs ought to be feeling delighted -- and somewhat relieved -- with their new acquisition . While Xulu has not had things all his own way since leaving these shores in 2012 , he remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , he is one of those players who boasts the rare combination of youthful exuberance and potential for progression , as well as experience -- of South African , Russian and international football . <p> Beyond being a statement of intent by Chiefs , he is the kind of marquee addition that gives Komphela immediate authenticity and legitimacy . <p> While not an offensive talent , he will surely appeal to the fans . Partly , this is due to Xulu 's class and reputation in his homeland , but also because -- as Kaizer Motaung has been quick to emphasise -- he was also a former Chiefs youth prospect , and his return can be considered a homecoming of sorts . <p> In terms of quality , the defender has already demonstrated his class in the domestic game during his time with Sundowns , and if he can shake the ring rust -- he only made four league appearances for Rostov last term -- he ought to at least rediscover that former composure and dominance . <p> If he can , his signing will represent a major coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Xulu 's arrival ought to assuage some concerns about the identity of Eric Mathoho 's partner next year . <p> While Komphela was welcomed warmly to Soccer City last week , a pervading concern threatened to derail his opening few weeks in the job , or at the very least represented an unresolved area of conflict . <p> Chiefs fans need not fret about the rumoured departure of Mashamaite <p> The new man may still need to find replacements for Itumeleng Khune and Mandla Masango should they depart , but having snared Xulu , he can at least sleep easy knowing that Tefu Mashamaite 's loss would not spell disaster for his back four . <p> Certainly , should the skipper leave , his loss would be felt keenly , but Xulu -- seven years Mashamaite 's junior -- should at least have a fair stab at proving he is a worthy successor to his fellow international . In time , he may even prove to be an upgrade . <p> Komphela can now deal with Mashamaite 's future calmly and assuredly , knowing that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If he can rediscover his past form , then Xulu -- who has signed a four-year deal -- can certainly be viewed as a better long-term prospect than Mashamaite . <p> But what does this move mean for the player ? <p> Despite the Chiefs spin on his signing -- and they are right to do so -- and despite the ' homecoming king ' narrative , and the statement of intent this represents , this is surely not how the player will have expected his ' return ' to be . <p> There is something undeniably romantic about the former great coming back home to enjoy the autumn of his career before his local fans . We saw this with Benny McCarthy , and his somewhat flabby return to the PSL back in 2011 . Aaron Mokoena , Mark Fish , John Moshoeu and Shaun Bartlett who ended their playing careers in the Rainbow Nation having played in some of the major leagues and at the biggest clubs of Europe . <p> Has Komphela just secured the first , key building block for his new side ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experiences and , in some cases , honours , tucked into their back pocket . <p> Xulu is 23 . He still has everything to prove and everything to achieve , to himself , to the national-team selectors , and to the fans back home . Here is a player , after all , who had a trial with Arsenal back in 2010 , and was linked to Barcelona . <p> The word ' reject ' will be bandied around a lot over the coming days and weeks . <p> This is unfair , as the defender has suffered with injury during his time in Russia , while a dispute with manager Igor Gamula made headlines across the world . <p> It is telling , perhaps , that no other European sides managed to acquire him ahead of Chiefs , while his struggles to secure a regular spot in Shakes Mashaba 's Bafana Bafana may also have counted against him in the eyes of local fans . <p> Nonetheless , he boasts the kind of potential that few other centre-backs in the PSL can offer . Most importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate to shake off the tag of a European flop and keen to prove that he can be the Bafana cornerstone that many of us hoped he would be . <p> Komphela will definitely be hoping that Chiefs fans are praising Xulu as the signing of the summer in 12 months time ...

Call of Duty : Black Ops and its sequel introduced a range of mechanics and ideas to the formula , ideas which shaped the franchise for years to come . <p> This year , Treyarch returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's a game which now includes new ideas and modes for the popular multiplayer that has defined the series . Including something as simple as swimming ; an idea which has a massive impact on the gameplay . <p> " We 're really big into this idea about a combat movement system . We 've been trying to figure out how to put swimming in various Treyarch Call Of Duty games for a while , " studio design director David Vonderhaar explained over at E3 last week . <p> We 've had water in levels , right ? It 's like this whole universe under the map , that we have n't been able to explore and what that means for traversing through the play-space . <p> The whole combat movement system in general , was really built for the fast and the fluid nature was built to reward players for moving and navigating through the world . But it 's very risky those moves , you can really be taken down , so risk and reward in the situation . <p> We actually think all those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back-strafe mantles , the thrust-jump , the power slide and swimming . All of those things work in combination to make that system work , it 's not any one of them . <p> " It 's actually , it 's just cool . Swimming , going under water and having combat 360 degrees around you , " multiplayer game director Dan Bunting added . <p> Everything behaves a little different around you , so if you throw a grenade , it has different physics . All of the explosions under water are a little different , there 's a lot of cool factor just in being able to swim . <p> We learned some things about swimming as we were going along and developing the feature , things that just helped with our map design . People are sort of using swimming as an emergent way to combat . <p> You can just drop into the water quickly , to duck out of combat and then you sort of turn the advantage around . If somebody has the advantage above water , you drop into water and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better position . <p> So there 's a lot of emergent mechanics that are coming out of it , it 's just a lot of fun . <p> The biggest new feature in the game however ? Specialists . Nine dedicated characters , each with their own unique ability which can be charged up and used to turn a match around in Call of Duty : Black Ops III . That new class-based system is what will keep the game fresh for regulars and newcomers . <p> " The Specialist is a brand new combat system , one that fits in the power band between the extreme of the reward system and the scorestreaks and the more traditional class-picked system , " Vonderhaar said . <p> So this is a brand new combat system that Dan and I are huge fans of what we call " big chunky meaty gameplay " which is the idea that you can see this character . <p> And by looking at that character , you have a really good idea of what this character is capable of . But it does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks and there 's still scorestreaks and there 's these really big chunky choices of a weapon or an ability , and those are things that everybody gets to participate in , because you 're always earning towards it even if you die . <p> So everybody gets their brief moment to shine as a specialist in a match . But it 's not free either , because if you get taken out while using it , it 's over , it 's done for you and you have to earn it again . <p> So the Specialist system is really entertaining for us to work on , and people have been reacting very strongly to it here at E3 with this concept of " Which of these nine people am I going to play as ? " and from those nine , " which weapon or ability am I going to choose ? " . <p> " My favourite part about specialists , is something that I wish I could say that we planned it out , but it sort of emerged out of the development process was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persona of that character , " Bunting said . <p> And as you start to play with them more and more , you actually kind of take on the persona of that character . You start to change the way that you play a match . It 's interesting how it 's kind of really changed the way that people play , based on whatever their favourite Specialists are . <p> Because he 's the writer that Lazygamer deserves , but not the one it actually needs right now .

@@3378239 <p> A commercial soap opera called Uzalo will get a R5-million-plus subsidy from the Durban metro -- a step the city 's council has agreed to because it will bring focus to Durban 's capabilities for film-making in productive competition with Cape Town and Johannesburg . The soapie is to be broadcast on SABC1 and the argument was whether Durban was correct in assigning so much funding to an initiative which , while it would create some jobs and in general convey lessons in film-making to a city hitherto innocent of such ventures , it is coincidentally linked to the business interests of Gugu Zuma-Ncube , who happens to be Jacob Zuma 's daughter . -- Peter Wilhelm <p> By Amanda Khoza from News24 <p> South African President Jacob Zuma <p> President Jacob Zuma 's daughter 's Durban-based television series , Uzalo , took centre stage at an executive council meeting in Durban on Tuesday . The city recently approved a R5m cash injection to help keep Gugu Zuma-Ncube 's popular KwaMashu drama afloat . <p> Zuma-Ncube reportedly presented her request to the city 's economic development and planning committee earlier this month after producers begged for financial assistance . Zuma-Ncube and Kopedi Pokane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company producing the show . <p> The SABC1 series is shot in a leased Newlands East warehouse and locations in KwaMashu . It tells the story of two prominent families in the township who had their eldest sons switched at birth in 1990 . <p> A report presented before committee on Tuesday revealed that Stained Glass requested a total sponsorship of R8m . The company requested that an amount of R5m be approved for the company to compete in the film industry within the city , to create job opportunities for the youth in particular , and showcase township culture in Durban . <p> DA Councillor Zwakele Mncwango said while he was happy that the series was being produced locally , he was concerned that Zuma-Ncube was given the funding because she was Zuma 's daughter . " My main concern is when we set aside R5m just to fund one project . What are we going to do when somebody else asks us for funding ? The owners of Uzalo had a choice to sell their product to any other channel on DStv but they chose SABC1 and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a problem . We should be funding upcoming artists and productions at the Playhouse , not well established businesses . " <p> Uzalo has officially replaced Generations:The Legacy as the most watched show in South Africa http : //t.co/xSsFKqsZt2 <p> Mncwango questioned : " Are we funding this project because they deserve it or is it because she is the daughter of the president ? I would hate for us to fund this project just because she is Zuma 's daughter . " <p> Councillor Heinz de Boer supported Mncwango , saying that Stained Glass Facilities was making a profit using taxpayer 's money . " The aim of any business is to make a profit . How can we even consider making such a huge donation to one company ? How can we take money from taxpayers and fund a struggling business ? " De Boer added that there were no compelling reasons why the series should receive aid from the city . <p> ANC councillors attacked Mncwango and De Boer , calling them pessimists . Councillor Nigel Gumede said : " We always give money to universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the universities , it is going towards the students they are taking in . Funding Uzalo is the same thing -- the money is going towards nurturing those young people . The report does n't mention any names but the DA always goes out there and searches for names to taint the ANC . " <p> Speaker Logie Naidoo said funding Uzalo would put Durban on the map in the entertainment industry : " Both Cape Town and Johannesburg have invested a lot of money in the film industry . This project will help us promote our culture and Durban as a brand . We have Isidingo and all these other series that are shot in Johannesburg and it would be good to have our own series shot in our backyard . " <p> He said while R5m sounded like a lot of money , the city would get plenty of mileage out of advertising . " For me it is not about the names involved . We need to support our industry so that we can attract new talent to our city , " said Naidoo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pittance when compared to the mileage we are going to get from the production . We actually need to up the stakes in terms of the amount of money we contribute to the creative industry so that we can attract more people from Johannesburg . " <p> Mayor James Nxumalo also gave his support to the production : " It 's not a crime to support individuals . They are also South Africans . " And National Freedom Party councillor Bongiwe Mtshali supported the city 's decision , saying the project was unique . " We have never had something like this in Durban . There are children who were on the streets and now we are seeing them on our screens in this series . The NFP fully backs this initiative " <p> Quite right . In an article today in Times Live , reporting on the findings of a study by the Wits School of Public Health into corruption and irregular spending in the health care system , one health official remarked : " " If you are a strong manager you get targeted and destroyed . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " THAT is the crux of the big lie , but which the ANC in their propaganda is wanting people to believe to be a " good story " . All ANC structures are drenched in corruption , nepotism and theft . And it 's safe to say that this Uzalo production by Zuma 's daughter will prove to have all the hallmarks of this big lie . <p> robmanzoni <p> " ... The ANC 's learning curve is as flat as a pancake ... " <p> WRONGGGGGGG .... <p> They learned long ago how to extract unjustified , non-repayable funds . That was a very steep curve .. and of course , realising in the process that free money is available if : 1 ) you have a " good story " motive ; and 2 ) you have the right name/connections ... <p> You do n't need to show a profit , or even pretend that a profit is possible . You can squander- or hang on to the cash -- no more questions asked , no accountability <p> " Accountability " and " Responsibility " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> robmanzoni <p> : ... Councillor Heinz de Boer supported Mncwango , saying that Stained Glass Facilities was making a profit using taxpayer 's money . ... // ... How can we take money from taxpayers and fund a struggling business ? " <p> OK -- a good argument ; then explain SAA , SABC , TELKOM , MANGO , ..... ETC .. taxpayers have been robbed to prop-up these mismanaged , previously profitable enterprises -- even paying bonuses for failure . <p> Until a way is found to stop this cynical profiteering , it will just keep happening . <p> This " grant " should be reversed and converted into a LOAN , with proper security in the form of Ms Ncube 's own property . If she decided not to sell to higher bidders , as seems to be the case , we must wonder why ... The " repayment " requirements ( what a quaint idea ... ! ) will provide an incentive to make the project work -- a grant does not . <p> Mo Haarhoff <p> Small wonder councillors complained of wasted budget last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away ? And as for our culture , they 'd better not send every road-cleaning team in the city out there just for shooting days . It 's impossible to get our suburban streets cleaned already because ' there 's no money ' . <p> jayceevanrooyen <p> This production Uzalo has a flavour similar to the fiasco of Dlamini Zuma 's Sarafina II of 1995 when taxpayers ended up paying about R14 million ( way over budget of course ) for a hairy-fairy idea which resulted not only in failure but all kinds of accusations about money . The ANC 's learning curve is as flat as a pancake . Mncwango and De Boer asked sensible questions but the ANC predictably shot them down .

Picture : Elmond Jiyane <p> Harold Maloka says he was disappointed to notice the limited media coverage of the positive story that unfolded at TUT . <p> Pretoria - " I am encouraged by the response of the students which indicates that our message that education is the apex priority for the country has been received far and wide in the country . We have discovered a positive problem at TUT , the problem of an oversupply of students leading to inadequate accommodation . We are happy that young people are hungry for education in our country in this manner and we are challenged as government to respond to this challenge positively . " <p> This is how President Jacob Zuma summed up the highly successful Siyahlola Monitoring Visit to Soshanguve and Tshwane University of Technology ( TUT ) . <p> On the morning of Tuesday , June 23 , TUT was already abuzz with activity , with students making their way to different venues in anticipation of the arrival of President Zuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands or take " selfies " with the president , while some were adamant and upbeat that the president 's visit to their campus would help address their plight . <p> Zuma was visiting the university following complaints from students that there is scarcity and lack of accommodation on campus to accommodate them while pursuing their studies . They further raised security concerns following the disturbing news of the stabbing to death of a student and burning of 18 cars during a protest last year . <p> The students also raised the challenge of adequate funding to successfully pursue their studies , which is a challenge faced by many students and potential students across the country . <p> In response to the students ' concerns , the president undertook the Siyahlola Monitoring Visit to see for himself and hear from students what the challenges are and how the government can help to create a conducive environment for learning . <p> On arrival , there was jubilation and excitement , a rousing welcome from the university community , which included university management , lecturers and students . <p> Cellphones were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the hope and aspirations of students . <p> The cellphones were in competition with television and photographic cameras , which all witnessed the positive events as they unfolded . <p> However , it was disappointing to notice limited media coverage of the positive story that unfolded throughout the day at TUT . <p> The visit began with a visit to female and male residences to observe the living conditions of students at the north campus . <p> Through the president 's interventions , the female residences were refurbished , especially bathrooms which were causes for concern due to lack of privacy and dignity . The students in the female residences attested to the interventions and were grateful to the government . <p> At the residences , students did not disappoint . They raised issues ranging from funding for meals provided by National Students Financial Assistance Scheme ( NSFAS ) not being enough , limited accommodation , students being required to remove all their belongings from their accommodation when going on holiday , which causes financial strain to their families . The university undertook to look into the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were happy to be at the university and looked forward to concluding their studies and entering the job market . <p> They also said that there was now security at residences which made them feel safe . <p> The president and his entourage of deputy ministers who form the Presidential Youth Working Group Task Team led by Deputy Minister in the Presidency , Mr Buti Manamela , also proceeded to Bethesda Church in the community , which provides accommodation to 70 students . They are living under dire conditions split into one shack and two small rooms with one of the church pastors being the caretaker . The Departments of Higher Education and Social Development will continue to assess the situation and find solutions . <p> The president also visited the Botho Socio-Psychology centre , a youth skills development centre which has been adopted by the university . The centre is run from the old Thulasizwe Primary School , which has now been refurbished . <p> The president also addressed the public meeting of students and community members at the university hall and announced successful interventions by the government since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . <p> The visit was a resounding success in many ways . Other than the warm and rousing welcome the president received , key interventions and progress were observed and announced . <p> Government departments and institutions have been hard at work to respond to complaints by students and assist them to create a conducive environment for learning to take place . <p> The Department of Labour is registering unemployed youth into its database and will provide job placement assistance through Employment Services Practitioners in the area . In addition , the department will explore organising interactive sessions for the work seekers with career counsellors , who will provide advice on preparing CVs and preparing for interviews . <p> The South African Police Service has initiated an internship programme that will cater for an initial 15 students . <p> The Department of Sport and Recreation has erected a multi-purpose centre at Reitumetse High School , which is 5km from the TUT North Campus and which will be accessible to the youth around the community serviced by Botho . The facility was constructed at a budget of about R1-million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soccer pitch . <p> Furthermore , the once dilapidated Thulasizwe Primary School , which has now been converted into a training centre , is getting much-needed attention . The Department of Public Works concluded a lease agreement for Botho Socio-Psychology Empowerment Centre near the campus which provides life skills and training for youth without matric in welding , boiler-making and computer skills to enable them to obtain jobs . The lease is for a period of 9 years and 11 months . The renovations of the school include painting , fixing of broken windows , doors and ceilings at a cost of approximately R3.5-million . The centre has been adopted by TUT students as a corporate social investment project . <p> The Department of Energy , in conjunction with the City of Tshwane , will attend to the internal wiring of the school and install prepaid electricity meters at a cost of R300 000 . The Department of Higher Education and Training ( DHET ) has accredited the centre as a recognised training centre . The City of Tshwane , together with the Department of Water and Sanitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ensure that water connection is legalised . <p> The DHET has moved the students who were housed by Botho at Thulasizwe Primary School in unsuitable conditions to the residences at TUT . The students had been " squatting " at the school . <p> The positive problem that the president found at TUT is encouraging , as it shows that many young people have heeded the message from government that education is the apex priority for the country . The oversupply of students demonstrates that young people are hungry for education . <p> In whatever measure , the president 's Siyahlola Monitoring Visit was a major success and the Department of Planning , Monitoring and Evaluation will follow up on the undertakings made as assigned by the president . <p> The positive story of the visit might have been missed in the reporting by the media . <p> However , the visit brought hope for the young people of TUT who want a better life . <p> * Harold Maloka is acting presidential spokesperson . <p> ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the right-hand side .

@@3400231 <h> Even in digital age , Kenyan company finds large market for pencils <p> Kenyan entrepreneurs Anthony Kirori and Ivan Ochieng manufacture hundreds of thousands of pencils every year from recycled newspaper at their factory in Nairobi . They co-founded Green Pencils Ltd in 2012 to offer an eco-friendly alternative to wood-based pencils . <p> " There was also an obvious gap in the industry . Although there is a big market for pencils , Kenya mostly relies on imported products . About 100 million pencils are imported every year , " says Kirori . " By using recycled newspapers we are helping protect the environment by reducing littering and the number of trees being cut to produce wooden pencils . " <p> Invented centuries ago , pencils have stood the test of time and remain popular even in the electronic age of smartphones and computers . Last year market intelligence firm Euromonitor estimated global pencil sales would grow to US$2.7bn . The world 's largest pencil manufacturer , US-headquartered Dixon Ticonderoga , produces an estimated 1.5 billion pencils a year . <p> Water resistant and longer lasting <p> At its factory , Green Pencils takes old newspapers through 18 different processes to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to three times longer than ordinary pencils . The pencils are sold to schools , corporate firms , government agencies and through a number of retailers . Kirori notes that growth in the education and private sectors is driving overall demand for stationery . <p> " Some people expected that with the advent of technology we would stop using pencils . But annual global consumption is about 14 billion . Pencils are not going anywhere . There will always be a market . However , how pencils are made should change to reduce pressure on trees -- which is why we use recycled newspapers , " says Kirori . <p> Green Pencils has carved a niche in producing branded pencils used for sales promotions , marketing campaigns or as gifts . <p> " We are adding value to pencils . Children use them on a daily basis so they present a great opportunity as a communication and marketing tool . Organisations can use them to pass messages to children , and subsequently to their parents . Pencils can be portable billboards in the hands of people you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirori says Green Pencils began focusing on schools and corporate clients when it faced hurdles getting on to the shelves of retail stores . <p> " Getting on to supermarket shelves has been a nightmare , " says Kirori . " By virtue of being the only Kenyan company making pencils locally , we expected supermarkets to embrace us . But we were surprised when they showed us the exit door , and refused to give us orders . But we learned to roll with the punches . We did not close shop , instead figured a way to go round our problems . So we shifted our model to business-to-business , and began working with corporate firms and government . " <p> Although distribution is also a major challenge , Green Pencils has not written off the mass market . <p> " We are looking to start selling through small shops once we get a distributor . Pencils are not bulky , so if we find someone already in the distribution business they can do that for us . Unfortunately a distributor we approached recently wanted 60% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can offer us better terms , our final game plan is to invest in our own distributorship network . " <p> Diversifying the business <p> Green Pencils has diversified into producing pens and is eyeing more opportunities in manufacturing other products using recycled newspaper . <p> Recently Kirori and Ochieng graduated from the 2015 Green Pioneer Accelerator programme , which seeks to support businesses involved in mitigating the effects of climate change . The programme offers companies support to scale their operations by getting their strategy and financials in shape , and preparing them for fundraising conversations with a network of over 600 investors . <p> " Next year we will start making crayons , as well as eye pencils used for make-up . There is also opportunity to make road signs . In Kenya road signs are often stolen to resell the metal . Our material is waterproof so we can make road signs no-one will want to steal . " 
@@3400232 <h> Do you have to pay your employees during load shedding ? <p> Commercial law firm , Werksmans Attorneys , has published information about how employers should deal with employees and the loss of productivity as a result of load shedding . <p> The legal firm says that many employers are under the impression that when employees are unable to work due to load shedding the ' no work , no pay ' principle applies . <p> " This is not the case , " the firm said . <p> " Our common and labour laws are clear -- if the employer expects the employees to be at work at a specific time and on a specific day and the employees comply with these requirements , the employer is obliged to pay them for that time . " <p> " This is regardless of whether the employees were able to perform their duties or not . " <p> But this does not mean that employees get a free pass and employers must bear the burden and simply pay up , as there are ways for employers to minimize the impact of these outages on labour costs . <p> According to Werksmans , a strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that apply to interruptions of production -- such as those seen in the metal and engineering industries . <p> It is important that employers and employees understand the serious implications load shedding has on both sides <p> These industries have come to an agreement with employees on how to deal with power down time -- specifically by differentiating between planned and unplanned load shedding . <p> Unplanned load shedding is where Eskom can not with complete certainty inform the public of exactly when load shedding will be implemented ( what Eskom does rather , is inform us of the likelihood of when load shedding may be implemented ) . <p> Planned load shedding is load shedding that occurs at a pre-determined and publicised time and date . <p> In terms of the agreement ( and similar contract ) , where the circumstances are unforeseen or unplanned ( such as unplanned load shedding ) employers may : <p> Elect to send the employees home , provided they shall receive not less than four hours ' work or pay in lieu thereof ; or <p> Expressly instruct employees sent home to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the employees shall receive not less than four hours ' work or pay in lieu thereof . <p> Werksmans points out that most load shedding is unplanned , however , often hitting at random times , and moving to different stages . <p> For most employers , this is highly disruptive , and often ends up with with employees getting sent home , paid for 4 hours of work , even if there was no work done . <p> Other issues that arise relate to workers having to work overtime to make up for lost production ( and employers incurring overtime fees ) , and also cases of ' misconduct ' ( such as arriving late ) as a result of load shedding . <p> " It is clear that load shedding will be with us for some time to come . Employers must be cautious not to contravene labour law requirements during these periods in an effort to reduce the consequences of load shedding , " the law firm said . <p> " It is advisable that employers negotiate a plan to minimise its effect with employees ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load shedding times for training or staff meetings . " <p> Werksmans said it is possible to negotiate an employment contract around remuneration and load shedding ( such as suspending pay when it strikes ) , but this can not be implemented unilaterally if not accepted by employees . <p> " If employees do not agree to changes in working hours , shift structures , pay or any similar measure designed to relieve the burden on employers during load shedding , the employer may be forced to implement retrenchment procedures in terms of sections 189 or 189A of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 , " Werksmans said . <p> There are training opportunities that could be used here , and also things can be done like catching up on filing , tidying up in the workshops , and a thinking employer could use that time well with their staff . <p> Anthony <p> We are talking about more than office workers here . For example a factory worker never does filing and most factories have dedicated staff to keep the place clean <p> Hey MR Bookworm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Filing is best done by admin people when the lights are on . <p> Training in most workshops , actualy require electricity . The average profesional workshop is usually clean , after all it can only be cleaned once . <p> No sir , there is nothing positive about load shedding . <p> Louis Botes <p> Noticed many companies have their employees clock out when load shedding starts . This way they get paid for hours worked only . Seems a legal and viable option . <p> Thinus <p> Eh no .. , Did you read the article ? If you are employed with a basic , certain Hourly rate per day &amp; overtime you have to get your minimum hourly rate regardless of load shedding or a clocking system that for employers with permanent staff only serves to calculate overtime anyway <p> Thinus <p> So here we are , If you want to see this country burn touch the people 's meager salaries because Eskom ca n't keep the lights on . If you have employees &amp; you want them to perform during load shedding GET A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if we want something done during load shedding . <p> bookworm <p> There is still training that can be done with factory workers , stuff to help improve their knowledge and understanding as well as standards of production etc .

As it 's not the most picturesque country it makes for a lot of down time for the players . " You are mostly confined to your hotel , because of the congestion , " said coach Russell Domingo . " You go to some countries and guys can drift off in different directions . There are benefits , especially for us on this trip .

This compared with the $50 ( R620 ) per person per year spent by high income countries . <p> In South Africa , where nearly a quarter of South Africans suffer a mental health disorder at some point in their lives , experts painted a mixed picture . <p> Last year , the country had 0.39 psychiatrists per 100 000 people - up on 2011 , when the figure stood at 0.27 . <p> Cassey Chambers , operations director at the South African Depression and Anxiety Group ( Sadag ) , said that too few health professionals were trained to manage mental illness due to underinvestment by the government and despite the high incidence of mental illness , which affects one in three people in the country . <p> Professor Soraya Seedat , head of the psychiatry department at Stellenbosch University , said even though South Africa was classified as an upper middle-income country , the ratio of mental health professionals was " grossly inadequate and does not mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So many patients living with a mental illness do not have access to treatment facilities , especially in disadvantaged rural areas , " said Chambers . <p> " If a patient does get to a hospital or clinic , it does n't mean that there is a psychiatric ward , or a psychiatrist or trained psychiatric nurse , psychologist or psychiatric medication available to treat the patient .

" <p> The boy described in this extraordinary opening paragraph of the soon-to-be-released biography , Golf 's Lost Legend , by writer Maxine Case , is Papwa Sewgolum -- arguably the finest self-taught golfer to have ever played the game . <p> He did not use a real golf club but a walking stick his fisherman father fashioned from a tree branch . <p> Papwa would accompany his father to the beach near the Beachwood Country Club in Durban . <p> The balls hit onto the nearby beach would be Papwa 's training ground . <p> Although he was known as the man with the wrong grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man of colour to win a provincial open in South Africa , beating the legendary Gary Player in the process . <p> But like all sporting greats who were non-white in apartheid South Africa , Papwa was denied the chance of reaching his full potential . <p> Now Oscar-nominated film producer Rafiq Samsodien wants to tell the untold story of golf 's greatest exponents . <p> Rafiq has the calibre ; the short film Asad , he co-produced , about the plight of Somali refugees , earned an Academy Award nod in 2013 . <p> Rafiq , who commissioned Papwa 's biography , plans to turn his life story into a major feature film . <p> When Rafiq tells the story of Papwa 's first encounters with golf on the beach as a young boy , the imagery he conjures up leaves you with goosebumps . <p> " As a young kid you go with your father wherever he goes on his little escapades . Now you can kind of picture this little kid with his father . <p> " Back in the day , dogs were taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to have a stick to ward off the dogs . The back of the stick was shaped like a golf club , " says Rafiq . <p> " From a distance Papwa used to watch these people playing golf and he took some kind of likeness to it . So all these balls used to come off the course , from hackers like me . <p> " Every day this kid used to take the stick and he used to be able to whack the balls , try and find targets and try and get the distance . <p> " He used to whack this ball from the age of six years old to the age of nine -- every day , from the beach to his home , home to the beach , he played wherever he went . It was him , the stick and the ball . And he started to become better and better at what he was doing . " <p> Papwa 's father recognised a rare talent in his son and approached the country club to see if they would let Papwa work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . <p> Papwa eventually became a caddie . <p> It was working as a caddie that Papwa met Graham Wulff , the chemist and businessman who founded the beauty product Oil of Olay as a gift to his wife . <p> Wulff took an instant liking to the young man and also realised his genius . He often allowed Papwa to play with him in a four-ball at the club -- a move that was against the laws of the day . Wulff became like a father figure , especially because Papwa 's father took ill and died . <p> " At the age of 16 he won his first South African Amateur Open and that set the tone for him . Obviously there were days that he could n't really play on the course but there were people like Graham Wulff who just put him to the challenge and came there with his business partners and they 'd play a four-ball . <p> " Graham would always choose Papwa as his partner . Against the odds , he would break the rules because you know back then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and someone like Papwa could have lost his job . <p> " But what happened was that he started to become amazingly phenomenal . <p> " You know there was this window where he was breaking the non-European records in terms of his wins . " <p> Wulff wanted to give Papwa the chance to compete on the international stage and get a PGA card . But there were hurdles to overcome . " If it was n't for this man 's belief in a guy like Papwa , I do n't think Papwa would have been able to play on the international platform . <p> " What Graham Wulff did was very admirable . At the time that Graham took Papwa to the British Open , was also a time when he was at the cusp of making Oil of Olay an international brand . <p> " He could n't really give as much of his time to Papwa apart from creating the enabling environment by providing the funding and the resources to do that . <p> " Now this is an interesting part : at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his PGA accreditation he bought two tickets and he was told by the South African carrier that they would n't fly black people . <p> " It did n't stop either one of them . I think that 's where the symbiotic relationship kind of emanated from . Both were cut from a different cloth , but yet quite similar in many respects . <p> " So Wulff then goes out and he buys himself an aircraft , a little Cessna and takes Papwa on a journey . " <p> It was 1959 and Papwa would beat Gary Player for the first time in a practice round at Northfield in the British Open . <p> " He gets to play on a level playing field and basically cleans up in the practising round . The fact that , you know , he gets arrested by the South African security police for being there , he arrives late , he still gets to play , but he does n't win , does n't make him less of a champion . " <p> Papwa went on to play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complications the South African security police were causing him . But he entered and won the Dutch Open later that year . <p> He returned to South Africa a hero of non-white sport but he still did n't get acknowledged as a real champion . In 1960 and 1964 he successfully defended his Dutch Open title . <p> But the turning point for Papwa , in more ways than one , was winning the Natal Open for the second time in 1965 and beating Gary Player . The story goes that Papwa had to accept the trophy outside in the rain because he was n't allowed inside the clubhouse . <p> It was clear that Papwa had become too powerful a symbol of the sports boycott movement . At the peak of his powers , the apartheid government banned him from participating in , or attending , any PGA tournaments in South Africa . <p> His passport was taken away and he could no longer compete internationally . In effect , golf was taken away from Papwa and it systematically broke his spirit . <p> After having successfully commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's focus is now on taking the story to the world in a feature film . The only thing standing in his way is funding . <p> " I 'd like to term it one of Africa 's greatest sports stories , it 's the life and challenges of the first non-white person to have ever won an international tournament during the 50s and 60s . <p> " The most amazing thing about this guy is that he was illiterate , he was a self-taught golfer , played golf the wrong way with an unorthodox grip . And you know for him to have used the influences and to have had a technical understanding of the game without anybody teaching him just makes this guy an ultimate genius as far as I 'm concerned . <p> " When I heard about this guy 's story I just thought this a story that needs to be told . It 's been a long and arduous journey for us to get to where we are right now . We started off with getting the rights from the family , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> " This person has been stripped so many times from success , dignity and respect and where his family became the beneficiaries of this injustice . <p> " We just thought that has to stop , you ca n't continually perpetuate this kind of mind-set and behaviour . <p> " We thought this story is so big , we ca n't do it justice with just a documentary . <p> And what an amazing story , that we are marking the 50th anniversary of Papwa beating the great Gary Player . " <p> The project has so far reaped rewards . It has been pivotal in getting Papwa recognised with a plaque on the 18th green at the Durban Country Club . <p> Recently he was also inducted into the South African Golf Hall of Fame . <p> The momentum has also seen the establishment of the Papwa Sewgolum Foundation . On August 27 , Gary Player will be the keynote speaker at a drive in Durban to raise funds for the film and to preview Golf 's Lost Legend . The book is due for release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is an amazing man and nobody knows what he has done . <p> " It was difficult to get to him , to break his spirit . The only way that they could have done that was to prevent him from playing and that was the only kind of level of torment that really broke this guy down . <p> " For me it feels like what we have here is the Rocky of golf . And that 's what we want to focus on . It 's a human drama , backed up against a political canvass . " <p> Rafiq is calling on benefactors far and wide to help him bring Papwa 's story to life on film . <p> " I think what we need to do is not just make this guy recognisable on a national level , we 've got to make this guy recognisable on an international level . <p> " South Africans have played a pivotal role in society , they have contributed to history , geography , science , innovation and a whole host of other things , let alone sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just have to look at these kind of people and Papwa was one of those shinning examples that has done that for golf . <p> " I 'm going to take some creative licence here and say that Tiger Woods was basically the guy that shaped golf and put people of colour on the golf map . <p> " But for me Papwa Sewgolum , is the real Tiger of the Woods . <p> " He 's the first person to have won an international tournament and that 's a historical fact you ca n't take that away from him .

@@3443239 the Zumafication of the SACP can not be practically felt , the effect on Cosatu will be far-reaching <p> In 2005 academic and Young Communist League general secretary Mazibuko Jara wrote a confidential paper entitled , What colour is our flag , red or JZ ? It was a critique of support by the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) for then ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma . <p> Years later , Jara , who is now in the interim leadership of the United Front , must feel vindicated . Time has proved that the blood of the party is indeed JZ , much more than it is red . <p> This week 's events at the Cosatu congress show that the labour federation has also abandoned its raison d ' ? tre in defence of the president of the ANC . <p> The backlash in both these organisations may yet be swift and brutal if they are to remain relevant to post-democratic SA , but that is a subject for another day . <p> The onslaught against axed former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi arose after he began wavering in his once-ardent loyalty to Zuma . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had brought the same fate to those who disagreed with Cosatu backing Zuma during the honeymoon period of that ill-fated matrimony . <p> Irvin Jim was also part of the pro-Zuma grouping that ousted his own predecessor , National Union of Metalworkers of SA ( Numsa ) general secretary Silumko Nondwangu . <p> While the effect of the Zumafication of the SACP can not be practically felt , the effect on Cosatu will be far-reaching as it prioritises palace politics over workers ' issues . <p> Led by Sdumo Dlamini , secure in the knowledge that he triumphed at a congress , Cosatu is ready to move on . He urged unions to " free themselves " from Numsa , passionately luring rebel unions back into the federation fold . <p> For Vavi and Numsa , their course of action is clear . The special Cosatu national congress this week was a test of whether the balance of forces was in their favour . Simply put , it was not . Secret ballot or show of hands -- it would not have made a difference . <p> Vavi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federation . It is a matter of time -- and a keen test of their support will be a march against corruption set to take place next month . <p> After all , SA is only 29% unionised , as Cosatu delegates were told at their special congress . There is room for well-organised , well-run unions that adapt to the economic climate and shift from the confrontational , hostile approach of the past . <p> It is unlikely that Vavi and Jim are the leaders to accomplish . They remain fixated on the tripartite alliance and its shortcomings and , unless they finally let go of their long-held bitterness and move on , they will continue to pay mere lip service to workers ' interests . <p> But what of Cosatu whose signs of decline were clear at the congress ? <p> Jara wrote in 2005 of " moral renewal " through removing the " cult of personality , centralisation of power , intolerance of difference , corruption , the ever-growing social distance between the leaders and the people and anti-poor policies " . Most if not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more broadly within many Cosatu unions . <p> The centralisation of power is clear in the way its central executive committee has become the chorus master for Cosatu 's office bearers , not the workers . <p> The intolerance of difference is clear in the expulsions of dozens of leaders from unions . At the congress , a group of 20 plain-clothes security guards waited in the wings . <p> A friendly member of this group said he and his colleagues were present to keep the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union delegation " in check " , to make sure that it did not " disrupt " proceedings . <p> It was rather odd for a union not to trust its own delegates at a congress of its federation . <p> Social distance between leaders and ordinary workers was also clear . Shop stewards who rose to address the congress complained that Cosatu was fixated on palace politics while worker issues were ignored . <p> Corruption is another festering sore in Cosatu unions but its leaders , and even the Department of Labour , are unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected by federation bosses and the labour minister over questions about its finances . Leaders who are pushing for answers are being increasingly marginalised . <p> A similar scenario is at play in the South African Municipal Workers Union -- . it emerged after union bosses failed to account for about R140-million in workers ' money . The union 's leaders -- who had initially backed Vavi -- shifted allegiance , seeking the protection of Cosatu , which provided it . <p> Still , Cosatu remains important in the alliance -- already there are attempts to draw it into the next ANC succession race . <p> Union bosses were distrustful of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa , who led a party task team to unite the federation , whispering that he intended wooing unions into supporting him in 2017 , when Zuma 's second term ends .

@@3498237 <h> Cheating academics may make students think plagiarism is acceptable <p> Universities are constantly implementing new measures to stop student plagiarism . <p> Students learn how to correctly cite sources and receive copies of the institution 's academic integrity code . <p> They are helped with their academic writing skills , particularly if the language of instruction is not the same as their first language . <p> Lectures about the dangers of plagiarism and the resultant punishments often form part of academic courses . Universities also pay high fees to obtain the licence for software programmes that detect similarity in student work against electronic databases of millions of published articles , student assignments , company documents and the like . <p> These efforts seem to be making little difference , although perhaps the picture would be worse in their absence . Could something else that contributes to student plagiarism but is n't immediately obvious be at play here ? <p> The answer may lie with academics themselves -- and , in some cases , with their own propensity for plagiarism . <p> Academics cheat , too <p> Studies have shown that the incidence of plagiarism is higher in classes where students perceive their lecturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in classes where there is little or no consequence to students for plagiarising and a broader institutional slackness in upholding academic values . Plagiarism also thrives in environments where academics themselves cheat . <p> In a 2012 article , a colleague and I surveyed more than 900 academics at one public university in South Africa . We wanted to find out why academics do n't report student academic dishonesty . <p> The answers suggested that some academics felt personal psychological discomfort because of the unpleasantness involved in taking action against cheaters . Others baulked at the time and effort required to report dishonesty and follow due processes . They weighed this against the time required to work on their own research , which is a crucial determinant for promotion . <p> Some complained that there was n't clarity within the institution about what process to follow when plagiarism is detected . These are valid arguments , but they hardly uphold the integrity of the academy . <p> Of concern , and a possible reason for academics not reporting the dishonesty of students , is that they themselves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in 19 South African management journals . These were submitted through Turnitin , a software programme used to detect plagiarism . <p> The prestigious US-based Academy of Management regards plagiarism of 5% or more as significant . Just over 31% of the articles in our sample contained plagiarised material that we defined as low ( between 1 and 9% ) . Almost 50% of the articles contained high and excessive plagiarism of 15% or more . Some 21% alone fell squarely into the " excessive " category . <p> If academics themselves are plagiarising , it seems likely they 'll ignore students doing the same . But why would academics risk their careers by cheating ? <p> Plagiarism : the risks and costs <p> The answer may lie in the unintended consequences of a government subsidy system . In South Africa , a large source of university income accrues from the subsidy received from the Department of Higher Education and Training for academic publications in what it calls accredited journals . In 2011 , for example , the government allocated R2.2 billion to universities for their research outputs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals the department remits around R120 000 to the university at which the academic author is employed . This means academics are pressurised to publish prolifically and increase the subsidy pot . <p> Rewards to the individual academic are usually substantial , too . These range from income to support research and conference attendance ( and travel ) , social accolades and accelerated promotional opportunities . The edict , " publish or perish " , so often mentioned in jest , holds true in academia today . <p> The problem is compounded when the subsidy to universities is considered in conjunction with plagiarism committed by academics . We calculated that , in one year , the Department paid almost R7 million ( around US$ 546 000 ) to universities for the plagiarised articles we highlighted . <p> Seeking solutions <p> To address integrity in academia , it 's paramount to focus on the integrity of individual academics . They are role models for students . In addition , questions must be asked about a government subsidy system that may , unwittingly , promote cheating through institutional and personal rewards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to continue , it 's essential that the quality of research output is also considered -- not just the quantity . This involves vigilance by both university authorities and journal editors . <p> By Adele Thomas , Professor of Management at University of Johannesburg <p> Interesting , that universities pay huge costs for software like turnitin when its practically worthless , and there lies the problem , schools do nt take the time to research good software , they simply follow the heard towards the highest marketed product ( turnitin ) . I 've been using Quetext.com plagiarism detector lately and if other agencies did the same there would n't be such an issue . <p> Jacobus Pienaars <p> The solution is ages old -- controlled exams . <p> Jacobus Pienaars <p> Actually it will make them think plagiarism is stupid . Just lie about a degree and get a cool job . <p> Rob Charlton <p> Part of the problem is that the quality of teaching staff has fallen as a result of expansion of the number of academic teaching posts . While it might sound good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suitably qualified staff does not exist , standards will perforce fall . Increasingly , professorships are being granted to people who have a business background , and being results-oriented , may not be quite as rigorous about the ( boring and tedious ) work of preventing plagiarism . The Minister of Higher Education makes noise about building universities in remote centres , but says little about sourcing staff for them . <p> Johan <p> " ... contained plagiarised material that we defined as low ( between 1 and 9% ) " . <p> That 's like saying if you shoplifted between 1% and 9% of the value of stock in a shop , it would be classified as low shoplifting . In Turnitin , you can have a high-ish % rating without having plagiarised at all , and a single instance of plagiarism expressed as &lt;1% which could be plagiarism . <p> So , IMHO , academics need to understand what plagiarism is before they express opinions about it . Next , policies should set out exactly what it is , and what the institutional reporting process is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the perpetrator might well be the son of a dean .

@@3505235 <h> AdReview : A memo and the end of an institution <p> by Herman Manson ( @marklives ) Tony Koenderman has cancelled AdReview -- the industry awards show he has been running for nearly 15 years . <p> This follows an internal memo to members of the Association for Communication and Advertising of South Africa which claims that ACA members are unhappy having two " Agency of the Year " award programmes ( the other being The Financial Mail 's AdFocus Awards , now Annual AdFocus Awards , of which Koenderman was also the founding editor ) . <h> Calls into question <p> The memo also calls into question the credibility of the AdReview awards -- without actually talking to Koenderman or inviting him to state his case . <p> The memo to members read as follows : <p> " The phones at the ACA have been ringing off the hook with complaints from the members regarding the AdReview Awards . Most ( a good 80-90% ) of the members are unhappy with the awards program . All the members have expressed concern about two ' Agency of the Year ' award programs and specifically , the credibility of the AdReview awards . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity/venture/program . We only endorse two awards programs in the South African industry , namely the APEX awards that recognise and award communications campaigns ' effectiveness and the Loerie awards that recognise and award creativity . We can therefore not encourage nor discourage participation in the Agency of the Year award programs however , if you are unhappy with the AdReview awards , its credibility and what it represents , take a business decision and do not enter . These programs exist only because agencies support them by entering . No entries = no awards . " <h> Writing about the ad industry since the ' 80s <p> Koenderman has been writing about the advertising industry since the 1980s . AdReview used to be a joint venture between Finweek and Koenderman but , after an internal restructuring in 2011 , AdReview moved into M24 Business magazines , which aligned it with the soon-to-be-closed trade magazine , AdVantage . <p> When Koenderman and AdReview 's paths parted from that of Media24 he , rather bravely , I thought , took his and its destiny into his own hands . <p> Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website takes time to build an audience and publishing a print title takes deep pockets -- Koenderman still managed to stage a credible awards season last year ( whether you enjoyed the actual event or not , the awards process itself is n't suspect ) . Ad Agency of the Year went to Joe Public ( as did the AdFocus " Advertising Agency of the Year " ) . Whether he achieved commercial success is another question . He seemed to abandon any attempt to monetise the awards this year ( no event , no magazine and no entry fees ) . <h> Competing awards events <p> But it 's not his commercial success or business smarts the ACA queried in its memo ; it was holding competing awards events -- which I would argue was done successfully and without much drama for more than a decade -- and the credibility of the programme . That assertion is also open to question as AdReview is judged by clients and agency bosses , same as AdFocus , and audited by an independent auditing firm , same as AdFocus . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after all , it had just sent out an industry wide memo calling AdReview ( and thus Koenderman 's ) credentials into question . To recap the essence of that memo : " All the members have expressed concern about two ' Agency of the Year ' award programs and specifically , the credibility of the AdReview awards . " <p> Koenderman responded with an ( understandably angry ) editorial : " I am appalled that an industry body such as the ACA should seek to stifle competition in the advertising sector , an industry whose very existence depends on unfettered competitive activity . <h> " Unsubstantiated complaints " <p> " On the basis of unsubstantiated complaints about the AdReview Awards , and without giving me right of reply , the ACA 's chief executive , Odette van der Haar has issued a statement maligning the awards and urging members to boycott them because of their alleged lack of credibility . " <p> No , the ACA , did not call for a boycott of AdReview , but a maligning statement it turned out to be , whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalated the exchange , rather than calming it : " Contrary to the perception created by the management of AdReview , the ACA did not make any public statement regarding the AdReview awards . In fact , following a number of telephonic complaints received by the ACA from member agencies , regarding the planned AdReview awards programme , the ACA sent a closed communication to its members , clarifying the point that the ACA chose some years ago not to endorse any third party commercial initiatives targeted at our profession . <h> " Free to decide for themselves " <p> " We also stated in the communication to members that the ACA will neither encourage nor discourage participation in Agency of the Year award programmes and we made it clear that if they were unhappy to participate in the AdReview awards -- for whatever reason -- they are free to decide for themselves if they wished to do so or not . <p> " We therefore vehemently disagree that the ACA has acted in a biased or unfair way towards AdReview . If the management of AdReview have a gripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this directly with each member agency . " <p> The " management of AdReview ? " The ACA must mean the 75-year-old journalist who has spent most of his professional career covering the agency world , building its profile and seeking to award standout agencies . The memo ( and with " internal memo " you need to understand that it 's a memo that reaches the majority of ad agencies in this country ) -- internal or no -- was a very public declaration and the ACA should have foreseen its consequences . <h> Unintended consequences <p> Koenderman had no fight picked with the ACA . He was doing what he had been doing since 2001 , when he launched his first awards show , minus the backing of commercial publishers . If its internal memo had unintended consequences , the ACA should have shouldered responsibility , engaged with Koenderman , and sought to find solutions to any issues members ( and how many does it take to get phones " ringing off the hook " at the ACA -- 3 , 13 , 30 ? ) might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 is much more positive that a few years ago . It feels more open and more engaged , and many of its leaders work actively on engaging with their peers and maintaining positive inter-agency and industry-wide relationships . The energy is fresh and mostly positive . <p> In this instance , the ACA seems out of tune with the broader industry and its dismissal of Koenderman , I mean the " management of AdReview " , not only lacks any humility but also lacks humanity to a man who knows more of our collective history as an industry than anybody I know and who , without question , has dedicated most of his career to offering it coverage in the mainstream media . <p> I just do n't see how this serves the industry or its members . <p> -- MarkLives ' round-up of top ad and media industry news and opinion in your mailbox every Monday and Thursday .

But at the same time , Mosaic , an NGO that seeks to enable South Africans to empower themselves to deal with domestic and sexual violence and abuse , says that many women are getting out of abusive relationships and/or getting help , and that men too are working to reverse the patriarchy in themselves and others . <p> Primrose Tetyana , a Social Auxiliary Worker who has been working with Mosaic for nearly two decades says that the big change she is seeing is that men are now asking for help , " Men now , are coming out and voicing out that they are abusers . " <p> For Gerald Andrews from Eagle Park , a 43-year old recipient of Mosaic 's counselling services , the realisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided she could no longer live with him . " I never thought that she would leave me , " he says , admitting now that he used to abuse her physically and then , verbally . He recounts how he would even start fights with her on purpose so that he could leave the house to have his affairs . " I was a player , " he says , and he said it was when she would accuse him that he would retaliate , " When we had fights , I 'd argue until I 'd win . " <p> Some time after his wife left him , Andrews was in court facing a charge of sexual assault , and says he was ordered by the court to go to counselling . He ended up at Mosaic , and received one-on-one counselling from Veronica Libbie , an assistant manager who also counsels male clients . <p> Andrews says Libbie taught him the tools to control his anger , and to communicate better . " If I think I 'm going to regret what I say , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , explaining that the outcome of an argument he delays having will be " far different than the one I would have had yesterday . " <p> Mosaic counsellors advise clients and those who are experiencing gender-based violence ( GBV ) that they should tell someone they trust what they have experienced so they can get the moral support that they need . The counsellors say that survivors of abuse must draw a line in the sand . " It is important that a woman stands up and says ' enough is enough ' , " says Libbie , " If a woman does n't , then a man will continue ( to abuse her ) . " <p> Sharon Mentor , aged 48 , hit rock bottom before she sought help . She was diagnosed as chemically depressed and says her husband had not only been having an affair , but was doing so in her home , and in front of their children . On top of that , she says he stopped paying the house bond and other primary bills . She says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill herself . <p> A Gauteng study from the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) found that emotional violence is in fact the most commonly reported form of violence , with 43.7% women experiencing and 65.2% men admitting to its perpetration . That same study found that over half the women surveyed ( 51.2% ) have experienced some form of violence ( emotional , economic , physical or sexual ) in their lifetime and 78.3% of men in that province admitted to perpetrating it . <p> Mentor says her son encouraged her to stand up for herself . Somebody recommended her to Mosaic and she started counselling sessions with Maria October , a Social Auxilliary Worker at the organisation . <p> " People like ( the counsellors at ) Mosaic make it easier for us to get power for ourselves , " she says , " It took me a couple of years , but I just said one day ' enough is enough ' and I took the stand for myself .

" <p> Rehse says it 's important that those experiencing violence , abuse and sexual assault know their rights . To help this happen , Mosaic 's 22 Court Support Workers help those seeking protection orders with filling out forms at South African magistrate 's courts and guide applicants through the legal processes . <p> Mtsewu also advises survivors of rape to find a Thuthuzela Care Centre ( TCC ) in their area and to go as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a one-stop sexual assault support centre -- or to a police station so that forensic evidence can be collected in the critical 72 hours following an assault , and so that they can get the support , counselling and medical treatment that they need after trauma , including Post-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PEP ) to help protect them against contracting HIV . <p> Mosaic 's counsellors say it 's important for survivors of violence and abuse to talk , to be listened to , and not to feel ashamed , nor to blame themselves . <p> October says that she urged Mentor to use her diary and look back at it to see when she was down , and when she felt better . " When she came to me , she was all teary . I urged her to be calm , to think about what she wants , " says October .

" With the counselling , he could discuss his hurts from his past and identify that , and also realise that it was n't necessary to be aggressive , " she says , " He 's constantly working on it . There 's definitely a vast change . " Smith and her husband decided to reconcile after she saw that he was no longer abusive or aggressive . Today , he still gets support from a men 's support group at Mosaic , which he participates in along with Andrews . <p> Andrews says that since his wife left him and he started counselling , he realised he 'd been modelling the violent behavior of his late father .

He wants the cycle of violence to end . <p> While Mosaic constantly faces capacity shortages because there is so much demand and need for the support services and counselling that they offer , they encourage all South Africans to find out about their rights , to use the protections that the police , the courts and the law offers them , to access professional counselling services , and to put their safety first . <p> " Everyone has a role to play in ending GBV , " says Rehse , " You can encourage a parent to get support , accompany a friend to the police or a TCC to report a rape and get help , seek counselling if you are a perpetrator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do so safely when you witness violence , visit or call one of Mosaic 's site offices to get support , or go to a magistrate 's court to apply for a protection order .

Mosaic , which is part of a group of South African NGOs calling for a comprehensive national strategic plan to end GBV , says that South Africa can end the cycles of violence that are killing and hurting South Africans at epidemic rates if citizens and government take real action . <p> This Sunday on Women 's Day and throughout Women 's Month , Mosaic calls on South Africans to learn about their rights , to reach out for help , and to do what they can to end abuse and to help themselves and those around them . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@3514234 <h> From music to making : how one entrepreneur built a business out of fun <p> Around the turn of the millennium , Bertier Luyt was a relatively successful producer of dance music in his native France . But with the rise of Napster , iTunes and -- later -- streaming services , the music industry gradually got tougher and less lucrative , and Luyt 's business suffered to the point that he was left unemployed . <p> For about five years Luyt worked as a freelance on decoration work for events , and helped out on renovation projects . <p> Then he discovered 3D modelling . After starting his own interior design business in 2005 and using SketchUp to show clients his ideas . Today , he 's a highly successful entrepreneur and has found worldwide fame as the founder of Le FabShop , France 's answer to the US chain The Tech Shop . Partly a community of ace designers , partly a 3D print on demand and partly an importer and retailer of maker gear . <p> Luyt got the idea for Le FabShop at New York World Maker Faire in 2011 , and went on to organise Mini Maker Faires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa to speak at Maker Conference 2015 , which takes place in Cape Town next week . <p> 3D printing your logo is the new black <p> htxt.africa : For those who have never made anything and have absolutely no interest in becoming a maker , what would you say to them to get them involved ? <p> Bertier Luyt We say everybody is a maker ! It 's a human thing to make , be that be cooking , writing , woodworking or building robots . It only takes someone to admit he is a maker , whatever he likes doing . What define Makers from the rest of the world is not only the fact that they like doing something , but they want to share it , meet people with the same kind of interest , learn from them , teach them . Meeting the community can happen online on dedicated websites , reading magazine , joining groups/clubs/non-profits , going to local hacker / maker spaces or FabLab , and participating into events such as Maker Faire or other Makers inspired activities . The best thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for you to get involved in the maker community as a self-educated individual ? <p> As a self-educated individual , I had the chance to choose what I wanted to learn , most of what it takes is find the good sources to learn from . After teaching myself 3D modelling in the early 2000 's , I started an interior design practice and a wood working workshop with my wife . I first discovered the Maker Movement online , looking for informations to build my first CNC machine . <p> I found some dedicated websites where different people shared their experiences building their own machines . On the forums , I could ask questions about materials , software , best practice and loopholes ! <p> At first you can be intimidated asking questions , but it 'd proven to always be rewarding ; the communities I had the chance to meet with were always very kind with sharing their knowledge . In fact , I mostly met curious , generous , smart , optimistic , sharing and caring people in the makers communities . A few months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own experiences with new people interested into building their machine . <p> Then I had the chance to attend my first Maker Faire in New York , where I met some people I had talked to before on different websites , and they were as nice in real life as they were online . It 's a great feeling to finally be able to meet people you 've been inspired from , and have the opportunity to thank them in person . <p> As someone who has already achieved it , what advice would you give to makers looking to turn their hobby into a profession ? <p> Zero to Makers is the state of those who want to make something , kids and adults . They will join a local club , read a magazine and go to events to get into it . <p> Makers to Makers is what happens when Makers meet together at a local fablab , a makerspace or a Maker Faire .

Some makers projects will find a lot of support in the community , and a lot of reach on their website , forums and social media . Either it 's the original idea to go to market or it 's by public demand that their passion will turn into a business . <p> We have the chance to live an extraordinary era for turning a hobby or a passion into a profession and take control of our life . Today with very little money it 's possible to prototype an idea , find its community , get funding and start a business . Online tools , open source software , cheap prototyping electronics , desktop manufacturing and 3D printing machines , crowdfunding website such as Kickstarter , social media are almost free today , all it takes is a computer and an internet connection . <p> At my company , we can have an idea in the morning , make a 3D model before lunch , print it in 3D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the day and share it to our community on social media . On the next day , we have enough feedback to know if it 's worth investing more into developing the original idea . <p> Bertier and his team are passionate about the Maker scene <p> With your experience , what can you say to those looking to create their own maker events and Faires ? <p> Advert <p> Organizing a makers ' event or a Maker Faire is always a very rewarding experience . While looking for makers , you will meet great people , original characters of all kinds . Organizing the event will take a lot from you but it will bring twice as more . During the event you will be granted a lot of smiles and laughter from the audience who discover the makers and their projects . Usually it 's a good opportunity to meet with press , officials and local entrepreneurs . If done well , the makers and the audience will be grateful and they will want you to do it again next year . <p> You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen anything that they have in common , regardless of their location ? <p> One of the common traits of Maker Faire and makers events around the world is the optimistic feeling . Something I learned over the year is that Maker Faire is a cool place for smart people , but also a safe place to talk to strange people ! Makers are usually very interesting but also curious about what you make , what you bring to the event . <p> At these events there is a vibrant feeling of intelligence , creativity , fun , and optimism . Because we 're smart , because we care , because we share , there are no challenges this community can not take . Young makers inspire kids to make something , makers sharing what they do with visitors unlock mental blockage and show it 's easy to start making . <p> Finally , what 's common to all these events is the spark in the eyes of the crowds , the smiles on the faces of the kids and their parents , the excitement of discovering new and creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker events and communities between developed countries and developing ones , such as South Africa ? <p> I am very lucky to have been invited to Cape Town for the first Maker Faire in South Africa . I can only imagine what local makers will bring to the show . I 've seen different projects from Africa in the last three to four years , notably a 3D printer from Senegal if my memory is correct , made of recycled computer parts , and several prosthetic projects . It seems to me that the scarce resources force makers to be more creative , more careful . I do n't expect much differences in the event itself , but I am curious of local makers culture , creativity and originality . <p> South Africa ( and a few other countries besides America ) produces a lot of its own maker resources . There are local businesses that make and sell their own designs of 3D printers and maker boards . How do you think this influences the local maker scenes when there are already established , foreign resources ? <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great about it is , it 's open for opportunities . Open source software , open source hardware and communities are what fuel the Maker Movement . I see more inspiration than competition , one innovation bring ten more . Some will prefer to buy a board from the original creator abroad , others will be able to make locally their own iteration , both will inspire people to make something on their own . <p> In Bertier 's eyes , we are all Makers <p> Making is , by definition , extremely open and free to use . Do you think that , as it becomes more commercialised and successful , making will become more closed off , regulated and controlled ? <p> Of course making is a human thing , but it needs tools , it needs support and documentation . Making is not only a movement it 's a market too . A few months ago in 2015 the Guardian estimated that makers are worth billions of dollars in the UK only . <p> In 2013 , the consultancy company Deloitte wrote a report on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that not only the makers are a market or provide the market , but their creative minds , their original ways to iterate change corporate innovation , and accelerate products development . <p> More and more companies start new programs such as Open Innovation for example . Research and development is no longer the privilege of said department , but innovation can come from every other department of the company . Open culture bring competitive companies to collaborate on projects together . It accelerates prototyping and brings products to the market faster . <p> Since every one is a maker , I am not afraid of regulation or control . We already see big companies , not involved in the community using makers ' codes , I call it " Maker-washing " , I am more concerned with this , because it does n't benefit the community . <p> What new development in making excites you the most right now ? <p> There are so many exciting things going on everywhere you look . In our speciality , the future of making things is fascinating with changes in design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very curious of bio hack labs , they are blooming all over the world , facing challenges in renewable energies , sustainable agriculture , or medicine . Of course robotics and drones in particular are really hot right now , there are so many new usages for these in our society : protect wild life , plant trees , cargo medicine and deliveries to remote places ... <p> I wait for my Pancake Bot . Miguel the maker behind this project first showed it at Maker Faire over two years ago . It was a Lego kit for making fun pancakes for his daughter 's breakfast . Last year he came to Maker Faire Paris with an advanced prototype . Early 2015 he ran a successful crowdfunding campaign . Now he is about to launch production .

With justice still elusive three years after the massacre , the families are n't confident , but their lawyers are .

The families also claim the police acted negligently and the Marikana Commission heard many points that could prove their case . They also want a formal apology from the police minister . <p> " This civil suit should be unnecessary . The Marikana Commission of Inquiry spent more than two years establishing what was already clear in video and media footage : the SAPS are responsible for causing these deaths .

@@3514240 <p> The Artscape Theatre foyer was alive with strains of song and story on the eve of the Women 's Day long weekend as women of Cape Town gathered to celebrate a remarkable new book that was , quite literally , hot off the press . A framed copy of Being a Woman in Cape Town : Telling Your Story edited by Nancy Richards and Carol du Toit was presented to Richards at the event . The well-known radio journalist brought about the formation of Woman Zone , an NPO working to connect the women of Cape Town , three years ago . Now this has lead to the publication of this book , a collection of first-person narratives by 13 local women . The aim of the organisation is to allow women to share their stories , and this book is a wonderful artifact of this . <p> The event took place at the Women 's Library -- the first of it 's kind in the city -- and formed an exciting part of the Artscape Women 's Humanity Arts Festival . Richards ' vision for Woman Zone , bringing women together to share their personal stories in order to understand one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the making of this book celebrated the healing power of narrative , made concrete on the beautiful pages of the book . <p> The event began with an introduction by Artscape Theatre 's CEO , Marian Jacobs . She spoke of the women leaders present in the audience who had shaped her life , influenced her thinking , burped her colicky babies and inspired her with their own narratives of courage and determination . <p> She welcomed to the event Mary Burton , founder of the Black Sash . Her book , The Black Sash : Women for Justice and Peace , was launched the day before . Jacobs shared a hilarious account of how she met Burton , while standing in her bra and panties in a gym change room . She also made special mention of that veteran activist and writer , Sindiwe Magona . <p> " So many women make major impressions in the world , but they keep their feet on the ground , " Jacobs said . She then told the audience how one of South Africa 's great female leaders helped her look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who explained that my baby had colic and she jiggled my child to sleep ! " <p> In the same way , she praised Marina Petropoulos , who also came to her aid as a new mum . " Despite the fact that I was a paediatrician , I knew nothing about babies . I called Marina . She coached me through breastfeeding and motherhood . " <p> Ramphela then took her place at the microphone . She spoke about the March to Parliament in 1956 , and asked , " What will we , as African women , contribute to a global movement ? We can say , ' We are the majority . Our voice is strong . ' We have so much to contribute because certain strengths , values and characteristics only we can bring to a social relationship . " <p> " Why are n't we leveraging this power ? " Ramphela continued , " Imagine if we were to bring the power of our voices as poets , writers , cleaners , professors . Imagine if we did this across the generations , looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space where women could claim their power and exercise their voices in the text of the book . <p> Richards then spoke about Woman Zone , reflecting on how part of the work of the organisation was to reduce the gaps and divisions in the city by bringing people together to share their stories . Richards had the pleasure of introducing Magona , and said that her book Mother to Mother had been a powerful inspiration in her own life . <p> Addressing the many storytellers in the room , Magona said : " It takes courage to tell your story because sometimes you talk about things you 'd rather hide . It takes a lot of courage to open your heart . But since you 've started , do n't stop . You could be addicted to worse things than writing ! " <p> Magona reflected on the importance of leaving the world in a better state than we inherited it , and challenged women to step up to the plate in this respect . " Now , we have a brand new country . What are we doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who marched in 1956 . We are n't being asked to march now , but there are still issues needing to be addressed .

Eventually she said to me in a fury , ' At first we were oppressed by white people . Now we are oppressed by people who look just like us . ' We all have a big lesson to learn as South Africans : evil is not colour-coded . " <p> Richards expressed her gratitude for each contributor who had given their work to the project so generously .

@@3520231 <h> Social media danger video goes too far <p> Washington - Late one night , a van pulls up to a small house in a sleepy suburban neighbourhood . <p> The home 's door opens and a 14-year-old girl comes outside . She 'd met a boy on Facebook just a few days before and they 'd chatted . His brother could drive , he 'd told her . He could come meet her if she wanted . <p> Thinking her own parents were out on a date night , the girl agreed . When she opened the van 's door , a man told her he was her friend 's brother and her friend was in the back seat . " Get in , " he said . <p> She obliged . <p> Suddenly two strangers in skeleton masks grabbed her from behind , pinning her to the seat . The man at the wheel pulled on her arm and pawed at her hair . She was screaming at the top of her lungs and struggling with all her might . <p> What she did n't know is that her own parents were behind the horrendous kidnapping , pawing and pinning , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , there is nothing scarier than this . And as adults , we all know how easily it can start on social media . With new platforms popping up daily , the wealth of personal information online and the easygoing , carefree way you can talk to friends , family and strangers at any time of day or night , it 's a perfect fit for those kids old enough to crave a social outlet . And given you can find anyone willing to talk about any topic , it makes even the dreariest teenage days pass by painlessly . <p> The dangers of this virtual world are stark , particularly when they cross over into real life , and most teenagers simply ca n't grasp how easily they can be manipulated or fooled into believing the person on the other end of the screen is a friend , when really he or she is a predator . Parents may feel like they can talk about it until they are blue in the face , but guidance can only go so far , and most kids believe intrinsically that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Until they are in a van , getting groped and threatened by strangers . <p> And what can we do to stop this , to help our kids make good choices ? I 'll tell you what we should n't do , at least . We should n't be the " strangers " in that van , like the parents of the young girl at the start of this piece . <p> In a video-taped social experiment , Coby Persin contacted three sets of parents about letting him friend their daughters on Facebook , pretending to be someone he was n't . He was to talk to the girls for a few days , then get them to agree to meet him . When they did , their parents jumped out and scolded them . <p> The video is being heralded as a mark of good parenting , a solid tactic for teaching young teens a lesson about stranger-danger . But the only lesson here that I can see those girls learning is that they can never trust their parents again . That those who are closest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you look at child predation data , is sadly true ) . <p> And that while they are n't allowed to talk to strange boys on the internet , it is perfectly okay for their parents to share their anguish , tears , sorrow , humiliation and stupidity online for millions of strangers to view at any time . <p> The parents in the video all said at some point , " What if something happened to you ? " <p> Something did happen to them , particularly the last girl which is where this video really goes off the rails . She was assaulted . She went through the same emotion , same fear and same shutdown as if she 'd actually been kidnapped . That can be traumatising to anyone , let alone a child . She thought it was real . Her own parents allowed her to scream and writhe and fight for her life to teach her a lesson . Sounds like a great way to give a child post-traumatic stress disorder , to me . Shock tactics are bad parenting , an admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that will be irreparably damaged with a stunt like this . <p> View the video . Some readers may find it disturbing . <p> It is a parent 's job to be trusted , implicitly and without question , by their kids . As parents , we would like to trust our kids , but it is not their job to be trustworthy . It is their job to learn how to be trustworthy . ( And do n't forget their brains are n't fully developed in terms of decision making . ) Adults should already be there . Taking away that bridge does nothing but harm the child and harm the relationship you 've spent so long trying to build . All while being complicit in unnecessary trauma . <p> Instead of scaring your kids straight about social media with the aid of some guy trying to go viral , why not have the tough conversations about social media and strangers that you need to have . Not lectures and this-could-happen-to-you type stuff , but real-world stuff . Take them on a tour of your own Facebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell them about what you did about it . If you 've been hurt by an online relationship , tell them about that , too . It 's about building real trust with the real people your children are becoming , not shouting hollow platitudes at them and snatching their phones away in the back of some dude 's van while he films it . <p> The experiment here simply goes too far . The point would still get across if you simply " found " the messages and dictated punishment accordingly . And given how important social media monitoring was to these parents , it would n't be out of bounds for them to do random checks on device usage , right ? <p> What is out of bounds ? Assaulting or traumatising your own kid . Then sharing it with millions of strangers to teach her not to talk to strangers . <p> Washington Post <p> * Darlena Cunha is a freelance writer ; she blogs at Parentwin and can be reached on Twitter @parentwin . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small triangle appears on the right-hand side .

@@3520233 <h> Related News <p> It 's undeniably beautiful , but the eerie , uncanny calm in the fictional Shropshire village of Yaughton portents a running theme ; one of sadness . It all starts innocuously enough . For whatever reason -- it 's never explicitly stated -- you 're caught in the little holiday village , one that 's bereft of life , and it seems that it up to you to figure out why its inhabitants have upped and vanished . Your own footsteps serve as the only sign of living humanity . <p> Games of this sort have pejoratively been called " walking simulators , " and this one most closely fits that bill . There 's honestly very little that you actually do other than walk . There 's a button to interact with things , but the only items you 're able to interact with are doors and gates -- and the telephones and radios strewn across the village , each filling in some of the story 's blanks . There 're no " insert object X in to object Y style puzzles , " and no conundrum to really solve . All you do , in effect , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to fragments of the past , told to you by ephemeral , ethereal bits of spectral , liquid light as they recount the past . <p> This is where Everybody 's Gone to the Rapture really shines . As you walk about you 'll encounter glimmering blobs of light that beg for you to follow them , revealing bits of the major story arch , uncovering the strange entity that 's perhaps caused the epidemic of the unknown sickness that led to the village being quarantined , and why there 's nobody left . It 's a little more Sci-Fi than its Christian nomenclature might suggest , cribbing relentlessly from the work of prolific British Sci-Fi authors ( whose books can be seen within the game ) . <p> While the story , frankly , ends up going nowhere , it 's the interactions between the villagers -- the human stories that emerge when people are dealing with catastrophe that become the most intriguing , driving aspects . The writing and the voice acting that relay these fleeting bits of narrative are superb , giving real insight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mundane , everyday stuff . It 's a beautiful look at humanity , at how people are flawed and fickle . It perhaps even raises important existential questions , and might make you wonder how you 'd cope in a crisis , or whether there 'd be any point in even trying . <p> Special credit needs to be given to The Chinese Room 's Jessica Curry . As the dramatic tension of each chapter ramps up , the music hits an intense , orchestral crescendo -- sometimes accompanied by Celtic vocal arrangement that are very much my favourite thing about the entire experience , seconded by the incredible attention to detail , and the care with which this village was brought to digital life . Everything is exquisitely , and painstakingly detailed , the art-style and the technology coming together to create a wonderfully realised , authentic and believable village . <p> As a game though , it falls a little flat , with an oddly slow pacing that 's exacerbated by the snails-pace your character walks at . Much ado has been made about the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait your character trundles around at -- it 's still unbearably slow . It 's very probably intentional ; meant for you to soak up all of the sights and sounds of the quant little village and the minutiae that lies in the details , but it works against the game . Eventually , I found myself not wanting to stray from the beaten path , lest I spend another hour crawling along to find my bearings . <p> It overstays its welcome too . Games of this sort are n't usually particularly long , making them more engaging than they ought to be , but this one , as it drags you along its guided narrative can take 6 hours to complete -- and even more if you 're bored enough to examine every nook and cranny of its superbly realised world . <p> And as good as the writing was for most of the game , the last speech , the one that 's meant to tie it all together comes across as the poorly-scribbled pretentious prose of a teenaged Stephanie Meyer . Much of what happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- for better or worse . As much as I enjoyed bits of the game , its conclusion and the vehicle through which they were delivered were utterly boring . Everybody 's Gone to the Rapture is n't a game for everyone , and it certainly is n't for me , though I wanted very much to love it . <h> Share this : <h> Conclusion <p> Like Journey , it 's the sort of game that works as a sort of blank slate on which to project your own feelings of loneliness , loss , unease , and perhaps even peace -- but as much as I tried , I found no such emotional connection . No sorrow , no joy ... just nothing . <p> 6.0 <p> Everybody 's Gone to the Rapture review was reviewed by Geoffrey Tim on a PlayStation 4 <p> I 'm old , grumpy and more than just a little cynical . One day , I found myself in possession of a NES , and a copy of Super Mario Bros 3 . It was that game that made me realise that games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - they were capable of being masterpieces . I 'm here now , looking for more of those masterpieces .

" <p> They mean that I will find a copy in a second hand bin very quickly . <p> Martin du preez ( D4RKL1NGza ) <p> It 's a digital only game so unless you buy a 2nd hand Ps4 with the game on you wo n't get it 2nd hand also I have no friends <p> konfab <p> ; ; <p> oh well , I will wait for it to appear on PS+ in two years time <p> tjsmoke63 <p> I enjoyed the game a bit more than you did , as I did find emotional connections to the characters and I liked the story 's conclusion as I feel it does make you think and with it being ambiguous it can certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt that the walking was too slow , and holding down the R2 button to sprint did make movement faster , though it took some time to build up . I finished my first playthrough in a little over 4 1/2 hours , but I 'm sure I missed something along the way as I did n't trigger many trophies in my time with the game . You are right that it 's not for everyone , and how much people like it is going to be very subjective . I do understand your points in your review , even if I do n't necessarily agree with them . I do think it 's a game everyone should at least try at some point , if only for the story , great voice acting , beautiful visuals and great music , even if they wait until it 's free on PS+ .

@@3520235 <p> Pressure cookers have come a long way since those hissing , spluttering and sometimes exploding machines our grandmothers may have used . <p> Today 's pressure cookers are safe and easy to use . Because they work best with cheaper cuts of meat , which cook in a third of the time to stove-top cooking , they are very cost efficient and time saving . <p> Electric pressure cookers are even easier to use as they can be pre-programmed for specific times , then they automatically switch off and keep the contents warm until required . <p> HOW THEY WORK <p> A pressure cooker looks like a large pot , except that its lid locks on to the top , forming a tight seal . <p> The cooking liquid inside the pot boils and creates steam . As the steam is trapped inside , the pressure builds , which in turn increases the boiling point of the liquid to about 120 ? C. Because of this high temperature , the food cooks much faster . <p> TIPS FOR USE <p> * Do n't fill the pot more than two-thirds full , as you need to leave room for the steam to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Use enough liquid to be able to create the steam inside the pot . <p> * Because evaporation does n't take place when cooking casseroles , you will use less liquid than the recipe states . <p> * Always brown meat and chicken in the pot before introducing the pressure . <p> * Always follow the manufacturer 's instructions . <p> * Make sure that all the pressure has been released before opening the lid . <p> * If you need to rapidly cool the pressure cooker in order to stop the cooking process , place the pot under a tap and run cold water over it until the pressure is released . <p> * Most pressure cookers have a little valve which pops up when the steam is built up and goes flat when the pressure inside has been released .

The vitriol that flowed following the Boks ' home defeat against Argentina was disgraceful . <p> The personal attacks were disgusting . Accusations ranged from racism to provincialism to the Bok coach even being anti-English . What an insult to a man who lives for rugby and being South African . <p> Meyer , regardless of whether he continues as Bok coach , is a good man and passionate about wanting only the best for the Springboks . <p> Which does n't necessarily mean his selections have been the best for Springbok rugby . <p> The abuse , though , said more of the rugby supporter than it did of the coach . Transformation , in Meyer 's three years , has never been trumpeted as a failing of the coach . No politician , especially the minister of sport , has condemned Meyer and his Boks in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dressed in a Bok jersey and loves to publicly tell the boys in green-and-gold to " moer hulle " . <p> The South African Rugby Union ( Saru ) executive , at least publicly , has not been at war with the national coach because of what it perceives to be a lack of transformation . <p> But every World Cup year it becomes a Bok black player numbers game , especially when the Boks lose . Who would want to coach the Boks ? <p> Meyer wants to and those within the Saru executive want him to continue for another four years . This time a year ago I heard for the first time that Meyer had been offered an extension without the condition that his team has to win the World Cup . I endorsed the thinking , it reflected calm and clarity . <p> The Boks were in good shape in terms of Meyer 's evolution as Bok coach . They had finally beaten the All Blacks 27-25 at Ellis Park and SA under-20 captain and world junior player of the year Handr ? Pollard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Johannesburg . <p> Then in November the wheels came off in Dublin against Ireland . A year ago a rugby case could comfortably be made for Meyer 's contract extension . He had finally broken the All Blacks bogey and his winning record was in excess of 70% . <p> The goal of any premier rugby nation has to be a semifinal because from thereon in it 's a lottery that can be decided by inept officiating , a brain implosion from a player , a prejudiced red card , a charge down , an intercept , or a moment of madness from one 's team or one of brilliance from the opposition . <p> Meyer said on his appointment four years ago he wanted the Boks to be a team that won on Saturdays and won between World Cups . He did n't want a Bok team whose only focus was the potential of a World Cup win . He spoke of being ranked No1 in the world , of not losing at home and winning consistently overseas . He wanted to be judged on results and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Boks , in four years , have not won a Rugby Championship . They 've lost three times in Johannesburg against the All Blacks , not won in New Zealand and lost to Australia , Ireland Wales and Argentina . <p> Meyer 's tenure still includes the World Cup and if his team makes the semifinal , final or wins it , the rugby argument changes . What does n't is the social dynamic of transformation and any Bok coach 's understanding of transformation . Meyer has done himself no favours with regards to black player representation , but it is n't out of racism , malice or a disregard for the merits of the black player . <p> When in doubt , like so many before him , he has found comfort with what he knows -- white rugby players . It 's not right and it 's not wrong but in the context of South African rugby it 's not acceptable . <p> Meyer , like his predecessors , including the first black Bok coach Peter de Villiers , is a man whose expertise is coaching rugby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it is expected the Bok coach must lead transformation . It is unfair and unrealistic . He needs to understand transformation and the custodians of the game need to lead transformation . <p> De Villiers , at the 2011 World Cup , failed black representation as much as Meyer has , yet De Villiers would argue , as would Meyer , that the white-dominated 2011 quarterfinal team was the best on merit . <p> South African rugby , like our nation , is complex . There is no simple solution and there never will be a quick fix . <p> Rugby decisions need to be challenged and there has not been enough from a rugby perspective for Meyer 's four-year tenure to be translated -- unchallenged -- into eight years . Meyer 's predecessors have achieved more and have been offered less in terms of continuity . Meyer needs a big World Cup to justify any continuation .

It brings youth , music and technology together in a completely new way ... <p> Called ' SoundBite ' , it 's an in-store customer experience that makes use of new technology so KFC customers can listen to music through the palm of their hands . All they need to do is press their elbows down on a design etched onto the table in the KFC store . <p> We found out more about the KFC Music Concept from Managing Director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather South Africa 's Digital Creative Portfolio , Ben Evans ... <h> 1 . Everything 's digital at the moment . What prompted the decision to go with digital in a different way for this activation ? <p> Ben Evans <p> Evans : We fundamentally believe that digitally integrated experiences are right for targeting the youth market . KFC have been progressive partners in considering new ways to use technology to engage and deliver against their business objectives . <p> Their open-minded view of bringing innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to create excitement around the KFC brand . <p> We see a gap between the digitalisation of the consumer and the general level of investment that brands are putting into the medium . This activation forms a small but important part in our view of a holistic ' KFC to customer ' relationship . <h> 2 . What went into creating a first-of-its-kind ' record table ' and how exactly does the sound travel up users ' arms ? <p> Evans : The core idea is not technology , technology just allows us to deliver this first-of-its-kind experience . Ultimately , our insight into the core youth audience is that they enjoy local music and , combined with this , we found that many local artists are talented but struggling to get a break with a traditional record label . So we combined these insights to form the idea of using our own tables to play local music on . <p> The technology we used then allowed us to create a highly engaging experience that we felt customers would not only love , but also talk to others about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions from consumers has been very positive . We ultimately adapted technology that is already on the market for other commercial uses to support our idea . With our own twist and additions , this became the ' record table ' . These beautifully designed table services were designed specifically to appeal to the target audience . <p> Behind the design and how it works - we have innovative ' bone technology ' driving the sound delivery . This cleverly passes sound waves/minute vibrations up the arms of the listener and into their ears - without the need for headphones . The sound is converted to vibrations . When you put your elbows on the speaker the vibrations transfer into your arms , traveling through the bone and flesh when you put your hands on your ears the vibrations travel into the ears vibrating the eardrums , just like any other sound . You can put the speakers on anything - windows , desks , etc. - and it will turn it into a speaker . <p> Then , the electronic ink was used on the tables to avoid clunky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interact with the illustrations . All the electrical engineering was done in-house and it was through interactive experimentation and tenacity that we managed to deliver this finished result . Making experiences that have never existed before is never easy , but is a challenge that we have a history of delivering on . A true collaboration between designers , technical developers , creative story tellers , project managers and strategists. <h> 3 . How exactly does the sound travel up users ' arms ? <p> Evans : I can only tell you what we have researched - sound is converted to vibrations when you put your elbows on the speaker the vibrations transfer into your arms travelling through the bone and flesh when you put your hands on your ears the vibrations travel into the ears vibrating the eardrums , just like any other sound . You can put the speakers on anything - windows , desks , etc. - and it will turn it into a speaker . <p> The table in action ... <h> 4 . Does the issue of copyright/trademark ever come into something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign ? <p> Evans : The way we have combined these technologies is unique to KFC , but is not protected via a copyright . All the content played on the tables is shareable if a customer places their cell phone on the table and links using KFCs in store Wi-Fi network . This content has been cleared of copyright by the artists and sharing is encouraged as this is our intended distribution network . <h> 5 . Why launch this with KFC in Bloem as opposed to a city like CT or JHB - what was the research process ? <p> Evans : Bloem is one of KFC 's flagship stores - where there is a large local youth audience and where KFC enjoys testing innovation . We are planning to roll out the technology into other stores nationally . <h> 6 . Makes sense .

There has also been an appreciation from customers that KFC have created a way to help local artists - and at the same time making an experience that connects with them as young consumers .

But eminent Australian physiologist Michael Ashenden , who has made the fight against doping his life 's work , has been left in no doubt that athletics has a widespread problem . <p> Fellow Australian anti-doping expert Robin Parisotto , who also worked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had I seen such an alarmingly abnormal set of blood values . " <p> Just when a global audience should be marvelling at the feats of the athletes , rumour and innuendo about doping has overshadowed everything on the track . <p> The response of the International Association of Athletics Federations ' ( IAAF ) has been curious ; they have come out fighting to defend their sport . British politician and former track and field athlete Sebastian Coe , who hopes to be elected as the body 's new president tomorrow , has described it as a " declaration of war " , dismissing Ashenden and Parisotto as " so-called experts " . <p> The response was utterly baffling from Coe -- a figure who has been strongly outspoken against drug cheats in the past and who wants an independent anti-doping body to be set up to tackle and speed up the action taken against doping misdemeanours . <p> Last week , Ashenden wrote an eye-catching and at times emotive 2 000-word open letter to Coe to address his remarks . He said : " Does the IAAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication that athletes adopt in their pursuit of winning ? Based on what I saw in the leaked database , my view is no . " <p> One only has to look at the IAAF 's current spending to see that not enough is being done . Its annual outlay on anti-doping is ? 1.3 million ( R26.2m and almost double that if staff and litigation costs are included ) -- in contrast to the ? 6m spent by cycling , which has a far smaller pool of people to test . <p> Admittedly , in cycling much of that budget comes from the teams , but the IAAF do not have that same option and are often dragged down by poor national federations -- Jamaica and Kenya being two examples of those who have been given their come-uppance by the World Anti-Doping Agency . <p> But the IAAF whistle-blower was someone who felt not enough was being done to tackle the problem of drugs . One insider made it clear that money and manpower would be thrown at the issue whether it is Coe or former Ukrainian pole vaulter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only other candidate , who is elected president in Beijing , " since the credibility of the sport depends on trust " . <p> If elected , Coe has pledged $100 000 over four years to each of the 214 national federations thanks to the reserve of money built up during Senegalese former athlete Lamine Diack 's tenure as president . <p> Since his " declaration of war " pronouncement , Coe has been less all-guns-blazing , rightly describing the fight against doping as one the sport ca n't afford to lose while also raising his personal fears that American sprinter and Olympic gold medalist Justin Gatlin could become the star of the World Championships . Gatlin has served two doping bans . <p> At every World Championship , the men 's 100m is the central attraction , but this year 's race also summarises the problems athletics faces : a sort of good-versus-evil tussle between Jamaican Usain Bolt , the sport 's shining star , and Gatlin , a two-time convicted doper . <p> There are those who believe Gatlin gets too much flak for the ills of doping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same story over the failed tests : that the first in 2001 was a result of medication for attention deficit disorder and the second -- five years later -- came from a rogue masseur rubbing testosterone cream into his legs . <p> With his past and the fact that , aged 33 , he is faster than he was when winning the Olympic and world sprint titles in 2004 and 2005 , a question mark remains -- more so should he win a sprint treble at Beijing 's Bird 's Nest stadium , which on paper looks perfectly plausible . <p> He argues he has refined his technique and that his athletic age is six or seven years less than his real age because of the time he spent out of the sport serving his bans . <p> Some say athletics relies too much on Bolt , but it is certainly the case that it needs him now more than ever . Indications are that he is getting back to his best form -- his consistency at last month 's Anniversary Games in London is proof of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.7 seconds in practice . <p> Overall though , the sense is that things are going to get worse before they get better when it comes to doping allegations . <p> The British 800m runner Lynsey Sharp made a valid point in the wake of the IAAF 28 and the potential re-allocation of medals .

@@3526230 Business of gender equality <p> Leading from the top , forging alliances , flagging sexist practices , and providing training to help female journalists tackle ' cybermisogyny ' are important steps being undertaken globally in an effort to achieve real progress in the struggle for gender equality and women 's empowerment in newsrooms , reports Julie Posetti . <p> Women are still dramatically under-represented behind editors ' desks , so the appointment of Katharine Viner as The Guardian 's first female editor in chief had women journalists across the globe fist-pumping in the direction of the glass ceiling . <p> Viner , who replaced Alan Rusbridger in May , is The Guardian 's 12th editor , and the first woman at the helm since the paper was established in 1821 . She is also the only female editor of a ' quality ' UK daily newspaper . <p> Her appointment followed the ascent of Minton Beddoes to the editorship of The Economist . <p> There are decades of research -- industry and academic -- that confirm the appallingly low presence of women in senior media management and editorial positions , and the poor , stereotypical representation of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makes the News project shows that women constitute a mere 24% of news sources . And a global study by the International Women 's Media Foundation ( IWMF ) shows that women make up only 36% of reporters and a quarter of media decision-makers . Other studies have revealed a growing gender gap in access to , and ownership of , online platforms . And in some countries , recent gains are being eroded . <p> South African journalist and researcher Dr Glenda Daniels released a report late in 2014 on the State of the Newsroom in her country , which indicates a decline of approximately 9% in the number of women holding editor in chief positions on major South African titles since 2013 . <p> We 've been waiting 20 years for real change <p> It 's 20 years since an historic UN conference in Beijing saw 189 countries adopt the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , a visionary roadmap for women 's rights and empowerment . <p> But the International Steering Committee of the recently formed Global Alliance on Media and Gender ( GAMAG ) has expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's rights objectives remains painfully slow . " We can not talk about equality , good governance , freedom of expression and sustainability when women are effectively silenced in and through the media , and where new technologies are used to undermine the human rights of women and women journalists , " the committee 's chairperson Colleen Lowe Morna declared at the end of the Committee 's inaugural meeting in Geneva . <p> GAMAG , an initiative of UNESCO , is a network of 500 media organisations and civil society groups from around the world . It has declared 2015 the " year for action , " saying that the time for simply talking about gender inequality in and through the news media has passed . <p> How do we get past the depressing statistics ? <p> " I think advocacy is very important , research is very important and making a noise about it -- shouting about it -- is very important , " Glenda Daniels told the 2014 International Newsroom Summit in Amsterdam . Prominent Filipino journalist , and Rappler CEO and editor in chief , Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate media boundaries is essential . " Whether it is going to be in pay or editorial positions or benefits , we deserve equality . Collaboration , alliances and really talking to each other are key , " she said . <p> In an interview with the author , Ressa described Philippines news organisations as being a long way down the path of transformation . " The largest newspaper -- Philippine Daily Inquirer -- is headed by a woman . After I left the largest TV network , I handed leadership to another woman , the second largest television station is headed by a woman as well . In fact , our joke here at Rappler is we need gender equality for men ! I do n't know what makes the Philippines different , " Ressa said . A matriarchal society and poor remuneration for journalists may be factors . " I think part of the reason women stick to the need to become journalists more than men have is because of the lower income ... because media does n't pay as well as banking , men who come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to feed their families . " <p> The Bloomberg News recipe for newsroom gender transformation <p> The most boldly practical and effective strategy for achieving real change in newsrooms the World Editors Forum has encountered is Bloomberg 's . When Bloomberg News marked its 20th anniversary in 2010 , the organisation was forced to face a disturbing reality : graphic gender imbalance . " Whenever I looked at our reporting on markets , companies , governments , virtually any subject , the voices on these stories were overwhelmingly men . As a reporter and editor , this disturbed me , because although some of the most authoritative voices on the issues belonged to women , they were conspicuously absent , " the founding editor in chief , Matthew Winkler , told a UN panel on media and gender in New York ahead of International Women 's Day this year . <p> " This coincided with another disturbing trend -- while we were certainly successful in recruiting very talented , bright women to our news organisation , the leadership of Bloomberg News was still overwhelmingly male , " Winkler said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emeritus , had identified the two biggest impediments to gender equality in and through the news media in the 21st Century : the paucity of women at the helm and the ' censorship ' of female sources <p> Gender equality in the news and in news management is good business <p> " Five years ago we started looking at this entire issue , not just from an ideological imperative or a social imperative , both of which are valid . We decided to present this issue as an economic &amp; business imperative , in the sense that if we want to be the most successful news organisation , if we want to be competitive , then the only way we are going to succeed is if we address the gender imbalance : it 's an economic and business issue , " Winkler said . <p> Tackling the gender imbalance -- both in the news and behind editors ' desks -- requires " ... a whole set of policies , prescriptions , targets , goals -- like any good business does , " Winkler said . <p> The paucity of mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on : " What we set out to do is make sure that right at the top of the news organisation there are women who have had families , who have been all over the world , whose reporting and editing is distinguished as anyone 's , and that they would be in a position to remind everyone else ' You can do this too . ' " <p> Bloomberg News still has a long way to go , Winkler admits . But one of the measures of their early success , he said , is the fact that " most of the headcount at Bloomberg News " now reports to a woman -- senior executive editor Laura Zelenko , a former Bloomberg News Eastern Europe correspondent . Winkler made a point of highlighting her qualifications : " Her credentials as a leader are unimpeachable . " <p> He also pointed to another measurable outcome : the number of female team leaders at Bloomberg News has doubled in the past four years . " It took a lot of attention but it was worth it and the leadership now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority over what we cover every day . " <p> Focusing on women in news also makes better journalism <p> And there have been editorial pay-offs too , Winkler said . For example , the strategy of tracking women leaders in business led to Bloomberg News breaking the story about the appointment of the first woman automobile industry CEO in the world -- General Motors ' Mary Barra . " It was an example of where I say paying attention to this gender issue has made us far more competitive than we otherwise would be . We even beat the hometown media in Detroit to the story . " <p> Winkler emphasised the fact that the Bloomberg News ' gender transformation project is still a work in progress -- but one in which men and women are equal partners . " We have a long way to go but by committing ourselves through policy , and framing the policy as an economic and business decision , this is going to make us a better company , a better news organisation , this becomes an issue that has to be embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all benefit from the result . " <p> Asked by France 24'sAnnette Young to explain the discrepancy between the number of female journalism school graduates and junior ranked reporters in newsrooms compared to women in news management , Winkler was clear about the cause of the problem : " The issue is insufficient leadership in the newsroom . " Young presents The 51 Percent -- a TV News show about women -- out of Paris . Her response to Winkler 's Bloomberg News strategy for change : " If the management of a news organisation that operates in the traditional world of American corporate culture can do it , so can everybody else . " <p> The new threat to women in news : Cybermisogyny <p> While highlighting the potential of social media channels to act as conduits for women 's empowerment and solidarity , experts acknowledge the growing impact of " cybermisogyny " on women journalists . <p> A recent UK study of Twitter abuse targeting celebrities by Demos found that " Journalism is the only category where women received more abuse than men , with female journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse as their male counterparts . " <p> Cybermisogyny , expressed via online sexual harassment through to stalking and threat of violence , is a genuine psychological -- and potentially physical -- risk to safety of women journalists . It is also a threat to the active participation of women in civil society debate , fostered by news publishers , through online commenting platforms and their social media channels . <p> It can be an especially brutal experience when you 're writing about feminism , as Jezebel staff recently pointed out to Gawker executives , " It 's like playing whack-a-mole with a sociopathic Hydra ... It 's impacting our ability to do our jobs , " they wrote in an email . <p> Australian journalist , journalism educator and feminist activist Jenna Price knows first hand what cybermisogyny feels like . The co-founder of the high-impact feminist Facebook group ' Destroy the Joint ' , she has received online threats to rape her , and her daughters , in response to her journalism and activism. " ... once a week , some thug will suggest that what will fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Daily Life . " There is nothing more terrifying than opening your email to pictures of beheaded women , or women being beaten and sexually assaulted . I had sleepless nights , " she said . <p> Price told the World Editors Forum that her coping strategies have evolved over time . " I used to cry and endlessly overshare about trolling . That did n't help . Then I went all stoic . That did n't work either , " she said . " There are a few women journalists who have a secret support society where we can share our rage . Younger women tend to lose their cool and I find myself constantly private messaging people when I see things getting out of control . I urge them to take a bit of time out . " <p> Pulling back is one response to gendered abuse that is gaining momentum among women within online communities . The 2014 launch of a video platform built by women and aimed at women , in reaction to the very sexist and misogynistic comment threads pervading YouTube , highlights the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a realistic option for women journalists working within mainstream newsrooms , where engagement with broad audiences via popular social media channels is now essential . <p> So , if pulling back is n't an option , what can be done ? The Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) has begun " social media defence " classes as an intervention , a strategy Price welcomed , saying media employers " ... need to practice responsible corporate citizenship and ensure their staff have the social media skills AND the emotional support required ... it needs policy , strategy and action . " ( See Nine recommendations for managing cybermysoginy below ) . <p> However , if newsrooms themselves remain bastions of male domination , harassment and sexism , better management of the effects of cybermisogyny will not have a major impact on new moves to target women 's empowerment in , and through , the media . <p> NINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGING CYBERMISOGYNY <p> 1 .

@@3526235 <h> A demographic window of opportunity SA needs to climb through <h> We have another 50 years in which , if we ca n't step up the pace of job creation pretty smartly , SA 's unemployment rate will keep rising <p> The most depressing thing about President Jacob Zuma 's state of the nation update last week was just how unambitious it was . Zuma recognised that the economy was in trouble and that last year 's 1.5% growth rate was far from the National Development Plan 's 5% aspiration , and he said -- rather optimistically , some would say -- that growth was expected to rise to 3% over the next three years , as the government pursued the nine-point plan announced in February . <p> But all he could offer in the way of how much these various government initiatives could boost growth over the medium to long term was a modest one percentage point . If we are looking at going from 2% growth , at best , in the next couple of years to 3% over the long term , we are in real trouble . And a report from the World Bank this week highlights this -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event that our policy makers were to do even some of the right things , the economy could grow a lot faster , on a sustainable basis , in a way that would benefit a lot more people . <p> The bank has done a bunch of new modellings on a question first raised earlier this year by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , which devoted a chapter of its Sub-Saharan Economic Outlook to how the subcontinent can harness the so-called " demographic dividend " . This is the virtuous cycle of more jobs , more income , more saving and more investment in infrastructure and human capital -- spurring yet more economic growth and more jobs -- that comes about if countries can take advantage of their demographic transition by creating enough productive employment to absorb the growing number of people joining the workforce . The demographic transition occurs when the " youth bulge " created by improved fertility and mortality leads to the working age population , aged between 15 and 64 , growing faster than the rest of the population . <p> The IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of its demographic transition , but in SA , it said , that transition had " largely been completed " . Not so , says the World Bank . SA is about 80% of the way through its demographic transition but the share of the working-age population is still rising fast , from 65% now to peak at more than 68% in 2045 , at which point there will be 2.1 working-age South Africans for every old or young dependant . <p> On the World Bank 's numbers , SA still has 50 years to go in which the demographic window of opportunity will be open . That sounds great -- until you realise that it also means we have another 50 years in which , if we ca n't step up the pace of job creation pretty smartly , SA 's unemployment rate will keep rising , growth will fall short and we will end up with an economy and a workforce too small to support an increasingly ageing population . That is , if we get that far . <p> If SA can climb through that window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bank 's number crunchers have modelled three alternative scenarios , and the crisp point that emerges is that faster and more job-intensive growth is a start -- but if we really want the dividend in full , that needs to be combined with sustained increases in labour productivity . Crucially , that means better outcomes from our basic education system , with more people entering the workforce with matric . It also means more skills for the existing workforce and especially the long-term unemployed . <p> While the bank calls for " job intensive " growth , I 'm not convinced it should n't just be calling for a clear focus on growth , period . The only time in the past 20 years that unemployment fell meaningfully was during the few commodity boom years when the economy was hitting 5% growth rates . The bank argues that the right policies to reap the demographic dividend could see SA hit even higher than that , and sustain it . But its list of policy recommendations is quite slim . <p> On the demand side , it focuses mainly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape and making regulation more flexible and on the supply side by improving basic schooling , skills development and post-school training . <p> Perhaps this is just a tactic on the part of the World Bank to try to get SA 's policy makers to zero in on implementing just a few essentials for growth and job creation , instead of the somewhat random laundry list on offer from Zuma . For as the bank 's research suggests , on his current form , we 're more likely to see the demographic bomb scenario than any demographic dividend .

@@3526238 <h> The Man From U.N.C.L.E review : A solid hour and a half of fun <p> If you 've never heard of it before , The Man from U.N.C.L.E . was a TV show that ran from 1964 to 1968 about counter espionage agents , and which starred Robert Vaughn . If you 've never heard of him , he was the bad guy in Superman III . <p> So The Man from U.N.C.L.E . the latest in a long line of vintage TV shows that have been re-imagined as feature length movies -- 21 Jump Street , The A-Team and Charlie 's Angels among them . <p> Even though the new spy flick stays with the TV series ' Cold War setting , it 's directed by Guy Ritchie , whose last film was Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows , which , while a bit dim for its subject matter , had some of the best action sequences we 'd seen before . If you 've never seen " the forest scene " before , you 're in for a real treat . <p> The Man from U.N.C.L.E . features all the usual hallmarks of Guy Ritchie 's work ; unorthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tame enough to maintain the film 's PG-13 rating ) and a plot and characters that are simple but functional . And none of these are bad things . <p> The plot , such as it is , involves Russian and American teaming up to stop a clandestine organisation that is creating nuclear weapons . The US agent , Napoleon Solo ( Henry Cavill ) is sent on a mission at the beginning of the film to capture Gaby ( Alicia Vikander ) , a German stuck in East Berlin who has ties to the mysterious group . <p> During the mission Russia 's agent , Illya ( Armie Hammer ) intervenes to take Gaby off Solo . After an entertaining chase ( something the film makes a habit of ) the two agents are forced to put aside their rivalry at the behest of their commanding officers . Yes , Russia and the USA decide the threat of nuclear holocaust is more important than the Cold War -- which , in itself , is basically a precursor to nuclear holocaust . <p> From there the movie contains some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Advert <p> The pacing is great throughout ; the plot develops at a steady clip and never dawdles on one detail too long . Although plot 's developments and twists are telegraphed from a mile away , they 're still enjoyable . The humour and scenes of levity that break up the action feel just right -- the movie never feels exhausting . <p> Despite both Henry Cavill 's and Armie Hammer 's previous movies being widely regarded as " utter rubbish " ( Man of Steel and The Lone Ranger respectively ) , the pair acquitted themselves rather well . Cavill looks like he was born to play a besuited secret agent and , while some say Idris Elba should be the next James Bond , we 'll take it as a personal offence if Cavill does n't scoop the role . <p> Hammer 's portrayal of a damaged Soviet spy was also convincing , if a bit ham-fisted as the movie could n't resist some stereotypical **31;760;TOOLONG between the two spies . Alicia Vikander , though , is relatively unknown in our eyes and plays a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads . <p> The essence of the film is summed up in a sequence that takes place right in the middle of the movie . Our two spies , after trying to jump into a lake and landing on the pier ( ouch ) steal a boat in hopes of escape . A regular chase scene plays out only for Solo to fall off the boat and casually swim to shore while the pursuers chase Illya . Solo then takes the time to hijack a truck , enjoy a cheese sandwich and wine while listening to Italian folk music , and then get back into action to save his comrade . It 's pulled off well , will make you laugh and is so unexpected you 'll find yourself grinning like an idiot . <p> In a lot of ways , The Man From U.N.C.L.E . recalls the recent Kingsman : The Secret Service , another light-hearted spy movie that 's very easy to adore .

@@3529240 <h> Jansen : Universities must challenge students <p> INDEPENDENT MEDIAThe University of the Free State vice-chancellor , Professor Jonathan Jansen at the CAO AGM , at Coastland Hotel in Durban . Photo : Sibonelo Ngcobo <p> Durban - Some South African universities - including some in KwaZulu-Natal - were guilty of dishing out a " version of Bantu education " to their students , rather than " challenging the socks off " them , Professor Jonathan Jansen said on Wednesday . <p> The University of the Free State vice-chancellor would not name the universities he referred to , but said the country 's universities were not all offering a consistently high quality of education which " stretched " students academically . <p> Jansen said evidence of poor quality was when the Council on Higher Education had certain degree programmes at a university discontinued . <p> He made the remarks in Durban on Wednesday , as the keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the Central Applications Office at Coastlands Hotel in Durban . The office is responsible for processing student applications to KwaZulu-Natal 's universities . <p> " Any academic worth their salt knows what a good quality university education entails , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library is well stocked , and where more and more people are earning PhDs . " <p> Jansen said the standard of education was compromised where class sizes were too large , teaching was inconsistent , and students learnt from notes rather than having to read entire books . <p> Transformation would not be accomplished in higher education until students at all South African universities achieved the same standard of education , he said . <p> " Access is one thing , success is another . " <p> Jansen argued that the diverse range of standards for admission at different universities sustained a two-tiered ( even three-tiered ) system of higher education . <p> At one of the country 's universities the admission points score for teacher education was in the low 20s , while at other universities it was in the 30s , he said . <p> " Are those students really getting the same quality of education ? Are we really distributing the same opportunities ? " <p> Jansen said he supervised Master 's students - among them people from top universities - who could not write at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undergraduate pass rate at his own university was among the lowest in the country , and rather than lower standards , his response had been to raise the bar for admissions for students , and for academics wanting to be promoted to professorship . <p> The pass rate climbed to nearly 90% . <p> Jansen said he refused to be told that raising the bar was to the detriment of black students , and that black students could not outperform their white peers . <p> He also drew a distinction between training students , and educating them . <p> " Training gives you skills . Education tempers your passions . " <p> Here are some of Jansen thoughts on education , race and role models : <p> * Introducing Mandarin at schools as an optional subject was political toadying . Instead , South Africa needed to get the teaching of English and the African languages right . <p> * Adding an extra year to all undergraduate degrees was a good idea , as long as those students who could graduate in a shorter period were allowed to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning children to work at menial jobs . <p> * The primary problem in South Africa was not spending , it was translating resources into results . <p> * Getting an education was not simply meeting the minimum requirements of a degree . <p> * South Africans had the wrong role models . Young people ought to look up to Steve Biko and Robert Sobukwe . <p> * How children behaved was a consequence of adult behaviour . Teachers who showed up on time , were prepared , and respected their pupils would see children respond accordingly . <p> * Make sure the people you have around the braai at your home do not look or pray in the same way that you do .

@@3532231 , SA 's economy has hit the skids <h> Accelerating job losses and firm closures give the lie to Zuma 's assurances that the economy is on track <p> Less than three months ago , President Jacob Zuma insisted in parliament that SA was " doing very well " . Last week , he came close to admitting SA was in a crisis . However , he insisted the country was not alone in experiencing low growth , nor was the problem one of SA 's own making . <p> The Financial Mail has long warned that the economy is in crisis . But it is as much a crisis of confidence caused by government 's mismanagement of the economy as it is due to global factors like China 's slowdown and the machinations of the US Federal Reserve . <p> The fact that there are both negative domestic and external forces bearing down on the economy makes its predicament that much worse . <p> With the mining sector edging closer to a strike , the rand testing new lows , fresh concerns over China 's growth , and the Fed on the cusp of raising rates , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an outright recession . <p> Over the past few months , many of SA 's key economic indicators have sunk to levels that suggest SA is headed for long-term economic stagnation , at the very least . Business and consumer confidence are at 15-year lows , worse even than at the start of the 2009 recession . <p> However , at a press conference on the state of the nation last week , Zuma assured SA that though it was caught up in a wider emerging-markets crisis , not everything was " doom and gloom " . <p> Though conceding that the electricity constraint could shave as much as one percentage point off growth in 2015 , he expressed confidence that the economy was still on track to grow by 2% this year and rebound to 3% by 2017 . <p> But with the Reserve Bank having marked down SA 's growth potential to just above 2% from 3.5% a few years ago , and Eskom having just pushed out the deadlines for the completion of Medupi , Kusile and Ingula by two years , it is becoming increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth forecasts will materialise . <p> The more plausible view is that SA can expect to bump along the bottom for several more years , growing at 1%-2% a year . Two more years of this desultory performance and SA will have experienced five consecutive years of low growth -- the most prolonged phase of weak growth since 1994 . <p> In an update on the SA economy released this week , the World Bank revised down its real GDP growth forecast for SA to 2.0% in both 2015 and 2016 ( a drop of 0.5 and 0.8 percentage points , respectively ) . <p> Most significantly , it forecasts the SA economy will recover to just 2.4% in 2017 as it expects the electricity situation to improve only towards the end of that year . <p> " Growth is stuck in low gear due to a combination of external headwinds arising from the fall in commodity prices and slowdown in the Chinese economy and important domestic constraints , " the Bank says . <p> Proof of this lies in the fact that over the past five years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against SA 's average of just 1.8% . This points to homegrown shortcomings that have been holding the country back , rather than just global constraints . <p> The president 's failure to recognise this ( at a press conference called to show he is not out of touch with the state of the nation ) can only dent confidence further . <p> " I wish he had n't continued to blame foreign forces and global issues and continued to say SA is n't alone is having low growth , " says Nomura strategist Peter Montalto . " It shows he fundamentally can not admit to the problem . This is the first step investors want to see , that SA acknowledges that its problems are homegrown . " <p> Pan-African Capital Holdings CE Iraj Abedian agrees . He argues that the economy 's suffering comes from a crisis of business and investor confidence , which primarily stems from government 's mismanagement of the economy . <p> For instance , he notes that the minister of home affairs has thrown SA 's tourism sector into disarray through the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the weak rand , it should be fairly humming . " This is a self-inflicted problem that has nothing to do with the global crisis , " says Abedian . " Not owning up to the specific damage the cabinet has wrought on the economy was a missed opportunity . " <p> He is unimpressed that Zuma announced that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa would head an interministerial task team to review the visa regulations since , like so much of the salvage work assigned to Ramaphosa , it comes after the horse has bolted . <p> Hopefully the tourism sector has not been irrevocably harmed and will bounce back once more practical travel rules are implemented . <p> The same can not be said for SA 's faltering industrial complex . <p> Even as the president was insisting that manufacturing exports had turned around , Stats SA released data showing that SA 's manufacturing sector had experienced two consecutive quarters of decline , dropping by 1.2% q/q in the second quarter after a 0.5% q/q contraction in the first . <p> This suggests that overall GDP growth remained below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Reserve Bank has warned SA to expect another dismal outcome when the GDP figures are released next week , roughly equal to the 1.3% recorded in the first quarter . <p> This means that the economy will have to outperform in the second half of the year to grow by 2% for the year as a whole . This seems increasingly unlikely , given the plummeting rand , rising inflation , tighter monetary policy and impending job cuts in several sectors . <p> Economists agree that the weakness in SA 's industrial output reflects a number of factors , including low productivity , regular labour disruptions , rising import intensity , weak business confidence and infrastructure bottlenecks , especially in the provision of electricity . <p> But this handy economic shorthand tends to mask the true horror of the disaster unfolding in SA 's industrial sector . <p> Henk Langenhoven , the chief economist of the Steel &amp; Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa , is surprised that few people have grasped the extent to which the economy is being eviscerated . <p> The first step to understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the metals &amp; engineering sector is intimately linked to the fortunes of the mining , construction and car-manufacturing sectors . Any disruptions in activity in any one of the sectors will hurt the others . <p> For instance , the travails in mining as a result of lower commodity prices , cost pressures and losses have had a very negative impact on demand in the metals &amp; engineering sector . <p> The latter 's annualised production numbers turned negative in June 2014 and have been negative ever since . In fact , the downward trend is accelerating . <p> Whether this slide continues depends largely on whether mining is able to sustain production and exports . That 's a big " if " given that , at current prices , more than 40% of the country 's platinum and 31% of the gold mining industry is loss-making . <p> " Strikes now in the mining sector would be calamitous , " says Langenhoven . <p> " All four sectors are suffering , all are highly energy-intensive and are the biggest employers and biggest export earners . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems as if nobody has realised how interlinked these sectors are and how important they are to the economy . " <p> Collectively the four sectors contributed 20.6% to GDP in 2000 , but that had dropped to just under 17% by the first quarter of 2015 . <p> At the end of 2014 , they together directly employed about 1.45 million people . By the end of the second quarter of this year , Langenhoven expects 67 000 of these jobs to have been shed , based on the sectors ' recent data for production and value added . <p> He also estimates the contraction in these four sectors will collectively shave 0.7% off SA 's total GDP in the second quarter . But the most worrying factor , he feels , is that these four sectors ' combined trade balance had reversed from a R50-billion surplus in 2011 to an estimated deficit of R70-billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015 . <p> Manufacturing and mining have discovered that despite the very weak rand , exporting your way out of trouble is difficult when China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , your key exports , the EU is barely growing and load-shedding occurs frequently . <p> The motor industry is also in recession , with vehicle sales down 2% in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2014 . The passenger car market has been in decline since mid-2013 , reflecting the growing pressure on the highly indebted SA consumer from rising living costs and weak jobs growth . <p> " If this is not counter-balanced by sustained or growing vehicle exports ( so far they have been buoyed by America 's recovery ) , it could initiate another wave of lower demand for the metals &amp; engineering sector and exacerbate the already bleak situation , with more retrenchments resulting , " says Langenhoven . <p> One of the chief industrial policy goals of the department of trade &amp; industry ( DTI ) has been to use the public procurement process to reindustrialise SA . But , says Langenhoven , it has n't stimulated the domestic economy by anything close to what was expected . <p> " Government wanted industry to ramp up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight . The capacity just was n't there . " Instead , it has been met in many cases by cheaper Asian imports . <p> The combination of domestic challenges , coupled with a global steel glut and swelling of cheap Chinese imports , has proved too much for SA 's steel industry . Evraz Highveld Steel , SA 's second-largest steel producer , has been placed in business rescue and ArcelorMittal has put its Vereeniging long steel works into temporary emergency care . <p> " I think we 've already lost in the short term and I expect things to get worse and job losses to accelerate , " says Langenhoven . " We 're seeing a lot of losses and some of the guys in my sector tell me they ca n't service their debts . " <p> Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings fears things could snowball . Substantial job losses in mining and manufacturing would depress consumption and so further weaken the broader business sector , he explains . The risk is that this causes a self-perpetuating cycle in which companies start to cut jobs more aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lings ' view is that a recession is not inevitable , but that SA is laying the groundwork for precisely such an outcome . Whether or not the economy actually tips into negative territory , what can not be denied is that SA has become well and truly stuck in a low-growth environment without any immediate means of escape . <p> Exports are under pressure , the consumer is on the ropes , business is battening down the hatches , and both fiscal and monetary policy are in tightening mode as the authorities seek to lessen SA 's external vulnerability in the face of imminent Fed hikes . <p> The World Bank warns that there are downside risks even to its already weak SA economic forecast . <p> " On the domestic front , if labour relations do not improve or if power disruptions worsen , growth could well disappoint further , " it notes in its report . " And if wage settlements continue to exceed inflation and productivity gains , competitiveness will erode , undermining the role of net exports in supporting the recovery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvesting an approaching storm " as the result of years of penalising the economy through government 's single-minded and legalistic pursuit of redress and redistribution at the expense of economic efficiency . <p> This approach has led to layoffs , weakening the human capital base in the public sector , writes Bruggemans in a recent column . " The cumulative unintended consequences of this can be observed daily . " <p> Only a change of heart can turn this around , he feels . " This does not necessarily mean a shift to unfettered economic logic . Restitution and compensation can remain a major feature of changing SA 's complexion ... but in a secondary , supporting role rather than the sole primary one , as has been the case for too many years now . " <p> Given three wishes , Abedian would reshuffle the cabinet to include more competent people who understand modern economies ; abandon government 's statist approach to running the economy ( since it has neither the money nor the implementation capability to do so ) and instead invite the private sector into a partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost-effective and sustainable energy policy that ends Eskom 's monopoly and involves a greater private-sector contribution . <p> Old Mutual Investment Management chief economist Rian le Roux wishes Zuma had used his press conference to announce immediate action against underperforming municipalities and government departments . He also would like to see a far more aggressive approach to corruption and wastage and a plan to reduce regulatory burdens , speed up regulatory processes and sort out managerial problems at state-owned enterprises , including replacing dysfunctional managements and boards with qualified , competent people . <p> For the World Bank , " improved labour relations , matched by greater collaboration between the public and private sectors and policy certainty to improve the business environment , is fundamental to restoring confidence . " <p> It also says SA must get basic education and post-school vocational training right in order to meet the jobs challenge , noting that this will also require more supportive small business policies , like ensuring greater regulatory flexibility . <p> Montalto counters that it is already too late to fix many things , like preventing the impending job cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done is politically impossible under SA 's current style of leadership , he says . " SA is stuck in this low-growth world within the confines of what is politically possible . The foundations are already laid . It 's all well and good bandying around need for labour law changes , improved education and skills and a change of mind-set at the DTI , but it is n't going to happen . " <p> The idea that SA has already lost the battle is not typically expressed in SA 's public discourse except in hushed asides . <p> Standard &amp; Poor 's sub-Saharan African MD Konrad Reuss is one of the few to have given it voice . In an interview with the Financial Mail earlier this year he said : " While we believe that government will continue to adhere to controlled fiscal expenditure , we do not believe it will manage to undertake the major labour and other economic reforms that will significantly boost GDP growth . " <p> Moody 's continues to give government the benefit of the doubt a full three years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite all the evidence that government is incapable of implementing any of the tough economic or labour market reforms . <p> " The country is at a crossroads in that it 's stuck in this low-growth trajectory and there are policy choices to make , " Moody 's lead SA analyst Kristin Lindow told the Financial Mail in May . " A lot of the growth constraints are domestic in origin . Acknowledging and dealing with it is going to be crucial if SA is to move beyond this period . " <p> So far government 's response to the crisis has been to establish task teams and " war rooms " , repackage old plans or promise to " fast-track " things it should have been doing urgently anyway , send contentious matters for further study , and continue to insist it is committed to implementing the business-friendly NDP even as new policies weaken property rights and investor protection . <p> To be fair , Zuma did announce one new , welcome initiative at the press conference : the establishment of a pilot investment facilitation centre , or One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic hurdles and fast-track all investment inquiries . <p> But what government has not been able to do is face up to the root cause of the growth slowdown : that under Zuma 's presidency there has been a progressive erosion of the structural underpinnings of SA 's economic performance and productivity . <p> The main culprit , according to the report , is that real turnover growth has barely kept pace with soaring real wage growth and rapidly rising employment costs . The result is that the productivity of many SA firms is in steady decline at a time when global conditions have become increasingly tough . <p> But supportive micro-policies to raise industry 's competitiveness have been few and far between . Instead , Zuma 's administration has increased the complexity of industrial regulations and presided over a rapid rise in the cost of logistics . <p> Above all , its distrust of private capital has meant it has failed at the most basic level to make SA a welcoming place to do business . <p> To compound matters , Zuma 's hands-off leadership style and lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto pilot with no-one at the helm to arrest the steady slide in its growth potential and creditworthiness . <p> This was underscored in parliament recently when Zuma revealed that he had no knowledge of impending job losses in mining , or of attacks on the integrity of the judiciary by his police minister , or even of the knee-jerk suspension of Glencore 's Optimum Colliery 's mining licence by his mineral resources minister -- an item of huge controversy which has caused confidence in the sector to plumb new depths . <p> It was ostensibly to repair the damage that Zuma called the press conference a few days later where he assured SA that not everything was " doom and gloom " . <p> On the contrary , SA is busy making the noose for its own neck . <p> At most , SA has a two-year window to prevent further sovereign credit rating downgrades . The rating agencies have been clear that it will take more than treasury 's continued fiscal prudence for SA to hang on to its investment rating . The country must also prevent any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is manifestly failing to do . <p> The World Bank concludes that " structural impediments will continue to weigh heavily on SA 's growth over the next three years " and that " labour relations will remain difficult in an environment of weak growth " . <p> Given this , the Bank expects unemployment to remain " sticky and high " , and extreme poverty and inequality to remain broadly unchanged . <p> The consensus is that the only way to jolt SA out of this low-growth trap is for government to undertake structural economic and labour market reforms . <p> However , for that to happen will ostensibly require an overhaul of the political leadership . That is at least four years away . If the economy is in bad shape now , what will it look like after another four years of this ? <p> On its current trajectory , SA can expect massive de-industrialisation , macroeconomic instability , and a sovereign rating downgrade to junk status , which could trigger a currency crisis . <p> A worsening of the growth and jobs situation could also lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiscal crisis or a jump to outright populist policies , says Le Roux . <p> That is not a happy ending . It is certainly a lot less than SA deserves . But if it materialises , SA will have only itself to blame .

These contestants have to impress at least one coach at the beginning of every audition . If they get more than one coach interested , it is up to the contestant to choose a coach to run with for the competition . In the US they have the likes of Pharrell Williams and Christina Aguilera as coaches on The Voice . Who can we expect on our version ? We have a few suggestions . <p> There are other TV talent shows with judges , mentors or hosts all pulled from our small local entertainment industry .

Here are the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kahn Morbee <p> One of the things that Randall Abrahams recently pointed out , which we do not talk about much , is the fact that we do not have good songwriters in this country .

Tamara has done so well in crossing over to a varied landscape of fans , which is feat few get right . <p> Several others could make the cut and we can throw around names like Karen Zoid , Ross Learmonth , Clint Brink , Busiswa , Donald and Alexis Faku .

These include accounts of torture by electric shock , cigarette burns , near-asphyxiation and being held in rooms with decomposing bodies while suspended by the hands or feet . <p> The Extraordinary African Chambers in the Senegalese Courts ( EAC ) was established at the request of the African Union ( AU ) with a special mandate to try Habr ? . <p> It concludes more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his prosecution , and will be the first time an African state has tried another state 's former leader . <p> Four previous extradition requests from Belgium and the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) to Senegal were denied during this period , while Habr ? lived a life of luxury under provisional house arrest in Dakar . <p> The trial will serve as a test case to see whether an African-led international criminal court can fight impunity on the continent -- a major concern among ordinary citizens . <p> A recent survey by Afrobarometer indicates that perceptions of impunity are widespread on the continent . <p> On average , 56% of citizens in 21 countries say officials who commit crimes " always " or " often " go unpunished . This ranges from 34% in Namibia to 76% in Kenya . <p> Previous regional attempts to address gross human rights violations have been unable to overcome the political challenges that internationalised courts must navigate . <p> The Southern African Development Community Tribunal is a notable example of this failure : it was dissolved shortly after a ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , Mike Campbell ( Pvt ) Ltd and Others vs Republic of Zimbabwe ( 2008 ) . <p> Habr ?

The ICC is accused of bias against African states due to the fact that all eight cases in which it is currently intervening are African . <p> The AU has gone so far as to call on its member states to take a unified position against the ICC 's jurisdiction to prosecute sitting presidents and senior members of government in power , arguing that the court unfairly targets African incumbents while overlooking violations outside of the continent . <p> Any international criminal justice court must navigate a political landscape that favours stronger nations .

Late last year , six in 10 Kenyans agreed the cases were an important tool in fighting impunity in the country , and only 35% believed the court was biased against Kenya and other African countries . <p> This raises the question of how attuned African governments are to their citizens ' attitudes on matters of implementing international criminal justice . <p> It also illustrates a disjuncture between the concerns of ordinary citizens and current debates on the ICC 's role in Africa -- which tend to be held at an elite level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ICC have often been supported by the argument that an AU-led judicial body would be better placed to fill the role of " court of last resort " on the continent . <p> This would provide a crucial opportunity for the organisation to play a larger role in its member states ; only a minority of citizens in 17 out of 21 countries surveyed reported that the AU helped their country " a lot " or " somewhat " . <p> If the AU , governments and civil society are to be representative of ordinary citizens ' interests , rather than elites , however , the debate on international criminal justice needs to turn its focus away from ideological and geopolitical disputes towards the victims of gross human rights violations . The AU 's insistence on exempting incumbents from prosecution would be a major obstacle to ending impunity among top officials . <p> Habr ? has little political support on the continent and has not held office since 1990 , yet victims have had to wait 25 years to see him take the stand .

@@3541239 <h> More risk , more reward <p> Editor 's Note : We 're holding off on the final review until we have a chance to play some multiplayer matches after the game is released . Stay tuned soon for the final score ! <p> The new mechanics of Madden NFL 16 are useful tools that allow you to control every aspect of the passing game . Some are more useful than others , and long time Madden players might need to retrain their brain to take full advantage of these mechanics , but to be sure , it 's a positive step in the right direction . <p> Right as you start Madden 16 , you 're thrown into an overly cinematic , somewhat ludicrous prediction of Super Bowl 50 . You 're forced to play as the Pittsburgh Steelers , who face the Arizona Cardinals in Madden 's prophetic big game . This is n't only meant to anger non-Steelers fans though , but to serve as a tutorial for the new passing/defending mechanics , most importantly , how you catch and throw the football . <p> For example , you can now catch the ball exactly how you want , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your receiver is being guarded closely by a defender who is directly contesting the ball , you can use the " Aggressive Catch " to leap high into the air , and reach for the ball with both hands over his head , or if your man is left wide open , you might opt for the the " Run After Catch " option to catch the ball in stride , maximizing the amount of yard you can gain . If you are n't sure which option would be the most useful , a button prompt conveniently flashes above your receivers head , so you can just treat it like a quick time event . <p> That 's not to say there is n't any decision-making involved though , as every option has a logical drawback .. It 's important not to overuse the Aggressive Catch , for instance , as your receiver will be left more vulnerable , and susceptible to big hits and injuries . Where the Possession Catch might seem like the safest option , defenders actually have a better chance of cutting off the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving options are a breath of fresh air , and add a level of nuance that has n't been seen in the franchise since the hit stick was first introduced . <p> On top of the new receiver mechanics , QBs have also been given a few new weapons . Your QB can now attempt a touch pass by double tapping your receiver 's icon . These are great for putting enough air under the ball to get it over the head of a linebacker , but not enough as to where the safety can get to it . <p> Some new passing mechanics are n't as useful as others , though . If you want to throw the ball high , you must hold L1 ( or LB on Xbox ) as you press the receiver 's icon , and for low throws , it 's L2 ( or LT on Xbox ) . In theory , these sound like good options to have , but in the heat of the moment , it feels too cumbersome . You only have a few precious seconds from the snap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that time , you have to keep track of the pocket to make sure you do n't get sacked , watch your receivers to see when they 're open , and gauge how hard you want to throw the ball . Attaching this new high/low throw to shoulder buttons is just too much . It would feel more natural if you could determine the height of the pass with the analog stick instead . <p> Quarterbacks and receivers are n't the only ones with new tools to play with though . Defensive backs can now toggle between playing the ball or the receiver at the touch of a button . Like the new catching mechanics , there 's a risk/reward to each . When playing the ball , provides the optimal path to the ball in an attempt to intercept or break up the pass , but if your defender is out of position you 'll most likely miss the opportunity to make a tackle . Playing the receiver has the opposite effect . Rather than trying for an interception , your defender will ignore the ball altogether . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 're practically guaranteed that the tackle will be made . <p> So those are my thoughts on Madden NFL 16 's big new gameplay features . Be sure to check back here later this week for my final verdict once I 've tested the online components .

And , thanks to his highly entertaining , adventurous two-wheeled efforts , there are plenty of people from well-heeled societies across the world who are prepared to pay to tag along . <p> Boorman led exactly such a group out of Cape Town last Friday , headed for the wide open spaces of Namibia , the sub-tropical bush of the Caprivi , primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderous Victoria Falls . <p> There are plenty of well-heeled bikers who are prepared to pay to tag along . <p> Last Wednesday , at a dinner hosted by the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel in Woodstock , Boorman spent an evening regaling a large group of guests with tales of his exploits and adventures and telling about experiences which he believes will stay with him for the rest of his life . <p> Before dinner , though , he had a bit of time to kill and agreed to do it in my company and provide some details of his life on two wheels . <p> According to Boorman , the very fact that his parents did not want him to ride motorcycles led to him riding them , even at a very young age when he was playing around with a friend 's little motorcycle . <p> It was , however , Boorman 's friendship with McGregor that really developed his love for bikes and motorcycling . <p> The two men became very close friends who not only rode together but , also for a while , ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about doing a long ride together . At first they were going to ride down to Spain where they would meet their families for a summer holiday . Then , they were talking about riding to China because McGregor 's wife was from there . <p> Charley Boorman tells it like it is at the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel in Cape Town . Picture : Willem Law / Independent Media <p> " One day Ewan called me and said , ' Charlie , come over , I have an idea of what we should do ' , " Boorman recalls . <p> " I got to his place and he had a little map there and said , ' Let 's forget about China , if we are going through Russia , we might as well go all the way across and over the Bering Strait and head for New York ' . And I thought , yes , why not ? <p> " If you are going to try and convince somebody to travel , do it with a small map -- the distances look like nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , it took several years of preparation to do The Long Way Around . <p> " At that stage , I had no money . I had a wife , kids and a mortgage and my acting career was nowhere , so I was painting and decorating people 's homes . Ewan had just done Star Wars , so he was alright , but we had to find a way to get the money for the trip . <p> " Somebody then decided we should do a book and we soon got that idea sold to people , but then we wondered how we were going to do it . I mean , I am dyslexic , how do I do a book ? We could not just do the ride , come home and start writing , I mean , you would forget stuff . And you could never take enough notes . " <p> So a suggestion was made that they should take video equipment and film the trip .

' That is nice , one guy said , but who gets voted off ' ? and I immediately said , hey , the famous Ewan McGregor is never going to get voted off , so it will be me . No thanks ! " <p> Eventually , it turned into a monster undertaking , with a film crew and support vehicles , huge administration and management . But the resulting programmes saw to it that the market for adventure motorcycles like the BMWs the two men rode , increased by over60 percent worldwide . <p> It was on that trip that Igor took care of their entertainment needs and a family of traditional Mongolians invited them into their wooden-framed animal skin home and offered them a meal of sheep 's testicles . While McGregor managed it , Boorman failed spectacularly , but the stoical Mongolians fortunately took it in their stride . <p> After this trip and the one down Africa for The Long Way Down , Boorman chose to take part in the notorious Dakar Rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth day of the 16-day event , still held in Africa , he crashed heavily , breaking his hands . <p> But sheer bloody-minded tenacity made him stay with the programme and , with both hands in casts , he helped manage the team to the point where they were able to get one rider out of three to finish . Only 67 out of more than 200 bikesfinished . <p> Boorman is quite happy to admit his acting career never succeeded . <p> " My father ( John Boorman ) was a well-known film director and directed movies such as Excalibur . <p> " When he needed a child to play a role in a movie , he would use me and my sister . After all , his own kids came free of charge , not so ? <p> " Lee Marvin was my godfather and a very close friend of my father 's .

After a rest at Victoria Falls in about a month 's time , a new group of riders will join him and they will tackle the long ride back to Cape Town . <p> " My wife is a very patient woman . She keeps things working while I am gone on a trip . In the past she had often been on her own with the kids for up to four months . We 've been married for 25 years now and apart from being a great partner , she is also quite hot , you know .

@@3547238 <h> Sweden on the cusp <p> 27 August 2015 , 16:50 <p> Sweden , that country known as the bastion of political correctness , supporting progressive liberalism with a socialist slant , and a keen low-tolerance for dissent , is a changing . <p> The title " The North Korea of Scandinavia " in respect to the country , first ventured by a Dane on a public forum , is most certainly deserved as just at the end of last year legislation was enacted which made it a crime to criticise Sweden 's immigration laws online , amongst other things . <p> As Daniel Pipes notes , " Sweden 's history creates a no-crisis mentality that militates against the hard-headed , flexible responses needed to cope with the country 's current problems , " especially with regard to immigration . He maintains that " past success has led to current failure . " <p> One example is that security in Sweden is well below that of a country like Bolivia , and there is little inclination to improve this , rendering immigrant violence inevitable . <p> Contrary to the progressive liberal view of Sweden viewed through rose-coloured -spectacles as a first-world socialist success story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years has led to poor , barely literate immigrants being housed in ghetto-like high density housing with attendant crime and grime , not to mention a strain on the socialist 's state resources as these new citizens qualify for all the benefits paid to the native Swedes . <p> Some of these immigrant housing estates have become known as no-go areas , with the country 's police services reluctant to intervene and ' police ' these ghettos . <p> Rape has increased exponentially alongside other crimes , lagging behind that of South Africa , but the country 's feminist controllers refuse to attribute this to a product of increased criminal activity , but instead speak of a rape culture that demonises men in their entirety for the purpose of increasing legislative measures that favour women across the board . <p> But now there is a backlash , at least with regard to the reality of immigration , in the form of the Swedish Democratic Party . It has been described as a far-right party by its establishment critics , although in actuality it 's more of the populist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party by Sweden 's other groupings , supporters do n't openly admit their allegiance ; at least not in the public arena . <p> According to a source , fifty percent of police secretly support Sweden 's Democrats . <p> In fact it even has the support of some immigrants , fuelled by the reality no doubt that their proximity to criminals in so far as their living quarters is concerned has them bearing the brunt of crime . <p> Last year , Sweden 's Democrats parliamentary share of the vote rose to 12.9 percent , a year later polls indicate it has nearly doubled to 25.2 percent , leading the governing Social Democrats who have only 23.4 percent support , and the nominally right -wing party , the Moderates with 21 percent . <p> The Democrats objectives are ; the assimilation of legal immigrants ; expelling illegals and reducing further immigration by at least 90% . It also endorses other a number of other policies related to <p> crime , defence , the European Union and Israel , which are abhorrent to the other established parties . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political climate has shifted in Sweden . Journalists , policy specialists and politicians all admitted that ideas outside the mainstream a year ago , now receive a hearing . Four newspapers have questioned the consensus in favour of high immigration . The shift apparently results from the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . <p> As Daniel Pipes states , denial and censorship can only continue for so long before the instinct of self-preservation kicks in . The Western country that 's been most prone to national suicide is possibly waking up from its stupor . As Pipes says , if this can occur in the " North Korea of Scandinavia " it can , and likely will , occur elsewhere in Europe . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

@@3547240 @ Stealing jokes made ' The Fat Jew ' a star <p> For some , Josh Ostrovsky is a social media superstar . For others , he 's a thief , building a humour-based brand out of jokes written by actually funny people . He has been a thorn in the side of comedians for a while ; his recent signing with the Hollywood-based talent Creative Arts Agency ( CAA ) has sparked a wave of online fury . <p> Ostrovsky , often called the Fat Jew , is a fully fledged Instagram celebrity , with 5.7-million followers . ( He also tweets to a smaller audience as @FatJew . ) His Instagram feed is filled with jokes and pictures with pithy captions . He describes his role as seeking out funny , buzz-worthy internet content and broadcasting it to the world through his brand . Comics say he steals from social media and removes the original source to imply that he wrote the material himself . <p> After the CAA signing , comedians compiled lists of his stolen jokes and pleaded with people to unfollow him . <p> Ostrovsky has an eclectic resum ? , including plus-size modelling , a line of ros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year his book Money , Pizza , Respect will be published .

In March , Time magazine named him one of the 30 most influential people on the internet . <p> His apparent sins are n't unique : joke-stealing and other forms of content co-opting are common on social media and he 's often lumped with Instagrammer Elliot Tebele , who posts viral content as @FuckJerry . <p> Defenders say he merely aggregates content that has potential , scouring Reddit and Tumblr for gems . When Ostrovsky has been accused of copying jokes , he has blamed his interns or said internet memes are nearly impossible to trace to their original source . <p> Part of the problem stems from Ostrovsky 's medium of choice , Instagram , which does n't have an in-built way to share content from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , but users say it can be difficult to get the site to delete stolen content , and it does n't do enough to police theft . <p> In stand-up terminology , oft-repeated gags that ca n't be sourced are called street jokes and in the days of vaudeville most routines were a mix of these old standards . The focus on original material in stand-up is generally traced to the 1950s and the likes of Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce , whose timely and political material sparked a stand-up revolution . <p> Over time , the move to more confessional , personal jokes meant comics felt more ownership over their material , and stealing jokes became taboo . Accusations of joke theft plagued comedians such as Robin Williams and Denis Leary.

Especially from sources within cyberspace . <p> The Christian vs Atheist/Agnostic debate being one of many fruitful examples of an information wasteland that is being created by internet users . Enough fuel to fire a bloody slaughter of humankind in future if it is left unchecked . Christian and non- Christian ' intellectuals ' present garbage information to vast users bases and floods the internet with their supposed spoils of war , intellect and superiority . Whatever has happened to proper logic and sound reasoning ; it appears as if people suppose themselves to be wise and intelligent by presenting arguments that actually goes to proof the contrary . Does our education system no longer provide children with an opportunity to debate topics in a fair , equitable , reasonable and logical fashion ? The wasteland of information that is called the internet is a breeding ground of contempt and belligerence .

Now , the title itself is as misleading as many News24 article headings . Upon glancing the title one would immediately assume some scientific or logical argument to be presented that explains some reason why humanity in general and in vast majorities remain faithful to their religious roots with a specific emphasis on Christianity . Yet , no dear reader , we 're left with an enquiry based on three premises : ( 1 ) people find it hard to dump their faith in Jesus Christ ; ( 2 ) their faith in Jesus Christ is without any verifiable historic evidence ; ( 3 ) and Jesus Christ failed on His promise to return for faithful followers . <p> So Victor 's ' what ' is explained by vague premises and further hating spewing experiences of the author of a religion entitled ' Christianity ' !

One would then expect in order for Victor to expound on why people find it hard to dump their faith in Jesus Christ , he would have set the parameters of ( 1 ) who Jesus Christ is ( this would have helped to establish the parameters of the argument for sub- premise 2 as well ) ; ( 2 ) who the followers of Jesus Christ are according to historic and contemporary and historic sources ? ; ( 3 ) what best sources tell us about what Jesus did when He walked the planet 's soil and if He indeed did ? ; ( 4 ) what we know of the history of the followers of Jesus Christ in relation to what sources tell us about both Jesus Christ and His followers and their combined history to date ? ; ( 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's followers are ? . <p> Once we have established the parameters of who the people and their Leader , Jesus is and how their faith in Him came about , we get to the real width , breadth , height and girth of the argument .

( 2 ) What can we glean from their numbers and demographics ? ( 3 ) Did their numbers increase or decrease ? ( 4 ) Any explanation for any increases or decreases ? ( 5 ) Any explanation for the sources underlying any increases or decreases ? ( 5 ) Does decrease in numbers constitute dumping of faith ?

Wagner Moura is chilling in his unshowy portrayal of the bumptious Escobar exactly because he plays him as a man rather than a monster . <p> Escobar , for him , is a dedicated family man and a ruthless brute , as capable of showing distress over the shooting of a dog as he is of ordering a jet full of innocent civilians to be blown up .

The Bulls were the first team to employ a defence coach and , as such , I gained a greater appreciation for that aspect of play . I feel I 've become a well-rounded backline coach at a professional level . I 've learned the value of possessing a sound tactical kicking game , a strong defensive system and a penetrative attack from broken field and first phase . As a player , I got involved in terms of tactical preparation and gave thought to the game . I would analyse my own play as well as that of my opponents . Coaching was a natural cause of events . As a player , I was trying to live out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist players in fulfilling their true potential . I once said rugby was never a job for me , but rather a way of life and that still holds true today . I have really enjoyed ploughing my passion for rugby back into coaching . <p> Sport24asked : What is the role of a modern day wing and how has it changed since your career ? <p> Pieter Rossouw : During my playing days , the winger tended to be an out-and-out finisher . Nowadays , the wing gets much more involved in play . Thus , he has to have excellent aerial skills because the game has changed and the defensive structures are so sound . The tendency is for teams to now pick wingers that are really big and physically imposing . Wingers today are used to generate momentum and not just to finish off try-scoring opportunities . Wingers in the modern game also have to boast a high work-rate and the stuff they do off the ball is just as important . Bryan Habana is such an impressive athlete because he 's improved his work-rate and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you become a valuable player for your team . Along with the physical side of the game -- he has maintained an excellent level of conditioning -- the reason Habana is heading to his third consecutive World Cup is because he retains a hunger to be successful and compete at the highest level . He has proved a phenomenal player and is a great ambassador for South African sport at large . <p> Sport24 asked : You scored 21 tries in a six-year Springbok career . Was your try in the 13-3 win over the All Blacks in Wellington ( ' 98 Tri-Nations ) the most crucial five-pointer you ever scored ? <p> Pieter Rossouw : That was probably the team 's most important try . It came about at an important stage and set us up for a crucial away win . Henry Honiball and I had spoken about doing something different on attack and he was the one who suggested that move , which we practiced once or twice during the week . The All Blacks had never seen that move before and so had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry moved right , did a shimmy and then played it back to me as I came in from the left wing . I ended up scoring right under the posts which was special . The Test at Athletic Park was the 50th meeting between South Africa and New Zealand which was a milestone in itself . <p> Sport24 asked : You played at the 1999 Rugby World Cup . Your memories from that tournament ? <p> Pieter Rossouw : I have special memories of the tournament which was also held in the UK . Our 44-21 win over England in the quarterfinal -- when Jannie de Beer slotted a record five drop goals -- was unbelievable and will remain etched in my memory . On the flipside , the extra-time drop goal loss in the semi-final against Australia was a sore point for a long time to come . But all-in-all , the 1999 World Cup was a great experience and we managed to beat the All Blacks 22-18 to claim third place . I enjoyed working under Nick Mallett . He was a passionate coach , a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His drive to be successful was one the main reasons he held a 71 percent win rate during his time as Springbok coach from 1997 until 2000 . From what I have observed , Heyneke Meyer possesses the same characteristics regarding the passion to be successful . <p> Sport24 asked : Namibia tackle the All Blacks in their first fixture in Pool C. Meanwhile , South Africa could theoretically face New Zealand in the semi-final . How do you beat the men in black ? <p> Pieter Rossouw : For us , it will be tough to beat the defending world champions because , as I outlined previously , we do n't boast many professional rugby players in our squad . However , the guys have shown plenty of courage and character , and we 'll certainly give it our best shot . Play tactically well and you can put the All Blacks under pressure . However , to beat the top-ranked team in world rugby , you have to be switched on for the full 80 minutes and be accurate in everything that you do . Deciding when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such strategy is also be dependent on the weather conditions . The Springboks have displayed in recent times they are capable of beating the All Blacks , and have found success against the men in black when they have varied their play . <p> 24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our Comments Policy .

@@3559236 <h> Taming Jaguar 's bodacious F-Type <p> . Jaguar 's gorgeous supercharged F-Type Coupe V8 is now offered in an all-wheel-drive version for those drivers for whom the two-wheel-drive model is just a little too wild . <p> ROAD TEST <p> Jaguar F-Type R coupe AWD <p> Bodacious was a fearsome bull . A hulking hunk of beef like no other . Bred to have cowboys shaking in their boots , literally . <p> Before his induction into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame and subsequent retirement in 1999 , he had rearranged the noses of many a poor rider , with a signature headbutt move unlike any other rodeo bull in history . One guy was so terrified of big Bodacious , that he wore a full-face hockey mask in an attempt to stay on him for for the full eight seconds . I wo n't say what happened . Too grim . <p> Where am I going with this ? Well , you 've probably heard references to rodeo in car reviews before , and I 've used them on occasion , but the first time I drove Jag 's 364kW supercharged V8 F-Type , with the traction control switched off , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's combination of instant torque spurts , a relatively short wheelbase , and a lively diff set-up resulted in another signature move -- this one involving the back wheels trying to overtake the front . Often . <p> This mega-Jag does 0-100km/h in just 4.1 seconds . <p> TAMING THE BEAST <p> Not that I want to draw direct comparisons between a frankly dangerous animal and a sportscar , but in the wrong hands the F-Type , even in its least powerful V6 trim , could rearrange a roadside hedge or two . So , you can imagine my surprise when Jag announced an even more powerful 5-litre supercharged V8 model with 405kW and an R badge to match . Madness . <p> Sometimes power wars can get out of hand in high-performance cars , and though this output does n't rank all too highly in the greater scheme of supercars , it 's certainly a handful in this particular chassis with drive to rear wheels only . I 'd advise any driver without Karate Kid reflexes to keep fingers far from the F-Type R 's Dynamic Stability Control ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift might be . <p> To be honest , 405kW and 680Nm is total overkill in the RWD F-Type . With DSC on , as it should be almost always , you 'll rarely get all the juice to the ground without its electronic leash reigning it in . But now , Jaguar has come to its senses by offering this very car ( in Coup ? guise only ) with all-wheel-drive , so now you get the big bandwidth fibre-optic data line and the high-speed router for full effect . <p> I must say though , that all of what I 've just said is utter hogwash if you drive like a normal human being without traction-breaking provocation via irresponsible stabs of the gas pedal . In which case , the all-wheel-drive F-Type behaves almost identically to its rear-drive counterpart . Perhaps the steering is a fraction heavier , but in most situations you 'd never know the difference . <p> HERE 'S WHERE YOU 'LL FEEL IT <p> The F-Type is strictly a two seater . <p> But , kick it with spurs , and the AWD version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that supercharged power down without losing a drop to wheelspin or into the electronically controlled ether . It 's as if Bodacious has been to finishing school . He 's the same beast , but not as buck-wild . He 'll still take you for the ride of your life , but now you do n't need to hang on for dear life . <p> Interestingly , Jag claims almost identical acceleration times between rear- and all-wheel-drive F-Type R Coup ? models . At 4.1 seconds from 0-100km/h the AWD version is just one-tenth quicker ( an added 80kg almost cancels the traction advantage ) , and our Vbox test gear almost perfectly corroborates the claims . We recorded identical 4.2 second times to 100km/h , and over the quarter-mile the AWD was two-hundredths quicker at 12.28 seconds . <p> Know that this is an incredibly loud car . As in most spicy Jaguars there 's a switchable exhaust flap activated with a button near the gear lever , but even even in Off mode those eight , force-fed cylinders blast from four tailpipes with sharp thunderclaps . <p> Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like the devil in a deep fryer . This sinister cackle and pop is actually backpressure on overrun , and it 's intentionally tuned this way . A round of applause is in order for Jaguar . Well done . <p> CLASSY COMMAND CENTRE <p> From the driver 's seat the current F-Type 's interior is the same as was when originally launched in 2013 , but this is fine as Jaguar 's done a fine job with detail . Almost every inch of the dash and seats is covered with the hide of Bodacious ' relatives , all stitched together with nanometre perfection . Eagle eyes will notice that latest F-Types have a new instrument cluster , sharper graphics in the 8 " touchscreen system and a slightly improved navigation system . I also noticed that the copper-coloured shift paddles and console accents found in earlier models have been changed to harder wearing silver . <p> The cockpit is confined and like in any true sportscar you sit deep in seats with windows at shoulder height . This is a strict two-seater with a bulkhead directly behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of usable boot space under the electronic tailgate . The Convertible in comparison , gets only a tiny nook big enough for two small bags . Removing the spare wheel in either does free up some space , and in the Coup ? there might be enough for some weekend away luggage . <p> VERDICT <p> The additional traction afforded by all-wheel-drive has made it much easier to use what the F-Type R can dish up . Seriously skilled drivers might prefer the edgier and tail-happier rear-wheel-drive version , but mere mortals will have a more rewarding driving experience with both axles in check . This reward does come at a cost though , and at R1 760 187 the AWD model is 73 grand more expensive than the buck-wild RWD F-Type R. Beats hedge trimming and hockey masks , though . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@3567230 <h> Rugby Springboks <h> Pieter-Steph 's miraculous path back to Boks <p> Springbok lock Pieter-Steph du Toit 's journey back to the national team after a devastating knee injury is the stuff that miracles are made of . <p> While the lock battled his way back from torn cruciate ligaments that almost certainly had put him out of the Rugby World Cup , the story of how he returned to play a test match just more than a 100 days after being injured is an amazing one involving an operation that has never been done in South Africa before and a father who gave up more than most to give his son a chance of playing at this year 's World Cup . <p> Du Toit probably never had such a low point in his life as on the 14th of March this year , where he twisted his knee in the Cell C Sharks 29-10 win over the Toyota Cheetahs in Bloemfontein . His World Cup dream looked over . <p> While lying on the field waiting for the stretcher he asked the team doctor Dr Alan Kourie if his cruciate ligaments were off -- or torn so badly that he needed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , " the doctor replied . <p> Later that night the scan confirmed the worst , that Du Toit 's ligaments were torn , and that the normal rehabilitation period was six months , a period that would have put him virtually out of contention for a World Cup place . <p> But a chance discussion with the surgeon -- Dr Willem van der Merwe -- and his father Pieter du Toit 's decision to accompany him to the appointment changed everything , and showed the sacrifice a parent is willing to make for his children . <p> With a replacement ligament three weeks away , Du Toit 's father spontaneously offered to donate his own , to the surprise of the doctor , and set in motion the events that will see the lock heading to the World Cup . <p> " Initially we would have had to wait for a cadaver to get a replacement ligament , " Du Toit explains , " That would have taken three to four weeks . But it was coincidental that my father went with me to the doctor 's appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody had thought about it until then , that it could work . <p> " The doctor phoned his colleagues in America and after consulting with them , they decided to go ahead . They did the scope and my dad was on the bed next to me . They did the operation and it went well . Otherwise we would have waited another three to four weeks . <p> " My dad jokes that he has a part of my contract at the moment , that he deserves a percentage of it , " the big lock laughs , " but those three or four weeks were the big difference why I am here today . He became a Springbok as well . " <p> The result was an operation that had never been done in South Africa before , groundbreaking medical technology which literally cut the recovery time down to three months , an exceptional difference in the life of a modern sportsman . <p> " Last time I was out of action for 11 months and this time I was out for three and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good -- when I 'm warmed up and raring to go its good , and when I 'm off the field and I train hard , there is a bit that I have to manage , " Du Toit admits , but just the mere fact he is back quicker than expected is something that brings out the big smile on his face . <p> Now that he has made it into the World Cup squad , Du Toit is a lot more philosophical about his situation , especially having undergone five operations for injuries in as many years . <p> " I had a difficult time with injuries as well . I had an operation for every year I 've been in Durban . I had five operations in five years -- two ankle ops , a chest op and two knee ops . It was very difficult but it taught me to vasbyt , to carry on and to learn to do things on my own . <p> " All my injuries were freak accidents and I 've always been one who can look past these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and do rehab . In the last two years I 've learnt a lot about vasbyt and patience . You learn a lot about yourself in these situations and it is something that only you can sort out , to get your head straight and make yourself stronger . " <p> But while there is a wave of expectation about his abilities , the young lock is happy to wear that mantle . <p> " It 's lekker that people expect a lot from me . It gives me a peaceful feeling that people believe in you . Nobody can take it away from me that I have talent and that I was good in the past . I will just work harder in the future to get back to that point . " <p> The Riebeeckstad lock has been selected for the Rugby World Cup as a utility forward , with his ability to play both blindside flank and in the second row , but he is clear about where he wants to play . <p> " I enjoy five because it gives you a bit of responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lineouts but I enjoy 7 as well . When I was Grade 11 they asked me to play lock and I did n't want to . So I was dropped to the second team and by the time we finished the season I was playing flank for the first team . I prefer lock , but seven is something I enjoy . Lock is the position I want to grow as a player though , " he adds . <p> Du Toit will return to the Stormers after the World Cup , to be closer to his family and his long-time girlfriend , and to rejoin the family wine business as well . But the reaction of him leaving the Sharks was something he did n't count on . <p> " It hurts sometimes when people do n't understand why you make decisions , " Du Toit says adding that he felt it was time to return home . <p> " It was good for me to get away from home , it did a lot for me as a person , and when I looked again I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing time , it was almost a fairytale , a dream , and perhaps I would have signed on again in Durban if I did n't wake up and realise its time to go home . <p> " I had a difficult time with injuries as well .

It was very difficult but it taught me to vasbyt , to carry on and to learn to do things on my own . The Sharks were very good to me and I will always be thankful for that . <p> " All my injuries were freak accidents and I 've always been one who can look past these things . I get over it and know I have to train hard and do rehab . In the last two years I 've learnt a lot about vasbyt and patience . You learn a lot about yourself in these situations and it is something that only you can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . " <p> For now the World Cup is the priority , and the fact that Du Toit is boarding the plane to England should be celebration in itself . But having been given a second lease on life he now wants to make a difference and a contribution in the Bok campaign . <p> With his fellow young Bok locks in Lood de Jager and Eben Etzebeth the Boks will be equipped for the setpiece battle like never before .

There was not much movement and only a few were up . The others were still sleeping , " he said . <p> " There was lots of smoke and it was dark .

@@3570234 <h> Saturday Betting Pool Compromised <h> Do n't throw your losing Jackpot Quickmix tickets away ! <p> Following enquiries received by the Sporting Post from punters , we approached Vee Moodley 's Phumelela Gaming team for an explanation of the voiding of Saturday 's Jackpot Quickmix . <p> Phumelela 's General Manager of Sports Betting , Mervin Gamble confirmed earlier today that a technical error encountered on Saturday 's Jackpot Quickmix betpool had delayed the betpool from closing at the jump of the 2nd leg ( the first leg was Turffontein , which was abandoned ) , thereby compromising the betpool . <p> In terms of Tab Rule 2.13 the pool was refunded . <p> For the record , rule 2.13 states : <p> CLOSING TIMES OF POOLS : Bets must either be accepted by the wagering system of the Operator before the stated closing time or when the wagering system closes for the purposes of accepting bets for the particular pool for which the bet is placed . A bet can not be accepted after the result of the event is known , if a wagering system of the operator erroneously accepts a bet in this circumstance the bet would be refunded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betting Pool Compromised " <p> I am one of the " unfortunate " holders of a winning ticket , and the run legs were all upsets.I notice that the code for incompetence is " technical error " .

Last year the new Sol Plaatje University became the first in Africa to introduce a dedicated degree in data science .

The SKA will be constructed in Western Australia and in the Karoo in South Africa , and eight other African countries will help to host antennae spread over 3,000 kilometres . <p> Construction of the SKA is planned to start in Carnarvon , Northern Cape province , in 2017-18 with some elements operational by 2020 and with full operation in 2025 .

The current intake for the degree is around 30 students . <p> ? Other universities have recognised the urgent need to develop programmes in the area of big data to be globally competitive in SKA research and are starting up programmes at postgraduate level and appointing senior staff with data science backgrounds , ? she said . <p> The Department of Science and Technology , or DST , was supporting postgraduate students through grants by institutions like the Centre for High Performance Computing or CHPC . ? For the past three years , an average of 15 postgraduate ( masters and doctoral ) students per year graduated from CHPC-supported programmes. ? <p> Further , said Pandor , the government-funded National Integrated Cyber-Infrastructure System , through its Data Intensive Research Initiative for South Africa or DIRISA , would support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation space . <p> ?

@@3570236 <h> Health-e News : Mothers and children are collateral damage in immigration clampdown <p> HEALTH-E NEWS <p> HEALTH-E NEWS <p> South Africa <p> 06 Sep 2015 08:42 ( South Africa ) <p> The National Health Act states clearly that all uninsured pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under six get receive free healthcare , regardless of their nationality . But some Gauteng health workers are refusing to implement this , as demonstrated by the recent death of a Zimbabwean woman 's premature baby while nurses allegedly stood by . LAURA LOPEZ GONZALEZ for HEALTH-E NEWS reports on how mothers and babies are the latest victims of South Africa 's clampdown on immigration . <p> In August , Eyewitness News reported that a Zimbabwean woman watched her baby die as Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital nurses not only allegedly refused to help her but also called her stupid . <p> The baby 's death came a month after Health-e News reported that Pholosong Hospital on Johannesburg 's East Rand was allegedly withholding babies from foreign mothers who could not pay R940 for their delivery at the hospital . At Leratong Hospital , one Zimbabwean mother said health workers threatened to have her arrested if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also reported that nurses threatened to deny health services to the babies of foreign mothers who could not pay upfront in cash ) . <p> But the National Health Act is clear : public health facilities must provide free health services to all uninsured pregnant and breastfeeding women , and children below the age of six years . Until a health minister publishes conditions to the contrary , this applies to all women and children fulfilling these criteria , regardless of nationality . <p> Like many of South Africa 's national health policies , this policy is progressive and evidence-based . Sierra Leone adopted the policy in 2010 . Within a year , the country had seen massive reductions in maternal complications and a 60% decline in maternal mortality , according to the United Nations Children 's Fund . <p> In South Africa , the HIV epidemic caused maternal deaths to almost double in two decades . The country has seen recent reductions in maternal deaths under Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi , although the death rate remains high . <p> Incidents at Gauteng hospitals prompted disciplinary action against three Rahima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and official statements . But official comments betray a dangerous and lingering confusion among officials about national policy . It is a confusion that has filtered down to hospitals and clinics , sabotaging a policy that could save mothers ' lives . <p> In the wake of the Rahima Moosa Hospital incident , Democratic Alliance shadow health MEC Jack Bloom issued a statement detailing the numbers of foreign mothers who delivered at the hospital last year . Zimbabwean women , followed by those from war-torn Somalia topped the list of mums who were said to comprise about a quarter of births at the hospital . <p> But foreign women do n't always give birth to " foreign " babies , and the figures make no mention of the nationalities of these babies or their fathers ' nationality . According to the Gauteng health department , it has yet to compile figures on this . <p> According to Bloom : " The hospital is clearly taking strain with the extra influx of foreigners , some of whom come directly to deliver and then return home . " <p> When asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far away as Pakistan came to Johannesburg specifically to deliver their babies , Bloom admitted evidence was anecdotal . " Anecdotally , there are stories about women coming specifically to give birth , and the department acknowledges this too , " Bloom said . <p> Jo Veary , a senior researcher at the University of the Witswatersrand 's ( Wits ' ) African Centre for Migration and Society , says there is very little if any research to show that women are flocking to South Africa in numbers to give birth . <p> " There is this assumption that all non-nationals are travelling to South Africa in order to access public healthcare services . But there is quite a large body of research that has been building over the last few years that indicates people do n't report moving to South Africa to access public healthcare , " said Veary , who also cautioned that figures from the hospital were not widely generalisable . <p> " Honestly , blaming foreigners for the failure to organise the public health services properly is the worst kind of xenophobia , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've worked in the public sector for over 20 years , and the problems we see are largely due to poor human resource and supply line management , and the disease burden related to local failure of poverty relief programmes and poor organisation of services -- not a handful of foreigners who are here for jobs , not for healthcare . " <p> But the idea of the " medical tourist mom " is a convenient myth . A clause in the National Health Act allows people travelling for medical care to be charged although proving women are travelling for medical care would be difficult . <p> " There 's all this rhetoric about supposed anecdotal evidence ... but how do you prove that ? " Veary asked . " We 're not seeing people move for healthcare . If you are a pregnant woman , you do n't have to prove anything . " <p> In his statement about foreign mothers , Bloom added that while the Gauteng health department stressed that any woman in labour must be admitted to health facilities , it was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal documents from patients . <p> Sasha Stevenson , an attorney with the public interest law organisation Section27 , says confusion over paperwork may be why National Health Act provisions regarding mothers and young children are not being implemented . <p> " Hospitals need some proof of ID to see a patient and they also need proof of income , " said Stevenson . " There seems to be a failure on the part of people asking for this information to communicate what they need and how it can be provided . <p> " They ask for an ID book or asylum-seekers/refugee permit sometimes and if the patient ca n't provide that document , they are turned away , " she added . " ( Patients ) are n't told that they can provide other forms of ID such as a foreign passport or affidavit . " <p> " Patients then fail to cross the first hurdle , " said Stevenson , who added that some foreign patients are generally not allowed to submit proof of income or substitute declaration of income forms . This means they end up being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written response to questions , Gauteng health department spokesperson Steve Mabona said that when patients ' income and immigration statuses could not be ascertained , they are regarded as full-paying private patients , " which is the case with most ' undocumented ' foreign nationals " . <p> Gauteng 's own Patient Classification Manual Policy is very clear . While the manual requires paperwork stating income from all patients , it is clear that uninsured pregnant and breastfeeding women and children below the age of six years are entitled to free health services . <p> According to Stevenson and Veary , this absolves uninsured pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and young children from typical means tests used to determine patient co-payments for public health services . <p> " The care available to pregnant women is n't just care linked to their pregnancy , " said Stevenson , who explained that if a pregnant woman or new mum broke her leg , this should also be treated free of charge . <p> The manual also states that documented or undocumented citizens of countries within the Southern African Development Community should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabona contradicted the policy in his response and maintained that uninsured pregnant and breastfeeding women and children below the age of six years must undergo means tests . <p> But he also acknowledged confusion among health workers : " There is great confusion around what services ( if any ) should be accorded to the ever increasing numbers of undocumented foreign nationals who wish medical attention , " he wrote . " This ( has ) brought about conflict between reporting them to the police and providing care . This is indeed a difficult choice that our healthcare workers face " . <p> " There are legal issues at play in that these are actually regarded as illegals -- by law -- whereas healthcare workers have an obligation of both morality and profession , " he added . <p> But it should not be up to healthcare workers to make " choices " about who to treat . Doctors and nurses should n't be expected to be immigration officers and the law provides for that . <p> " The Immigration Act is very clear that someone providing humanitarian assistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes everyone from the receptionist to the surgeon , " Veary said . " It 's not the obligation of healthcare providers to act as immigration officers . " <p> She added that much of the confusion is likely to stem from particularly problematic 2013 guidelines , which Veary described as a horrible " cut and paste job " and which contradicts the latest policy . <p> Stevenson also stressed that healthcare workers needed clear messages : " What is needed is clear communication from the Gauteng and preferably also the national Department of Health about the rights of migrants and what staff members should do when a migrant is seeking care , " she said . " There is n't that kind of communication and so we continue to see people being turned away . " <p> The national Department of Health did not reply to requests for comment .

@@3570237 <p> Just as newsrooms are settling into their social media workflows , the mobile-driven chat app trend is presenting new challenges likely to cause upheaval . All over again . <p> " Unlike most technology trends , which travel from West to East , this is a trend travelling from East to West , " says Trushar Barot , the BBC 's mobile editor . " And so I think it 's quite possible that within a year or two this user behaviour -- which is sort of second-nature to people in Korea , Japan , South America -- will travel westward and become second-nature to a lot of people in the West as well . " <p> Since receiving less than 1% of global web traffic in 2009 , mobile 's share of traffic has boomed to 33.4% in 2015 -- and about half of that growth has come in the past two years . In countries like Nigeria and India , over 70% of web traffic comes through mobile users . <p> In terms of active users of social media platforms , the mobile messaging apps WhatsApp , Facebook Messenger and WeChat each garner more users than Instagram , Twitter or Tumblr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social platforms at the start of 2015 were chat apps . <p> The percentage of internet users on WhatsApp globally rose from 16% in 2013 to 24% in 2014 . In countries like Malaysia , South Africa and Singapore , over 70% of mobile internet users are on WhatsApp . And in countries where it does n't do so well , like China , South Korea and Japan ( where less than 4% of mobile internet users are on the app ) , it is usually because another chat app -- WeChat , Kakao Talk , or Line -- beat them to it . <p> For the world 's firsttime internet users , it 's mobile-first <p> " In terms of internet users , " says Barot , " If you 're looking at how many of them are getting connected to the internet for the first time in many parts of the world , it 's usually through people buying their first smartphone , and usually their first interaction with their friends and co-workers is through a chat app . So that becomes the de facto social network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about to come online for the first time are likely to do it through chat platforms , rather than the more traditional platforms , which is why he believes they are so important for a global news organisation like the BBC to consider in their strategy . <p> " In some ways , it 's just a simple calculation that it 's the app that the most people already use on their mobile phones , " says Barot . " It 's the same thing as social media years ago , where we wanted to have a presence on Twitter , because that 's where people were spending their time online . " <p> So it 's that well-worn mantra of " go where your audience is " that could pull newsrooms out of their Facebook and Twitter burrows into these younger social media spaces . But the new opportunities these chat apps offer in terms of sourcing news , telling it through creative and engaging means , and distributing it , might be enough of an inducement for change-fatigued newsrooms to experiment with these new platforms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the news organisations mapping these new frontiers , using chat apps such as WhatsApp , Line and WeChat ( Japan and China 's leading chat apps , respectively ) to connect with people during disasters , elections or pandemics . <p> To determine when to bring in chat apps as part of the BBC 's strategy , Barot uses a three-circle Venn diagram to determine if a chat app will be effective . The BBC Ebola project was one of the most recent where Barot integrated chat apps into reporting and engagement . <p> " The Ebola WhatsApp Project team have built up a subscriber base of about 20,000-odd people , primarily in West Africa , who are getting daily news from our team with public health information and content , " says Barot . <p> The service delivers simple text , highly visual and easy-to-understand content , and audio in English and French to its subscribers , but it has also been able to operate as a two-way communication service . <p> " A lot of those users have also been providing us with tremendous amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to get through any other means , particularly because in a lot of those countries there 's a lot of security and health protocols that our correspondents have to go through before they 're allowed to be on the ground , " says Barot . <p> " And equally we 've found with other cases ... it 's been much easier for the people who are on these chat apps to send their messages or their content through these platforms than through any other means we can offer them , " says Barot . " So that 's become really useful getting that sort of audience newsgathering coming in as well . " <p> From global to local <p> This is what the Oxford Mail found after six months of experimenting with morning and afternoon updates through WhatsApp . The UK regional daily had a print circulation of about 12,700 at the beginning of 2014 -- a 22.9% fall from the previous year -- but their six months of WhatsApp bulletins won them more than 1 200 subscribers to the app , with a conversion rate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily email bulletin , and six or seven times greater than Twitter , according to the Guardian . <p> Alessio Balbi , the head of audience development at Italy 's Gruppo Espresso and Repubblica.it , says chat apps are an opportunity for small newsrooms . " In this field , being a big player could actually be a limit , whereas if you address a local community chat apps are a powerful tool . For a big newsroom to handle something like 50 000 users is very challenging and consuming in terms of time and resources , and the return is limited . But if your audience is more contained and you get to turn a community of 1 000 , 2 000 people , into loyal users -- it 's a remarkable success . " <p> Experiment and learn <p> " One of the things we really learnt last year , " says Barot , " was just understanding how users behave on those chat platforms compared to social networks , and what lessons we could learn in terms of how we can devise plans that work specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that was through a lot of trial and error . " <p> Snapchat , the app best known for being used by young people to send their more sordid snaps to each other -- which are then almost instantly wiped from digital memory -- became more apparently useful to newsrooms when it launched its Discover feature in January . <p> The partnership with select media companies internationally , which each deliver a daily ' edition ' to live on the app for 24 hours , has been received with huge interest . <p> In the Fusion newsroom , a joint venture of Univision and ABC ( US ) has been created to reach a younger TV audience . International editor Santiago Tarditi explains how a team of five people are experimenting with Snapchat to find new ways of engaging a crowd of young people who see Facebook as ' their parent 's social media ' . <p> " From a journalistic point of view Snapchat Discover gives you a lot of creative space and a lot of wriggle-room to experiment and try different features , " says Tarditi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US and UK ( the base of the bulk of Fusion 's audience ) , Tarditi is enthusiastic about the early results . " We ca n't disclose any numbers , " says Tarditi , " but I have to say it 's mind-blowing ... and the figures have been very constant . " <p> However , three months after the launch of the Discover feature the buzz was fading , along with audience reach , with figures showing drops of up to 50% in unique views according to The Information . <p> A shift for TV broadcasting <p> If the app makes this feature open platform -- or if another app dethrones Snapchat and includes a feature which does the same -- then it could have massive impact on the news industry . <p> " I feel it 's kind of the way forward for the company , and for media as a whole , " says Tarditi . <p> " I think we 're still a long way from seeing TV become an underdog . It 's still our main platform and our main source of income in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that there 's a new generation of consumers that are more interested in news being delivered straight to their mobile phones . " <p> As these networks evolve , " says Tarditi , " So will the TV networks , and we 'll adapt to whatever features they offer , and at the same time grow with them . " <p> Some of this adaptation is already happening -- in one very visible way in particular . Snapchat 's statistics reveal that portrait video ads get up to nine times more viewing completions than landscape ads on the app , and the Discover partners have been playing around with portrait video news too , as they adjust to the app . <p> " It 's almost forcing them to think in new ways about how their content can be consumed on a mobile phone , " says the BBC 's Trushar Barot , who asks if we are about to see the emergence of an acceptance of portrait style video display . " Suddenly you 're faced with having to create portrait video , which is a really alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagining video in 4:3 or 16:9 format . " <p> " And so editorially thinking , how are we going to work ? It makes sense for somebody viewing it on a mobile phone because ... if you 're forcing a user to flip their phone over horizontally then that 's a bad user experience , " says Barot . <p> However , Barot agrees that it is " a mistake to think that news on the big screen is dead " , and people will still want to see dramatic stories on a big screen . " Where I think the challenge is going to be , is how people first hear about a major story that 's emerging , and in that sense it 's very likely to be on their mobile phones , " says Barot . <p> " The battle for the home screen of mobile phones is going to be intense , and the strategy for how you win that battle is going to be really interesting . " <p> Fusion 's Snapchat strategy " <p> For the digital-first Fusion network , the strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market -- such as Vine , Meerkat and Periscope . Tarditi says the network has been trying to feed " snack components of content " to an audience always on the run and hungry for creative content . <p> " What we see is that people on Snapchat , and in general on the internet , have a very short attention span , so we really have to gain their interest in any way possible , and that 's with moving images , with sound , with animation , and so on , " says Tarditi . The Fusion team have even played around with stop-motion and clay animations , which can be as simple as a quick animation ( in portrait-style ) with a goofy sound effect . " We try to always keep it upbeat and light . " <p> One of Fusion 's attempts to gain interest was with their seven episode ' Outpost ' series of mini-documentaries launched exclusively on the Snapchat platform . Each episode tells an off-the-beaten-path story from Latin America , and Tarditi says " they are one of the best performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifespan on the app , the episodes then move into Fusion 's other spaces on the web and social media , with some of them making it to television . " What we 're trying to tell our audience , " says Tarditi , " Is : ' Hey , check out Discover , because this is where things are going to be premiering , and this is where you 're going to be able to see them before anywhere else . " <p> It 's a bold move to launch content exclusively on a platform that has no sharing function and depends almost entirely on word-of-mouth , but Tarditi says they see " very positive engagement " with the stories and that people take conversations to Twitter ( where Fusion also have a Snapchat-specific @FusionSnaps account ) or email when it is worth talking about . <p> Be ready for constant change <p> It can be overwhelming for journalists or a newsroom to try to adapt to the constant change and unfamiliarity of a swathe of new platforms , but Tarditi advises that " experimenting is the key . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the specific virtues and functionalities that different apps have . <p> " It ca n't just be generic content that gets reposted from Facebook to Twitter to Whatsapp , you need to think much more carefully about what works on each platform , " says Barot .

" <p> Using chat apps for crisis reporting and verification <p> Chat apps do n't just bring chances to test new ways of reaching people , however . When student activist Joshua Wong Chi-Fung told protesters taking to the streets of Hong Kong last year to download the off-the-grid messaging app FireChat in case of an internet blackout , journalists saw the chance for a new method of sourcing news . The masses of people on the streets overwhelmed internet servers and rendered social media networks unusable , except for the chat room app FireChat , since it uses Bluetooth and person-to-person Wi-Fi to create a " mesh " network of phones connected directly with each other . So the crowds of people strengthened that network , and it could operate even without an internet connection . <p> " What happened in Hong Kong , though , you had no idea who was who since users can be anonymous and every time there was misinformation it spread on the app , " says FireChat 's chief marketing officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying the army is coming , they 're loading assault rifles now with bullets , you guys need to run for your lives . It was n't true , " says Daligault . The FireChat team responded by bringing in journalists with verified accounts to sort information as it broke . Recently they partnered with Storyful , the news verification service , to try and filter authentic news through their chat rooms as it breaks . <p> The app is still chaotic , but the Storyful partnership will help the FireChat team to develop the app to work more effectively for journalists , and it could be a way towards a breaking news app which sifts out misinformation . <p> Even if journalists would rather rest on Twitter , they may be forced onto chat apps to find news . When Russian politician Alexei Navalny was arrested earlier this year after breaking house arrest to go to a protest , he told his 25 000 followers on FireChat that he had been arrested and urged them to carry on with their protests . The app sent out a push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the news , as traditional SMS , Whatsapp and similar chat apps have capacity to do . <p> For journalists trying to protect an anonymous source , they might not find much use in *FireChat , since all chat rooms are public ( though they are working on creating private chat rooms ) . But in places where internet access is limited or cut off , it could be a way for journalists to connect with people without actually being on the ground . In Hong Kong , verified journalists brought into the app were able to chat with protesters on the street " directly , without the risk of getting tear-gassed or coming up against a water cannon , " Daligault says . <p> Kinks in an evolving system <p> There are other challenges currently facing chat apps .

My instinct is that as these companies begin to mature , they engineer their products to the point where a lot more functionality gets put in . " <p> " I think what this has taught us is that our content no longer has to be fed in the traditional way , " says Tarditi . " Platforms like Snapchat Discover allow for this way of feeding content -- to be reshaped and formed again -- in a way where content lives first on mobile and then migrates to other platforms .

@@3570238 <h> Girl power ! <p> OPINION : So , the theme running through the August edition of The Media was women . And accordingly , it was only right and proper that I too ventured an opinion on the opposite sex . Harry Herber wonders why men have the gall to believe that they 're the superior sex . <p> Now , to kick off , I 've mused about why no magazine on earth would run an edition dedicated to men ? Indeed , no-one would start a movement to save the battered men of this world -- and we know there are many of them ! Really , nobody goes up to a guy on a plane and offers to help him get his hand-luggage into the storage bin . But perhaps that 's because no man boards a plane with hand luggage consisting of a handbag weighing 10kg , an overnight bag the size of a coffin and three bags bearing logos of airport shops ( who in God 's name shops at the airport ? ) . Plus there 's the computer bag , three magazines , a hat and a wooden giraffe . And to add insult to injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called limited bin space and " Bloody SAA ... " <p> I can already hear the screams of " Crucify the small -dicked bastard ! " so let me hastily change tack and look at the reality of women in advertising and the communications world , and plainly put my stake in the ground . Truthfully , I 'd rather have one woman available in times of stress than 10 guys . True . But I really could n't put my finger on why this is so . I therefore turned to trusty Google , read 20 different articles on the subject , and now believe I can put facts on the table proving female superiority on the one hand , and why they currently form the backbone of the advertising and communication industry in South Africa on the other . <p> Here are just a few reasons why this industry relies on women <p> Simply , they 're just smarter than men . Really . Females worldwide have higher IQs than males . I attribute this in the main to women not playing rugby , drinking marginally less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal and never watching wrestling on TV . In fact the highest IQ ever measured was that of a woman who scored an incredible reading of 228 . Now that 's equal to the whole of a sold-out Loftus on a Saturday ... <p> Then there 's the ' multi ' thing . No , not multiple orgasms , another thing men envy , but multi-tasking . Ninety-nine percent of buyers in this industry are women . They deal with four or five clients simultaneously . It 's no problem juggling rate negotiations and simultaneously emailing , booking , chasing material , phoning and commenting on someone 's ridiculously short dress that really " management should say something about " . ( BTW , management invariably is saying something about it ! ) <p> Men , unfortunately , just ca n't do two things at once . The perfect example ? When men take a magazine into the bathroom and shut the door . It takes 25 minutes for them to work out what to do , in what order , and which paper to use for what ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- another reason women are smarter . You can toilet train them . Think about it , women can aim . Without being able to see ! Men can see , hold and direct . So why is it that men pee on the seat ! ? <p> I know we men believe that we 're physically stronger , more adept , and can at least master physical challenges better than women . Well , it 's just not true . C'm on guys ! Admit you 've all tried to walk in a pair of high heels . And it 's just bloody impossible . Yet every woman can do it without any practise ! Plus to our absolute chagrin , tell me how it 's possible to sit down in a skirt measuring four inches long and never ever give a glimpse of underwear . Do n't pretend you 've never noticed . No , sorry , physically too , women can match men any day of the week . <p> The final evidence that shows just how smart women are is how they can cut men out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who in hell really knows what a JT is ? Or a window treatment ? HRT ? A wedge heel ? A bob cut ? What do they mean when they say it 's " fine " ? Or when they ask you which shoe looks better with the outfit ? They always wear the one you did n't suggest anyway . <p> I think it 's clear that this column has been written by someone belonging to the inferior sex . The one in second place . Finally , to all the women in this great communication industry , I salute your superiority . To all the ignorant blokes out there I ask you , did you even know there was such a thing as a " vagina steam " ? <p> This story was first published in the August 2015 issue of The Media magazine .

This means a fund may not have the best outright performance over either three or five years , but it has performed well consistently over these periods and without taking on risks that expose you to sudden periods of poor performance . <p> When it comes to choosing a fund , you can take some comfort from the fact that a fund with a good PlexCrown rating has a track record of good risk-adjusted performance over five years , rather than just being a top performer over a particular quarter , with no guarantee of what it may deliver the next quarter . This is as good as you can get when using historical performance as a measure , since the past is no guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance deviating from past good performance : a star portfolio manager might resign from a fund management company , the company might change its investment process or strategy , or the fund might reach a size that inhibits its future performance . <p> The PlexCrown Ratings rate each fund with a single score , which is determined from two or three different risk-adjusted performance measures and one or two measures of a manager 's skill over the three- and five-year periods , with a higher weighting given to the longer-term measures . The rating is from one to five PlexCrowns , with one being the poorest score , three the average and five the best . <p> Comfort of a leading company <p> The winner of the Raging Bull Award for Management Company of the Year is determined on the basis of each company 's average PlexCrown rating in four broad unit trust sectors or asset classes ( equity and real estate , interest-bearing , multi-asset and global and worldwide ) where the sizes of each of the company 's qualifying funds in that sector are taken into account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall score . The overall average determined in the PlexCrown Ratings Survey of Management Companies identifies the unit trust company with consistent , good risk-adjusted performance across the broad asset classes over five years . <p> The size-weighted average scores in these broad sectors for the top five managers , based on performance to the end of December last year , are shown graphically -- see link at the end of this article . <p> Winning formula <p> Coronation 's consistently good overall performance is reflected in its average scores across the four sectors -- three above four PlexCrowns and one above three PlexCrowns . Coronation has 19 funds that qualify for PlexCrown ratings , and a good proportion of them -- 15 -- achieved either the highest or the second highest rating of four or five PlexCrowns . <p> The manager 's highest average rating was for its South African interest-bearing funds ( 4.988 PlexCrowns ) , the second-best score after Community Growth . In this sector , the Jibar Plus Fund , aimed at short-term investors looking for a cash-like investment with slightly better returns than cash itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor who needs a reliable , growing income , each achieved a score of five PlexCrowns . <p> Coronation 's second-highest score was for its South African multi-asset funds ( excluding income funds ) . In this sector , Coronation achieved a score of 4.820 PlexCrowns and was in second place behind joint winners Ashburton , Foord and Rezco , all with a perfect score of five PlexCrowns . In this sector , the funds that contributed to Coronation 's high average score were its fund with a high exposure to equities ( the Balanced Plus Fund ) and one with a lower exposure to equities ( the Balanced Defensive Fund ) , each of which obtained the highest rating of five PlexCrowns in their sub-categories . <p> For the performance of its global and worldwide funds , Coronation achieved an average PlexCrown rating of 4.193 , coming third after Old Mutual and Foord . <p> Coronation 's high-equity multi-asset global fund ( the Global Managed Feeder Fund ) , its lower equity multi-asset fund ( the Global Capital Plus Fund ) and its fund that seeks out the best-performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund ) had the highest rating of five PlexCrowns each on a risk-adjusted basis . <p> Coronation 's weakest performance relative to its performance in the other broad sectors was in the South African equity and real estate sector , where the manager scored 3.370 PlexCrowns . <p> In this sector , Coronation 's Top 20 Fund detracted from its performance . The fund achieved a PlexCrown rating of three , but because the fund is large ( R22.03 billion ) it was given a 65-percent weighting in the calculation of the average of all Coronation 's equity and real estate funds . <p> The Top 20 Fund , a good performer for many years , under-performed its benchmark and peers last year after taking a " healthy exposure " to selected commodity shares and being largely underweight in retail shares . Coronation says the fund will have periods of under-performance , because it takes investment views contrary to popular opinion in order to generate good long-term performance . <p> Coronation 's Equity Fund achieved four PlexCrowns and was ranked ninth out of 82 equity funds over five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . <p> Stronger equity manager <p> Runner-up in the management company of the year rankings was PSG , which also achieved good , strong , consistent performance across its range of funds as reflected in its fund average size-weighted scores in the four sectors : most above four PlexCrowns and one above three PlexCrowns . <p> Beating Coronation 's average in the equity and real estate sector , PSG achieved an average of 4.147 PlexCrowns , but in the global and worldwide sector it showed relatively weaker performance , with 3.000 PlexCrowns . <p> PSG has 12 funds that qualify for the PlexCrown Ratings . Its local PSG Equity Fund and its multi-asset Balanced Fund each obtained five PlexCrowns and all but two others obtained four PlexCrowns . <p> PSG has only one global fund -- a multi-asset flexible fund of funds that invests in offshore funds managed by Coronation , Foord , Investec , Nedgroup and RE:CM -- that qualifies for a PlexCrown rating , hence its middle-of-the-road rating in this sector . <p> Locally strong , weaker offshore <p> Nedgroup Investments was placed third , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer in all sectors , with its relative weakness being in the equity and real estate sector . <p> Nedgroup achieved its best fund size-weighted average score , 4.360 PlexCrowns , in the South African multi-asset sector ( excluding income funds ) . On this score it ranked fifth behind Ashburton , Foord , Rezco and Coronation . <p> Nedgroup 's five-PlexCrown Stable Fund is its top performer in this sector . Nedgroup outsources the management of its funds to managers that it regards as the " best of breed " , and its Stable Fund is managed by Foord . <p> Nedgroup achieved its second-highest average score with its funds in the global and worldwide sector . It obtained 3.893 PlexCrowns in this sector , but none of its global or worldwide funds achieved the highest rating of five PlexCrowns . <p> Nedgroup obtained an above-average 3.805 PlexCrowns for the management of fixed income and multi-asset income funds . In this sector , Nedgroup 's Flexible Income Fund , its multi-asset income fund managed by Abax Investments , was its leading performer , achieving five PlexCrowns . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nedgroup scored 3.266 PlexCrowns . Its star performers in this sector were all specialist equity funds : its financial fund , small-cap equity fund and mining and resources fund all achieved the highest rating of five PlexCrowns . <p> Prudential was placed fourth in the management company rankings , and while its funds that invest in local markets show good , consistent performance , its weakness in foreign markets is obvious . <p> Prudential has nine funds that qualify for PlexCrown Ratings . Six achieved the second-highest rating of four PlexCrowns , while its two foreign funds achieved low scores of one and two PlexCrowns . The Global Value Fund of Funds and the Global Cautious Managed Fund are managed locally and invest in underlying mutual funds and exchange traded funds from around the world , including those of Prudential 's parent company in the United Kingdom , M&amp;G . <p> Prudential 's star performer is its low-equity multi-asset fund , the Inflation Plus Fund . This fund was ranked first over both five and 10 years to the end of 2014 on straight performance . <p> Down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inclusion in the PlexCrown Ratings , Allan Gray has been either the leading fund manager or a runner-up . But , on its risk-adjusted performance to the end of 2014 , weak performance by its offshore sister company , Orbis , is clear from its average scores , and resulted in its fall in the management company rankings . <p> Allan Gray scored an average of 2.084 PlexCrowns for the performance of its two global funds : the Allan Gray-Orbis Global Equity Feeder Fund and the Allan Gray-Orbis Global Fund of Funds . <p> Its best scores were in the local equity and real estate sector , where the manager has only an equity fund ( which scored four PlexCrowns ) , and in the local interest-bearing sector , where its Bond Fund scored four PlexCrowns . <p> In the past , Allan Gray has scored well in the multi-asset sector , where it has three funds , but its latest score was a more pedestrian , though still above average , 3.718 PlexCrowns .

It says these included companies in the energy sector and shares listed in countries where oil prices exerted a significant influence on the economy , such as Russia . The fall in the oil price also affected Sasol shares , held by the Allan Gray Equity , Balanced and Stable funds . <p> Local manager Oasis was the winner of the management company of the year award in 2007 , but on its performance to the end of 2014 , it ranked 12 out of 17 managers on the performance of its funds that invest in South African markets . However , its three offshore funds , domiciled in Ireland and denominated in foreign currencies , fared a lot better , earning Oasis the Raging Bull Award for the Offshore Management Company of the Year . <p> Two of the three funds , the Oasis Crescent Global Equity Fund and the Oasis Crescent Global Property Equity Fund , obtained five PlexCrowns each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on risk-adjusted returns . Oasis 's global equity fund achieved four PlexCrowns . <p> Awards on straight performance <p> Awards for the best South African equity fund , South African interest-bearing fund , rand-denominated global equity fund and offshore global equity fund are made on the basis of straight performance over three years . <p> A fund that has won an award on the basis of straight performance over three years may well have good , consistent performance over longer terms , but this award does not provide proof of it -- you will have to look at its longer-term performance as measured by the PlexCrown Ratings . <p> The award-winning Harvard House BCI General Equity Fund , for example , is the top performer in the South African general equity sub-category over three years , but it also performed well in its sub-category on risk-adjusted returns over five years as measured by the PlexCrown Ratings .

Having wheeled the children there in a double buggy , I 'd let them loose , expecting them to go off and make friends . <p> While Nick would settle himself on a grassy bank and watch the world go by , his sister would trot off to make friends for him . <p> He was like a little Buddha , solemnly receiving potential playmates , but never going off in search of any friends himself . <p> The saying goes : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you the man .

He was staggering around and saying his first words , but what I loved was how , every day , he learned something new . <p> One week he discovered how to put a blanket over his head and then remove it , to gales of laughter . We did this endlessly . <p> A week later he caught on to building towers of bricks and knocking them down . <p> It 's a non-verbal age , a time when you can play with your children spontaneously without any fear that what you say might be wrong . <p> It 's worlds away from the troubled teenage years , when even the phrase " You 're looking very nice !

These are reserved for embarrassing mother moments , when I attempt to do things at which I am woefully inept . He will say : " Mom , please stop trying to help me do my maths , you know you will only get it wrong . " <p> But while he may have a brain like a computer , that does n't mean he can remember anything useful , such as his wallet , keys or mobile phone . <p> Every day I run him through a checklist of what he needs and almost always there is a gasp and a swift trip upstairs to collect some vital item . <p> Once I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " debit card when he sheepishly came up and told me that , despite having " looked everywhere " , it had been hiding under his toy meerkat all along . <p> He 's my fascinating , hilarious and loving boy and , for now , he 's still young enough not to have grown out of his ancient , 43-year-old mom . <p> I have , of course , adored my boys from the moment I locked eyes with them as I held them in my arms for the first time . <p> But raising children is never an easy job and parental adoration can wax and wane . <p> And then , suddenly , you 're the mother of two , tall , dark and handsome men and you 're completely free to love them to bits without any of the pressure of discipline or worrying about exam results . <p> By 22 , they were qualified , workers , independent and , moreover , far better cooks than their parents . <p> Most importantly they were willing and able : " Ca n't you reach that lightbulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

They have challenged Africa 's progress towards better living and working spaces but they also provide shelter for the swelling populations seeking a life in cities . <p> Rural Africans are pouring into towns and cities in search of jobs and other opportunities , but African cities -- 25 of which are among the 100 fastest growing cities in the world -- are not delivering the much needed support services , including housing , at the same rate as people are demanding them . <p> The United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) projects that nearly 1.3 billion people -- more than the current population of China -- will be living in cities in Africa in the next 15 years . <p> Africa 's urbanisation rate of four percent a year is already over-stretching the capacity of its cities to provide adequate shelter , water , sanitation , energy and even food for its growing population . Safe and resilient cities and human settlements is one of the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) to be agreed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) launched in September 2000 , UN-Habitat has largely succeeded in meeting the target of taking 100 million people out of slums by the time the MDGs expired in Asia , China and part of India ... but not in Africa . <p> However , Tokunbo Omisore , past president of the African Architects Association , believes that Africa can solve its slums situation by planning and developing towns and cities that strike a balance in the provision of housing , water sanitation , energy and transport while luring investments to create jobs . <p> According to Omisore , the problem lies in the fact that so far settlements have been developed for people but not with people , and he asks if Africa wants the humane aspects of its cultural values and heritage reflected in its cities or has to replicate the cities of developed nations to become classified as developed . <p> " Slums and sprawls demand understanding the reasons and problems resulting in their existence and identifying the class of people living there , " says Omisore . <p> " African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration for the human development of our different communities and ensuring creation of employment opportunities which is key to the sustainability of our cities .

@@3632237 <h> Cape Town is a design Mecca <p> 29 Sep 2015 15:51Opinion <p> Christo Maritz , the owner of Infestation Design and founding member of Open Design Festival Cape Town says our country is proving to be a strong contender in the design arena , with Cape Town as the driving hub . <p> Cape Town has grown from a quaint artsy city to what it is today -- an international design Mecca , which now attracts prominent design ambassadors from key design countries around the world . The stage was set 20 years ago with Design Indaba , which first established a place for South Africa on the world design map , introducing the rest of the world to our design talent and waking the talent within . <p> Since then , additional movements and programmes such as Southern Guild and World Design Capital ( WDC ) 2014 have given our design community focus and greater purpose and served to further showcase us internationally . In addition , the Open Design Festival , which last month saw its third successful year , has become our central stage from which to drive socially conscious design . This approach is Africa 's unique selling point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting for showcasing its power and potential to the public , both local and international . As a design community , it seems we are committed to not disappoint . <p> Today , local designers are offering the world design with a conscious ; we design with the aim of improving someone 's life as well as making something beautiful . Coming from Africa , we inherently consider accessibility , cost , functionality , and need more than designers in first world countries . This is a huge advantage for our design community on an international level , as the greater global society makes a deeper commitment to the importance of design in improving community living for all . There is a new narrative around design 's relevance , and we are now being seen as trendsetters in this arena , thus making us an attractive go-to city for the latest kind of design thinking . It 's the kind of thinking that can create anything from an out-of-the-box app for a corporate client to a simple yet brilliant fire alarm system for informal settlements . <p> Cape Town has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , slower pace , artist community and culture of food and wine . Whilst it was already being acknowledged as a place for design in the early 2000s , design was still somewhat disconnected from the city and its people . <p> WDC 2014 was a catalyst for change . Building on the foundation laid by Design Indaba , it helped put focus on the desire for a new identity more tied to the community and gave birth to a sense of pride in the design profession . <p> In Cape Town , our design evolution has kept pace with our growing social conscience . This is enough to take us from an underground community of problem-solvers and innovators to a full-on movement . People have started speaking to each other -- the Cape Craft and Design Institution , the City of Cape Town , Western Province government , Cape Town Design Network and our dozen or so design schools -- and the conversation has rallied us towards greater cohesion and strength . <p> Opening design to international interest <p> Besides the international interest we 've had from external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prestigious Index Awards and the Maker Faire , there was another shift that made me believe that we had indeed arrived as a design Mecca of sorts : requests from international students for internships with our agency went from a trickle to a flood over the past two years . <p> While agencies have had international interest on a client level for some time , students are now choosing to come to Cape Town to develop their skills and experience . Since students always want to be at the centre of action and innovation , it excites me to see they are setting their sights on the Mother City as the place to be . <p> Open Design has showcased that we have the type of thinking it takes to solve complex problems and come up with better solutions on a global level . We also have the ability to design beautiful and sustainable things , and all of these capabilities play an important role in further establishing our international reputation while offering long-term local growth . <p> So how does Cape Town 's future as a design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinventing itself : it 's gone from port city to manufacturing city to destination city , and now to design city . It 's critical for South Africa to see the importance of this industry as an additional economy and realise that we have the capacity to grow the knowledge economy too . As we become more sought after internationally as design experts , local business will start to better recognise design 's pivotal role . This will improve products and competition , and in turn , drive our economy . If the design community is serious about growing our reputation as an international design Mecca , we need to stay connected , participate in the platforms that are there , embrace our own ability and recognise that our skills are relevant and world class .

But we are concerned that a couple of provisions will compound the under-performance of the economy , " commented Wayne Mann , director of group risk at The Unlimited , at Thursday 's roundtable . <p> The Unlimited is a financial services company and direct marketing specialist , which has spent close to R1m on Popi compliance . <p> Chiefly , Mann argued that Popi compliance represents a significant cost burden for small businesses and it impedes their ability to reach new customers via low-cost electronic marketing , such as e-mail and SMS . <p> Under Popi , a company can send only one unsolicited e-mail or SMS to a potential customer . If the potential customer does not explicitly " opt in " to future communication from that company , further direct marketing is prohibited . This does not apply to existing customers . <p> " Consumers are already protected under the Consumer Protection Act and can opt out of electronic marketing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' under the CPA to ' opt in ' under Popi ? This is simply another piece of red tape to make it more difficult for small businesses and start-ups to sustain themselves . <p> " Is it really that much of an inconvenience to receive those unsolicited SMSes or e-mails ? The business sending them may employ 10 people who support another 30 . " <p> Mann believes that , over and above that , direct marketers play a key role in delivering information about products and services to historically underserved markets that might not have access to such information by other means . <p> Francis Cronj ? , information governance specialist and adviser to parliament 's technical working committee on Popi , argued that aside from enforcing our constitutional right to privacy , effective data protection legislation opens up certain trade barriers that might have existed -- for example , with the European Union , which itself has very strict data protection laws . <p> He believes there is a lack of responsibility for the protection of personal information among South African companies and noted that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on IT systems alone to ready itself for Popi . <p> " The Popi Act must be read in the context of the preamble , which clearly recognises the need for economic and social progress , " Cronj ? added . <p> The act 's preamble is explicit that the act must bear in mind that economic and social progress " requires the removal of unnecessary impediments to the free flow of information , including personal information " . <p> " We think cases will be brought to the National Consumer Commission where the law is broken but the spirit of the law is not and exclusions to Popi compliance will be created , " said Warren Moss , chairman of the Direct Marketing Association ( DMA ) of South Africa . <p> Moss said the DMA supports Popi but shares similar concerns around its impact on small businesses . <p> " A horizontal piece of legislation such as Popi can not be tailored for every industry .

Perry and the hospital staff realised Michael was alive , they began working on him in an emergency pace as one would expect in the Emergency Department , " according to the lawsuit .

The procedure went well , and Tammy began to believe that Michael might make it . <p> " I started to make sounds of joy and the doctor said , ' No , no , no .

She broke her silence last week in interviews with the Buffalo News , which did an extensive report on the case . <p> The defendants are contesting the case but , except for one , are not commenting . <p> Perry did not respond to the Buffalo News ' requests for comment .

" Tammy said . " His family is fighting for his life and the medical industry is telling us he 's dead . Can you imagine what it must have been like for him , laying there , listening to that ? " <p> The next hearing for the case is scheduled for February 24 , when Tammy will appear in court alongside the doctor she blames for her husband 's excruciating double death . <p> " I wonder if this guy sleeps at night , " she said , " because I sure don't.

@@4871236 <h> Being hurt does not make one an authority . Nor does it automatically infuse your argument with moral virtue and logic . In fact , very often it has the opposite effect <p> An archetype for the kind of dangerous and flawed thinking advocated by the vanguard for racial populism appeared in Business Day earlier this week . <p> The ideas about racial identity and racism that Scott Burnett presents in The demon of white racism has not been slain in SA , are a threat to constitutionalism in general and equality in particular . Thus , they are worth interrogating and understanding in detail . <p> The foundation of his argument centres on two key and related contentions . The first of these is the following : " These days , ethics tends to focus more on consequences . When the consequence is feeling hurt , belittled or unfairly treated , then the person so affected has far greater authority when reporting on it . " <p> Mr Burnett is arguing that one 's authority on any issue flows from their emotional reaction and connection to the subject at hand . On the spectrum of emotions available to any person , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bestows on a person a " far greater authority " . <p> This point is critical to understanding racial populism . Emotions rule . No person , idea or , importantly , principle has greater authority than emotion , and hurt is the most powerful legitimating force of all the emotions . <p> Debate is not a marketplace of ideas , with each jostling for position on the basis of their reason or evidence ; rather it is a hierarchy , each with an inherent value born of its author 's emotional disposition . It is profoundly anti-intellectual . It is from ideas such as this that populism and demagoguery flow . With them , authoritarianism and censorship . <p> The sentiment is abhorrent to the values and principles that define a constitutional democracy and , importantly , which regulate equality . Mr Burnett takes a sledgehammer to them . If ultimate authority flows from emotion , these ideals are instantly denuded of their worth . And the consequences for freedom are profound . <p> Consider , for example , The Spear painting by Brett Murray representing President Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much hurt and pain , certainly he felt belittled . In an attempt to censor the painting and have it removed from public sight , the president said he was " shocked , and felt personally ? offended and violated " by the painting . It was described as racist , demeaning , insulting and much else besides . <p> By Mr Burnett 's reasoning , this would make the president the defining authority on the subject ; ethically superior too . He was not , of course . Mr Murray 's rights were just as important , as were those of the public . The final arbiter was not emotion , but the constitutional right to freedom of expression , of which artistic expression warrants particular reference in our founding document . <p> Simply being hurt does not necessarily make one an authority . Nor does it automatically infuse your argument with moral virtue and logic . In fact , very often it has the opposite effect . For this reason , judges , who aspire to objectivity and fairness , not psychologists , are the final arbiters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demagoguery , hurt and pain won with regards to The Spear . It was destroyed and vandalised . No doubt Mr Burnett approved . <p> If the door to that kind of moral relativism is opened too wide , there are many other issues that will quickly consume SA . The death penalty springs to mind , advocacy for which is fuelled almost entirely by emotion , much of it the response to serious pain , loss and suffering . <p> This is a difficult point to make in SA today on the subject of racial identity ( in truth , it would appear near impossible ) . There is much real and lasting hurt today , the result of a history fused with racism . It is a compassionate , caring and empathetic society that listens to and responds to that trauma , and we all have a duty in that regard . But if those emotions are elevated above all other concerns , if hurt becomes the defining legitimation for action , principles are rendered redundant , as Mr Burnett illustrates . And , as the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too will be lost . And it will be to everyone 's detriment , particularly the poor and marginalised . <p> It is easy to say hurt trumps all ; more difficult to say principles matter . In a nationalistic environment where populism is starting to take hold , exceedingly hard . Every person , ethically , legally and morally is equal under the Constitution . <p> It is both disturbing and revealing that his piece was so widely endorsed , without a single reservation expressed in response to Mr Burnett 's embarrassing claim . It says much about the intellectualism of the left . In essence , Mr Burnett 's position is profoundly anti-intellectual . He has either embarrassed them or confirmed that the gap between the vanguard of racial populism and the vanguard of radical populism , as espoused by parties such as the EFF , is not as wide as they like to believe . Certainly , Mr Burnett crossed it in one short stride . <p> Mr Burnett has a second argument , which flows from his first . He states : " ( White South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-black racism : if you do not inhabit a black body , your opinion on whether something you did or said was anti-black racist is just not that relevant . A similar asymmetry applies to sexist acts . " <p> That sentence is another assault on equality , pure and simple . If equality means anything it is that every person is equal in dignity and worth and therefore that every opinion has equal protection under the constitution , however right or wrong it may be . It is for this reason that the Constitution is grounded in the value of dignity and protects free speech . No one needs to respect an opinion that is wrong but , in making it , we all start from an equal footing . That is the essence of equality . In making his case , Mr Burnett is evoking this very right . Yet , the content of his argument is just the kind of thing that encourages anti-constitutionalism . And there is an ever-growing appetite for it . If voted into power , those forces will waste no time laying waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr Burnett 's position lies at the heart of one of history 's great evils -- essentialism . It is unclear what is taught at the Wits Centre for Diversity Studies , where Mr Burnett is a candidate , but if it 's this there is much to worry about . Postmodernism and moral relativism had its day in the sun in the 1990s , its light has faded , but daybreak seems only now to be dawning on the Centre for Diversity Studies . How many great thinkers have offered up invaluable insights into the human experience over time , unconstrained by the kind of " ethics these days " Mr Burnett advocates . They are all lost to him and he is the poorer for it . <p> Mr Burnett later presents his " insights on structural racism " , as if he has only just stumbled across the idea . The obvious has never before been wrapped up in such superficial profundity . A great many evils have left their mark on SA , apartheid and colonialism in particular . There are others , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctness -- traditional African culture , for example -- but the legacy of these things is blatant . <p> What does one do about it , however ? <p> For all of their shared obsession with feelings and emotion , racial populists have not built much of an economic reputation ; if anything a kind of economic illiteracy seems to hold sway . Nor do they demonstrate any interest in discussing that side of the problem . Checking your privilege does n't get anyone a job , but then getting or creating jobs is a far more difficult discussion when one can endlessly interrogate the bottomless subjective pit that is the human soul . <p> In its totality , Mr Burnett 's piece is grovelling . He seems , from the response he generated , to relish the adulation . " The grovel " has become ever more common in South African debate . <p> It is fashionable nowadays for certain left-leaning types to prostrate themselves before the gatekeepers of orthodox racial discourse . It is presumably cathartic for them . They set out how guilty they are , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , as if applying for an award . Any article critical of how race is debated is a chance for them to lay before the world their fragile , insecure soul for all to see and , hopefully , to be endorsed by the politically correct as a " good white " in turn ; simultaneously , for them to offer up , as Mr Burnett does , their rights and , if they had their way , the rights of others too -- to equality and freedom of speech . <p> Make no mistake , Mr Burnett 's views are an affront to our culture of human rights . They are shameful and dangerous . And it is important to recognise them as such . <p> But they are exactly what the doctored ordered , so far as the intellectual racial populists go , hence it was uncritically endorsed almost across the board . It was described as " thoughtful " , " excellent " , even " profound " . His piece is precisely the kind of repentance they wish to see or to associate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the suggestion that those who wish to comment on racism and racial identity know their place in SA 's contemporary hierarchy -- at the bottom , illegitimate and guilty . <p> The vanguard of racial populism , for all its feigned intellectualism , will happily endorse the most abhorrent , anti-constitutional sentiments if it fits their agenda . For its members , equality is not an ideal ; it is an obstacle to be beaten down and replaced by a racial hierarchy only they can see , feel , interpret and define . And , if they can not , before which they can prostrate themselves . <p> It is disgraceful and weak . Individual rights are illusions , used as a veil under which demagogic and collectivist ideas such as " whiteness " and " blackness " are smuggled in . Racial essentialism is the real product being sold . <p> But Mr Burnett is braver than his counterparts in one important way . He , unlike them , is willing to nail his colours to the mast : to openly contest constitutional principles such as equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he opens his recipe for populism with the phrase , " If white people want to belong in this new country " -- an admission that he believes the constitutionally entrenched idea of equality is a myth . They , by contrast , cowardly endorse his sentiments with likes and shares on social media . They should have the courage of their convictions , like Mr Burnett . If they believe our constitutional pact is illegitimate they should say so . Then we can have a proper discussion . Are all South Africans equal under the Constitution or not ? Put your money were your mouth is . The EFF has .

@@4877237 <p> We are living in a world where the phrase one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter has never been more pertinent . It would seem that the idea of terror is no longer one that exists in some far-off land , happening to far-off people . It has become a reality that one minute you 're sitting having a coffee , waiting in traffic or cursing the ATM for swallowing your card and the next you 're running for your life . <p> So the response worldwide has been to find the " hubs of terror " and destroy them , cutting off the proverbial head of the snake . This is not just something that superpowers engage in any more . Anyone who has been attacked by an extremist organisation can bring it out the big guns and " put boots on the ground " . This can be seen with Kenya in Somalia and Nigeria within its domestic realm , and the African Union ( when it gets its mess together ) . <p> The problem is with the way people view terrorist organisations as organised groups , which like governments or even multinational organisations can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . It 's like that uncle who owes child support , a good chunk of cash to a loan shark and can not keep a stable job . We only know where he was last seen but not where he 'll be next . <p> Terror does not work on the premise of having a " return violence to sender " address , it is not , in the formal sense , based anywhere . Much as terrorists can have twitter accounts , supposedly sell oil to fund their activities and have ad hoc military bases the ethereal nature of these groups means they are ready to move on from wherever they are in the blink of an eye . When France calls on her allies to take the fight " to the heart of Isis " , the notion is ridiculous because there is no heart , there is barely a body . <p> This is what makes the actions of France , the US and other GI Joe " boys with toys " countries so counterproductive . The areas these extremist groups occupy are predominantly civilian centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Area 51 , state houses , global headquarters or even head offices . They are regions and spaces in which people who have little to nothing to do with the actual organisation have been occupied and taken hostage . <p> Therefore to bomb these areas in the name of " rooting out the organisation " amounts to an act of terrorism in itself because just like the terrorist attack a group has come and enacted violence on innocent people in the name of ideology and to change the minds of a few . Terrorists do not bomb nations because they do not like how the people spend too much time in cafes or despise the local beer , but to challenge the institutional powers in that country . So when a government retaliates and bombs innocents because they do not like the organisation what 's the difference ? <p> It is the innocent that suffer within these spaces when terror is fought with force . One needs only look at those killed in an Afghanistan hospital due to human error on the part of the Americans . Their general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In this battle of ideologies and political will it is not only those within " terrorist areas " who suffer but also those in " counter-terror " nations , retaliation results in the Garissa attacks , Paris attacks and Nigeria attacks . It results in violence against people who have nothing to do with the conflict . Innocent people are embroiled in a cycle of bombing and violence . <p> Another problem with fighting extremist groups in a fight fire-with-fire sort of way is that it does not take into consideration that the core problem is not being addressed , namely " why are these activities taking place " . Killing people who one believes are evil does not kill the idea they represented and perpetuated . In fact , more often than not , it turns them into a martyr further fuelling the fire one is trying to fight . Take for example the Nazi regime . The fall of Hitler has not stopped the spread of neo-Nazism around the world . The end of apartheid has not meant that all apartheid enthusiasts woke up in 1994 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch " . In fact , according to an Institute for Justice and Reconciliation barometer South Africa is more divided now than it was before 1994 . <p> Terrorism can not be fought physically because ideology does not exist in the physical , it is in the psyches and emotions of those who engage with it . Unlike a house filled with furniture , or an office filled with computers one can very quickly pack up it up and move along when the going gets tough . <p> The current way in which the fight against terror has been approached , and continues to be approached shows a lack of understanding in the way in which terror fundamentally works . It is the reason why , despite occupying countries for upwards of 14 years , bombing whole nations to dust and holding dialogue after international dialogue , terror , like a bad rash , has gotten worse . <p> We have gone from only worrying about al Qaeda to worrying about Boko Haram , Isis and even some miscellaneous groups who seem to be doing the independent thing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be fought . Understanding the ghost-like nature of it , homing in on the psychological and ideological aspects and acknowledging the fact that it is in the hearts and minds of the people will help in understanding how best to move forward and avoid civilian casualties on both sides . <p> Brilliant piece , brilliantly written . Our new Canadian PM has promised to pull out of bombing ( quite a few oppose it though ) , so I will be tweeting this to him , and my federal , provincial and municipal representative as your piece is the best series of arguments and sound bites I have seen yet . It 's hard to support the ' GI Joe boys with toys ' even against ISIS if your family and friends are collateral damage . There is no " return violence to sender " button . Brilliant .

@@4897239 <p> Government is committed to develop a relevant public broadcaster . It seems that some people have already forgotten that pre-1994 , the broadcasting system was characterised by inequality of access , language , cultural and education programming , lack of diversity and choice in services . <p> Again , it seems that there are some people who have not yet realised that since our democratically elected government took over in 1994 , it has never failed to allow the truth to breathe -- and hence , as South Africans , we are now living in a world that is unrecognisable from that of 21 years ago . <p> We do not want to bring back the bitter memories of apartheid . Rather , the truth must be told that before the dawn of democracy , the apartheid regime was characterised by a culture of secrecy , disinformation and restrictions on press freedom . <p> Those who were there during the late 1980s will remember that news at SABC was always permeated with racial stereotypes , while black employees were subjected to whipping as a disciplinary procedure , attend separate training classes with their white colleague 's and were always given older machines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era where government is no longer hiding behind media restrictions and is fully accountable to the public . <p> Now , let 's allow the truth about the Broadcasting Amendment Bill to breathe . It is incorrect to suggest or portray me as someone who is trying to put the SABC in the " intensive care unit " of the ruling ANC . Our people will never rebel against their government because they know that the central pillar to making free and open flow of communication a reality is our public broadcaster . <p> We want to put it on record that our government recognises the central role that the SABC plays in society . We are therefore committed to the development of a sustainable and relevant public broadcaster , which is accountable to both parliament and the public , meaning that all the headlines that suggest that I want to put the SABC under the total control of the ANC are incorrect and misleading . <p> As South Africans , it is important for us to understand that the proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act , which we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ensuring universal access to broadcasting services in South Africa . The proposed changes will strengthen the SABC and better allow it to fulfil its public broadcasting service mandate . <p> Contrary to what others are saying , government is convinced that this change will ensure a more robust , relevant and sustainable SABC . The proposed changes are systematic in nature and take into account all aspects related to the public broadcaster . <p> In the last decade , the SABC has had to navigate through several challenges and there were times when boardroom issues took centre stage . Unfortunately , these challenges sometimes hindered the ability of the SABC to discharge its public broadcasting service mandate . <p> We are also cognisant of the fact that the SABC operates in a fast-changing landscape where innovation and change are the order of the day . It is therefore important that the SABC and its leadership are in a position to move with the changing times , if they are to stay relevant . <p> We all know that companies function optimally when the board and the leadership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , the board provides strategic direction which allows the leadership of the company to concentrate on operational issues . <p> The proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act will allow government to develop and implement a stable corporate governance model , which ensures the long-term stability and sustainability of the SABC . <p> This process will allow for introspection on the size , selection process and tenure of future boards , and is a vital element in ensuring that the SABC is fit for purpose in the unfolding media landscape . <p> One of the proposed changes is to reduce the number of nonexecutive board members from 12 to nine . The rational for this change is to strengthen the board and to streamline its operation . The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act of 1993 has a similar streamlined board consisting of an MD , chairman , staff-elected director and not fewer than four and not more than six other directors . <p> Our experience over the years has shown that a large board is expensive to maintain . We also want to avoid situations where members of the board are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will agree with me that large boards can become dysfunctional in cases where the competing interests of members take precedence over board matters . <p> Another good news is that the proposed changes in the bill seeks to ensure that the board is composed of people with a range of skills and expertise required to ensure optimal operational efficiency , so that the corporation is not left behind in the digital era . <p> They will allow the SABC board to make strategic decisions regarding its operations . <p> Government would like to see a situation where the process of appointing and removing the nonexecutive board members is expedited without compromising the participation of the general public in the process . To achieve this , the bill proposes that a nominations committee be formed to select future boards . This committee will screen and interview prospective board members , and will recommend the names of persons to be appointed as nonexecutive members of the board . <p> The rationale behind this proposed change is to appoint members of the board expeditiously , and to ensure that the best possible candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international best practice for public broadcasting . <p> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act of 1993 provides for a merit-based appointment of nonexecutive directors and to ensure this the act provides for the establishment of a nominations panel to conduct a selection process for each appointment of a director and make a written report on candidates who are nominated for the appointment . <p> The Royal Charter for the continuance of the British Broadcasting Corporation also provided for establishment of a nomination committee for the appointment of nonexecutive members of the BBC executive board . <p> To ensure the integrity and independence of the nominations committee , the chairman of the nominations committee will be a retired judge , who will be appointed in consultation with the minister of justice and correctional services . <p> It is also important to note that the powers to appoint and remove nonexecutive board members still remains with the president and the president will use his or her discretion in the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman of the board . The president will continue to appoint the candidates from the people recommended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . <p> As government , we are confident that the checks and balances , which are embedded in the proposed new process , will allow for the appointment of candidates who are best placed to move South Africa forward . An appointment process for nonexecutive directors for public broadcasting corporations , driven by the executive , is a hallmark of legislation in Canada , the UK and Australia . <p> We also want to inform the nation that a new section to address the systematic retirement of board members to maintain the institutional memory is inserted . This will ensure that the board can always call on institutional memory , thus ensuring continuity and stability . The bill proposes that a third of the current nonexecutive members be retained in the board for a period not exceeding 10 years . This will ensure that the institutional memory of the board is not eroded as well as providing stability within the corporation . <p> The SABC head office in Auckland Park <p> Government has no doubt that these proposed changes will lead to a better SABC that will serve all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices heard on this issue and to engage in the public consultation process to be led by parliament . <p> In March this year , cabinet approved the final amendments to the broadcasting digital migration policy , which paved the way for the implementation of digital migration . Cabinet further approved that government should provide free set-top boxes to the 5mn poor TV-owning households . This shift is a reflection of government 's commitment to ensure that digital migration happens within the shortest time possible . <p> Once the migration process is completed , South Africans will have access to digital terrestrial television . The migration will release valuable spectrum which will allow for more channels and more content to be broadcast in the same bandwidth as is currently used by one analogue channel . <p> The availability of more television channels will lead to more demand for local content , which will translate into growth for the local content industry . This will also spur industry growth and lead to job creation . Furthermore , it will result in better quality sound on both radio and visuals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realise our vision of building a people centred and inclusive information society . <p> It is therefore clear that the landscape is changing , and consequently the SABC and the regulatory environment must change as well . Change is often a painful process , but it is sometimes inevitable . <p> In conclusion , we would like to invite all interested parties to participate in the parliamentary processes to deliberate on the proposed amendments to the bill . We also challenge all stakeholders to provide concrete proposals on how we can create a public broadcasting system we should be proud of as South Africans . <h> Share this article <p> &gt;&gt;People will agree with me that large boards can become dysfunctional in cases where the competing interests of members take precedence over board matters . <p> ... in that case , it would 've been pertinent to reduce the number to 5 in my opinion and really should not have been more than a maximum of 7 . <p> &gt;&gt;the proposed changes in the bill seeks to ensure that the board is composed of people with a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the corporation is not left behind in the digital era . <p> Please also make a note of checking that they have n't experienced any house fires that may have resulted in the proof of such being destroyed without the ability of being able to have it also confirmed by such institutions as UNISA . <p> &gt;&gt;The rationale behind this proposed change is to appoint members of the board expeditiously , and to ensure that the best possible candidates serve on future boards .

@@4905234 not the job of Legal Aid to subsidise the Bar -- John Jeffery <p> In an article on Politicsweb Kameel Premhid of the Helen Suzman Foundation makes some drastic yet misinformed suggestions regarding the transformation of the Bar by using funding from the State , allocated to assist the indigent through Legal Aid SA , for private legal practitioners . <p> He suggests that Legal Aid SA should reduce its staff , and give the work to advocates presently at the Bar with under five years of practice , so as to address the issue of lack of transformation at the Bar . In this regard he explains that " .... if half of Legal Aid 's 2013 personnel cost of R900m , so R450mil , was assigned to the roughly 860 advocates presently at the Bar with under five years of practice ( calculated using the average intake of pupils over 2010 -- 2014 , assuming perfect retention ) , each advocate would be guaranteed R500 000 of income per annum . " <p> He says that the " solution seems obvious . " <p> Really ? What about service delivery to the poor ? Premhid seems more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 per annum income , rather than he is with service delivery to the poor . And , mind you , his criteria for such practitioners to get work is purely that they are Bar members with under 5 years of practice . <p> Has Premhid read the Constitution at all ? <p> There is nothing obvious about the situation . In fact , there are a host of other factors that Premhid conveniently ignores . Transformation demands a much more nuanced and multi-faceted approach than simply cutting down Legal Aid SA and giving the work to private advocates . <p> Firstly , the outsourcing model is a doomed model . It did not work and nearly bankrupted Legal Aid . At the dawn of democracy in 1994 , we inherited a Legal Aid dispensation that was unable to meet the growing demands of our new democracy ; a democracy with a Constitution which now guaranteed certain categories of persons legal representation by the state and at state expense . The Legal Aid Board , as it was then called , became responsiblefor providing legal aid in criminal cases where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice would otherwise result " if they were not represented . <p> This brought with it its own problems , as the judicare model of referring cases to private attorneys - with no possible oversight over their work - simply became unaffordable and unmanageable and the Board was subsequently compelled to consider other , more cost-effective , models of delivery . <p> This lead to the implementation of a public defender model and sound organizational governance practices . <p> Legal Aid SA now has maintained a mixed-model legal aid delivery system , with the bulk of the service ( 96% ) provided by in-house salaried lawyers employed at our Justice Centres . <p> Today we can proudly say that Legal Aid SA has been revamped and remodelled to one of the best legal aid systems in the world . It continues to discharge its mandate to facilitate access to justice by providing public funded legal representation to the poor and the indigent , and has done so in a commendable manner . <p> Secondly , Premhid further apparently assumes that private legal practitioners must be better at providing a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per se . In fact , all legal aid practitioners employed by Legal Aid SA are admitted attorneys or advocates and as such belong to the organised legal profession . Why should they therefore be discriminated against in favour of other Bar members ? Another aspect is that the current figures and analysis regarding the lengthy periods of time that remand detainees stay in custody while their matters are being heard indicate that often the long delays are caused by private legal practitioners , not by Legal Aid . <p> Thirdly , on the issue of transformation , the Bar has had more than 20 years to transform . What did it do in this regard ? We need a legal profession , both attorneys and advocates , which is reflective of the race and gender composition of the country . Do we have this or are we anywhere close ? The answer is no . Racially , in terms of the latest available figures , 70% of the Bar is white -- while whites make up only 8.9% of the population ; 18% of the Bar is African , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gender perspective , countrywide , 25% of the Bar are women , but women make up just over half of South Africa 's population -- 51.3% . <p> Surely it is not Legal Aid SA 's responsibility to address this -- it is the responsibility of the legal profession itself . <p> In addition , if we look at the representivity of the legal aid practitioners we find that of the current 1924 legal practitioners only 262 are White ( 13,6% ) . Should we now penalise the Legal Aid practitioners , who meet the diversity and other criteria to serve the public , so as to ensure work for private Bar members . <p> Premhid 's argument shows little understanding of briefing patterns . The issue of briefing patterns is an ongoing concern and one which we are addressing . Government can not compel the private sector to ensure an equal distribution of briefs . Government can , and does , however , pay particular attention to briefs given by the State . <p> The State Attorney Amendment Act provides for the development of policy on briefing patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work will be allocated equitably among practitioners . This will help address long-standing concerns about the skewed allocation of briefs . <p> We have a target of 76% of briefs to be given to Black and female practitioners . We are meeting this goal . <p> We have , as a Department , taken bold steps to furthermore increase the allocation of briefs to competent previously disadvantaged individuals . We must ensure that briefs are given as widely as possible , in other words , that it 's not the same people who are continuously briefed and that female and Black practitioners are exposed to many different types of work , so as to build expertise in a variety of areas . <p> The most glaring shortfall in the Bar figures is with regard to African women . What is being proposed is that we need a target within the Previously Disadvantaged category for African women . In particular , we need to break down the 76% and set targets for each group . <p> Finally , Premhid then talks about " worthy societal goals " . Let 's discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa . The private legal profession has had more than 20 years to come to the party on the issue of pro bono legal work . Providing pro bono legal services to the poor and indigent is a vital part of transformation . <p> Dave Holness of the University of Kwazulu-Natal writes that " the hesitancy of the legal community in much of South Africa to embrace mandatory pro bono work is well illustrated . " As an example , he refers to the fact that pro bono work was initially mandatory only for attorneys practising in the three Cape provinces as the Cape Law Society introduced a minimum requirement of 24 hours a year of mandatory pro bono work in 2003 . <p> Legal Aid SA currently has a voluntary pro bono system in place and has memoranda of understanding with the statutory Law Societies as well as 3 of the 13 Constituent Bars of the GCB and the National Bar Council of South Africa . <p> In terms of this arrangement , legal practitioners will be required to render pro bono legal services of up to 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in any one year , such additional hours will be counted as pro bono hours for the ensuing years to a maximum of the following 2 years . <p> But there are only 503 accredited pro bono practitioners who signed up for the programme . <p> The latest figures show that there are 23 712 practicing attorneys and 2571 advocates in the country . So out of the more than 26 000 private legal practitioners , only 503 are interested in assisting Legal Aid SA with pro bono work . <p> So , the issue is really much more complex than Premhid suggests . <p> Transformation of the legal profession is crucial . But taking work from Legal Aid SA and outsourcing it to private legal practitioners is not the answer . <p> John Jeffery , MP is South Africa 's Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development .

It 's possible that another factor such as a lack of exercise could play a role . <p> Still , study author Dr Jonathan Silverberg , said , " You have common health problems that turn out to have a lot more serious consequences in some kids . " <p> According to Silverberg , an associate professor of dermatology at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago , prior research has shown that adults with allergic disorders are more likely to have risk factors for heart disease . <p> His own research has hinted at links between the skin condition known as eczema , unhealthy life choices such as less physical activity and smoking , and heart disease risk factors . The new study aims to understand whether similar connections might exist in children . <p> To find out , Silverberg 's team examined the results of a 2012 U.S. survey of households and focused on findings regarding more than 13,000 children up to the age of 17 . The survey found that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12 percent had eczema and 16 percent had hay fever . <p> The new study finds that kids with asthma and hay fever were more likely than other kids to be obese or overweight , and they also had about double the risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol . <p> Extra risk remained even after the researchers adjusted their statistics to account for obesity as a factor , Silverberg 's group said . The kids did not have a higher risk of diabetes , however . <p> Extra kilos <p> And the actual increase in risk for high blood pressure and high cholesterol was n't large . For the kids with asthma and hay fever , the overall level of risk only grew only by about 1 percentage point , the researchers noted . <p> So , " clearly , not every kid with allergic disease has increased cardiovascular disease , " Silverberg said .

They did tend to pack on more extra kilos , however . <p> What might possibly link allergies , asthma and heart issues ? <p> It 's possible that inflammation related to allergies could boost cholesterol and blood pressure level , said Dr Gregg Fonarow , a professor of cardiology at University of California , Los Angeles . Indeed , researchers have linked diseases like psoriasis that cause inflammation to an increased risk of heart disease , he noted . <p> Silverberg said it 's also possible that the diseases could cause problems through other means , such as poor sleep . <p> For his part , Fonarow speculated that differences in physical activity , diet and caloric intake between kids with and without the conditions could make a difference . <p> What to do ? <p> Fonarow said parents should n't be especially concerned about the findings .

@@4912238 e-shoppers back <p> December 14th , 2015 <p> E-commerce is on the increase in South Africa , but many shoppers are reluctant to shop online . DONOVAN MARAIS of Sage Pay provides some insight into what is holding them back . <p> E-commerce is on the rise in South Africa . According to recent research conducted by Ipsos on behalf of FNB and Paypal , 22% of South African Internet users have made purchases online , and 48% expect to do so in the future . <p> This is clearly a growing and potentially lucrative market for small businesses that are able to give customers the convenience and flexibility of doing business online . But what about the 30% of people who are not shopping online ? What 's holding them back and how do can they be persuaded to make the big leap ? <p> Here are a few of the reasons some people are still reluctant to shop online , and a few ideas about how you , the small business owner , can change their minds . <p> 1 .

Many of them are anxious about whether an item they order online will be shipped in time to reach the recipient for Christmas .

Speak to your couriers and suppliers to find out about their lead times and do n't make any promises that you ca n't keep . If you miss a Christmas shipping date , you 'll probably lose the customer forever . <p> Tip : Post your cut-off dates for Christmas orders and shipments prominently on your Website , marketing emails , and other communications so that customers are aware of the deadlines and stick to them . <p> 2 .

Be sure to tell your customers how you process payments on your site to give them peace of mind about its security .

I ca n't say I approve of killings , not of other people at any rate , but I 've thought enough about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story you may remember from when you were little . Please share it with your comrades at Azania House . <p> * * * <p> It was a late summer 's afternoon , in the Year of the Feather , when all birds still lived in Dushe , a palace in the forest . Mrs Hen had gathered her chicks underneath her wings . The hatchlings were only two days old and Mrs Hen was as protective of them as any mother would be over her new offspring . She was sitting outside the entrance of the royal closet waiting for Mr Falcon , the king , to return from patrol duty . Mr Falcon 's routine involved an unhurried flight around Dushe , inspecting all corners of the palace with his sharp eye , and on returning he would lock himself up in the royal closet . <p> Mrs Hen was entrusted with the key to the royal closet . At all times she could be seen with the golden key hanging on her neck on a piece of string , waiting for Mr Falcon . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the colour , shape , and texture of the feather revealed the character of a bird in a way that nothing else could . Mrs Hen 's feather , according to the final verdict of the Royal Counsel , suggested she was of the most protective bird species in all of Dushe , so the decision to entrust her with the key to the royal closet was not a difficult one to make . <p> The closet was where His Majesty , Mr Falcon , kept his jewellery collection and portraits of himself that were crafted by the weaver birds on a regular basis , or when one was commissioned by the Royal Counsel , or whenever the weavers were not busy plaiting banners for the Dushe Talent Festival . Unlike his predecessors , who only went into the royal closet when they were showing visitors around , His Majesty went in and viewed the portraits and jewellery for lengths of time , every afternoon . Some birds said -- behind his back , of course -- that His Majesty was affected excessively with hubris , others said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself , and yet others believed he visited the closet in order to meditate -- a very royal thing to do . <p> On this afternoon , Mrs Hen fell asleep while waiting for Mr Falcon . When he arrived , eventually , he saw that her head was tucked underneath her wing and she was snoring . A chick was napping on Mrs Hen 's fluffy back . Instead of waking her Mr Falcon used his beak , carefully , to unhook the key from Mrs Hen 's neck , but before he knew it he was pressed to the ground , struggling to breathe . Mrs Hen had one foot on his neck and another on his belly . She was shouting , imploring the chicks to run to safety . The chicks scattered to all directions . It was some moments before Mrs Hen realised she had mistaken the king for a dangerous beast . She jumped off and cried , " Forgive me , forgive me Your Majesty . " Mr Falcon got up and was dusting himself , still feeling giddy , while Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Oh Mr Falcon , Sir . Forgive me . I fell asleep while waiting . I thought you were one of these ... dangerous beasts that eat chicks . " <p> The king looked around to see if any of his subjects were watching but there were only Mrs Hen 's confused chicks , now chirping hauntingly and running back to Mrs Hen 's embrace . Mr Falcon said , " Just give me the key . " <p> " Your Majesty , " she said , bowing remorsefully , and handed over the key to Mr Falcon . " I am very , very sorry , Sir . " <p> Mr Falcon looked at Mrs Hen as though wondering what sort of devious bird she was , and then he flashed that unnatural kingly smile at her , turned around and went into the closet . <p> Mrs Hen was so nervous she could n't fall asleep that night until dawn . She made a promise to herself that she would never take a nap again while on duty , no matter how tired she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake ; if she made another mistake she was sure no bird in Dushe would trust a chicken again , and in those days trust was everything to birds . <p> There was a new vigilance about Mrs Hen the following morning . She fastened the golden key around her neck , waved and greeted other birds by their names , to demonstrate to them and to herself that she was alert . <p> * * * <p> In the afternoon Mr Falcon came back and found all the birds gathered outside the closet , their heads hanging low as though bereaved .. Upon enquiry , Mr Falcon was told that the bird who kept his keys had lost them . The birds had been looking everywhere and there was no sign of the keys anywhere . <p> Mr Falcon said , " I thought someone had died -- but this is worse . " <p> " Indeed , Your Majesty , " said Mr Vulture , his uncle , shaking his balding head in resignation . " But that 's what you get for trusting a chicken . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Mr Falcon . <p> " Do n't mind me , Your Majesty . I 'm just an old , miserable man . " <p> Mr Falcon shifted his attention to the other birds and said , " When did this birdy lose my key ? " <p> No bird answered but they all turned to look where Mrs Hen was desperately scratching the ground with her feet , searching for the lost key . She was surrounded by her chicks and they were helping her , using their beaks that were not yet firm . <p> When His Majesty saw Mrs Hen he took off and with great viciousness clawed at and flew away with Mrs Hen 's baby chick . All Mrs Hen could say when she realised what had happened was , " Usana lwam , Thixo ! " What she did n't know was that Mr Falcon would do it again the following day , and the day after , until her entire brood had been clawed away and eaten . He 'd wait on a treetop , watch Mrs Hen as she was scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened she wished she could fly , to rescue her chicks from Mr Falcon , but flying was not one of her talents . <p> The other birds were dejected and overwhelmed . The freedom of Dushe from the early days was replaced by fear . According to the Birds ' Charter , no bird could prey on another or another 's produce ; but the king 's behaviour towards Mrs Hen ushered in a new era , one in which uncertainty was the order of the day . <p> * * * <p> Mrs Hen continued to search for the lost key . Her desperation was aggravated by the demise of each chick . She thought if she found the key Mr Falcon might forgive her , the chickens might stop blaming her for putting the entire species into disrepute , the other birds might stop seeing her as a foolish bird , and slowly but surely everything would return to normal . But one morning , a few days later , Mrs Hen and all chickens were banished from Dushe . That morning the other birds sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace into the wilderness . <p> On the way , in the distance ahead , the chickens saw figures that looked like giant birds . They thought those must be Mr Falcon 's secret army . They changed direction a number of times in order to avoid an encounter , but every time they emerged the giant birds miraculously appeared in front of them . They kept running and wished they could fly , but out of sheer fatigue they stopped and waited in resignation for the strange birds to catch up with them . <p> The big one , almost as big as a horse , endowed with a neck as long as a giraffe , introduced herself as Mrs Ostrich ; and the short one , with a hideous horn atop her head , said she was Mrs Guinea Fowl-Whistler or some such thing , and together they were the first Dushe rejects . Their crime , they were told , was that they were flightless birds , therefore could n't be regarded as birds at all and had to leave . But it turned out Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchlings away from the sight of the other birds . They now lived as nomads , moving from one place to another to confuse the enemy . But the chickens did n't know whether to believe them or not , and travelled on . <p> * * * <p> When they arrived at a pebbly cave on a plateau , very far from where they 'd come , the chickens settled and named it Kude-le . The following morning , their first morning in Kude-le , when everybody woke up , Mrs Hen was already outside , frantically scratching the ground like she had in Dushe . She did n't speak when spoken to , she just scratched and scratched and did n't stop even when her feet started bleeding . Part of her soul had gone with her late chicks . <p> Meanwhile , after the sad departure of the chickens from Dushe , Mr Falcon was seen entering the royal closet in the usual way , using a golden key , but no bird knew where he 'd found it , or if there was a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first instance . <p> * * * <p> The words of Mrs Ostrich and Mrs Guinea Fowl-Whistler hit home one afternoon when Mr Falcon arrived quietly in Kude-le and clawed away a baby chick from Mrs Hen 's newest brood . He stalked the chickens of Kude-le even when the Year of the Feather had passed . <p> The cocks of Kude-le could be heard calling each other at the crack of dawn , " Kwek , I miss the Dushe days ! " <p> " I hear there is no more Dushe to speak of . " <p> " Kwek , I miss the other birds . " <p> " Let 's go find them in the forest . " <p> " Kwek , has the key been found ? " <p> " I doubt it .

The chicks , unlike the hens and roosters , were more concerned with creating a just society of birds than they were in finding the lost key ; but the grownups dismissed them as na ? ve upstarts , and it went on like that for generations . <p> As for Mrs Hen , she grew very old and whenever she saw a bird flying over she gathered her chicks under her wings . If she was lucky enough to spot Mr Falcon from a treetop Mrs Hen crossed the road and ran to safety .

@@4915236 There 's more to your medical aid choice than annual increases <h> As households nationwide begin to reshuffle home expenses in an effort to accommodate the above-inflation medical aid premium increases for the New Year , many people are asking if perhaps other medical aids offer better value . <p> Jill Larkan , Head of GTC Healthcare Consulting , a division of leading financial advisory business GTC , advises that contribution increases are not the only element to consider when deciding whether to change plans for 2016 . <p> Current age profile <p> " Yes , premiums are important but over and above the annual increases , there are three important areas which should be assessed each year , in order to confirm the longevity and sustainability of your medical aid plan , " says Larkan . <p> To ensure that medical aids do n't compromise on the benefits within the plan in the years ahead , or to prevent them from suddenly charging unreasonable premiums in the future , Larkan says that it is critical to know the medical aid plan 's current age profile compared to the industry average . <p> " Also make sure you - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " she cautions . <p> Larkan says that the average age of a scheme is an excellent reflection of a medical aid plan 's future sustainability and this information can be extracted from the Council of Medical Scheme 's ( CMS ) Annual Report , for every medical aid countrywide . <p> For example , the CMS ' Annual report for 2014-5 states the average age for open Medical Aid Plans as 33.6 years . <p> Larkan advises that any medical aid plan with a similar -- or even lower -- average age would be a sustainable , reliable option , while any plan that 's indicating an average age of over 40 years carries an element of risk which you would otherwise not have been aware of . <p> " Stable average ages , or even plans where the average age is reducing , should result in stable or increasing solvency levels from your medical aid , which is an ideal situation to have with the medical aid plan you 've selected , " Larkan continues . <p> Number of members <p> Linked to average age is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear indicator of the level of claims which the scheme can expect in the future . <p> In addition to average age profiles and pensioner ratios , Larkan recommends checking the number of members on a medical aid plan . It 's also important to review if that number is growing or declining . <p> " Check what the number of members on your scheme has been doing over the past few years , " she says . <p> " If your scheme is not bringing on new members -- and preferably new younger members each year -- the scheme once again carries an increased risk element . " <p> With members ageing naturally each year , a medical aid scheme will automatically age by one year in a full 12 month cycle . It 's therefore important for schemes to be bringing younger members onto the scheme each year in order to balance the average age . <p> " Younger members are important because they help schemes to maintain favourable claims ratios , " says Larkan . <p> Finally , Larkan advises members to check the solvency ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Best options and value for money <p> " A solvency ratio is very closely related to the growth or decline in memberships , " she says . " When a medical aid scheme has too many high claims , which is also known as a poor claims ratio , these medical aids will have no choice but to use their reserves to offset these costs and balance the budget . " <p> Professional healthcare consultants should be making use of all the statistical data which is available in the Council for Medical Schemes annual reports in order to provide companies and members with the best advice about plans in the year ahead . <p> Larkan is well aware of the difficulties members face in selecting a medical aid that offers best options and value for money for their employees .

I personally can vouch for most recruiters , internal and external , who skip straight to the education section of candidate 's CVs and then move onto their work histories to assess their experience . <p> Focus your precious time on your CV and LinkedIn profile <p> We understand that your spare time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have the greatest impact . Does your CV stand out from the rest of the pack ? Is your CV in a professional format , with the same font used throughout with no spelling or grammatical errors ? Is your LinkedIn profile up to date ? Have you asked people for endorsements and added all of your courses , diplomas and degrees onto your profile ? This is time better spent in my opinion . <p> Why do you insist on repeating yourself ? <p> Most people just regurgitate the information in their CV onto their cover letter . What is the point of this ? People are going to read your CV regardless so why do they need to read a cover letter ? <p> The only time that I feel you should include a cover letter is when you are asked for one .

We 've set up a separate company in the UK , Solar Stone Energy ; effectively we are trying to create a utility scale solar project on rooftops . So we are aggregating a bunch of rooftops to build a big solar power plant , " says Callcott-Stevens . <p> It gets even more pie in the sky -- especially when we are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trio want to give them panels for free . <p> " We cover the costs of the installation and on-going monitoring and maintenance . There is absolutely zero cost to you .

By generating electricity on your roof , we receive a Feed-in-Tariff ( FiT ) through a government-backed subsidy programme .

" <p> They feel it could find favour with London 's population of 8.3 million . <p> " If you look at what 's happening in the States and in Europe , in solar and wind energy , people are putting solar on their rooves and creating their own power .

That 's not to say you wo n't have coal or nuclear power stations . It just changes the game .

Although James says it will take another 16 years to see a profit , it could n't have come at a better time . Eskom , South Africa 's power supplier , regularly cuts the power -- a legacy of under investment and delays in coal stations , such as Medupi and Kusile .

Last year , Eskom announced that 77 bids were received for Round 4 of the programme , for a total of 5,804MW . Of these , 13 were accepted as preferred bidders , for a total of 1,121MW installed capacity at a cost of R23 billion ( $1.8 billion ) . <p> " By the 4th round , the tariff prices have halved .

Sub-Saharan Africa is obviously closer to home so it 's easier to look at . The solar rooftop model works really well in a deregulated market .

" <p> The Shabaab , east Africa 's long-time al-Qaeda branch , is headquartered in Somalia where it is fighting to overthrow the internationally-backed government in Mogadishu , which is protected by 22 000 African Union troops , including Kenyan soldiers . <p> The Islamists have lost much ground in recent years , but remain a threat in both Somalia and neighbouring Kenya , where factions have carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 67 people at Nairobi 's Westgate Mall in 2013 and the massacre of 148 people at a university in Garissa in April . <p> Somalia <p> The militants say the attacks are retaliation for the Kenyan military presence in Somalia and " war crimes " committed by Kenyan troops . <p> Inside Somalia , some factions were reported to have pledged their allegiance to ISIS in October . <p> But pro-ISIS groups have been attacked and their leaders assassinated as Shabaab emir and al-Qaeda loyalist Ahmed Diriye seeks to shore up his control . <p> The statement on Thursday is the first time Kenya has said there were also ISIS factions operating in the country . <p> Those now loyal to ISIS operate in the far northeastern Mandera region , while the al-Qaeda force is based in the southeastern Boni Forest district , police said . <p> " We are sounding the alert to tell our people to remain very vigilant and not to drop their guard , because al-Shabaab in its many manifestations is still a threat , " Boinnet told reporters . <p> It was not immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in allegiance . <p> The reported divisions come at a time when Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has become the jihadist franchise of choice , attracting fighters from abroad and the allegiance of other militant groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria . <p> But al-Qaeda has also recently expanded its territory in Yemen , just across the Gulf of Aden from Somalia . <h> Tell us a bit about yourself : <h> Saving your profile <h> Settings <p> News24 allows you to edit the display of certain components based on a location .

@@4939240 <h> Volatility is name of game for rand <p> London - It has been a horrible year for the rand as US Federal Reserve tightening , commodity prices and China 's slowdown combined with a dire domestic situation to weaken the currency . <p> And while 2016 will see some improvement in the macro picture , South Africa 's economy remains structurally flawed , pointing towards more rand weakness . <p> The macro concerns have not gone away , but the most acute period of pain is probably over . The US has made the initial leap in raising interest rates and given a more certain outlook for the path of rate hikes next year . The genuine worry about China 's growth prospects is priced into the market . While plunging energy prices mean South Africa 's terms of trade have remained relatively stable over the past five months compared with oil exporters such as Russia . That 's the good news . <p> The bad news is that the economy 's structural flaws are here to stay . Unemployment remains stubbornly above 25 percent . Political issues , including a power struggle at the top of the ANC , are weighing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nene on December 9 was a big hit to the country 's credibility which the appointment of Pravin Gordhan a few days later has not amended . <p> Growth projections continue to be downgraded by economists ; 2016 consensus gross domestic product ( GDP ) forecast is now for 1.4 percent growth compared with 2.4 percent in July . After November 's purchasing managers ' index data fell to the lowest level in six years , there is a risk that even these reduced figures could be over-optimistic . <p> The current account deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP remains a major risk for the currency , though it has narrowed recently , especially in a world where US rates are going up . <p> This keeps upward pressure on South African yields , which only further constrains the growth outlook . The rand has roughly halved in value against its trade-weighted index over the past four-and-a-half years . <p> It has fallen more against both the Chinese yuan , and China is South Africa 's key trading partner , and against the dollar , which is the currency denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corporate level . <p> All this currency weakness helps ease those domestic concerns , but data is not yet indicating that the rand is overly cheap . <p> So what 's the ultimate conclusion for the rand ? Volatility , perhaps . It 's unlikely that we 've reached the nadir for the rand , but a more conducive macro-environment may lead to occasional powerful rallies as investors finally start returning to emerging markets globally .
