PHOTO : APP <p> In the aftermath of the War of Independence of 1857 , Sir Syed Ahmad Khan ( 1817-1898 ) emerged as a key leader of the Indian Muslim community , being a thoroughly modern Muslim in a thoroughly pre-modern age . He is credited for originating the Two Nation Theory , founding the Aligarh Movement and being a founding father of Pakistan . <p> Less celebrated are his achievements in providing a modern , scientific and rational interpretation of Islam and the Holy Quran , as well as his debates on culture that -- in the face of stern opposition from fundamentalists and detractors -- sowed the seeds of enlightenment and progress .

His writings in our textbooks are purely limited to the Two Nation Theory , his books on the ancient monuments of Delhi , and the causes of the 1857 War of Independence , namely Asaar-us-Sanadeed and Asbaab Baghavat-e-Hind , though he wrote a lot more on themes such as culture and civilisation , and was one of the earliest Muslim champions of interfaith understanding and peace , especially in his dealings with blasphemy . <p> Similarly , his opponents and detractors misrepresent his secular and scientific thought , as well as the fact that like all great thinkers , Sir Syed 's thought also evolved throughout his long life . This letter forms part of the Mazameen-e-Sir Syed edited by Azizuddin Akhtar and published by the Muslim Educational Press , Aligarh ( undated ) , and this is the only such collection of Sir Syed 's multiple essays this translator has seen where this letter has been published . Hence , the occasion marks the need for an original translation into English and a fresh re-reading . <p> My dears ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have passed many stages . I am descending from the spacious and blossoming hill of life with disappointed steps and an unfulfilled heart , having seen its wonders and curiosities once , and my greater sorrow is due to the reason that the tools nature had granted me while strolling on the hill of old age , I could not make proper use of them , owing to my ignorance and waywardness ; there were gardens waving everywhere from the initial stage of the hill up to the high peak . The flowers of wishes and desires were blooming everywhere and without exception , the beautiful trees of hope could be seen bending down with pretty flowers at every destination , and a strange refreshing breeze could be seen giving freshness and cheer in everything and every place ; in short , there were provisions of mirth and ecstasy . <p> There was an open invitation for the traveller to use as he desired . There was no hindrance , to benefit from them was up to the intelligence and desire of the traveller , but alas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept believing the atmosphere and the spring would carry on like this , and this pleasant and delightful provision will not finish until the final part of the destination . But how wrong I was , now that I look upon the part of the destination travelled already , standing at the final spot of old age , I can retrieve nothing except regret and sorrow ; an extremely extensive and exciting part of age has passed . When I look ahead , all the scenes appear to be a thorny valley and one views such a high ascent , to successfully negotiate what is an imaginary hope . The horrible visage of the scene ahead and the beauty of the already-travelled destination and the thoughts of having abandoned it without any credo distract my mind such that the remaining energy also appears to be lost . <p> O dears ! Why did I attain this disappointment , and why could I not take advantage of the world according to my wish ? Only because I did not understand the value of time . During my early age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my welfare , I did nothing . Unfortunately , I did not find a leader or guide who could put me on the right path ; I was not fortunate to have a patron or benefactor who could endeavour to turn my actions towards adequate determination . With my own control and intelligence , without any perfect guide or compass , I rowed my boat , so much so that upon my witnessing the limitless surface of the sea of existence after arriving at a dangerous rock , I saw the people who made use of wisdom and adherence to the rules and understood time to be an invaluable capital ; how happy and fulfilled they are crossing the sea of existence , otherwise what could not have emphasised the flight of time and the need to benefit from it ? But I , in my foolishness , did not understand its prodding . <p> Year after year , the sun , leaving the morning , making its usual circuit over its bluish roof , set in the west .

The lightning tried to open my closed eyes with its glow , but alas ! My sleeping heart did not awaken . The thunder tried to open my ears by clapping with incredible force . But my ears stayed put . The wind , fast and violent , cold and warm , of all types , kept moving , but I was least alerted . The watch was in my pocket every time and kept informing me of every minute and second with its mournful voice about the flight of time , but I never understood that this in fact was the tick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I took it out of my pocket to look , but sometimes it was 6pm , at other times 10pm , or midnight .

While writing in this space on the occasion of his 90th birthday , I had noted that he was not only a literary craftsman who had imbibed the art of creating natural , effortless humour out of the ordinary , but that his travelling had also exposed him to the Cold War machinations of the newly departed colonial powers , especially in the Middle East . <p> Even before Insha was struck by the disastrous Arab defeat to Israel in 1967 , he travelled the Middle East . Whatever tragedy he saw unfolding in its bazaars and bylanes , he distilled his entire anguish in the form of a long poem , Baghdad Ki Ek Raat ( A Night in Baghdad ) , written exactly 70 years ago this year . A veritable modern Arabian Nights written at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem today is starkly prescient in anticipating the humiliating subjugation of the Middle East by imperial powers , in league with its various shahs , emirs and tinpot dictators , many of whom are still in power . <p> Insha 's villains are not only the imperial powers ( in the poem it is Lawrence and Glubb Pasha ) and their straps in the region , but also the cunning oil traders . On the other hand , his heroes are the ordinary people of the region , the oppressed masses ; its " rusted slaves , importunate beggars , the peasant and the workers of the oil mill " . Later in the poem , he wondered aloud whether the region was resigned to its benighted fate . But like all progressive writers , Insha was an optimist and gently encouraged the ' people of Egypt and Baghdad ' to awaken and take their fate into their own hands . <p> Insha , who died young at the age of 50 , could not live to see that at least the Iranian masses rose up to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Iranian Revolution ( which will turn 40 next month ) , and just 60 years after this poem was written , the masses in not only Egypt , but Tunis , Cairo , Sana'a , Damascus , Manama and even Khartoum ( as I write this ) awakened to take back their rights in the form of the Arab Spring . Insha would have been elated at this development , and perhaps would have written a follow-up to his aforementioned poem . <p> To mark the occasion , I am presenting selected excerpts from the poem translated in English for the first time for lovers of Insha , as well as to aid a deeper understanding of the poet and humanist who was against war and all forms of imperial exploitation , and believed in a socialist future for mankind : <p> Sindbad take me with you today , <p> One entertains the mind when one wants to be entertained . <p> With you , I disappear from the view of time , <p> A constellation of thoughts accompanies me . <p> Now or after , perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were halcyon days , everyone had leisure <p> People used to live in kingly splendour <p> Everyone used to have a magic lamp in their pocket , <p> Djinns used to perform every task . <p> Where is the Baghdad of Scherezade 's imagination ? <p> Politics of oil and crude dominates the atmosphere , <p> Even some caliph disguised as an oil trader <p> Emerges from a Baghdad thoroughfare . <p> Till when will the city and desert nourish this hunger ? <p> Will Aladdin 's magic lamps be for everyone no longer ? <p> Will no Prince deliver the counter-magic ? <p> Will someone suggest an escape route ? <p> From the lanes of Bukhara and Samarkand , the morning breeze brings the message of spring <p> The author is a Pakistani social scientist , book critic and translator .

Similarly , secret funds of 12 ministries ( used mostly for political lobbying ) have also been abolished . <p> Merely declaring that secret fund &amp; discretionary funds end is not enough , check &amp; declare where &amp; how they were spend #budget2013 <p> Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced a 45% cut in the expenses of the prime minister 's office and a 44% cut in the budget of the Prime Minister House . According to him , Pakistan needs a strong fiscal discipline , where every department has to perform efficiently and within the available means . <p> The PML-N government announced it will not keep more than 40 ministries in order to curb expenses alongside announcing a 30% reduction in non-developmental expenses of each ministry . <p> According to Dar , if we were to comply with the economic vision of the PML-N , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . <p> Looking at the initiatives , that are mostly criticised for their political motives we find various successful programs pursued by Shahbaz Sharif 's Punjab government spread all over the country . The Free Laptop scheme , the national internship program , cheap loans for young entrepreneurs and the Qarz-e-Hasana program are a few particularly youth welfare projects . <p> The continuation of the Benazir Income Support Program has been a good development , though the government changed its name . I wish they could retain the original name alongside developing a transparent mechanism to ensure fair distribution of the money to people who deserve it . <p> Reservations and few disappointments : <p> Every educated Pakistani understands that the economic performance of the previous government has been more than dismal . While recognising the change and a few important initiatives of the government , Ishaq Dar disappointed us on a few but very important notes . <p> For instance , the government has increased the General Sales Tax ( GST ) by 1% , this will definitely effect everyone . However , why did they skip imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a professional earning more than Rsseven million a year is taxed , why are you skipping " the feudal lords " earning billions from their agricultural lands ? <p> Nobody denies that Pakistan needs a sound tax culture , where the burden of the running state is endured by all . However , the strong lobbies of industrialists and " zamindars " once again succeeded in not allowing their incomes to be taxed . <p> We provide subsidised urea , fertilisers and seeds to them , which is more than enough of a reason to tax them ! <p> Similarly , we find that the ' wealth tax ' has been revised , but do not understand the mechanism and its effects . Above all , we have seen that Federal Board Revenue ( FBR ) has been missing its tax collection targets for the past three years , is it guaranteed that it will achieve ambitious targets this time ? <p> The bottleneck in tax collection is administrative corruption in various departments that cause a whooping loss of around Rs500 billion . <p> I do trust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the booming housing sector and luxury apartments are still out of the tax net . We are encouraging the import of hybrid cars at a time when we are unable to supply power to homes and industries ! <p> The last but not the least important point is about the salaries of government employees . Increasing minimum pension to Rs5000 is very good , but what about their pay ? <p> Pensioners are more in number and hence , necessitate greater investment as compared to salaried employees . At least a 10% increment in the salaries should have been made to help people avoid the shocks of the official 13% inflation rate . <p> Conclusively , economic decision making in Pakistan has always been crippled by the lack of vision , short-sightedness , political expediencies and weak governments . With a stable and strong government in the centre , we do believe that the government will take all possible measures to restructure the economy . <p> The documentation of economy , taxing rich , targeted subsidies , the elimination of non-development expenditures and focusing on long-term plans are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sustainable growth . <p> In short , the budget has its pros and cons , we can debate everything ; however , I believe that every Pakistani will have to support the government for its difficult but correct economic decisions . <p> This is a golden opportunity for the PML-N leadership to make their ' Asian Tiger ' slogan a reality . <p> Political maturity and economic wisdom has to be compatible in order for it to work . This can also be done by promoting education and not hiding anything from the public .

The train that had taken me from Taipei Main Station to Houtong cost only about 56NTD ( S$2.40 ) , although an Uber driver had told me it 'd cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , which would still be a sensible and affordable option for families . <p> After bidding farewell to the last , satisfyingly affectionate cat , whom I befriended using another tourist 's treats , I took the train back to the town of Ruifang where , after some nimble Googling , I discovered that Jiufen was only about 10 minutes away by local taxi . <p> Most tourists to Taiwan will recognise Jiufen 's signature red lanterns and old-fashioned , multi-storeyed tea houses from postcards and travel sites , or for its uncanny resemblance to the village featured in Hayao Miyazaki 's Spirited Away , and I was delighted to be visiting the mountain town for the very first time . <p> Immediately after I arrived , I found myself lost in its dizzying alleyways , filled with tea shops , souvenir shops and stalls selling popular Taiwanese street food items , like peanut ice cream rolls , taro balls and my favourite -- freshly grilled Kurobuta sausages . Feeling slightly overwhelmed by the heat and hordes of tourists , I ducked into a tea house that I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the more famous , but also more crowded , A Mei Tea House . <p> It turned out to be an excellent decision , and serendipity at its best . Jioufen Teahouse , where I found myself , was housed in a 100-year-old red brick building that retained all of its historic and romantic charm . I was led to my own private booth , where I found utter quiet bliss . I ended up staying for hours , reading my book , sipping on cups of Jin Xuan -- a lightly sweet , buttery variety of Oolong that is native to Taiwan -- looking up occasionally only to brew my tea , or refill my own cup . <p> On my way to the bathroom -- a trip made necessary after my fourth pot of tea -- I discovered a ceramic art workshop in the basement of the tea house , as well as a display area filled with exquisitely crafted tea paraphernalia . There were some pretty pots I would have loved to take home , but much of what was being sold was far above what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that the owner of the tea house was a painter and a ceramic artist who 'd made all the teapots and cups used by guests himself , especially when I had so thoroughly enjoyed the experience . <p> FOOD TRIPPING IN KEELUNG <p> Rather than head straight back to Taipei , I decided to make one last stop at the port city of Keelung , via a 45-minute bus ride that cost me 15NTD ( S$0.65 ) . Keelung is known for sightseeing spots like Lover 's Lake and the Buddha Hand Cave , but I really had eyes only for its Miaokou Night Market , located right next to the Keelung Habour and , happily , the bus and train station . <p> By the time I arrived , at about 7pm , the night market festivities were already in full swing . It was absolute , organised chaos . There were so many people and so many things to see , I did n't know where to begin . I even spotted a man pulling a small cart with his two children and toy poodles around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . I followed the sea of hungry visitors as it ebbed and flowed through the night market , trying to decide what I should eat , given my rather limited capacity for food . <p> There was the usual Taiwanese night market fare that can also be found in Taipei , like lu rou fan ( braised pork rice ) , fried chicken , meatballs , shaved ice and oyster omelettes . But there were also numerous seafood stalls , selling everything from grilled squid to butter crabs . After much indecision , I settled for some grilled king oyster mushrooms , two servings of delicious fried sweet potato balls , and a delectable crab and mushroom soup , all of which added up to about 160 NTD ( S$7 ) . <p> It had been the perfect end to a perfect day out , filled with more tea and goodies than I should have stuffed in my body , and a renewed appreciation for Taiwan and all it has to offer . With my belly full of treats and a wallet still fuller than expected , I hopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a leaf out of my new feline friends ' book , I curled up in bed until the work week began again .

@@51057233 <p> Earlier this year , English Biscuit Manufacturers ventured into a new snacking category , packaged cupcakes , with the launch of Cake Up , a centre-filled cupcake brand . " Given that Peek Freans enjoys a large customer base , high recall , and is synonymous with snack time , it made sense to launch Cake Up under the Peek Freans umbrella , " said Ayesha Janjua , Head of Marketing , EBM . <p> EBM has been spearheading the growth of the biscuit category for the last 50 years and currently accounts for almost 50% of the biscuit category 's market share in Pakistan . It has a diverse portfolio comprising 14 brands -- including plain , sweet and value-added biscuits ( such as peanut , pista and chocolate ) , with most of them leading in their respective categories . <h> Cake Up 's USP , according to Janjua , is that the fillings are made from real ingredients . This means that real strawberry pulp is used for filling a strawberry cupcake and not just syrup , while real cocoa is used for the chocolate cupcake and not flavouring . <p> It was this success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given their baking expertise , cake appeared to be the most relevant one . According to Janjua , " we wanted to take advantage of our experience and enter a new category that has the potential to grow .

" <p> Presently , the packaged cake segment has predominantly one big player -- Hilal -- and several small players , such as Dawn , Bake Parlor and Cake Shake . New players , such as Gibbs , are entering the market and experimenting with Swiss rolls and cake slices . However , it would be premature to define market shares in this category . <p> Cake Up was launched with four variants -- strawberry , caramel , chocolate and double chocolate cupcakes . While strawberry-filled and chocolate-filled cakes are available in the market , caramel and double chocolate are new flavours introduced by EBM . " We explored the different kinds of variants that are available in packaged cakes worldwide and fixed upon those that would suit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The campaign 's tagline was ' real rishtey ' .

Cake Up 's USP , according to Janjua , is that the fillings are made from real ingredients . This means that real strawberry pulp is used for filling a strawberry cupcake and not just syrup , while real cocoa is used for the chocolate cupcake and not flavouring . " We wanted to make sure that we delivered a quality , great tasting product to our customers in the same way we have done for biscuits , " said Janjua . To develop a packaged cupcake , EBM undertook extensive R&amp;D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients . <p> According to Janjua , " our variants target children and adults and the product line-up , packaging and the communication has been developed to cater to different age groups and not only position it as a children 's snack .

" This is the average price in the market and we managed to produce a great quality offering that is competitively priced , " said Janjua . <p> The launch was promoted by a 360-degree campaign ( developed and executed by Ogilvy India in collaboration with Ogilvy Pakistan ) . The objective was to inform people that a new product had been launched by EBM in the market . Once the initial goal was achieved , the focus shifted to establishing a brand identity .

The brand 's message is that just as relationships bring us joy , happiness and love , Cake Up too adds a dash of sweetness to all interactions with loved ones . <p> To engage people and induce trial consumption , ' Bake Your Own Cake Up ' activities were arranged at major malls ( Dolmen City , Karachi ; Packages Mall , Lahore ; Centaurus Mall , Islamabad ) where a virtual Cake Up Factory was set up .

" <p> Although the brand has been in the market for only three months , EBM say it has already outperformed their initial sales estimates . This is a major win for the brand given that this is EBM 's first foray into the packaged cupcakes category . Janjua is optimistic about the future of the packaged cakes segment in Pakistan ; in her opinion , despite there being several snacking options , packaged cakes are a unique offering in terms of taste , convenience and affordability . <p> 100 million people in this country are below the age of 18 .

@@51057237 <h> Promoting excellence in advertising <p> I was 19 years old . Sitting on my hands , anxiously leaning forward as Zuhra Karim , dressed in a crisp sari gathered neatly at the shoulder , read a piece I had written with an inscrutable expression . At stake was an internship at She magazine . I had been referred by a friend who was a regular contributor . After 15 minutes of pin-drop silence , Mrs Karim peered over her glasses and told me with a half-smile and her trademark ' betay ' in a clipped English accent that it was good and I could start on Monday . And that was the start of a two-month internship , which turned into a job that lasted two years . <p> Mrs Karim was my first boss ; the editor and publisher at She , a publication launched in 1963 with great optimism and a progressive stance . My interaction with her was limited to mainly : a ) praise for the good pieces I had written , b ) being given more work when she thought I had too much time on my hands ( in my defence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperating and satisfying in equal measure ) and c ) a blunt conversation when a colleague complained about me . She heard me out patiently and then with the same half-smile said it was probably because I was leaving the colleague in question out and was more friendly with my fellow intern . At her behest , said colleague and I sorted things out in a car ride home and are still friends . <p> She was the best start for a professional career that one could hope for . The office was a high ceilinged loft like space , open-planned ( before open plan became a thing ) and inhabited mostly by women barring five men ; the illustrator/page maker ( all manual in those days ) , the computer operator ( a later addition , giving the illustrator more time to draw portraits of the girls ) , two marketing men who never spoke and reported to the formidable Mrs Masood and the tea man who made the most awful tea ( may God rest his soul ) . Mrs Karim was strict about timings and liked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl from a convent school ; there was never any talk of religion or politics and diversity was encouraged . <p> Perviz Masani remembers Mrs Karim as a die-hard perfectionist . She was a demanding boss but generous with opportunities which we were all hungry for . " She was low-key and refused to give interviews . Perhaps this is why she was such an enigma . " And she was an enigma , even to those of us who worked with her . A stickler for routine and discipline , she was deeply private and reserved but her door was always open for feedback , critique or advice . <h> " She taught me the work ethic that took me on future career paths , she taught me time and people management , how to balance work and family . You hear a lot of conversations and pronouncements around women 's rights and women helping women but Zuhra Karim just got on with it , all in a day 's work . " <p> When it came to stories and opportunities there were no holds barred . Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work-life balance ( except for the week before the issue went to print ) . An Urdu version of the magazine was introduced to bring in more readership . Apart from the fashion and fluff , there were serious stories on women 's issues , social issues and health . I do n't ever remember any of our stories being censored , or being told what we could or could not cover . " For me , she was the mentor who encouraged me to think in ways I was not used to , question situations I took for granted and raise issues that sometimes I did n't even know existed , " adds Masani . <p> It was a great mix of the superficial and the meaningful -- so no surprises that it was the highest selling English magazine at 30,000 copies at that time ( easily outselling Herald which pleased her to no end ) . At the time we liked to think we were quietly changing society with articles on women 's health , interviews with feminist icons and frank conversations . It is somewhat poignant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today , more than ever before , our country needs women to help it battle against centuries of prejudice , superstition and ignorance .

You hear a lot of conversations and pronouncements around women 's rights and women helping women but Zuhra Karim just got on with it , all in a day 's work .

By the time the magazine took a sabbatical , Mrs Karim and Omar Kureishi had divorced and she married Masud Karim . When the magazine returned , so did Bilquis Nasrullah . That Mrs Karim 's friendship with Aunty Billy ( as she was known in the office ) survived a divorce is remarkable and that they returned to work side by side is incredible but completely in line with Mrs Karim 's stoic and pragmatic nature . <p> Writer Sabyn Javeri , who worked at the magazine some years later , calls her a true class act ; " a hard task master ... uncompromising , a perfectionist and an absolute professional . I do n't think I have ever met anyone quite like her . " <p> Like Sabyn , everything I learned about professionalism and teamwork I learned at She . If I am able to critique my own work , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabyn who considered Mrs Karim a friend , the rest of us never really did get to know the person behind the reserved exterior . She was , as Perviz said : " an enigma " . And while I found her intriguing , I was never able to muster the courage to begin a conversation . Perhaps she would have surprised me . <p> In the last decade , she gradually withdrew from work , eventually ceasing completely as her health dwindled . She raised two children ( three if you count the magazine ) and was a devoted grandmother by all accounts . Her passing coincided with the demise of another icon -- Herald magazine . I have a sneaking suspicion while she would commiserate with the latter she would have been secretly pleased that She outlived them both . 
@@51057238 <h> Promoting excellence in advertising <p> A review of the latest campaigns that centred around celebrating the love for Pakistan . <p> When it comes to patriotism in Pakistan , two things stand out -- music and mothers forcing their kids to wear green and white clothes . Music has always played an important part in reviving the national spirit in people . It has moved the nation in times of war and played a huge part in the celebration of victories . We all have that one favourite song that really ignites a sense of patriotism within us , making us proud to be a Pakistani . In 2017 , many brands turned to music to celebrate the jazba junoon for Pakistan . Here are five campaigns that centred around celebrating the love for our country . <p> BRAND : Strepsils <p> Agency : Adcom ZenithOptimedia <p> Campaign : Strepsils Stereo <p> Message : A tribute to one of Pakistan 's favourite national songs . <p> Effectiveness : First of all , whoever came up with this , you guys deserve a raise ! This is the stuff brand managers ' dreams are made of . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade had been really tough on us as a nation . We need all the positivity we can muster to lift ourselves and our image . Unfortunately , the reality is that in the past 10 years , our young may have lost the kind of connect with our country that we had while growing up . Coming back to the campaign , Strepsils Pakistan have done a wonderful job in reviving an old classic ; paying tribute to the great Alamgir with this A capella rendition of Khayal Rakhna . The video is vibrant and dare I say , quite un-independence-like . Shedding the sherwani for funky styles and reflector shades , iconic singers and most importantly , the biggest winner for me is a STRONG BRAND CONNECT . A smart way to connect the young with the country again . The amazing digital response and trending on social media shows it is a sure-shot winner . <p> Verdict : Fun , fresh and festive . <p> BRAND : Khaadi <p> Agency : In-house <p> Campaign:Main Bhi Pakistan Hoon <p> Message : Celebrating the spirit of inclusion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have no baggage ; no salvaging dying sales or launching an SKU ... Independence Day is one of those instances when clients are as positive as you are , the goal is equally clear and spirits are high . Khaadi 's Independence Day campaign touched upon a sensitive issue this year : inclusion . A bold subject , ramped up by the powerful vocals of Meesha Shafi . Khaadi wanted to remind us that the white in the flag is as much Pakistani as the rest . With ' Main Bhi Pakistan Hoon ' , Khaadi signifies that as individuals we may be different , but we are bound by the same common thread . <p> Verdict : Thought-provoking campaign . <p> BRAND : HabibMetro Bank <p> Concept &amp; Producer : Javed Jabbar <p> Executive Producer : Alia Chughtai <p> Lyrics : Ali Hayat Rizvi <p> Campaign:Pakistaniyat -- Celebrating 70 Years of Pakistan <p> Message : Pakistan is our one true identity . <p> Effectiveness : I was pleasantly surprised by this campaign . I did not expect a brand to make such a selfless campaign . As creatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , this campaign truly celebrates nationalism without forcefully putting the brand in . Beautifully shot and with the strong message of our one identity , this one had me really connect with the thought and spirit of being a Pakistani . I liked how they named all the minorities and said we are all one . I liked how it talks about our soch ki aazadi and insaniyat . I liked how they have put a positive spin on the word Pakistaniyat ... before this , I had only heard this term in a negative context , when someone littered or drove on the wrong side of the road . <p> Verdict : Strong message , great execution . <p> BRAND : Coca-Cola <p> Agency : Ogilvy &amp; Mather Pakistan <p> Campaign : Coke Studio <p> Message : Celebrating Independence Day of Pakistan . <p> Effectiveness : Let me start by saying that I am a huge Coke Studio fan . I have been following it since season one and I ca n't get enough of it . I even hooked my three-year-old son to the songs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrating Independence Day with a national song , sung by the featured artists of the season . The last two songs were phenomenal . However , this year , they opted for the national anthem . My first thought was , why ? Why would you want to feature a piece you ca n't experiment with ? You ca n't change the arrangement . You ca n't change the melody . You ca n't play around with the words . I thought that if anyone could rise to the challenge , it would be Coke Studio . Did it work ? In my opinion , NO ! The song lacked passion and the visuals were morbid . I wanted to see pride and love for our country on the faces of the singers . Instead , they looked expressionless , blank and lost . The same feeling was reflected in the song . It was the wrong choice . Coke Studio has produced such powerful and memorable songs in the past . This time , it just did n't work . <p> Verdict : The expectations were high but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Blue Dot <p> **33;2510;TOOLONG <p> Message : Celebrating all that is great about Pakistan . <p> Effectiveness : This campaign ran for about four months and concluded with an Independence Day song paying tribute to the different icons of Pakistan . Now please do n't hate me for what I 'm going to say . I admit I have been guilty of doing the same thing in the past , but now , whenever I hear a heavy voice-over with clich ? d zoom-in , zoom-out shots , I snooze ! We have seen and heard it too much . There is nothing new ; nothing that we do n't know already or that makes us think . I feel that the marketing team needs to become a little braver , step out of their comfort zone and look for something fresh and new . The music as well just did n't appeal to me at all . 
@@51057240 <p> AYESHA SHAIKH:C.K . Prahalad defined the Bottom of the Pyramid ( BoP ) as " people earning less than $1,500 a year . " How would you define BoP within the context of Pakistan ? FAHAD ASHRAF : Reckitt Benckiser ( RB ) defines BoP as those underprivileged consumers who have reduced purchasing power in terms of value , but in terms of absolute numbers , constitute the largest proportion of Pakistan 's population . According to the Government of Pakistan 's poverty measurement statistics , approximately 60 million people live below the poverty line and essentially this is the BoP population segment for Pakistan . <p> AS : Prahalad 's book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid was published in 2004 and the idea of tapping into this massive market potential immediately gained traction with brands across the world . Why has it taken more than a decade for BoP Marketing to reach Pakistan ? FA : BoP has been a talking point in brand circles for quite some time , but on-ground initiatives have taken off only recently and this has been triggered by the changing technological landscape , which has made BoP consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technology , particularly cellular technology , has created an enabling environment . The speed with which cell phone penetration has increased among BoP consumers has opened up avenues for businesses to reach out to them . Previously , communication media was limited to a few terrestrial channels , like PTV , print and radio and there was no way to directly interact and engage with the largest population segment of the country . Now , there are almost 40 to 50 million cell phone subscribers and SMS marketing has become an important outreach tool . As more people switch to smartphones ( Google has projected that by 2018 , the cost of an average smartphone in Pakistan will come down to Rs 500 ) and have access to 3G , the possibilities of BoP will increase . Small shops in remote villages today stock bread , eggs , milk -- and cell phones . <p> AS : How has RB brought BoP to Pakistan ? FA : RB launched the first pilot under ' Project Hope ' last year in Dhori village near Sargodha . The initiative was aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the low-income BoP consumer . To improve the project 's effectiveness , we collaborated with Save the Children and Plan International ( an international NGO specialising in healthcare solutions ) as well as government organisations . Our goal is realising the ideal of Sehatmand Gharanay , Khushal Pakistan . <p> AS : Is the scope limited to image-building campaigns or have there been changes in product formulations as well ? FA : BoP Marketing starts with educating consumers and creating an aspiration for an improved quality of life . However , product adoption will not take off unless poor households have access to affordable solutions . This is why RB started with awareness drives about the benefits of handwashing . However , most of these consumers do not have the spending power to purchase a 100 gram bar of Dettol soap for Rs 50 . This is why we have created a new , affordable , multipurpose ' Hope ' soap specifically for this market . It is priced at Rs 25 , has a strong citrus fragrance and can be used for bathing , handwashing , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely effective ; the brand has achieved an 80% market penetration and is being used by almost 600 households . However , this is not where RB 's role ends . As our brand portfolio does not include some essential FMCG product categories that the BoP market needs , we have collaborated with other organisations to create a basket comprising sanitary products , personal hygiene solutions and nutritional consumption items for children and adults . Our R&amp;D teams are working towards developing a powder that decomposes waste , destroys bacteria and germs , and completely masks odour . Since sanitary facilities are severely lacking across Pakistan , bringing this product to market will go a long way in reducing the incidence and mortality rates associated with diarrhoea . <h> " BoP Marketing starts with educating consumers and creating an aspiration for an improved quality of life . However , product adoption will not take off unless underprivileged households have access to affordable solutions " <p> AS : How has the community responded to Project Hope ? FA : When Project Hope started off , there was a lot of resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being challenged , particularly when we began involving women from Dhori to help spread the message . Plan International provided education about the features and benefits of the products we were bringing to the village , and provided sales training to the women as well . In a conservative social setup , recruiting local women turned out to be a winning stroke and helped us reach a wider audience . The way the system works is that RB is responsible for delivering the products to the village , after which the women sales team takes over and goes door-to-door telling others about the benefits of these products . Not only has Project Hope brought brands such as National Foods , Peak Freans , Shan and Shield to Dhori , it has also created employment for local women who earn stipends and sales commissions , which in turn has increased their purchasing power . <p> AS : From a business standpoint , is profit generation a core objective of BoP marketing campaigns ? FA : Yes , but we need to be patient . There is a reason why they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations are changing . The gain per consumer is extremely small . The market is saturated and competitive , so there is no other way for companies to progress unless they visit these areas and do something to help them . Prices must be kept low and profits will become possible only when massive sales volumes are achieved . <p> AS : What is the most challenging aspect of executing a BoP campaign ? FA : To change consumer habits ; although managing the logistics of distribution to ensure that the BoP consumer has access to brands is a costly undertaking as well . However , once the product is available , the greatest challenge is inducing trial . Several international behavioural studies estimate that it may take up to 250 to 260 days for new habits to form . The answer to executing a successful BoP campaign lies in creating a sustained , long-term intervention . I do not think that bombarding people with marketing communications produces the desired behavioural change unless it is supplemented by in-person product demonstrations . <p> AS : What has the post-campaign evaluation revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an unprecedented success . The figures compiled for the last six months show a 23% reduction in diarrhoeal incidences and a five percent increase in five times a day handwashing . These results have encouraged us to scale up the project , and our target is reaching five million households in the next five years . However , there are financial as well as logistical limitations that will have to be overcome if Project Hope is to be implemented nationwide . The uncertain security situation , lack of adequate infrastructure , inconsistent government policies , and deeply ingrained cultural taboos are the major obstacles restricting the widespread implementation of BoP marketing in Pakistan . <h> Email <h> Comments ( 10 ) Closed <p> HafeezFeb 17 , 2017 08:10pm <p> For people not familiar with marketing jargon this is exploiting the poor for corporate profits .

The recognition of the price barrier being too high and hence launching a lower priced product specific for these areas is a Win in my book .

You will read about a trans woman from Delhi , about a man from an untouchable background passing himself off as a Muslim , a government official retired from a post in Kabul , a resistance fighter in Kashmir , a woman in the Maoist rebellion in Bastar , a rebellious woman who kidnaps an abandoned baby , and more . Indeed , from time to time the birds and the beetles become as important as the people in this narrative , the poetic expression of the crude and ' hard ' realities not only make the novel even more unputdownable but exhibits Roy 's extraordinary writing skills . <p> So , it would be an utter injustice to judge the book solely through my headline that categorically calls it astory of body that wages war on you . Because Roy 's mastery knows no bounds . While I 'm particularly trying to expound the part of the story that deals with gender crisis and identity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife to India 's identity today through a number of characters and subplots . Throughout the book , she subtly sounds an alarm , coaxing people to see the policies behind the " polite prime minister " she never names but is clearly inspired by India 's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi . And while she writes about the rise of Hindu nationalism and the use of " opulent displays of piety " as political currency , she also addresses the absurdity of protest becoming a brand , writing about a man on a hunger strike against corruption : " The old man 's rustic rhetoric and earthy aphorisms trended on Twitter and swamped Facebook . " <p> While tackling the official national narrative and countless forms of resistance to it , Roy exhibits her extraordinary skills by also managing to simultaneously relegate her analysis to the micro level by touching upon the treatment of transgender women , local religious traditions under assault , attitudes toward abortion and violence against women . <p> She brilliantly brings this all together through empathetic characters whose perspectives are often obscured by tokenizing portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . It synchronises micro to the macro and shows its evolution and conclusion simultaneously . It 's a journey and interpretation of the ' whole ' through the prism of deep ' parts ' , both reflecting the each other . <h> Aftab : A migration from one identity to another <p> Hijras are the persecuted people who , though biologically male , feel they are female , and dress and act as women and constitute a long-recognized subculture . <p> People who are defending their right to be women , not men , do not , as a rule , wear pin-striped suits . They wear golden sandals and green-satin shalwars . In Roy 's Khwabgah ( House of Dreams ) , they also paint their nails and sing songs from Bollywood movies . They are fancy ; they are fun . At the same time , they are the book 's ruling metaphor for sorrow . <p> " Do you know why God made hijras ? " Anjum 's housemate Nimmo asks her one day . " It was an experiment . He decided to create something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he made us . " Think about it , she says . What are the things regular people get upset about ? " Price-rise , children 's school-admissions , husbands ' beatings , wives ' cheatings , Hindu-Muslim riots , Indo-Pak war -- outside things that settle down eventually . But for us the price-rise and school-admissions and beating-husbands and cheating-wives are all inside us . The riot is inside us . Indo-Pak is inside us . It will never settle down . It ca n't . " <p> Aftab - another young boy who is suffering from the gender crisis and has recently discovered Hijras of Khwabgah- did n't get this at all and wanted to contradict Nimmo desperately . He was deeply affected by Nimmo 's words because he was happier than ever before after discovering Khwabgah . <p> " It was only when he turned fourteen , by which time Nimmo had run away from the Khwabgah with a State Transport bus driver ( who soon abandoned her and returned to his family ) , that Aftab fully understood what she meant . His body had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall and muscular . And hairy . In a panic he tried to remove the hair on his face and body with Burnol -- burn ointment that made dark patches on his skin . He then tried Anne French cr ? me hair remover that he purloined from his sisters ( he was soon found out because it smelled like an open sewer ) . He plucked his bushy eyebrows into thin , asymmetrical crescents with a pair of home- ? made tweezers that looked more like tongs . He developed an Adam 's apple that bobbed up and down . He longed to tear it out of his throat . Next came the unkindest betrayal of all -- the thing that he could do nothing about . His voice broke . A deep , powerful man 's voice appeared in place of his sweet , high voice . He was repelled by it and scared himself each time he spoke . He grew quiet , and would speak only as a last resort , after he had run out of other options . He stopped singing . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high , barely audible , insect- ? like hum that seemed to emerge through a pinhole at the top of his head . No amount of persuasion , not even from Ustad Hameed himself , could coax a song out of Aftab . " <p> His body started going against his perception of his ' self ' and existence . How on earth can the perception of self 's existence can go so wrong and misleading ? Is it a mirage that I 'm chasing ? Am i caged in the wrong body ? The gender and sex , both constitute person 's experience of self and identity and therefore status and role in society , how can it shatter like this ? The body waged war on ' him ' as Roy puts it aptly . <p> His ' Hijra tendencies ' were unlikely to ever go away as Dr Nabi already warned the family . Fitrat was the word he used for ' tendencies ' . <p> ' Tendencies ? ' his father said . ' Tendencies are no problem . Everybody has some tendency or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> " Even though the visit to Dr Nabi did not provide an immediate solution to what Mulaqat Ali saw as Aftab 's affliction , it benefited Mulaqat Ali a great deal . It gave him coordinates to position himself , to steady his ship that was pitching perilously on an ocean of couplet- ? less incomprehension . He was now able to convert his anguish into a practical problem and to turn his attention and his energies to something he understood well : How to raise enough money for the surgery ? He cut down on household expenses and drew up lists of people and relatives from whom he could borrow money . Simultaneously , he embarked on the cultural project of inculcating manliness in Aftab . He passed on to him his love of poetry and discouraged the singing of Thumri and Chaiti . He stayed up late into the night , telling Aftab stories about their warrior ancestors and their valour on the battlefield . They left Aftab unmoved . But when he heard the story of how Temujin -- Changez Khan -- won the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kidnapped by a rival tribe and how Temujin fought a whole army virtually single- ? handedly to get her back because he loved her so much , Aftab found himself wanting to be her . " <p> Anjum will not contradict Nimmo 's idea of why God created Hijras , but in time she finds out for herself . On her eighteenth birthday , a big party is held in the House of Dreams . Hijras come from all over the city . For the occasion , Anjum buys a red " disco " sari with a backless top : <p> That night she dreamed she was a new bride on her wedding night . She awoke distressed to find that her sexual pleasure had expressed itself into her beautiful garment like a man 's . It was n't the first time this had happened , but for some reason , perhaps because of the sari , the humiliation she felt had never been so intense . She sat in the courtyard and howled like a wolf , hitting herself on her head and between her legs , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a tranquillizer and puts her to bed . <p> That is the last orgasm of her life . After the genital surgery , her new vagina never works right . Sex is the least of her problems , though . Nimmo had said that for most people Hindu-Muslim riots and the Indo-Pakistani war were outside matters , things that happened in the world , whereas for hijras conflict was an internal condition , and ceaseless . <h> A political story told through gender crisis <p> However , this seems to be not only one dimensional as Sameer Rahim thinks the gender crisis also reflects the political crisis . He writes : " Anjum 's uncategorisable body is a powerful metaphor for the internal contradictions within India . A fellow hijra describes the battles within their bodies like this : " The riot is inside us . The war is inside us . Indo-Pak is inside us . It will never settle down . It ca n't . " <p> In recent years , India 's political discourse has been rocked by the rise of Hindu nationalism , those " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In 2002 , in Gujarat , Hindu pilgrims returning from the ruins of the Babri Mosque -- destroyed by radical Hindus in 1992 -- were caught in a fire on their train and 59 burnt to death . The culprits may have been Muslim ; certainly they were blamed and a targeted pogrom killed at least 2,000 . In her non-fiction , Roy blames the Chief Minister of the time for inciting the attacks ; that Chief Minister is now India 's Prime Minister , Narendra Modi . " <p> More than anything else , Hijras in this novel represent India itself . With Partition , in 1947 , Roy writes , " God 's carotid burst open on the new border between India and Pakistan and a million people died of hatred . Neighbors turned on each other as though they 'd never known each other , never been to each other 's weddings , never sung each other 's songs . " The consequences of that terrible event form the main story of " The Ministry of Utmost Happiness . " <p> Roy stays with Anjum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devolve into anecdotes . However , she changes her main character . Just as she started the book with the birth of Anjum , she now stages another birth . " Miles away , in a troubled forest , a baby waited to be born . . . .

@@51252231 <p> In a move reminiscent of previous governments , the PTI administration decided not to pass on the entire reduction in the international price of petroleum products to domestic consumers by adjusting the tax rates on different POL products , as it considered appropriate . The reason : to attempt to contain the estimated shortfall of around 173 billion rupees in the revenue projected by Finance Minister Asad Umar in the Finance Supplementary Amendment Bill 2018 during the first half of the current year - a shortfall that was projected by Business Recorder on the basis of the government 's measures not being implementable , as had been in the case in the past , without massive tax reforms . Sales tax adjustment on petroleum and products , an indirect tax because its incidence on the poor is relatively higher than on the rich , with huge daily sales implies adjustment in revenue collection from day one . In other words , sales tax on POL products is a tax that is easily collected though it does erode the disposable income of the poor . <p> Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority 's ( Ogra 's ) recommended price adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( GST ) which was notified by the federal government ; however the Centre then raised the petroleum levy on petrol from 10 rupees to 14 ( a 42 percent rise ) and on high speed diesel from 8 rupees to 18 rupees ( 126 percent rise ) . The Ogra 's recommendation compared to the notified rates for January are as follows : ( i ) petrol of 9.50 rupee per litre ( 10 percent reduction ) while the government agreed to a decrease of 4.86 rupee per litre ; and ( ii ) high speed diesel by 15 rupees per litre ( 13.5 percent reduction ) with the government notifying a decrease of only Rs 4.26 per litre . The main revenue generators for the government are petrol and high speed diesel with the former in use by the rich with fuel guzzling cars , however , the lower middle to middle income earners who own motorbikes too use petrol ; high speed diesel affects public transport sector notably buses and lorries thereby adversely affecting price stability . <p> Those who may accuse the government of following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous governments that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) criticised bitterly when not in power , must acknowledge that without this adjustment in rates , the budget deficit would have risen dramatically which is a highly inflationary policy whose repercussions on the disposable income of the poor would have been greater if not at par with tax adjustment on POL products . Additionally , the incumbent government is grappling with a rising circular debt - it is up to 1.362 trillion rupees - which reflects continuing liquidity issues of the energy sector whose resolution requires the government to raise tariffs and/or make direct unbudgeted injections which again impact on the general price level . In other words , Business Recorder fully supports the government 's decision not to pass on the entire decrease in the international price of oil onto domestic consumers . <p> Independent economists rightly express serious concerns at the policies of the government not being in synch ; for example , while it has decided to reduce the rates applicable to industry that requires a subsidy , with the objective of making our exports competitive in the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not passed on the decline in the domestic oil prices which is a major input to industrial output and which , in turn , may make our exports uncompetitive .

@@51306238 <h> Treason and upstarts <p> The Special Court verdict on the treason of Ex-President Pervez Musharraf has opened a can of stinking worms . Perhaps these worms can best be described as upstarts of opportunity . The first lesson and abject reality are that in the highest echelons of politics in Pakistan , loyalties and allegiances can be switched for personal gains . <p> In the past 12 years , the biggest flock of cuckoos re-nestled themselves into various political parties to continue what they do best . It is time for them to leave for good . The bird 's nest must be converted into an eagle 's eyrie . <p> The second lesson learnt is that any leader in the Pakistani environment lowers guard and does not remain in awe of such carpetbaggers and illegitimate children of the opportunity will be isolated in times of crunch . <p> This palace intrigue of Ex-President Musharraf 's tenure is now reaching its logical conclusions . It lasted over 16 years ; perhaps the filthiest and longest in Pakistan 's history . It is not just General Musharraf who became a Greek Tragedy during this game of deceit , betrayals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Daughter of the East Benazir Bhutto was assassinated most controversially . Musharraf was clueless over what had happened . The simple question of who benefitted has still not been answered . <p> Centres of power in Pakistan need to realise that there are no holy cows . Each is a vital organ of the state and must function in concert for the greatness of the country . Checks and balances are not invasive but systemic with self-course correction mechanisms . Virtues and good practices should never be compromised for the sake of an individual . Integrity and purity of organisational structures are cardinal . <p> There is something known as sympathetic detonations . It is a flashover , usually unintended , of an explosive charge by a nearby explosion . What has happened in the Judiciary , Executive and the Armed Forces in the past 16 years is this phenomenon . The perpetuation of acrimony in the form of judicial activism , corruption by rulers and the buzzword of Civilian Supremacy were utilised cleverly to mask and smokescreen much bigger crimes and designs . <p> Not just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the honest politicians , the fighting soldiers and the hapless people of Pakistan . Interestingly there is one common denominator . Each organ is hurt by its own . <p> A glance around will expose a sidekick of media persons who became rich aristocrats within two decades , led the disinformation airwaves , created issues where there were none and conditioned Pakistan to hybrid threats . Suddenly , after the use of Dark Age references in the judgement , these evergreen journalists have switched sides overnight to ride the next bandwagon . Keep them at bay . <p> It is time to put an end to these sympathetic detonations and gather remains of the day . Pakistan deserves to be back on the track it deserves ; Jinnah 's Pakistan . It is the Prime Minister of Pakistan who has to lead the charge through these parched lands and infested waters to pinnacles of National Character and Morale . <p> For the military , it is a lesson in humility and how it feels when hurt . Perhaps amongst all the constituents of the state , it has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . Having seen thousands of combatants fall during this time , they must introspect and ensure that the blood of its martyrs and many more of the country is not wasted to be exploited by greed and opportunism that led to the day when one of its ex Chiefs was sentenced to be dragged dead or alive on the Constitution Avenue . <p> The attacks on the armed forces have been direct and indirect but surely relentless . The attacks lasted for nearly two decades that begun with disowning the war on terrorism . When peace is finally restored for rebuilding the country , a new form of activism threatens to destabilise Pakistan . Army 's degradation is the only logical conduit to permanently destabilising Pakistan . Christine Fair had to write agonisingly , " For Pakistan State to Collapse , it is basically Pakistan Army that has to collapse , I do n't see that happening " . Perhaps the game to destabilise Pakistan through bad governance and pitching organs and people against the armed forces has also been exposed .

He must not put caution to the wind and keep looking over his shoulders to identify the ghosts of Dark Ages , the cuckoos genetically predisposed at occupying other 's nests . If he does not , they will lead him to a dungeon . <p> In the interests of Pakistan , there should be no public display of supremacy . The chamber of the Chief Justice of Pakistan is not far .

@@60430239 <h> Email <p> Outgoing ambassador to the United States Ali Jahangir Siddiqui served in Washington from May-Dec 2018. - File photo <p> Former ambassador to the United States Ali Jahangir Siddiqui , who served in Washington from May-Dec 2018 - a period when Pak-US ties went from cold to frigid - spoke to Dawn about the complexities in relations between the two countries , the challenges he faced as an envoy , and whether Pakistan can contribute to normalcy in Afghanistan . <p> Siddiqui , who left Washington yesterday , told Dawn that he could have been more effectual serving a full three-year term , but maintained that he had contributed to an improvement in bilateral ties during his short seven-month tenure . <p> Q : How did America 's demand for Pakistan to do more impact bilateral ties ? <p> Siddiqui : I can not say whether they recognise that it was an unfair demand i.e. Pakistan had done a lot at a great cost to herself . But it is clear that the US South Asia strategy was not successful . <p> I think that Pakistan has gained from standing its ground . Of course , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship but we sustained it . <p> Q : What do you believe is preventing Pak-US relations from taking off ? <p> Siddiqui : The lack of clarity on both sides . Pakistan has not had broad-based strategic dialogue with the US for a long time and that has held things back . <p> But when we did have the strategic dialogue in the Obama years , that was precisely when the relationship was worsening rapidly . So , the problem is deeper than a structured engagement . <p> There is mistrust on both sides that needs to be unwound and that will take effort , whereby the leadership on both sides needs to be engaged by their respective diplomats and historical issues are discussed , and we clear and put the last 20 years of history behind us . <p> Q : The common perception is that both sides fail to understand each other . Instead of talking to each other , do they talk across each other ? <p> Siddiqui : I do n't think this perception is correct . The bureaucracies on both sides are sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its bureaucracy compared to ours - many US bureaucrats at the Assistant Secretary and higher levels are political appointees . So there is a strong political dimension in their system , which means that the direction that the US President wants is where the system goes . <p> Both sides have an understanding of each other and of their own historical positions . It is true that both sides do n't spend enough time understanding where the other is coming from and frequently miss the considerations and pressures the other side has to manage . From our foreign policy perspective , I would say that I observed that since we are busy dealing with short term issues and crises , there is limited long term policy planning at least vis a vis the US . <p> For example , an answer to the question ' Where do we want the Pak-US relationship to be in 15 years ? ' will dictate whether the next generations of our students will study in the US , whether our scientists will collaborate with US scientific institutions , whether our economy will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis-a-vis China is clear , but with the US it is not so . <p> Q : Can Pakistan help create a semblance of normalcy in Afghanistan as the Americans demand ? <p> Siddiqui : There is a lot of focus on Pakistan here but we have already done everything we can . We used every ounce of security and diplomatic goodwill we had to get all parties to the table . <p> The outcome of these talks will be determined by the Americans and the Afghan people , not Pakistan . <p> The Americans understand that and we are facilitating the process as best we can because not only is peace in Afghanistan a noble goal but Pakistan has been the second-worst sufferer in this conflict and we want a peaceful Afghanistan . <p> Q : Pakistanis often say that they want trade , not aid . Are they serious about it ? <p> Siddiqui : I sometimes think that our policy planners missed something here . Trade not aid is quite dated , by some decades . The adage about teaching a man to fish , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change fishing ! <p> In the same way , trade not aid is no longer applicable . There is a role for aid , there is a role for trade , but with all the evolution in technology and other change in the world , we need to look for something new . Perhaps technology , not trade . Although I would repeat that trade and aid are both relevant . <p> Q : Pakistanis often boast about their strategic location , arguing that they can not be ignored because of this . Was this strategic location an asset for you or an obstacle ? <p> Siddiqui : Saying we have a strategic location , like saying we have a young population , is taking a one-sided position on what is a fact . A one-sided position , while correct on its own , ignores the disadvantages . A youthful population also means a struggle to get them employed while a strategic location means geopolitical complexity . <p> So , I dealt with our strategic location as a fact . Sometimes there were advantages and other times there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . For example , we were caught up in the US-China competition as a result of our strategic location , China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and closeness to China . <p> There were statements made both on Capitol Hill and by the US administration that money Pakistan may get from the International Monetary Fund may end up repaying China but we have been successful in explaining to all US departments of government and this is not how IMF and our loans to China are structured . <p> Having dealt with this complexity due to our strategic location , we have created a better understanding of Pakistan and our positions with these stakeholders . <p> Q : Do you think your performance would have been better if you had a full term ? Would you like to return with a full term ? <p> Siddiqui : Of course . Diplomatic results are a function of skills and time .

The Russians , eager to get into the act , have hosted a conference on the issue . The Pakistanis insist they want to help end the war . Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hopes to win reelection in April as the man who brought peace to his country after 17 years . The Taliban , however , seems to be in no hurry at all .

While temporary cease-fires may be honored , the Taliban will continue to seek tactical , often temporary , battlefield victories , until convinced that its political demands will be met . Talking and fighting might lead eventually to a negotiated settlement , but the path to that settlement is likely to be long and bloody .

@@60459231 <h> Could the Pope 's call to end the death penalty keep Catholics off juries ? <p> In August , Pope Francis declared the death penalty morally unacceptable in all circumstances and committed the church to its global abolition . This pronouncement broke from previous Catholic teaching , which permitted the death penalty in " very rare " cases of " absolute necessity . " <p> Death penalty abolitionists hold out hope that the pope 's new call to action may eventually sway the American public : Catholic voters and politicians might become more inclined to repeal the death penalty , Catholic prosecutors might increasingly exercise their discretion not to pursue capital punishment , and Catholic judges ( including the five Catholic justices on the Supreme Court ) might grow more receptive to legal arguments that limit the practice . A change in public opinion could also influence the Supreme Court , which considers society 's " evolving standards of decency " in evaluating whether a punishment is " cruel and unusual " under the Eighth Amendment . <p> But because of the anomalous way we select juries in capital cases , greater opposition to the death penalty among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death sentences imposed in this country . Such opposition could even solidify judicial support for capital punishment . This paradox is possible because of a process called " death qualification , " in which a judge can disqualify certain prospective jurors who are opposed to executions . The pope 's sharpening of the Catholic position on the death penalty helps reveal the problems with this system . <p> Death qualification produces a smaller , more adamantly pro-execution pool of jurors . Studies show that death-qualified juries are more inclined not just to impose the death penalty ( because , somewhat obviously , those with qualms are excluded ) but to convict in the first place . One review of 14 studies found that a " favorable attitude towards the death penalty translates into a 44% increase in the probability of a juror favoring conviction . " Research suggests that death-qualified jurors are more persuaded by aggravating evidence at sentencing and less persuaded by mitigating evidence than those who are disqualified . <p> Death qualification weakens the connection between capital trial outcomes and the views of the broader community . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2013 , I found that more than 22 percent of prospective jurors were removed because they opposed the death penalty . And death qualification can disproportionately affect certain minority groups . One 2010 study found that in a mock capital sentencing proceeding , Catholics were more than twice as likely as others to be excluded from juries considering a death sentence . ( African Americans are also more likely to be removed . ) <p> " Death qualified " juries shield capital punishment from social change <p> After the pope 's pronouncement , judges may disqualify even more Catholics during jury selection . And prosecutors may begin to more aggressively bar Catholics from juries using another method -- " peremptory strikes . " Through peremptory strikes , prosecutors can exclude a limited number of prospective jurors for almost any reason . <p> Of course , not every Catholic follows every papal declaration , and American Catholics -- who make up roughly a quarter of the U.S. population -- have never been uniformly against capital punishment . In June , the Pew Research Center reported that 53 percent of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Americans ) , and 42 percent of Catholics opposed it ( compared with 39 percent of all Americans ) . That was more than two decades after Pope John Paul II said justified cases were so rare as to be " practically nonexistent . " <p> Still , that 's far less support than among other religious subgroups ; 73 percent of white evangelicals , for instance , support capital punishment . And the poll figures possibly understate Catholic opposition , which may be more intense because it 's rooted in explicit teachings of the church . Nor do the statistics capture the crucial question of whether prosecutors view Catholics as a bloc that disproportionately opposes executions . <p> Death qualification operates with the Supreme Court 's blessing . In 1968 , the court decided that a prospective juror can not be excluded simply because she has " general objections " to the death penalty , but it authorized disqualification of those who would automatically vote against death , regardless of the evidence . ( Judges had long been disqualifying jurors before the 1968 decision for anti-death-penalty views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1985 , the court made it even easier to exclude death penalty opponents , permitting the removal of any prospective juror found to be " substantially impaired " in the ability to fairly consider capital punishment , where legally authorized . Since then , the court has become increasingly lax in allowing for-cause strikes , approving the exclusion of jurors who voiced concerns about the death penalty , even when they expressly claimed they could still consider it . <p> To see the interplay between death qualification and the pope 's declaration , imagine jury selection in a death penalty case . One prospective juror is a devout Catholic , familiar with current doctrine . " Could you consider imposing the death penalty ? " the prosecutor asks her . Before August , her response might have been , " Yes , under rare circumstances . " Now , she might respond , " Well , I want to follow the law , but it 's against the teachings of my church . " The judge would be more likely to find her " substantially impaired " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result would probably be less Catholic and more strongly pro-capital-punishment . <p> Then peremptory strikes would come into play . Explicitly race- and gender-based strikes are impermissible , but the Supreme Court has not ruled on the constitutionality of strikes based on religion -- especially when faith maps fairly closely with strong views on punishment . And the peremptory-strike process is opaque enough to allow plenty of backdoor discrimination . <p> Repeated often enough , the combination of death qualification and peremptory strikes could exacerbate the split between community sentiment and trial outcomes . Widespread and growing opposition to the death penalty may simply lead to the exclusion of a higher percentage of death-averse jurors , which may lead to a steady , or even increasing , number of death sentences . <p> The Supreme Court has identified two supposedly objective data points of evolving standards of decency related to capital punishment : laws authorizing them and numbers of convictions . If increased juror disqualification paves the way for more death verdicts , the justices might conclude that support for the death penalty remains robust , despite a mounting societal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the practice of death qualification , without fully recognizing the mischief it has wrought .

The mini budget was discussed at the start of the senate session , and it prompted members of the opposition to stage a walk-out . <p> Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani headed the session in which all seats of ministers were empty , with Pakistan Peoples Party 's ( PPP ) Raza Rabbani and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz 's ( PML-N ) Javed Abbasi among others registering their protest against the lack of attendance . <p> Senator Rabbani , while pointing to the vacant seats of the ministers , said it was surprising that the finance minister had suddenly been taken ill as if there was a suspicious virus in the air . Upon this , the Senate chair inquired about their whereabouts , to which Leader of the House Shibli Faraz responded that they will arrive soon . <p> In their discussion , opposition members rejected the mini budget , terming it as against the interests of the people and the country . In their remarks , senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imamuddin Shouqeen and others said that the mini budget has given way to a new wave of inflation . <p> The government had committed to the construction of five million homes but no loan is being provided for their construction , they said , and added that slums belonging to the poor were being demolished , while a controversial property like the Grand Hyatt Hotel was regularised . <p> The senators also lamented the increase in price of everyday products and transport fares . " The country 's debt is rising due to devaluation of the rupee while the government is making deals with foreign countries in return for more loans . The state should ensure equitable distribution of wealth and social justice , " they remarked . <p> On the other hand , Federal Planning Minister Khusro Bakhtriar told the upper house that the development of Balochistan was amongst the priorities of the government . <p> He said that unapproved projects for financing had been dropped from the Public Sector Development Programme ( PSDP ) , with development fund under it slashed from Rs800 billion to Rs675 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rs200 billion for Balochistan but allocation remained at Rs55 billion .

He said that the foreign ministry and the Prime Minister 's Secretariat had allowed a Pakistani Jew to travel to Israel while the country 's passport clearly stated that it would be used for all countries except Israel . He demanded why the permission was granted and remarked that if the country was looking to improve relations with Israel , then the house should be taken into confidence . <p> The chairman of the senate sought an explanation on the matter from the foreign ministry , and adjourned the session till Friday today . <p> Protest in NA over Saeed 's speech <p> A federal minister 's scathing criticism of the top leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly which subsided only after the chair ordered to turn off mike of Prime Minister Imran Khan 's key cabinet member . <p> Taking the floor on Thursday , Federal Minister for Communication Murad Saeed began his speech by lashing out at the opposition for using the term ' selected prime minister ' for Imran Khan . <p> " A selected person is one who became first a finance minister and later a prime minister after formation of the IJI Islami Jamhoori Ittihad in 1990 , " the minister said in an apparent reference to the former PM Nawaz Sharif who is also supreme leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) . <p> Saeed said an elected prime minister addresses Pakistanis when he visits a foreign country while a ' selected prime minister ' returns from abroad with a ' Qatari letter ' .

What do you guys say ? The ball does n't bounce much in England and controlling middle overs will be key . Plus we need to take a few ( 1-3 ) wickets at the top and I feel Shinwari/Afridi are more likely to do that than Amir . Amir is good for containment at the top but we do need wickets at the top . Junaid does a better job ( in terms of wickets ) than Amir himself .

@@60486231 <h> Sudan police confront rallies as Bashir blames media <p> Sudanese police fired tear gas at protestors holding rallies in the capital Khartoum on Sunday after organisers called for further demonstrations against President Omar al-Bashir 's three decades of rule . Bashir , on a visit to Cairo to meet his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi , said the media were exaggerating the size of the problems he faced at home . Deadly protests sparked by a government decision to raise the price of bread have rocked the east African country for weeks . The demonstrations have mushroomed into nationwide rallies against the government of Bashir , who swept to power in 1989 in an Islamist-backed coup . Officials say 30 people have died in the violence since the protests first erupted on December 19 in the farming town of Atbara , before spreading to Khartoum and other regions . Rights groups say more than 40 people have been killed . On Sunday , protesters came onto the streets in Khartoum and its twin city of Omdurman to hold sit-ins in several squares , responding to a call by the Sudanese Professionals Association which is leading the protests .

@@60511239 <h> South Africa will struggle to boost coal exports , even if it wants to <p> CAPE TOWN : There may be some irony in climate change being blamed for an increase in weather delays that resulted in South Africa 's coal exports dropping 4 percent last year , but in reality the rough seas at the country 's Richards Bay terminal are the least of the industry 's worries . <p> Shipments from Richards Bay declined to 73.5 million tonnes in 2018 from 76.5 million the prior year , well below the 91 million tonnes capacity of the terminal , which is the second-biggest in the world behind Newcastle Port in Australia . <p> The terminal lost 36 days of loading last year because of rough weather , down slightly from 38 days in 2017 , with both these years being considerably higher than in preceding years . <p> But even if the terminal was fully available all 365 days of the year , it 's still unlikely that much more coal would have been shipped . <p> The blame for South Africa 's lower exports was placed on market conditions by the head of Richards Bay Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices crimping demand in the main export destination of India . <p> However , RBCT chair Nosipho Siwisa-Damasane said the weather disruptions are also likely a challenge for future years , and terminals around the world were going to have to deal with the " new norm " of what was previously abnormal weather patterns . <p> While high prices were undoubtedly a contributing factor to the lower exports , it 's also likely that infrastructure constraints and an inability of many of South Africa 's coal miners to boost production were perhaps of greater importance . <p> The rail network has a theoretical capacity of delivering 81 million tonnes a year from South Africa 's inland mines to RBCT , meaning that even if it was working at full steam , there still would n't be enough coal to use up RBCT 's export capacity . <p> Mandisa Mondi , the general manager of coal freight at state-owned rail operator Transnet told the IHS Markit Southern African Coal Conference in Cape Town last week that plans were in place to boost the rail capacity to match that of RBCT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational efficiencies to reduce bottlenecks , followed by later infrastructure improvements such as a new tunnel through a mountain between the inland coal fields and the coast . <p> Transnet said it could eventually boost the rail capacity available for exports by 25 million tonnes above current levels , but whether this happens depends on whether miners commit to producing and exporting more . <p> It 's here where the situation becomes less clear , with companies having been reluctant in recent years to invest in building new mines or even expanding existing operations . <p> Part of this was because of a long-running dispute over South Africa 's mining laws , although that appears to have been settled recently . <p> CONFIDENCE LACKING ? <p> Still , South Africa 's coal miners would have to take a positive view of likely demand before committing capital to new projects . <p> The IHS Markit conference heard some rosy forecasts of demand for coal , mainly on a surge in new power plants being built in India . <p> However , these forecasts are likely to prove hopelessly optimistic , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) becomes available from projects in Australia , the United States and Russia . <p> Just under half of South Africa 's coal went to India in 2018 , a country with an official policy of reducing coal imports to zero over time . <p> Other major buyers include South Korea , which also plans to lower coal burning , and Pakistan , which has concerns over the foreign exchange cost of importing fuels . <p> While South African coal is viewed as a good quality product , and superior to supplies from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia , there are serious questions as to whether there will be sufficient demand in Asia to justify spending the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to boost mine supply and rail capacity . <p> This makes it likely that South Africa will continue to be a relatively steady supplier of around 75 million tonnes of coal a year to the seaborne market . <p> This could increase somewhat if Transnet can de-bottleneck and RBCT does n't lose more days to rough weather . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exactly that , just plans .

More upward adjustments in central bank 's policy rate and exchange rate depreciation would be part of the understanding , they said . <p> Further adjustments in energy prices , expansion in revenues , reduction in losses of public sector entities , further autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan , market-based currency exchange rate and deep-rooted structural reforms are key areas under the future assistance package from the IMF . The two sides had already agreed on the way forward but had differences over the sequencing as the government wanted the passing of ' further pain ' on to people next year . <p> A statement released by the Ministry of Finance on Twitter said deliberations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalise an agreement on the contours of a programme " . <p> The ministry said that the premier " appreciated IMF 's support to Pakistan and shared his vision for nation-building " . <p> Prime Minister Khan also expressed the government 's commitment to undertake structural and governance reforms and to strengthen social protection in the country , the statement added . <p> It also said that the IMF managing director recognised the steps taken so far by the government to bring stability to the economy . She expressed the Fund 's desire to remain engaged with Pakistan in ensuring that economic recovery is sustained . <p> Earlier , Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry had said the Khan-Lagarde meeting would " give us a chance to understand the IMF views and we will be able to give our version to the IMF chief " , Radio Pakistan reported . Chaudhry stated that Pakistan wants " a fair deal that can actually help Pakistan in the short-term without affecting our long-term economic goals " . <p> Meanwhile , Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi stressed that Islamabad wanted to proceed with the bailout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the common man . <h> Stumbling issue in IMF bailout talks <p> The IMF is asking for an adjustment of around Rs1,600-2,000 billion over three to four years . It also wants some corrective measures to put Pakistan 's economy on the right track after witnessing the highest-ever current account deficit . <p> But the stumbling issue in the talks is the pace of adjustments in the current expenditure . The emphasis on current expenditures comes as a result of a focus on what is known as a ' primary balance ' in the parlance of public finance . <p> A senior official involved in the negotiations earlier told Dawn , there is some space for a cut in certain expenditures where Pakistan is in a comfortable position . " This agreement in cut will pave way for accession to the programme , " the official claimed , adding it will be a politically difficult decision . <p> A cut in the current expenditures still seems to put the government in an awkward position by making adjustments in subsidies and other special grants . <p> The IMF has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on current expenditures that include debt service , defence , and subsidies . Previous governments decreased development expenditures when undertaking the Fund 's adjustment and usually left current expenditures alone ( other than subsidies ) . <p> But the official had said there is certain non-development spending which can not be discontinued or reduced . <p> The primary balance of a government 's budget is the difference between revenues and expenditures after removing interest payments . It tests whether the path of debt accumulation of any country is sustainable or not . <p> If this is in deficit then it means that at least some of the interest payments due in the given year will have to be made through borrowing . <p> Cutting the primary deficit requires a cut in current expenditures , and usually becomes necessary when reducing debt-to-GDP ratio is a priority . <p> Finance Division 's Spokes ? person Dr Khaqan Najeeb had told Dawn that productive dialogue continues with IMF on all areas including fiscal , energy , structural reforms and monetary policy . Discussions are part of regular ongoing interaction between government and IMF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , adding that " technical level subject-specific discussions also support the process of overall dialogue " . <p> According to Najeeb , the government has already taken several policy measures including an increase in interest rate , gas and electricity tariffs along with revenue measures . <p> The Ministry of Finance recently announced that the Federal Board of Revenue 's ( FBR ) target would not be revised downward following a revenue shortfall of Rs191bn in the first seven months . <p> The FBR has been asked to take administrative measures including revival of tax on mobile phone cards to cover up the shortfall in reaching the budgetary target . <p> The Fund has also asked for further monetary tightening as well as a complete free float of the exchange rate . <p> " We are already moving towards the target in these areas , " the official had said , adding the IMF has acknowledged these measures . <p> According to the official , the finance minister has already conveyed to the IMF during recent parleys that only those measures will be taken which are favourable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has secured breathing space through Saudi Arabian and United Arab Emirates loans , an IMF programme is essential to unlocking access to resources from other multilateral lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank , as well as global capital markets . <h> On DawnNews <h> Comments ( 145 ) Closed <p> Ravi <p> Feb 10 , 2019 06:28pm <p> All vague statements ..

What better way to celebrate being single and dodging many , many bullets than by recounting all the horrible men in pop culture . <p> Here 's a list -- an incomplete one since there are too many to count -- of toxic and problematic characters from Pakistani drama and Bollywood : <p> 1 . Zaroon from Zindagi Gulzar Hai <p> Where do we even start ? Rich brat goes to college and does not hit it off with a seedhi , dupatta clad girl , who ca n't stand his guts and privilege . They end up getting married , god knows how . In fact , we 're not even sure if they liked each other till the end even . Rich guy Zaroon only started taking an interest in Kashaf after his best friend Osama proposes to her . He 's also weirdly always been fixated on how Kashaf fits his " ideal type " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranbir from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil <p> All Ranbir Kapoor 's character did in this movie was throw a fucking tantrum because the girl he likes does n't like him back . He literally falls to the ground on her wedding day and starts hitting himself with a gamla while singing Channa Mereya , the film 's only saving grace ( along with Fawah Khan ) . Get a grip , Ayaan . One scene shows him physically shove Anushka Sharma 's character Alizeh because he does n't understand why and how she could reject him . He 's the worst and there too many men like him in real-life , we definitely did not need to see him or celebrate him in reel life . NEXT ! <p> 3 . Rahul from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai <p> Honestly it was hard to pick just one problematic SRK role . But Rahul in this 90s flick was probably the worst . First , he had a fun thing going on with Anjali but was flirting with and ended up marrying Tina ? Anjali moves on and away and is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , wait for it , falls in love with a now feminine sari in the rain Anjali . No thanks . Tussi jao , tussi please jao . <p> 4 . Lucky from Main Hoon Na <p> Main Hoon Na was recently released on Netflix ( Pakistan ) and obviously we jumped at the chance to watch what we remember being a cute story about long lost brothers , reunions , college and that killer Qawwali mash-up . I mean , you 're lying if you did n't have a crush on Zayed Khan after his debut in Bollywood . Watching Main Hoon Na in 2018 , however , proved to be a completely different experience . Firstly , wtf is up with Lucky 's hair . It 's all things awful and were we really attracted to that ? More concerning is his attitude towards his best friend Sanju , who 's a tomboy and in love with Lucky for some reason . She goes crying to their new Sari-clad , beautiful teacher who has the perfect solution . Instead of telling her to move on from loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives her a make-over . The next day , Sanju enters college in a pink shalwar kameez and makeup , and sweeps Lucky off his feet , who also begins hearing violins around him ( literally ) . He then realises that beneath the baggy clothes and kohl eyes was the woman of his dreams and decides to fall in love with her once her appearance changes a little . Barf <p> 5 . Salahuddin from Mann Mayal <p> Mann Mayal started off a little sketchy , by depicting a teacher-student relationship . The drama was extremely and unnecessarily long-drawn out , and very frustrating . But perhaps , the most problematic part of it was the character Salahuddin , played by Hamza Ali Abbasi , who is Manahil aka Manno 's tuition **28;2186;TOOLONG . However , he rejects her because he feels his family 's social status can not be matched with Manno 's . Manno goes on to party a drunk , gambling man , and mothers two children . Despite having many opportunities to leave him , she sticks it out . And you know who else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Salahuddin . While the drama intends to show a caring , dedicated man in love , he 's basically a stalker . <p> 6 . Khizer from Humsafar <p> Ok so he was n't a main character or someone disguised as a hero -- I mean he was outright the villain . BUT . He was the worst , and we can not let it go . Apart from being annoying AF , he teamed up with Asher 's mother ( the main villain aka mother-in-law ) to drive Khirad out of her son 's life . And he did that by harassing Khirad and making it seem like they were having an affair ? It turns out he did it to win over Sara , another antagonist in the drama and Asher 's best friend who is hopelessly in love with him and hates Khirad . Sara turned him down once again , but Khizar obviously refused to take no for an answer .

The caped crusader who first appeared in Detective Comics number 27 in 1939 , has been voted the most popular superhero by countless publications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason why studios are quite adamant on making movies featuring the Dark Knight . <p> Many actors in the past have played Batman on the big screen , with Adam West portraying the character in Batman : The Movie ( 1966 ) . Near the end of the 80s , Warner Brothers started producing its own series of Batman films starring Michael Keaton ( Batman and Batman Returns ) , before Joel Schumacher came in the picture and burnt the Batman franchise to the ground . Schumacher directed two Batman films starring Val Kilmer and George Clooney respectively , and those are the versions we 'd all like to forget ever existed . <p> Michael Keaton in Batman <p> Val Kilmer in Batman Forever <p> George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell in Batman and Robin <p> It was when Christopher Nolan swept in nearly a decade later that new life was breathed into the franchise , with Christian Bale donning the cowl and setting the bar really high for any future Batman . The next one to pick up the mantle was Ben Affleck , who debuted as the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and later appeared in Justice League , along with a cameo in Suicide Squad . However , there is unanimous agreement that Justice League was a debacle , following which the DC Extended Universe ( DCEU ) is getting a shake-up . As Affleck 's Batman unfortunately belongs to Zack Snyder 's poorly executed vision , he will now be passing the torch to another actor who will portray a younger Batman . <p> Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Rises <p> Ben Affleck in Justice League <p> Snyder is a director with many flaws , but what he did do right was give Batman a new life by casting Affleck and bringing Frank Miller 's version of the character on screen . Affleck 's Batman was definitely the highlight of BvS and Justice League ; he was broken and , in Affleck 's own words , was on the verge of moral bankruptcy . This middle-aged Batman was a heavyweight brawler who not only beat up criminals but also branded them . Affleck 's Batman was thus similar to how the character has been portrayed in the highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , Bale 's Dark Knight trilogy is considered one of the best , if not the best superhero trilogy in cinematic history , while Bale 's performance received universal acclaim . However , I do think we have Nolan to thank for that more than Bale . Nolan is a visionary who left no stone unturned when it came to filmmaking , which is why most of his films are considered masterpieces . His execution and vision are what made Bale a successful Batman . When it comes to Affleck , he did n't even get his own solo outing and yet stood out among a bunch of other famous superheroes . <p> We could even say that Affleck had Snyder pulling him down with his outrageous way of storytelling and poor execution . While the Dark Knight trilogy was extraordinary plot wise , its ' Bat-bale ' was n't that much . Meanwhile , both BvS and Justice League were lacklustre at best , but their ' Bat-fleck ' was pretty awesome . <p> For so long fans had craved a comic-accurate Batman , and Affleck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped straight out of a comic book . The warehouse fight scene in BvS is far superior than any fight scene in the Dark Knight trilogy , and Affleck 's caped crusader asking the Man of Steel if he bleeds and then adding " you will " is a moment we will all remember for the years to come . <p> Suffice to say , it 's a bittersweet moment to see Affleck go while also saying goodbye to the mediocre Batman films he starred in . He gave us so many memorable moments with just two movies and limited screen time , which is why he completely deserves a solo outing as Batman . He was initially expected to get one , but then DCEU got a shake-up and now we will most likely never see Affleck as Batman again . <p> In the meantime , Hollywood is searching for its new caped crusader . If the rumours are to go by , then Scott Adkins , Jake Gyllenhaal , Robert Pattinson and Armie Hammer are being considered for the role . To be honest , if they cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably shoot myself . There are certain things you do n't mess with , and the beloved character of Batman is certainly one of those things . Getting Twilight flashbacks while watching a Batman movie is surely the last thing any fan needs . <p> Robert Pattinson in Twilight <p> Gyllenhaal may be able to pull it off , as he has time and again proven himself to be an extremely talented actor with a knack for going deep in his characters . <p> Jake Gyllenhaal in Spider-Man : Far From Home <p> Hammer was once cast as Batman in George Miller 's Justice League back in 2007 , before things fell apart and the movie did n't happen . He could play Batman , but as of late he does not have a good record when it comes to playing an action lead in a movie ( case in point : The Lone Ranger , The Man from UNCLE ) . <p> Armie Hammer in The Man from UNCLE <p> Adkins could be a perfect choice , but his acting skills have n't been tested as much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role is anything to go by , then Adkins may well be given the suit now as he is the perfect candidate who possesses the physique and looks as well . Further , because Adkins is a trained fighter , he could also do his stunts himself . Perhaps the only factor standing in his way is his age , as reports suggest that Warner Brothers is searching for a much younger Batman and Adkins is 42-years-old . <p> To say that Batman is an iconic character would be a major understatement -- he 's more than that . Batman has been a success in all forms of media -- movies , video games , comics and TV series -- and that shows the universal appeal of his character . As a fan , I can only hope Warner Brothers will do right by the fans and cast a decent enough Batman if they ca n't give us a solo ' Bat-fleck ' . But if somehow they decide to bring Affleck back , trust me , there will be no complaints from the fans .

@@60574230 <h> Pakistan 's undiscovered pot of gold ? <p> Energy security is the key foundational block of the national and international energy frameworks across the world . From the geostrategic perspective , energy security is also deemed critical for national and international sovereignties . The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) defines energy security as " the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price " . Energy security has many dimensions : long-term energy security mainly deals with timely investments to supply energy in line with economic developments and sustainable environmental needs . Short-term energy security focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly to sudden changes within the supply-demand balance . Lack of energy security is thus linked to the negative economic and social impacts of either physical unavailability of energy or prices that are not competitive or are overly volatile . Though , it may mean different things in different places . Those states which are highly dependent on imported oil and gas , for instance , tend to focus more on the supply side of the equation . Whereas , in countries with economies based on exporting oil and gas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy security , at first , was purely about oil supply . It evolved as a policy response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo . At the time , the aim was to coordinate among the industrialised countries if supply gets disrupted , to avoid future supply problems and to deter exporters from using resources as a strategic weapon . <p> For Pakistan , energy security is no longer just a desire but rather a critical imperative for its struggling economy . Pakistan , for long , has been pulled back from getting on the path towards tangible economic growth with a real sense of development , due to its high dependence on oil and gas importation . The indigenous crude oil production meets only 15 percent of the country 's total requirements , whereas the other 85 percent is met through imports . Not only did Pakistan 's oil import bill rise to $12.928 billion in 2017-18 , but the country also imported Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) worth $2.123 billion . Needless to say , the huge costs entailed in these imports worsened the economy , substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these costs translated into a higher current account deficit , which also precipitated a further decline in the value of the Pakistani currency . <p> In this backdrop , Mr. Arshad H Abbasi -- a well-known energy and water expert and a member of the Center for Research and Security Studies ' ( CRSS ) Board of Directors -- impresses upon a sense of urgency for fresh exploration efforts in both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons . It is the only panacea for addressing the ills of the Pakistani economy which is beset by dwindling foreign reserves , a diminishing economic growth rate , and a deplorable balance of payments deficit . These ills have left the country 's economy vulnerable not only to external shocks but also to potential breaches from the national security perspective . Oil and gas exploration aimed at achieving self-sufficiency can ensure energy security which as a sub-set of national security can catalyse employment generation and economic development , thereby curbing religious extremism , radicalisation , and militancy , along with engaging the youth of the country in economic activity . <p> Pakistan today faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources in a cost effective , sustainable and environment-friendly manner . Affordability or cost of energy is a major component of energy security , but this is badly ignored when decisions are being made to import LNG , while not unlocking the huge domestic hydrocarbon reserves within the country . <p> Energy insecurity can generate ripples in many sectors of the economy , deteriorating the aggregate growth pattern . Having said that , we do have a jackpot ; all that requires to be done is to unlock it . The domestic oil and gas sector has enormous potential ; the balance recoverable reserves of crude oil in the country are calculated to amount to more than 350.632 million barrels . The total oil resource potential is 27 million barrels with the production of 86,032 barrels per day . Furthermore , Pakistan as the largest consumer of gas has a total resource potential of 282 trillion cubic feet of shale gas with recoverable reserves estimated at 24 trillion cubic feet of conventional gas . Meanwhile , production of gas hovers at around 4 billion cubic feet per day . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment at the national level . <p> For Pakistan , energy security is no longer just a desire but rather a critical imperative for its struggling economy <p> However , the notion that some people flag that ' nothing works in Pakistan ' is still not valid . As Mr. Abbasi spells out a success story of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Oil and Gas Company Limited ( KPOGCL ) and proves that if there is commitment and will , then all other things fall into place . In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) -- a province badly hit by terrorism -- the Provincial Oil and Gas Company KPOGCL ( Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Oil and Gas Company Limited ) can brag about its unique story . Back then , law and order was one of the biggest hurdles in extracting oil and gas in KP , whereby all oil and gas exploration activities were stagnant after the onset of the Taliban insurgency in 2006 . In this kind of environment , which was not receptive to healthy economic activity , KPOGCL not only established an innovative fool-proof security model in collaboration with the Pakistan Army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Single Window Facilitator ' Cell for national and international oil and gas exploration companies . Although , KPOGCL started operations from scratch in January 2014 ; within a short span and in receipt of only limited funding , the agency managed to achieve remarkable results ; the province became the epicenter of oil and gas activities in Pakistan and also created an enabling environment for national oil and gas companies . The production of oil in KP jumped from 20000 BPD ( barrel per day ) in 2013 to 60000 BPD by 2018 . Similarly , the KPOGCL showed phenomenal production of natural gas and liquid petroleum gas ( LPG ) . Now , the enthusiastic team of KPOGCL has set an achievable and practical target of oil production of 200,000 BPD , gas production of 2,000 MMCFD and LPG production of 3,000 tons per day by the year 2025 . Now , the point to ponder is , what exactly did the KPOGCL do differently ? Engineer Abbasi highlights three key lessons learned from KPOGCL 's success story : a ) KPOGCL rolled out the red carpet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province , by removing red-tape ; b ) Transparency is the key to attracting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . Institutional transparency in KP OGCL fascinated international Oil &amp; Gas Companies such as Rosgeo ( Russian ) , Halliburton , Saudi Aramco , GE , Siemens , CCK , Jereh , Eriell Oil Field Services to invest in the province ; and c ) KPKOGCL successfully demonstrated that oil and gas exploration in a troubled area is possible , owing to the commitment and will of its team . <p> The path ahead is to capitalize on the initial optimism generated through the change in political leadership expected to help Pakistan start afresh , free from the legacy of corruption and successive economic fiascos over the decades that have crippled it as a country and as a nation . <p> In this context , Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy ( HELP ) , proposed by Engineer Arshad H Abbasi represents a novel paradigm for a new cooperative framework for converting the dream of self-sufficiency into a reality .

Nonetheless , the new government ought to put self-sufficiency in oil and gas production at the top of its agenda . Neglecting to do this would not only further mire it into circular debt but also exacerbate the already devastating ramifications for economic as well as social solvency of our nation . <p> It is time that Pakistan realise the importance of energy security and developed its energy policy framework and implementation road-map around it . Capitalisation of indigenous resources , both conventional and unconventional , and energy conservation and management would have to be at its heart .

In case of job employment quota for religious minorities , the response has been , however , conciliatory if not welcoming . <p> The government of Pakistan reserved a minimum of five percent job quota for minorities on May 26 , 2009 , which was intermittently followed by similar provisions from the provincial governments . <p> The empirical evidence indicates that it has so far not shown due results . The minorities are still unable to take advantage of this affirmative action and minority jobs seats remain vacant . The data reveals that after nine years in implementation , the minority job quota is still unmet . The number of minority employees is even below the proportion of minority population in Pakistan . <p> How to make quota work ? <p> This absence of minority employees is still open to many plausible interpretations varying from compliance and implementation of quota to hostile political environment , social resistance , practical neglect , and also lack of stringent constitutional and sub-ordinate legislation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations , a sizable section of human and minority rights activists now have started holding that it is because the minority candidates generally do not fulfill criteria for jobs .

She says according to a policy brief that Bargad has published on minority quota the link between employments with education quota is undeniable . <p> The National Lobbying Delegation for Minority Rights is also actively pursuing the quota case . Its member and civil society activist , Asif Aqeel , who is member of a government committee to consider providing a desired education quota to religious minorities in Punjab , says , " the job quota is provided as an affirmative action .

However , it 's Article 27 of the Constitution ( safeguard against discrimination in services ) which endows job quota for minorities . <p> This administrative order defines a minority in the light of Article 260(3) ( b ) of the Constitution of Pakistan , signifying religious denomination and its allocation is similar to job quotas reserved for women and disabled persons . An important highlight of this quota is that it has to be carried forward if suitable candidates are not available . <p> Similar quota provisions for minorities have been subsequently replicated by the government of Punjab ( notified on May 27 , 2010 and further consolidated on February 9 , 2015 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 30 , 2010 ) ; and by the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( initially reserving a 0.5 percent quota and then to one and three percent and ultimately to five percent in August 2015 ) .

Major official sources published on annual basis , i.e. , Economic Survey of Pakistan , Labour Force Surveys , Pakistan Employment Trends , etc. , and the provincial development statistics do n't provide such data and the segregated figures for religious minorities in jobs are not available . <p> However , a publication of the federal establishment wing " Annual Statistical Bulletin of Employees of **26;2118;TOOLONG Bodies/Corporations under the Federal Government " can provide us partial information to indicate severity of the problem .

Forty percent are employed at the level of BPS-1 and another 35 percent do their jobs at BPS-2 . The total number of gazetted officers ( from BPS 17 to 22 ) is only 214 with no one working at BPS-22 and only two are employed at BPS-21 . Another key feature is that both at gazetted and non-gazetted positions , the share of Punjab is far greater than its part of minority population in the country . In gazetted positions , Punjab occupies 58.82 percent share as compared with 31.86 percent of Sindh , while in total employees ' positions this is respectively 57.00 percent and 18.64 percent . <p> Another data , shared with the parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent posts reserved for non-Muslims were lying vacant . This indicative case of the federal government employees clearly establishes to rethink about minority job quota in Pakistan and link it with allocation of minority quota in education . <p> Matching and linking quotas in employment with education <p> In the absence of data , we can assume that an affirmative action of minority quota in educational institutions would practically serve as an instrument for filling the minority jobs and increase opportunities for socio-economic mobility of minority families . This would help their kids to join decent work which is currently reduced to mostly lower tiers of a selected range of fields . <p> The quota for minority students in education will be a subsequent effort to ensure that minority candidates are placed in allocated jobs with better qualification and the employment quota is filled to obtain equity in public and professional sphere of Pakistani life .

Moreover , the federal and provincial bureaus of statistics should be bound to provide segregated socio-economic data pertaining to minority households . <p> Moreover , the constitutional , legislative and policy guidelines on ' equity , ' ' social protection ' and ' social well-being ' have to be clarified and backed up with subordinate legislation .

A T20 game takes only around 3-and-a-half hours , just a little more than an Indian movie . <p> In this format , batsmen have no time to make adjustments . In Test matches , a player can assess his performance session by session . In one-day cricket , a batsman reviews the situation after a few overs , but in T20 cricket a player needs to adjust his style after every ball . <p> In a short span of time , 180-200 runs are scored . This provides great entertainment to a cricket lover . In this format , one good over , either with bat or ball can change the complexion of a game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a series of 4s and 6s . T20 cricket provides all the fun they want . But it becomes possible only when the game is played on batting-friendly wickets . <p> The enjoyment of T20 is in a high scoring game , when batsmen hit maximum boundaries and set a tough target for opponent . But so far in the ongoing Pakistan Super League ( PSL ) in Dubai and Sharjah , most matches have been low scoring . <p> In the first phase of seven matches played in Dubai , no team crossed the 200-run mark . Karachi Kings ' 183-6 against Multan was the highest innings total . Lahore Qalandars were bowled out for just 78 by Peshawar Zalmi . <p> The average first innings total was less than 144 , which is not enough to attract crowds . <p> Pitches in the UAE are slow and have little bounce . And the boundaries are bigger . Such conditions are not supportive for power-hitting . The local batting talent failed to hit out of the ground and manage only 20s and 30s . <p> Overall , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Pakistani bowlers do not lose matches when batsmen have set 150 or more runs on the board . <p> Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) as the host of the league should take notice of low-scoring pitches in the UAE . That is the reason we have been seeing a large number of seats vacant during the matches . <p> According to PSL officials , website ticket charges for Dubai for general admission are 20 AED for a single game or a double-header during the weekdays and back to AED 40 for weekend PSL matches . Platinum tickets for the weekend double matches are available at AED 290 but there 's also an option to watch the match using Platinum East and Platinum West tickets for AED 125 per ticket . <p> For Sharjah , the tickets for single games that will be held during the weekday the minimum price for a North Stand ticket is AED 20 , while the East Stand ticket price is AED 40 . West Stand tickets are available for AED 70 , while the Members Enclosure will cost you AED 150 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands showed that people ca n't afford to buy tickets on a daily basis as mostly people are doing low-paying jobs there . The distance between the main city to cricket stadium is over 25 kms . So the transportation charges also affect a common man . <p> The organisers should think of something different to attract crowds . To fill the stadium , ticket prices could be reduced or fans could be allowed to enter without paying anything after the first innings . <p> Full house encourages players to show their skills . Empty stadiums dishearten the players . 
@@60577235 <h> Transforming Thar <p> Tharparkar in Sindh is in the news mostly for wrong reasons . We get to know that children are dying of hunger or malnutrition , there is a drought-like condition most of the time , schools are closed , and hospitals are not functioning . On the other side , the PPP government in Sindh claims that the situation is not that serious , the news items concerning Thar are largely biased , the number of children dying there is highly exaggerated , and the health and school facilities are as good or bad as in some other districts of Pakistan . <p> During my recent visit to Sindh , I decided to get some first-hand exposure in Thar so that I could share with my readers what I saw . To be fair , a lot is happening in Tharparkar , and it is no more an idyllic and quiet place , as it used to be till a couple of years ago . The main reason for this ongoing transformation is the Thar Coal Project with majority share of the government of Sindh and minor shares of private companies , including a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight to behold ; it is awe-inspiring and encouraging at the same time . <p> The minefield is a huge hollow created after digging and removing millions of tons of sand and stone . The crater-like mine presents an enormous sheet of coal at the bottom where heavy machinery is at work . The most interesting aspect of this gigantic workshop is the fact that hundreds of local Tharis are now gainfully employed and the job opportunities have been extended to womenfolk too . Dozens of women are driving dumper trucks and operating them with ease . Dozens more are getting training to start work at the minefield . <p> Since this was an unannounced visit by this writer and no pick and drop or accommodation was availed , there was no question of staging a show for the visitor . The women who were getting motor training were all from the local villages and even those who were training them belonged to Thar . Most of them were Hindus belonging to the lowest castes of their religious hierarchy . Malnutrition was definitely there , but one could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined and those who had been working there for months . <p> The jobs these women are getting , have a tremendous potential of changing their socio-economic conditions . Once they have a regular income of around 25,000 rupees per month , not only their own nutrition level improves but also of their children . The main cause of death among children is two-fold . One , the early marriages of teenage girls who are barely able to conceive a child and then bear the birth pangs . Two , because of malnutrition among mothers the embryo does not receive the required nutrients during the first eight weeks of pregnancy . When the embryo becomes a fetus in the ninth week of gestation it is already week and unable to develop as a healthy organism . <p> This has a lot to do with poverty and lack of livelihood opportunities . Previously the number of infants dying was much higher because of the distances and a lack of infrastructure . Now the roads in Tharparkar are much better than the roads in many other districts in Pakistan . With my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many districts in the country can match the road infrastructure in and around Tharparkar . This is mainly thanks to the efforts the government of Sindh has put in during the last ten years . <p> Since the government of Sindh is also the majority shareholder in the Thar Coalmining Project , the requirements of the project have also prompted the government to fulfill its responsibilities . In addition to the government of Sindh there are other non-governmental organisations such as Baanh Beli led by Javed Jabbar , Indus Hospital led by Dr Abdul Bari , Thardeep Rural Development Programme led by Dr Allah Nawaz Soomro , Thar Foundation led by Naseer Memon , The Citizen Foundation led by Dr Kamlani and many others . These organisations are working in consonance with each other and trying to bring about a change that should have taken place much earlier . <p> At the moment Thar Foundation is at the forefront of this transformation . As a new player in the field it has new blood in its veins and hired local educated youth to contribute to the development of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karachi , to provide free healthcare to underprivileged people of the Thari society . They are already on the way to make Islamkot a model taluka ( tehsil ) for health facilities in Sindh , which can be followed by other districts . For example , their Marvi Mother and Child Clinic has been operational since 2015 , and one could see Thari women and children get the best possible primary healthcare that is the hallmark of Indus Hospital in Karachi . <p> When this writer paid an unannounced visit to Gorrano village , he could observe mother-and-child health services being provided to the local people . Free medicine and treatment , and that of high quality , is appreciated by the local men too who accompany their wives and children to these clinics . Informal chats with the local people disclosed that they are appreciative of the efforts both the Sindh government and the Thar Foundation are doing . Islamkot is also going to be the location of a 250-bed hospital already underway in its earlier phase . <p> Almost a 100-bed facility is already completed and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be operated by Indus Hospital . Since the Thar dessert has a vast terrain with sparsely populated areas , mobile clinics ' network is also underway . With regard to education also , The Thar Foundation has achieved a lot in collaboration with the Citizen Foundation . It is presenting an ideal example of private-public partnership by offering to adopt and operate all government schools in Islamkot to begin with . Twenty-four school units have already been set up in Islamkot and Mithi , having capacity of 5,000 pupils . <p> Some of the campuses spotted on the way and visited , again unannounced , showed smartly dressed children attending classes . Though malnutrition was visible on their faces and poverty reflected in the nearby villages where they come from . The Thar Foundation claims that the multimillion dollar Thar Coal Project employs almost 75 per cent of its staff and workers from the area . Still , a major challenge is creating food security and eliminating or at least reducing malnutrition . This challenge is compounded by the fact that agriculture is possible only in scattered areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being made to introduce bio-saline agriculture with the help of both the government of Sindh and the Thar Foundation , and the local communities are more than enthusiastic to try this new adventure . Now in selected areas cluster beans , millet , melons , and lentils are being grown to the amazement of the local population , and Pakistan Agriculture Research Centre ( PARC ) is also on board . Another unbelievable development is aquaculture development in the Thar Desert . A large pond has been created in which 100,000 fish seeds have been released . <p> This and many other initiatives are transforming Thar , for which the Sindh government , the Thar Foundation , The Citizen Foundation , and Indus Hospital are to be appreciated . Though the scale of these interventions is still meager , they need to be expanded for a sustainable change in this region .

Now Trump talks of " love " between them . <p> And in the run-up to the summit he suggested that if the North gave up its weapons , it could be transformed from an isolated fortress state to an Asian economic tiger -- much like Vietnam , a communist country that embraced capitalism and buried its confrontation with the United States . <p> " With complete Denuclearization , North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse , " tweeted Trump .

@@60620235 <h> Laws of absurdity : crop zoning <p> As the shift in area under cultivation from cotton to other cash crops with better returns per hectare continues to grow pace , proposals are being made in the corridors of power to restore zoning laws for major crops . <p> In FY05 , land under cotton peaked both in terms of area at 3,193 hectares and 42 percent share in four major kharif crops . According to latest numbers from Federal Committee on Agriculture , cotton crop will record its worst year since three decades , with cultivated area 25 percent lower than the peak figure . <p> This has sent alarm bells ringing across MoC , which has betted big on textile export revival but has little power to influence cropping patterns across country , thanks to devolution of agriculture as a provincial subject under 18th amendment . <p> This has revived proposals for zoning of agricultural land for major crops , under which government is entrusted with the wisdom to identify suitable area for each major cash crop based on factors such as climatic conditions , proximity to industrial units , and crop targets . <p> It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the envelope on the proposal , considering it hands are tied so far as provincial government is concerned . On surface , it may appear that the proposal may receive strong opposition from rice and sugar millers , two crops which have gained share in area on cotton 's expense . <p> But BR Research 's past conversations with sugar millers indicate that the proposal may find strong support , at least in the sugar lobby . <p> It may be recalled that a different kind of zoning laws existed for sugarcane until early 1990s , which mandated that growers may only sell their produce to mills set up in the area . <p> Abolition of these laws led to mushroom growth of mills , as 52 new units were setup in the following decade , more than the total mills setup since colonial Raj . Opening of industry allowed businesses to compete for the crop by offering premium , also contributing to increase in area under cultivation . <p> The abolishment of zoning is to the chagrin of old players , who previously held growers in the farmgate area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the industrial unit within the zoned area , industrial units enjoyed virtually unlimited power to procure raw material on self-determined rates . <p> The proposal to reintroduce zoning poses similar risks . For one , the proposal is an obvious infringement of fundamental freedom of choice and right to free enterprise . Second , it is also an infringement on property rights , by bestowing government with the power to determine what business communities may engage on their privately own lands . <p> More importantly , it also risks entrusting the government to decide winners and losers in agriculture , as different crops offer varying rates of return . This opens the floodgates of rent-seeking and corruption , as farming communities shall lobby their MNAs and MPAs to ensure their tehsils and districts are zoned such that they grow crops with highest returns per hectare . <p> The policymakers should be weary of the proposal , as they may find ostensible support from a cross-section of industrial as well as farming associations .

The automotive industry has been relying heavily on the Chinese investment which comprises 30% of the overall foreign investment in the country . This major part of Chinese investment has dropped down by 74.8% on a year-to-year basis in the first seven months of the fiscal year 2019 . Overall , the investment from China as an integral part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) has also slowed down by almost 28.4% on a year-to-year basis . <p> In the Finance Supplementary ( 2nd Amendment ) Bill 2019 ( mini-budget ) presented by the current government in January 2019 , the restriction on non-filers to purchase cars was raised to a maximum of 1300cc engine capacity . However , we have seen another recent amendment as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-filers . To some extent , it would relieve the pressure imposed due to the slowdown in investment inflows . Therefore , on behalf of this new policy , Fitch Solutions have also revised its prediction for the sales of new vehicles in the recent research report . The new forecast suggests a 2.4% contraction and 1.3% growth in auto sales during the FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 as compared to the previous high of 7.3% and 10.6% contraction and growth respectively . <p> The research agency believes that the slowdown process in the investment inflows into Pakistan is going to create a significant impact on the automobile industry of Pakistan , especially in the commercial vehicles segment . According to the statistics revealed by Fitch Solutions , the sales in the commercial vehicles segment are expected to undergo an increase of 4.9% during FY2019 . Out of this , the light commercial vehicles segment is likely to see growth by 11.8% during the same period . However , the heavy commercial vehicles segment will primarily face the brunt of investment slowdown , and it 's expected to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research report says that the lifting of the ban on non-filers from purchasing new locally manufactured vehicles would boost passenger car sales though nominally . Previously , the consumer base in the low-budget segment had decreased significantly due to the restriction on buying a new car . However , the research company believes that even the prices of low-budget cars have sky-rocketed beyond the reach of many non-filers . Therefore , not many non-filers who primarily belong to the low-income segment would be able to afford a new car even after the lifting of the ban . On this basis , the sales in passenger vehicles are forecasted to decline by 3.6% during the FY 2018-19 whereas the sales are expected to grow by a marginal 0.6% during the FY 2019-20 . <p> That 's it from our side for now .

But first , a brief explanation of the issue , its profound effects and the economics behind it all : <p> What 's the problem ? <p> There are three main issues with plastic straws ; the lengthy period it takes to decompose , its small size and the horrifying impact it has on aquatic animals . <p> It 's estimated that approximately 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine creatures succumb to plastic in the sea . Though straws only account for a portion of those deaths , they remain a part of the issue as numerous types of animals are unable to differentiate between it and their food .

In fact , though 5 types of plastics can be recycled , they are n't even accepted by most curbside recycling programs . <p> Additionally , even the few recycling programs who accept plastics , are unable to recycle straws , as a result of their size . In fact , according to Jonathan Kuhl of the D.C.

Well before the inventions of the paper straw in 1880 , and polypropylene plastic in the 1950s , metal straws were found in South America and , much earlier , in an ancient Sumerian Tomb . When the invention of polyprotein plastic straws occurred , the issue of plastic straws also began . <p> Because of its flexibility , businesses , fast-food chains and other restaurants alike , adopted plastic straws , which , in turn , increased its popularity .

The USA , therefore , shares the responsibility for what is happening in Afghanistan , Pakistan and the region . <p> The foregoing proves .

" <p> " The clear message from President Trump has helped -- is having a real impact . And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do . We still have a long way to go -- much to do -- but we have really seen very strong progress in defence spending from NATO allies . " <p> Trump also underscored that Germany , in particular , is not doing enough , as Berlin now plans to spend 1.5% by 2024 , which is lower than the 2% guideline . <p> " Germany honestly is not paying their fair share , " he said . " I have a great feeling for Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're paying for a big proportion of NATO , which is basically protecting Europe . They 're paying close to 1 percent . " <p> Trump has criticised the alliance since before he became president , at one point declaring NATO to be " obsolete . " He later revised that statement , saying he no longer believed that to be the case during Stoltenberg 's visit back in 2017 . <p> The White House also issued a statement saying that Trump met with Stoltenberg to mark NATO 's 70th anniversary and reaffirm US support for the alliance . The statement said the two leaders " reviewed NATO 's unprecedented progress to increase burden-sharing " and also discussed " ongoing efforts to fight terrorism ( and ) check Russian aggression . " <p> Trump emphasised the importance of a stronger NATO in opposing Russia during the meeting , yet underscored that he still believes that the relationship with Moscow will be good , adding that he hopes to " get along with Russia .

" Tax amnesty schemes must be one off or else " taxpayers will develop an expectation of future immunities " was the IMF 's warning in the mandatory ( second ) quarterly IMF review in 2014 under the three-year Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) programme ( September 2013-2016 ) . <p> In Pakistan during the past 11 years , five amnesty schemes have been announced - one during the tenure of the Pakistan People 's Party in 2008 and three during the tenure of the PML-N government ( 2013-18 ) , all approved through an ordinance instead of by parliament . Two amnesty schemes were announced by the Dar-led finance ministry ( one announced during the EFF that elicited the aforementioned warning from the IMF ) and one in December 2016 , no more than two months after the programme concluded , allowing property owners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of 3 percent tax . <p> Dar 's successor Miftah Ismail announced one scheme in 2018 which was extended by the caretakers and widely hailed as the best amnesty scheme as it enabled the government to forcefully purchase property with double the amount of valuation if the property 's filed assessment was less than the market value . Additionally , the scheme envisaged the following tax rates : ( a ) a 2 percent tax on foreign exchange sent from abroad ; ( b ) 2 percent on undeclared money lying in local dollar accounts ; ( c ) 3 percent on foreign assets declared but not brought back to Pakistan ( valued at market price and not less than cost of acquisition ) ; and ( d ) 5 percent tax on foreign liquid assets like bank accounts declared and not brought back . The terms for undeclared local assets or income were that flat rate of taxation of 5 percent . None of the schemes was particularly successful though the failure of the last scheme was attributed to Imran Khan 's warning that if elected he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as it may , Ismail 's scheme led to filing of declarations by 55,000 of more than 1,770 billion rupee assets ( domestic and foreign ) with the bulk declared under domestic assets ( only a little over 30 million dollars were repatriated under the scheme ) . With over 200 billion dollar assets held by Pakistanis in Switzerland alone this result can hardly be declared a success . <p> The scheme prepared under the Asad Umar-led finance ministry , not yet approved by the cabinet that reportedly is seeking adjustments/fine-tuning in the tax rates , was discussed by the newly-appointed Advisor to the Prime Minister on Finance Dr Hafeez Sheikh with the Federal Board of Revenue ( FBR ) on 20 April 2019 - discussions that ' focused on the scope and the features of the scheme ' with the Advisor instructing " FBR to fine-tune the scheme to make it simple to understand and easy to implement . He also emphasised that the objective of the scheme should be to make the economy more tax compliant and documented " - instructions based on the Cabinet 's discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF Mission leader on " progress of negotiations for an IMF-supported programme for Pakistan . Both sides expressed their commitment for moving the discussions forward . It was agreed that an IMF mission will visit Pakistan by the end of April 2019 . " It is doubtful if this conversation was on specific conditions . <p> As aforementioned , the Fund remains opposed to amnesty schemes , and with Pakistan being on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , with which IMF maintains close contact any attempt to launch an amnesty scheme in 2019 may be at the cost of not only the IMF package but may also land Pakistan in the black-listed countries by the FATF which would have repercussions on investment inflows . The concerns of these two multilaterals must be looked at carefully and the amnesty scheme tailored to ensure that the government does not face investment inflow problems on which it is heavily relying to meet the unsustainable current account and budget deficits . <p> Dr Sheikh , it may be recalled , opted to have the IMF Stand-By Arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was unable to convince the then Zardari-led government to implement politically challenging tax and power sector reforms under the Stand-By Arrangement . The question is whether he will do the same in 2019 or whether the Khan administration will allow him to proceed with the necessary structural reforms holding him entirely responsible for all politically challenging decisions and dumping him as soon as the economic impasse is over . This question has no easy answer .

@@60785231 <h> Lucky : running out of luck <p> Despite a 105 percent growth in exports , the company 's revenue shows a growth of about 6 percent in 9MFY19 . Meanwhile , the company 's margins shrank to 30 percent , which for Lucky are the lowest margins it has seen in the past decade -- in 2010 when other players were incurring gross losses , Lucky was at 33 percent margins . But even at the steep decline in margins , the company lands at a net margin of 22 percent -- which is second to Bestway cement in 9M . Is it a mixed bag result , or is Lucky tumbling downhill like the rest ? <p> What factors reconcile the high growth in exports with low margins ? Though exports have grown -- they are now 26 percent of the total sales for the company -- they have grown primarily in clinker which is a semi-finished product used to make cement . Clinker exports were 50 percent of Lucky 's total exports -- much higher than the industry average of 32 percent ( based on data from APCMA ) . The problem is , clinker fetches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $60 per ton less than domestic cement sales . High priced domestic sales have declined by 13 percent . <p> The revenue per ton ( as calculated for Lucky ) grew by 4 percent garnering a renewed sense of respect in the existing sales mix . The reason is the price competition that has been seen in the north zone has not occurred in the south zone . Retention prices per cement bag have remained the same , or moved upwards . During the period when prices were dropping in the north , southern zone prices were going up . In Hyderabad , prices went up by Rs10 per bag between Feb-19 and Mar-19 , in Islamabad , they were coming down to Rs35 per bag . Other markets showed similar drops of Rs20 per bag . <p> The graph shows the upward movement of per bag cement prices in Karachi demonstrating while despite a drop in domestic sales , revenues have still shown the growth that it did . The growth in exports has helped bring overall sales up . <p> The other major factors are fuel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Costs per ton sold ( as calculated ) for Lucky rose 14 percent in 9MFY19 . For Lucky , nearly 65 percent of all costs are fuel and power based ( coal etc. ) , while packing materials ( paper and board etc. ) are about 10 percent . Exchange rate affects the cost of imported goods while the global price movements of the commodities also impacts overall costs . Though coal prices have come down recently -- they averaged $94 per ton in 9M against $91 per ton during 9MFY18 . While the rupee depreciated by 13 percent between July-18 and Mar-19 and by 27 percent since Jan-18 . The margin drop of 19 percent makes sense . <p> The company also incurred higher distribution costs due to greater exports -- resulting in indirect costs going up from 9 percent to 10 percent as a share of revenue . The bottom-line drop of 15 percent ( 17% drop per ton ) is despite the lower effective tax rate of 15 percent , against 18 percent this period last year . Lucky has its fingers pretty spread out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project and a clinker facility in Iraq are set to produce in 1QFY21 as well as the launch of Kia Lucky Motors that will soon start booking for Sportage and Picanto soon .

@@60798238 <h> The disillusionment driving the yellow vests <p> There can be no doubt that the tenacity of the protesters , who started the yellow vest movement in November 2018 , and who have so far achieved only meagre success in terms of direct outcomes , has astonished the French politicians . <p> Historians of the Left , anxious to portray the French Revolution of 1789 as a glorious phenomenon in which ordianry people led the nation to a new era , often refrained from a more critical review of that period . <p> A peasant revolt ( or jacquerie ) was the result of a crowd expressing their rejection of the established order before submitting to it again , givingup fatalistically on the hope of overthrowing it . The revolution , on the other hand , reflected the will of the propertied , in this case , the bourgeoisie , who already holding a few privileges , intended to increase them by overthrowing the old elite of the ancien r ? gime , because the former 's economic situation allowed them to envisage a better future by so doing . <p> The French government , which judges the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its part , that they will sooner or later acknowledge the realities of the 21st century globalised market.It rejects their vision of the future on the grounds that it fails to take into account the course of national and international events . <p> This article , looks at the recent work of Fran ? ois-Bernard Huyghe and Damien Liccia , In the mind of the yellow vests , which provides useful insights into this movement . <p> The two researchers indicate that since November 2018 , a forgotten question has emerged : that of a " just society " based on " the social contract . " . However , they seem to forget the hope that the En Marche movement of the soon-to-be-president Emmanuel Macron aroused on the eve of the elections of May 2017 . The near-unanimous positivity across French media already seemed unfounded , and although some in the foreign press did draw attention to Macron 's fairly privileged social background and the time he had spent in banking , few in France seemed to pay attention . <p> Huyghe and Liccia recall that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media " , in short the " techno-structure . " They no longer adhere to the " European promise " . They reject " the moralising oligarchy . " They oppose " democracy , in its etymological sense " ( i.e. " command by the people " ) to the " norms of the liberal rule of law . " The hike in the price of fuel , many felt , was only a symptom of a deep malaise . They worried about a lack of prerogatives they claimed on the basis of their citizenship and , finally , rebelled against the contempt they felt the elite was showing towards them . <p> During the second phase , the yellow vest movement addressed the issue of tax justice , and , finally , that of political representation . The debate has shifted , opposing " democracy of the people ( in the sense of a capacity to fully achieve their will , without mediation ) " and " liberal democracy , that of the rule of law guaranteeing the protection of the rules and freedoms . " Defenders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a potential source of danger , who might behave unrealistically if granted the prerogatives contained in the Citizen Initiative Referendum they demanded . This is an instrument of direct democracy that would , were it to be adopted , allowcitizens who gather a number of signatures set by law to bring about a referendum . <p> In any case , the yellow vests have rediscovered " two traditional forms of social confrontation . " The first is the strategy of the slowdown ; people " certainly very honourable in everyday life " decided to slow down the traffic , and to break traffic speed radars ( to prevent the state from collecting revenue from speeding fines ) , thus taking over public space . " And some of them , amazed at being gassed or baton-charged , who consider themselves honest people , have also thrown a few punches ... One defines oneself by one 's adversary ...

The state , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of understanding that divides the masses , to use a Marxist concept , from the elite . In this way , the population has rediscovered the second traditional form of confrontation : it is no longer unaware that at each demonstration ( or to use the terminology in vogue " act " ) , the yellow vests will be up against the forces of law and order . <p> The French government , which judges the claims of the yellow vests to be utopian , expects that sooner or later they will acknowledge the realities of the 21st century globalised market <p> Bernard Huyghe and Damien Liccia look into a phenomenon to which the European media may give too much importance : that of populism , " the political insult par excellence . " The latter , varying from case-to-case , blame yellow vests for : " the violence of their speeches ( or indeed of their actions ) , their hatred of the elites , the claim to embody a genuine people without respecting their legal representatives , their disregard for norms , law or humanity when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their naivety : demanding the immediate implementation of their selfish claims , without taking into account hard facts , not least economic ones . " <p> They conclude : " Condemned for its style , its hostility , its fantasies and its unrealism , populism is the ideal bogeyman ... " . <p> The concept of populism has evolved over time . But a political class " in full ideological disarray " resorted to it , for lack of being able to respond to a population that expresses its " political refusal of the System , of ' right-thinking ' and of political correctness ... at each election . " <p> " At every yellow vest demonstration , commentators highlight the lack of education of the masses , the insufficiency of explanation of the historical movement supposed to lead each one to conquer his autonomy and bring prosperity to all . So there is a problem of pedagogy -- the elite having perhaps robbed the masses of their sense of history . <p> Populism is said to comprise three typical characteristics : its supporters refuse to accept reality , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space to demagogy ) and in " false hierarchies , amounting to a refusal to recognise the skills of experts , professionals and intellectuals .

" " Finally , they cultivate an attachment to outdated values " , refusing " modernity , progress , Europe , cultural openness , etc. " and would be " destined to end up in rubbish bins of history " . <p> Such a reading ignores an important dimension : " France from below " nurtures even more a feeling of hostility toward the political , economic and media elites which , in its opinion , are one and the same and which aim at perpetuating their position at the top of society 's institutions . It is convinced of the existence of a " cosmopolitan and oligarchic class " anxious to maintain its " financial power " and its " moral hegemony . " <p> Moreover , the movement of yellow vests reflects " a struggle of the periphery " ( rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? me or Bohemian bourgeoisie , or very loosely translatable as ' Champagne socialists ' of the city centres ... of those who are less and less able to benefit from social mobility ( especially through schooling ) " ) .

In a recent , and appropriately titled , essay Victory of the Vanquished , Plenel attempts an analysis of the yellow vest movement that challenges the " established order " , " its immobility " and its certainties ; the " yellow vests " , he writes , " opened the door of a history that had previously been padlocked .

Plenel adds that " the violence to which the police forces resort is an echo of a great fear of the haves . " This violence is reminiscent of " the almost unanimous opprobrium " of which the Paris Commune ( 1871 ) was the object , even by novelists such as George Sand and Emile Zola .

@@60808238 <h> Italian museum looks to unlock da Vinci hair mystery <p> An Italian museum says it plans to carry out DNA tests on a lock of hair it believes might have belonged to the Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci , who died 500 years ago this month . <p> However , some experts have thrown doubt on the exercise , saying the hair almost certainly did not belong to the Italian master , while credible DNA testing may prove impossible . <p> Leonardo Da Vinci died in May 1519 and was buried at the Chateau d'Ambroise near the French city of Tours .

" Fasting is good for health because it helps detoxify our bodies . By opting for regular fasts , waste elements are drained out and the intestines are kept healthy , " he explained . <p> Doctors and nutritionists , therefore , largely agree that fasting is good for health but discipline in what we eat before and after the fasting period is very important in ensuring that . <p> It 's not uncommon to see people indulging in delicious meals foriftar .

Matin added overeating , especially foods high in fat and sugar -- read pakoras , samosas , and sugary drinks -- can cause lethargy along with weight gain . <p> " Excess carbohydrate consumption also leads to increased sleepiness and lethargy after iftar and instead of boosting their metabolism , most people end up gaining weight during Ramazan by overindulging in high-calorie foods .

Matin also explained that one does not have to go completely cold turkey when it comes to delicious meals and suggested healthier ways of cooking to satiate cravings . <p> " Baking or air-frying many items that are traditionally deep-fried can help one cut down the oil and calories tremendously , " she concluded . <p> Fasting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people opt for fasting beyond the month of Ramazan .

However , all this often leads to a huge increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio .

This ultimately resulted in an increase of 15 percentage points in the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 29% of GDP to 44% of GDP . <p> Pakistan has also had a history of borrowing either to resolve its budgetary or balance of payments issues . The latter has been the pivotal reason behind the country 's recent recourse to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This has been heavily debated in the media in terms of its benefits and disadvantages . This article aims to analyse why countries borrow , whether it is good or bad and explores the link between public debt and growth . <p> The motives behind borrowing <p> A recent IMF working paper titled " The Motives to Borrow " has defined both good and bad reasons for the countries to borrow . Good reasons include using debt to finance periods where high expenditure is required , particularly during times of natural disasters . <p> Increasing spending during recessions can smooth out the business cycle raising output , employment and incomes . Using debt for capital outlays on public investment programmes can lead to economic growth . <p> However , this comes with the condition that governments must ensure two important points .

However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady accumulation of debt and budget deficits during bad times should be offset by surpluses during times of economic expansion . <p> Economists have also pointed towards politicians and policymakers using bad reasons for borrowing .

@@60848238 <h> MPS : A step too soon ? <p> There was a strong noise of 150 bps increase ; and it happened . The rumor had it as a prior IMF condition and this perhaps is good compliance . The stance is hawkish and the words seem not at all influenced by the Q Block , but surely have the IMF 's tone . <p> The policy rate now stands at 12.25 percent and the discount rate is at 12.75 percent . The headline and core inflation In April stood at 8.8 percent ( 10M average 7% ) and 7.0 percent ( 10M average 8.1% ) , respectively . The 12 Month moving average of core is 7.9 percent while headline is at 6.6% . The past trend suggest that CPI is increasing every month but the core is on the fall . In simple words , food and fuel prices -- cost push , are on the rise while demand driven inflation is falling . Theory says that monetary policy tightening is meant to curb demand . <p> The word is that IMF condition is to keep minimum 2 percent real interest rates . Seeing yesterday 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from macroeconomic models with no or little role of judgment . Economics is not a real science , and a standardized model can not be run everywhere without adapting to domestic realities . <p> And the most critical role is of judgment of the economic manager where someone having domestic economic knowledge could have an edge . Another question is why urge for deciding on future expected inflation today when the central bank announces monetary policy every two months . <p> The inflation is expected to increase due to currency depreciation -- which could be more , as the foreign reserves are too low and the exchange rate is now market based , passing on energy prices -- not much impact on CPI as two third of consumers slabs are below 300 units consumption where prices are not expected to increase ; and the rationalization of taxes . Let us see how high inflation goes , and it depends on how much currency further depreciates . <p> One rationale for hawkish stance could be that the central bank is overly cautious in correcting external imbalances , falling reserves position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess and the deficit would be north of 7 percent in FY19 . But how higher interest rate could reduce it further ? Debt servicing is surely going to soar , but the IMF target is primary deficit -- excluding debt servicing . The government has already cut down its development spending , in current expenditure administrative efficiencies can lower expenditures , but not interest rates . <p> The element of enhanced central borrowing is inflationary in nature . The borrowing is shifted from commercial banks as latter are not inclined to lend at prevailing rates . This is happening because central bank has given a put option to banks to park the excess liquidity at policy rate with SBP which is 50 bps below discount rate . The floor of corridor is 150 bps lower than the policy rate , but that is rarely used . If the central bank mops up the excess liquidity at floor , banks would be happy to lend to government at prevailing rates . <p> Last but not the least is external imbalance . The non-oil trade deficit is declining due to ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade deficit , but to hope for a fall in oil prices or ration consumption through load management ( read load shedding ) . <p> The crucial part is the fall in foreign exchange reserves , and that has to be built . In Egypt , higher interest rates brought foreign portfolio investment in the country , and that jacked up reserves . Now with falling rates , the hot money is evaporating . IMF thinking could be to have a replica of it in Pakistan . The window to do tough reforms exists till those flows remain intact or till the interest rates remain high . <p> One big assumption is that like Egypt , foreign flows will come in Pakistan , but historically this never happened in Pakistan . A better option could be to excess global capital market directly , as in case of former , the economic slowdown at home is a little too high a cost .

However , he stressed that so many children could not have received blood transfusions and , at the same time , because the affected children were of a young age , other factors that cause the disease could not be given much significance . <p> Dr Mirza said that the federal government has been working with the provincial government to cooperate on the matter since the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being provided for all adult and child patients of HIV/AIDS and further new medicines were being ordered as the current supply was found to be insufficient due to an abnormally large number of child affectees . <p> According to the special assistant , as many as 50,000 screening kits have also been ordered and three treatment centres are being set up in Sindh " so that the work could be done in a more authorised manner " . <p> Dr Mirza said that when a child is found to have HIV/AIDS , it is a chronic condition which requires them to take medicine their whole life . <p> He reiterated that the federal government will cooperate with the provincial government , which would be required to do long-term planning on the matter . <p> Dr Mirza said that in his opinion , the number of reported cases of HIV/AIDS in Pakistan was much lower than the actual number of cases in the country . <p> He added that as per their " conservative estimate " , there were 163,000 patients of HIV/AIDS in the country .

@@60873235 <h> Email <p> The writer is the author of Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments : US Crisis Management in South Asia . <p> BEFORE coming to power , Prime Minister Imran Khan constantly pointed to the Pakistan diaspora as an untapped resource that would contribute generously for the country 's good once he took office . As a Pakistani who has been part of the US-based diaspora , I can see where he was coming from . Immediately after the PTI came to power , social media activism in the US was consumed by diaspora encouraging each other to do more for the country . <p> Ten months down , diaspora chatter is downbeat . The intuitive reasoning is that things have n't improved much under the PTI . In reality , the reasons may have more to do with the diaspora 's mindset . <p> The fact is that the US-based diaspora is far more parochial than one would expect of a relatively successful , well assimilated expat community . To complicate matters , successive governments in Pakistan have failed to translate their desire to extract greater support from overseas Pakistanis into targeted strategies that appeal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . They have the greatest potential to do more . Unskilled and semi-skilled labour are already helping to their maximum ability by sending remittances to their families . <p> Ten months down , diaspora chatter is downbeat . <p> Highly skilled professionals tend to help in four ways : contribute to philanthropic causes in Pakistan ; invest in profitable ventures that generate local economic activity ; use their influence in US policy circles to promote Pakistan 's case ; and physically relocate back to put their skill sets to use . In each case , things are n't operating at potential . <p> Large funds pour into Pakistan for philanthropic causes . A 2007 book by Adil Najam , Portrait of a Giving Community , documented how Pakistani-Americans have kept up the spirit of charity . These inflows , however , are haphazard , most often transferred through informal family networks and usually devoid of any larger understanding of overall needs . The state must be faulted for not having a mechanism to define national priorities for in-bound philanthropic contributions . There are also no transparent mechanisms that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds have reached their intended recipients if they were to channel them to more strategic initiatives coordinated by the state . <p> The diaspora have shied away from private efforts to pool resources going to identical causes . The result is redundancy and a supply-demand mismatch in terms of where the money ends up . <p> The diaspora 's commercial investment choices also tend to be driven by an extremely conservative mindset . Too many expats gravitate towards investing in ' safe ' sectors , most prominently real estate . Millions of dollars therefore pour in to be parked in what is arguably one of the least fruitful sectors from the point of view of generating local economic activity . <p> The state can be critiqued for lagging in creating adequate incentives to alter this behaviour . But I suspect the kind of investment certainty the diaspora want is impossible to provide in Pakistan 's current context . State efforts would have to be combined with a more entrepreneurial spirit and less jaundiced view of doing business in Pakistan . <p> In terms of political influence , the politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , many influential Pakistanis are active in trying to improve Pakistan-US ties . But as an aggregate , the community is as divided by petty issues and personality clashes as they would be in a Pakistani context . Successive Pakis ? tani ambassadors in Washington have tried and failed to gel these influencers together . <p> Finally , the discourse around public service in Pakistan is often too entitled for my liking . Most successful diaspora feel they 'd be doing the country a favour if they move back and work for the state . Most are looking for the right prominence to take the plunge . I experienced this my ? self recently in the wake of misinformation that I had accepted a job in the public sec ? tor and was returning to Pakistan .

Consumer prices rose by 8.2 per cent between February 2018 and February 2019 .

The leading companies in Pakistan enjoy success , not through innovation but by creating monopolies using their proximity to politics .

This will definitely help boost their export . Remittance is seeing an uprise , that 's also appreciating . These two traits are similar to Bangladesh . But the problem is due to overt taxes being imposed both in direct and indirect modes , next year 's inflation rate will hit double figures . Ironically wages will be increased in upper grades by 10% , whilst in lower grades salary increase will be 5% .

@@60916230 <p> Some of the countries like Russia , China and a few members of the EU have , of late , started raising questions over growing US dominance in the global economic order . Speaking in front of business and political leaders at the annual Saint Petersburg International Forum , Russia 's Vladimir Putin accused Washington of seeking to " extend its jurisdiction to the whole world " and lashed out at " inequalities " in the global economic system . Denouncing the " rhetoric of trade wars and sanctions " , he also called for rethinking the role of US dollar in global trade . Besides , he pointed to US efforts to block the building of Nord Stream 2 , a major new natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that would bypass Ukraine . Talking about Washington 's pressure on Chinese tech giant Huawei , Putin said that " they are trying not to just squeeze out , but to unceremoniously push ( Huawei ) out of the global market .

Much touted in this connection is the agreement with Iran which bound the country not to develop nuclear capability in exchange for lifting of sanctions . The fact that the US has consigned the agreement to the dustbin of history has not been seen favourably by major EU countries and does not befit the sole superpower which is supposed to lead by example .

So far as relationship between Russia and China is concerned , Putin and Xi speak openly about their warm personal ties ; Xi going to the extent of saying that " Putin was his best friend " . Moscow and Beijing 's economic ties have also grown in recent years though they remain heavily tilted in favour of China . The partnership has yielded increasing trade which grew by 25 percent in 2018 to hit a record dollar 108 billion . In the meantime , China is also planning to establish a system that would ensure national security in technology , amid an expanding trade war with the US which has snared Huawei . Such a step would protect China 's key technologies and be a major step to counter US crackdown .

Unsurprisingly , however , the news of his arrest on Monday eclipsed the other major event : unveiling of the Economic Survey of Pakistan that paints a dismal picture of the economy for the financial year 2018-19 . Still , the PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif , who along with his son Hamza Sharif ( nabbed by NAB the next day ) has faced similar action , took issue with the timing of the arrest saying it had been done to divert public attention from the " IMF prepared anti-people budget . " And a furious PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari termed his father 's detention " political victimization " by the PTI government which , of course , said it had nothing to do with either the arrest since NAB is an independent body , or the case itself which was instituted in 2015 , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fathom the urgency with which NAB has taken that step considering Zardari had been cooperating with the legal process , regularly appearing before the relevant courts whenever required . <p> Understandably perturbed over the development , Bilawal held a press conference to vent his anger raising several issues directly or indirectly related to the arrest declaring it a negation of Article 10-A of the Constitution that guarantees the right to fair trial to all citizens . NAB , however , had moved only after the Islamabad High Court ( IHC ) cancelled Zardari 's pre-arrest bail , and refrained from taking into custody his sister Faryal Talpur , co-accused in the same case , despite cancellation of her bail because her arrest warrants were not issued till then . That though is not the end of the road for them ; they can go into appeal in the Supreme Court against the orders of the IHC and seek relief . As regards the issue of bias in NAB 's approach , the PPP has a point . There is the example of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NAB accountability court . Yet he was not arrested until the court convicted him in the Avenfield reference case . Zardari , on the other hand , has been arrested even though NAB is yet to file a reference against him . Surely , there are other examples , such as that of Shahbaz Sharif , former senior Punjab minister Aleem Khan , Sharjeel Memon and Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani who have been meted out similar treatment . But the PPP and its supporters are not so wrong when they rake up some unsavoury events from the past to complain of an institutional bias against the party and compare the manner in which NAB has proceeded in cases involving top leaders of the two major opposition parties . <p> These parties blame the government for using the NAB law instituted by a military regime .

" <p> Trudeau had angered Trump at the time with his response to a question about the tariffs Washington slapped on Canadian steel and aluminum . " Canadians are polite and reasonable , but we will also not be pushed around , " he said . <p> For Trudeau , Thursday 's meeting with Trump still has risks about four months before a Canadian national election . Trump is deeply unpopular in Canada , especially among supporters of Trudeau 's Liberal Party , and notoriously unpredictable . <p> But maintaining a good rapport with the United States , and keeping one of the world 's largest trade partnerships on an even keel , is considered the top job for any Canadian prime minister .

@@60935237 <h> The Issue with Korean Chaebols <p> During the past three decades , South Korea has enjoyed a major economic boom that has made it one of the world 's largest and most industrialized economies . The country was able to quickly lift itself out of poverty ( a result of the Korean War ) and became a source of large amounts of foreign aid and investments for numerous developing economies , particularly those in Africa and South Asia . Furthermore , within the last decade , Korean pop culture ( such as K-Pop , Korean dramas , arts , etc. ) have also become very popular globally . In short , South Korea has had some very wonderful three decades in positioning itself to become a prominent economy and source of investments and entertainment on the world stage ; this phenomenon even has a term : Hallyu ( Korean Wave ) . <p> However , despite South Korea 's economic rise and enjoying an increase in influence and standards of living , much of its prosperity has been attributed to a handful of conglomerates , better known as chaebols . Chaebols are large industrial South Korean firms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have monopoly over any single industry . Some examples of chaebols include Hyundai ( has a monopoly over South Korea 's automotive industry ) and Samsung ( has a monopoly over the country 's electronic industry ) . Even though many of them formed shortly after WWII and the Korean War -- having been modeled after Japanese zaibatsu , chaebols came into the limelight during South Korea 's economic and technological boom . And while these mega-conglomerates have been crucial to the country 's development , they have become prime recipients of public backlash in recent years . <p> There are primarily three issues with chaebols , that has turned popular opinion against them . The first criticism that they receive is that they hold a lot of sway in South Korea 's politics , policies , and governance . For example , Hyundai played a key role in serving as a mediator between North and South Koreas in the late 1990s , or how the Lotte Group was involved in the THAAD scandal two years ago . Another example is that many members of chaebols serve or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samsung scandal , it became clear that the companies have a strong grip over the country 's government and has also indicated to high degrees of corruption . And while the South Korean government has tried to take initiatives in trying to combat the influence of chaebols , it has had very little effect . <p> The second criticism chaebols receive is how their operations have fueled rising costs and increased income inequality . Although chaebols are run by influential families , the average worker does not receive that many incentives and many employees at these large corporations have been reported to deal with dismal working conditions , poor pay , long work hours , and an increased cost of living . This has widened the wealth gap in the nation , with these families becoming far richer and influential ( even sending their children overseas for education ) while the majority of the population has been reduced to living hand-to-mouth , with their education and job environments becoming even more steeped with fierce competition . This is further aggravated due to the fact that most of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of limited jobs available in the companies , people are competing with one another to attain those spots . For better comparison , the situation is somewhat similar to Pakistan 's medical college entrance exams season . Another issue is that because these companies are highly diversified and hold a de facto monopoly over their respective industries , small and medium scale enterprises have a much harder time trying to start up and survive , let alone thrive . Furthermore , as these companies hold a monopoly in their respective markets and are not worried about any stiff competition , many of their leaders have become complacent , export-focused , and risk-averse . This has further led to three outcomes : <p> 1 ) economic stagnation and high levels of bureaucracy <p> 2 ) the US-China Trade War would particularly affect South Korea <p> 3 ) foreign competitors now have an easier time entering and overshadowing both Korean and overseas markets . <p> The third and probably the most glaring criticism against chaebols is their stranglehold on the Korean economy . Chaebols have been known to hold very large portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one report , Samsung alone produces a fifth of South Korea 's exports and its revenue is equal to around 17% of the Korean economy . Another example is the case of Hyundai and the port city of Ulsan , located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula . Hyundai is headquartered in the city of Ulsan , and the company alone was able to turn the city one of Korea 's most developed cities and the city also boasted the highest per capita income in the peninsula . Chaebols are generally diversified , the same goes for Hyundai . The company not only is an automobile manufacturer , but is also involved in construction , cargo , shipbuilding , and oil and gas drilling . Because of Hyundai 's presence in the city , Ulsan became a major port city , shipyard , and a primary source of South Korea 's exports , and the local population of the city had hugely benefited from being employed by the company . In short , Ulsan became almost completely dependent on Hyundai 's operations , so much so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . This became further evident when Hyundai began to move its operations overseas . The company laid off almost 30,000 of its employees in Ulsan , sending economic and demographic shockwaves throughout the city . Living costs and unemployment skyrocketed , suicide rates increased , and much of Ulsan 's working population began to move elsewhere in the country for better job opportunities , turning the once-richest Korean city to the most rapidly-aging one . <p> For another example on how big of an impact these companies have on the economy , let us look at Samsung . In 2016 , poor production and political scandals that led to the arrest of then-President of South Korea -- Park Geun-Hye -- and the heir to Samsung caused the country 's GDP growth to slump and almost drove South Korea into an economic stagnation . And since Samsung alone generates almost 1/5 of the country 's GDP , its losses and decline would be detrimental to South Korea . It is also noteworthy that the ten largest chaebols own roughly 2/3 of the South Korean economy , while the top 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , if even one chaebol does collapse , it would have disastrous implications for South Korea . <p> This chaebol problem is not just limited to South Korea , but is rather commonplace in many Asian markets , including Japan , China , Taiwan , etc. , with all these economies being vulnerable to most of these issues mentioned above , with Japan being a very obvious case . Therefore , if South Korea and other Asian markets want to secure their economies and enact more independent policies , tackling and breaking the monopoly these mega-conglomerates hold , encouraging small and medium-scale enterprises to spring up , and encouraging self-employment and competition would be some of the necessary first steps to be taken . <p> The writer is a student of business at Forman Christian College , Lahore 
@@60935238 <h> Left in the dark , ECB policymakers divided on stimulus options <p> SINTRA : European Central Bank policymakers were divided on Tuesday , with some feeling powerless , after President Mario Draghi hinted at new stimulus measures that had yet to be discussed by the ECB 's Governing Council . <p> Draghi told an ECB conference the central bank would ease policy again if inflation fails to accelerate , saying that fresh bond purchases , rate cuts or changes to the ECB 's policy guidance had all been " raised and discussed " at a meeting of the Council less than two weeks ago . <p> The message depressed the euro and bond yields , in the process angering U.S. President Donald Trump , who accused Draghi of seeking an unfair trade advantage by devaluing the euro . <p> But conversations with six sources on the sidelines of the ECB 's annual symposium in Sintra , Portugal , showed that rate-setters had not expected such a strong message and that there was no consensus on the path ahead . <p> The sources , who have direct knowledge of the situation , said the possibility of a rate cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in passing and there had been no substantive discussion as the focus had been on a fresh package of loans . <p> Markets were unimpressed with Draghi 's message after the June rate meeting , however . <p> A further escalation of the global trade war since then and a string of bad economic indicators also suggested that many of the risks were already materialising , forcing Draghi to strengthen his message , one of the sources said . <p> CLEAR SHIFT <p> Indeed , speaking on Tuesday , Draghi said more stimulus would come if there were no improvement , a marked shift from the June message that the ECB would act in the event of " adverse contingencies " . <p> The sources said policymakers were concerned that Draghi was flagging his measures so strongly to markets as a ' fait accompli ' that there would be no chance for them to disagree with them in at the next policy meeting on July 25 . <p> But they added that , with a global trade war escalating and financial worries around Italy already high , there was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very little new information will come to light before the next rate meeting , so it would be difficult to justify coming to a different policy conclusion than in June . <p> Nevertheless , they said the debate about which measures might be implemented , when and in what order was still wide open . An ECB spokesman declined to comment . <p> Some policymakers favour a resumption of the ECB 's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase programme , others prefer a simple reinforcement to the ECB 's pledge not to raise rates for a long time and some lean towards rate cuts , the sources said . <p> POLICY MESSAGE FIRST ? <p> Several saw a change to the ECB 's policy message as the first port of call . <p> This could mean dropping a reference to when rates might rise , simply saying they would stay at present -- or potentially lower -- levels until specific economic conditions including a level of inflation were met , two of the sources said . <p> This would allow the ECB to maintain guidance for a longer period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . <p> Others favoured resuming purchases of sovereign bonds on the grounds that it would lower borrowing costs for governments , indirectly creating fiscal space for them to react to the economic downturn . <p> This posed some issues , however .

@@60937236 <h> Is the ICC biased against Muslim players ? <p> Seven out of the 10 teams competing in the World Cup consist of Muslim players . <p> Recently , while going through my Twitter feed , I came across a rather amusing tweet . It was by the former vice chancellor of the Lahore University of Management Sciences ( LUMS ) , Dr Adil Najam . The tweet names and shames the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) for being biased against Muslim players by making them play ODI cricket during the month of Ramazan and on Eid as well . <p> According to Najam , the ICC gave preferential treatment to Indian players by giving them ample time to refresh prior to the World Cup . But is such a critique of the ICC fair ? Is the governing body of cricket truly biased against Muslim players ? I do n't think so . <p> The Indian team came into the tournament right after the conclusion of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) . The late start that India had in the World Cup has already led to many believing that the ICC is blatantly favouring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arguing that the Indian team was given an extra few days due to the IPL ending later than predicted . While this may be , is this somehow indicative of an agenda against Muslim players ? <p> The impact of the BCCI on international cricket is undeniable , simply due to the monetary reality of the game . Decisions which favour the Indian board usually get approved by the ICC . However , this does not necessitate faith-based discrimination . The ongoing World Cup schedule was released in April last year . Thirteen months later , it has become a matter of concern due to its clash with Ramazan for Najam . <p> If this was truly a matter of concern for any of the Muslim players , cricketing boards or supporters , then it should have been raised as an issue well in advance . It seems strange to point out this issue once the tournament has already commenced . Clearly , either the Muslim players did not see this as an issue , or they simply lack some foresight . Despite the dominance of the Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council does include and represent players from across the world from different faiths . It seems unfair to lambast the ICC now when any of its Muslim members could have pointed this out much earlier . Also , keep in mind , even now , no Muslim cricketer competing in the 2019 World Cup has raised this concern . <p> Seven out of the 10 teams competing in the World Cup consist of Muslim players . Almost half of the players playing in the greatest cricketing tournament are Muslims . You 'd think if playing in Ramazan was a matter of concern for them then they would have informed the ICC of so . Granted , if the ICC ignored their requests then it is an entirely different matter altogether , but there have been no such reports of this being the case . <p> I do not see this as a malicious attempt to victimise Muslim players since it is clear that playing in Ramazan has not been a problem for the players or for the boards . Additionally , Ramazan teaches us to carry out our day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's against the very spirit of Ramazan to demand a period of relaxation due to an adherence to religious rituals . The fact that Indian players received extra rest days was due to their professional commitments , which they informed the ICC about well in advance . <p> It 's imperative to critically analyse what one posts on Twitter , and I feel that Najam has added to the hostility against Muslims in the midst of the already existing narrative that the ICC is overlooking minor cricket boards . The issue regarding Muslim cricket players is becoming unnecessarily controversial . <p> As a cricketer myself , the series of tweets is an insult to the gentleman 's game and to the spirit of Ramazan . As professionals , international players train hard ahead of Ramazan in order to build enough strength to play well , and expect no leniency in return . High profile players like Hashim Amla and Moeen Ali make sure that their teams do not suffer because of their religious practices . These players have been great ambassadors of Islam because of their professionalism . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a decline in Islamophobia among Liverpool followers since Mohammad Salah joined their team . <p> Nonetheless , perhaps a lesson can be learnt from this . In the future , it is the responsibility of the respective boards , players and us fans to bring to the fore any concerns which may have been overlooked . <p> It 's high time our trend setters tweet logically and cut down on rants which only further the narrative of self-victimisation . I believe that Ramazan has nothing to do with cricket , just like Najam has nothing to do with sports .

@@61124236 <h> Individualism leads to collectivism <h> Individualism leads to collectivism <p> ISLAMABAD : As the name indicates , individualism refers to the rights of the individuals and is centred around the self . Due to this reason , we tend to associate individualism with selfishness , whereas individualism can also be defined as being independent and self-reliant . We are responsible for our own actions and we can not blame others if things go bad . At the end of the day , one has to take ownership of their actions . In contrast , collectivism is defined as ownership by multiple people or a group . Preference is given to a group of people rather than individuals . So here the question arises that how does individualism lead to collectivism ? The answer is simple : ownership . Every individual takes the responsibility of whatever is happening in their life , good or bad . If this happens , then it ultimately leads to group responsibility i.e. collectivism .

@@61127233 <h> Email <p> FOLLOWING a legal battle , in which the apex court had given control of three major hospitals of Karachi to the federal government , Islamabad has now said that the health facilities will be returned to the Sindh government . This was decided in a federal cabinet meeting last month , the special assistant to the prime minister on national health services recently confirmed . The issue of the health facilities -- the JPMC , the NICVD and the NICH -- had become a source of discord between the centre and Sindh , with the former saying the Sindh authorities were not ' capable ' of running the hospitals , while the provincial authorities said that in the aftermath of devolution , Islamabad had no right to run health facilities in the province . The centre has said " financial constraints " are amongst the reasons it has decided to return the facilities to Sindh , while the provincial authorities are saying their stand has been ' vindicated ' by Islamabad 's decision to return the hospitals to them . <p> While the centre 's reversal of its decision should be welcomed , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wonders why Islamabad had pushed to take over the facilities in the first place when it did not have the finances available to run them . This indicates a lack of foresight and planning on the part of those at the helm of affairs in the federal capital . However , while Sindh has done a good job in spreading a network of cardiac facilities in different districts in the shape of the NICVD , there is no time for the provincial authorities to bask in their ' glory ' and savour this ' victory ' . The situation in many tertiary-care units in the province is abysmal , with critical equipment missing and a shortage of staff . The condition of basic health units and rural health centres is even worse . While it is true that the province is facing a funding crunch -- which the chief minister says is mainly due to a cut in federal transfers owed to the province -- beyond money , better management of health facilities in Sindh is needed . The provincial government 's stand may indeed have been vindicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure . If the NICVD , and indeed SIUT -- both facilities in the public domain -- can deliver quality healthcare to the masses , then other public hospitals and clinics can also be transformed in order to give quality free-of-cost care to the people of Sindh . <h> On DawnNews <h> Comments ( 5 ) Closed <p> Daanish <p> Jul 09 , 2019 10:25am <p> Sindh government has ruined whole province . <p> Recommend0 <p> Aamir Latif <p> Jul 09 , 2019 12:41pm <p> During appeal of Sind government in SC against SHC judgement , was federal government sleeping during 2-1/2 years if they were now financially not capable of taking over these hospitals ...

There were blunders , as always . For instance , Uzma Khan announced the winner of the Best Drama Actor category before the nominations were announced , or when Momina Mustehsan named the wrong category , sending the audience into fits of laughter . <p> PHOTO : PUBLICTY <p> Overall , there were some moments that we 're going to remember , some we would n't be able to sit through again and others we wished had happened . Here 's a quick round-up of all that went down at the LSA on Sunday night . <p> The ones we 'd like to remember : <p> We could n't have thought of a better way to kick off the evening other than Atif Aslam spontaneously giving us a glimpse of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first host of the night , actor Fahad Mustafa , paid homage to all the women of the Pakistani film industry .

We need to empower them , as much as we can . " <p> It was a great night for Iqra Aziz , who bagged two awards for Suno Chanda . But before she accepted one of them , the starlet spoke about how she believed in herself and that is what turned her life around . <p> " Before I thank anyone else , I would want to thank myself on how I never gave up on myself , " Iqra stated . " I believed I could do this and I did . I would also like to thank my love ( Yasir Hussain ) , who is prepping for his segment backstage . I love you !

" I responded , ' Well , I hope it 's never a comfortable watch , sir , " she shared . All we can say is , you go , girl ! <p> When Mehwish Hayat took the stage as the other host of the night , she made sure to take subtle digs at intolerance and how she hopes Pakistani society will become more open in the future . " I wish we live in a space where there would be a little space for my Billi ( her item number ) and my Tamgha-e-Imtiaz , " the civil award winner joked . <p> PHOTO : PUBLICITY <p> Speaking of Mehwish , another memorable moment of the night we definitely support was when her Chhalawa co-star Zara Noor Abbas joined her onstage and the two talked about women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and are the best of friends , " the two revealed . " Women need to lift other women up . That 's how we 'll grow . That 's how it should be and that 's how it is !

We were pleasantly surprised at how the former did n't say a single problematic statement throughout his set , unlike his previous appearances at the award functions . <p> PHOTO : PUBLICITY <p> Hina , as always , stole the show with her wit and charm . But nothing comes close to the moment when Yasir went down on his knee and pulled out a ring for his lady love , Iqra . Overwhelmed with emotion , the starlet said yes and the couple embraced amid crazy cheers from the crowd . <p> The ones we could n't sit through again : <p> PHOTO : PUBLICITY <p> While there was n't much that went wrong last night , there were still few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive . Here 's hoping we better sense prevails as of next year . Ahem , Sheheryar Munawwar and Feroze Khan take notes maybe ? <p> The ones we wished had happened : <p> Following all the controversies that have marred LSA 2019 since the nominations were announced earlier , with many of the original nominees bowing out of the running , no one really mentioned the root cause of the problem . <p> No one highlighted the #MeToo movement at the event and we really hoped someone would . In a time when issues such as sexual harassment are taking centre stage globally , it looks like Pakistan is still lacking a bit . <p> Though the show went quite smoothly , it was a bit tedious and forgettable overall . <p> Also , a lot of Lux darlings were missing from it entirely . There was no Sanam Saeed , no Ayesha Omer , no Ahad Raza Mir , no Sajal Aly , no Adnan Siddiqui and no Aamina Sheikh .
