They made promises to earn the favor of the gods and began with a new year . This started the trend of making new goals for the new year throughout all cultures . <p> Carolyn Aldwin who works at Oregon State University 's school of social and behavioral health sciences , said social media and peers can play a huge role in why people get involved in making New Year 's resolutions . <p> " There is a great study showing that people 's health behavior habits were at least partially a function with social network .

On one level , this is true , and it is better to have goals that you can clearly measure and accomplish , " Hooker said .

@@16315239 <p> With the Oregon state government facing a significant shortfall , the tight budget may extend to public university students . <p> Oregon Governor Kate Brown has released her proposed budget for the 2017-2019 biennium , which has the state in a major budget shortfall , and if the legislature approves it in full the public universities in Oregon will be facing their own shortfall . The presidents of all Oregon public universities had sought at least a $100 million increase in funding for the biennium , and received no programmatic increases in the new proposed budget . With the flat funding that the universities currently receive not meeting the increasing costs of state mandated programs and their own programs , universities may have to turn to cuts or tuition increases to balance their budgets . <p> " What we ( the public universities ) got from the governor was in the realm of $650 million , " said Director of Government Relations for Oregon State University Jock Mills . " What we told the governor we needed to do everything that we are doing now and not significantly raise tuition was about $100 million more than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in creating a state budget for the 2017-2019 biennium and it is just a recommendation to the legislature . Now the legislature will come back for their next session and begin to create the final budget based on the governor 's recommendations , as well as their own input . There is a possibility still that the universities will receive an increase in funding to cover their costs . <p> " The governor 's budget is just a starting point , " said Sherman Bloomer , the director of budget and fiscal planning at OSU . " It 's a recommendation and that budget was based on $900 million in revenues from all taxes . " <p> According to Mills , increasing costs to the universities are for the most part , driven by state mandated employee health and retirement benefit programs . Since costs for those programs are increasing and the universities will not receive any additional funds it puts the budgets of the universities in a tight spot . <p> With the governor 's proposed budget not having an increase since the last biennium , OSU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will have to find ways to balance their budget . According to Mills , the universities can either eliminate expenses , or increase revenues . Eliminating expenses would mean lowering funding to programs for students and faculty , or to eliminate faculty . And increasing revenues , means an increase in tuition for students who already pay nearly 70 percent of the cost for their education . <p> " When it comes to providing the funding necessary to provide education services we have two basic sources of money , either state appropriations or tuition money , " Mills said . <p> Oregon Ballot Measure 97 , which would have increased taxes on corporations selling goods in Oregon , was estimated to cover the major shortfall that the state is now facing , but would not have necessarily relieved the burden on the public universities . According to Bloomer , the measure did not include any specific appropriation plan and therefore may have not provided any additional funds to public universities , even though it would 've greatly increased state revenue . <p> " There would have been a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee it would 've gone to higher education , " Bloomer said . " The choices the governor and legislature would have to make would 've been different . " <p> The legislature will have to make its decision on a budget during their next session in February . The governor 's proposed budget will influence decisions , but is not necessarily the final budget that will be passed . If the legislature does not increase the funding public universities receive , then all of the universities will face their own tough decisions on how to balance their respective budgets . <p> According to Bloomer , OSU 's Budget Committee has been working with the Student Budget Advisory Council since the fall of 2016 to set up plans for multiple situations that may arise , such as a decrease in funding , flat funding or an increase in funding from the state . The two are working together to set up a mix of cost reductions , tuition increases and enrollment increases , all of which will depend on the level of state funding .

@@17390235 <p> Nafees Iqbal would never forget the day his uncle Akram Khan asked him to play in the National Cricket League in 1999 . " I walked across the road from my house to the MA Aziz Stadium with my whites . I went into the dressing-room , felt a little intimidated with so many senior players around . We fielded first , and Saifullah Magsi struck 170-odd . Soon it was our turn to bat , and I made 126 . My whole family had come to see the game , and it was such a proud moment . " <p> That was the first round of the NCL 's first season , about a year before Bangladesh played their inaugural Test . There had been two and three-day matches in Bangladesh in the National Cricket Championship , but it was sporadic . The NCL was formed to tick one of the boxes that led to Bangladesh 's Test status , and a few seasons later it was given first-class status . So like Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe , Bangladesh would also get their Test status before their domestic long-format tournament got first-class status . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Bangladesh Test cricketers to develop the skills , mentality and temperament for a longer period . It was divided into the divisional headquarters , meaning room was left for players from outside the main cities and towns to get a chance . While that has happened in the last two decades , only a few , incredibly , have come through the first-class system . <p> **** <p> Habibul Bashar was facing a senior pace bowler in the nets during the early days of Bangladesh 's first-class season . The bowler ran in , and suddenly rather than heading down his over-the-wicket path , he bowled around the wicket . Bashar was stunned , nearly took the ball on his gloves but it hit the top of his bat-handle . <p> " What was that ? " Bashar asked . <p> " You will play a lot of first-class and Test cricket . These things will happen once in a while " , was the response from the other end . <p> Bashar smiled and went back to facing the next bowler . <p> In reality , the senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of it , he bowled from the other side . He was known for his quirky side , so Bashar did n't mind . <p> That was a one-off funny incidemt but across the country , cricketers did try to figure out the longer version in those days . Some thought batting with a heavier bat would help them , others felt a lighter bat would give them the advantage . Those in Rajshahi figured it was fitness that would help them during a hot four-day match . Dhaka , Chittagong and Sylhet banked on their flair and talent , but that did n't last long . <p> **** <p> The promise of the NCL gave away far too quickly . Within a few seasons , it began to be referred as picnic cricket by players who would simply turn up for the matches and go through the motions . The money involved in the NCL was much less than what they earned in the Dhaka Premier League , the country 's most important competition for decades . <p> The intensity too was vastly underwhelming in the first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League had players facing pressure on a daily basis , there was a deafening silence while playing a first-class game . Those running the divisional teams were unsure what to tell the players even if they did badly . For places like Barisal , the same players continued for many years because there was no local talent being developed . When the talent pool dried up in Chittagong and Sylhet , the administrators hardly bothered . <p> **** <p> It was expected that Bangladesh 's Test team would benefit from the domestic first-class scene but it was the Dhaka Premier League and recently the BCB 's youth programmes that have had the most impact . <p> Bangladesh did n't have the advantage that Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe had - both countries played long-version cricket for a while before they played their first Tests in 1982 and 1992 respectively . <p> Sri Lanka did n't actually get official first-class status for their domestic matches until the late 1980s - i.e. long after they had got Test status . The premier tournament , called the Sara Trophy , did not get first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-day matches , played largely among the same teams that became first-class clubs . Additionally , because of its geographic location , Sri Lanka would often get foreign teams to visit and play cricket and those were considered first-class matches , while when a Sri Lankan team went overseas , those matches were also considered first-class . <p> In Zimbabwe , although the Logan Cup has been played since around 1903 , it only became a first-class competition after Zimbabwe gained Test status in 1992 ( so the first first-class Logan Cup came only after Zimbabwe were a Test nation ) . Prior to this it was not a first-class competition , but it did feature multi-innings long-form cricket . While the question on when cricket was introduced in Zimbabwe remains a debate , most people seem to think that the first game was played in 1890 when the white colonial settlers arrived in the country . Ever since cricket has been played regularly in various centres . <p> It 's important to note that while the Logan Cup itself was n't designated as a first class competition until Zimbabwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing first-class cricket regularly and of a high standard through the 1980s as counties such as Middlesex and Leicestershire visited the country , along with teams such as Pakistan International Airlines , Young West Indies , Young Australia and Sri Lanka in first-class games . Before 1980 , Zimbabwe ( or Rhodesia as it was then known ) took part in South Africa 's Currie Cup , and those games were first-class matches . So when they gained independence the same year , they faced a huge question : whether to stay in South Africa 's domestic first-class cricket competition - and risk apartheid-related isolation along with them - or to go their own way and exit the Currie Cup . They chose the latter . <p> The feeling from the players who made up Zimbabwe 's first Test team is that , while they think the cricket the provinces played in the country was of a decent standard , these first-class games against visiting sides were vital to the development of the national team . Some of the internationals who visited included Dean Jones , Bruce Reid , Courtney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the late 2000s , the BCB decided to pick teams instead of asking the divisions to do it themselves , in a bid to even out the strength of the squads . It backfired - the sense of competition within the teams reduced as players were not representing their regions , and hence cared less for the team and more for their own performance . <p> In 2013 , the then BCB president AHM Mustafa Kamal inducted all first-class players into a salary scheme and began the Bangladesh Cricket League , a more refined regional first-class competition . Created to spice up the first-class scene , the BCL has provided for a higher quality of cricket than the NCL . <p> Yet , there remains very little trust in players even if they put up a good show in the domestic circuit . A player either has to come with an age-group tag or has to prove himself in the A team , who rarely play . <p> Indeed , Bangladesh 's first-class scene is yet to impart value to cricketers .

@@19453239 <h> Simon Broughton : A quest for Sufi music amid war and intolerance <h> The world has entered a time of uncertainty ; it is observing uncomfortable trends as people flee violent wars and oppression in mostly Muslim-majority nations . <p> Xenophobia has been on the rise , in parallel with extremist terror . So as lives are lost and homes abandoned , what happens to the old way of life ? <p> Simon Broughton is a British filmmaker who began his career as a BBC journalist . His works are significant because of the immersion they provide into the enduring musical cultures of countries like Afghanistan and Syria . <p> He made ' Breaking the Silence : The Music of Afghanistan ' two months after the fall of the Taliban . Broughton has explored diverse sects to make ' Sufi Soul : The Mystic Music of Islam ' . <p> His last visit to Bangladesh was in February when he attended the Dhaka Literary Festival . As protectionism and Islamophobia shroud some parts of the world , he sat down to speak to bdnews24.com about the threat to cultural exchange . <p> Senjuti : Did you face difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your journey into Afghan music began ? <p> Simon Broughton : Before making that film , I did n't know very much about Afghan music . So , for me , it was a process of discovering . Of course , I knew something about Indian music and something about music in wider region , but it was really the first time I focused on Afghan music . <p> Senjuti : Yes , not many people know about Afghan music ... <p> Simon Broughton : And for me it was a really interesting way to look at Afghan history because each regime there in Afghanistan , since the Russian invasion in 1979 , had a different attitude towards music . The Russians were actually quite supportive of music , as long as that was not protesting against their activities . And then of course , there was the Taliban , who would rather ... <p> Senjuti : They were the first to ban music in Afghanistan ? <p> Simon Broughton : They ... they did n't ban it but they restricted some things and eventually they banned female singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually , the Russians , they forbade a lot of Sufi music , because it was religious . ( Um ... you know , because they were a sort of ' atheist ' state ) . <p> So , each regime had its own effects on their music . So , it seems an interesting way to look at the course of history of the country ; the music getting caught in the crossfire , as the world . And of course , when the Taliban came , this was the most severe ban on music there has ever been . They also did other terrible things likes banning women from education , you know , women 's lifestyle were just halted ... I mean the film is not very much about that , it sticks to the music . <p> But what amazed me was experiencing the hunger and thirst for music just after the fall of the Taliban ... I was there just two months after the fall of the Taliban , and it was just incredible , all these lorries came over the border with cassettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto blasters in the markets . It was just ... incredible . People said something before I went there like , ' it 's a bit early to start talking about music , there are other bigger issues than that that ' . And actually I felt in reality , it was exactly the right time to go there . <p> Senjuti : Yes , I mean , how can people live without music ... <p> Simon Broughton : Yes , it 's absolutely a question . Actually on a whole , people really had to ! Because , the thing with music , is that it 's so noisy ! ( laughs ) No , actually it was sort of a very brutal suppression of a human right . So , the sad thing is that , the film ends with quite a lot of optimism with what can be done with Afghanistan and you know , the situation has got really a lot worse . So , the optimism at the end of the film has n't been realised . <p> I mean , music is still allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy called Ghulam Hussain ) had to flee recently , because he was being threatened . He worked in a music school , he was teaching Rubab ... and he had to sever all those ties because his life was in danger . <p> Senjuti : Well , then you started working on a film on Syrian music and Sufi music as well . <p> Simon Broughton : Indeed , the Sufi film was actually the first one , after the Afghan film . And actually the Afghan film had fantastic sequences on Sufi music in Kabul . Um ... Naqshbandi , I think they are ... was fantastic ! And they had this guy who would really go in a sort of trance ... So it was very thrilling and amazing . <p> Sufi music has been a long love . You know , you are very familiar with it in Bangladesh ... these situations , when it gets caught up in conflicts with hardline mullahs . Sufis in Pakistan are in conflict with the extremists . <p> It seems , after the attack on 9/11 , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very important to show that , on a whole Islam is actually about peace ! Through these Sufi music we can show the world that Islam has also got a rich heritage of music , poetry and other forms of arts . And they still exist in the different parts of the Islamic world . <p> So we went to Syria to show in the film where Sufism really started . It grew out of the deserts in Syria . Well , in that part of the past , when it was n't called Syria . And we looked into Turkey for Rumi , because Rumi is the best internationally known poet of the Muslims . <p> And then India and Pakistan , the South Asia , with Nusrat ( Nusrat Fateh Ali khan ) and the others , probably the most famous Sufi musicians . We also talked to Abida Parvin . <p> Then we ended up in Morocco , it 's a really small country with an active love for Sufi music . There are no big stars . Like there are no Moroccan Nusrat ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his name is Mawan Hajj . But what you get in Morocco is lots of different ' Tariqas ' and brotherhoods . Each of them has a different style in music . Some of them are just locals , some of them have instruments . Well my favourite is the wilder stuff . There are these two ' Tariqas ' , who have this amazing wild stuffs . One if them is the ' Isawos ' . They really have this amazing music . <p> Another reason for filming in Morocco is that they have a festival for sacred music . Everywhere else we filmed , the music were in shrines and was part of the ritual thing . And then in Morocco , some of it gets put on stage . <p> In Pakistan we filmed Qawwali shows on Baba Farid 's Shrine and we used Nusrat 's archive footage , cause he died in 1997 . So we really wanted to show the on-stage Sufi music of Morocco . <p> Senjuti : You actually started your career in journalism and then ... <p> Simon Broughton : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the writing came later . <p> Senjuti : I think we can say that you have been to a lot of different cultural regions and you know a lot about this part of Asian music . <p> Simon Broughton : A little bit of quite a lot actually ... ( laughs ) <p> Senjuti : Well , that 's what journalists do ! Well , what I want to ask is , in your opinion , how do you think unrest and changing political scenario affect the evolution of different cultural heritages across the world ? <p> Simon Broughton : Well , it 's terrible . I think there are terrible examples of that . The worst example is the destruction that ISIS or Da'ish brought to historic sites in Syria and Iraq . The heritage sites belonged to all of mankind . They were deliberately destroyed ! Before that they had survived thousands of years ! This is a real crime . <p> I filmed in Syria , in Aleppo . What a beautiful place it was , what a fantastic city ! It offered a rich culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians and other minorities ' co-existing , living alongside each other in that same city ... the Yazidis and the Shias . And the destruction of that city and the horrible war going on there ... will we live to see Syria as a popular cultural zone again ? <p> Senjuti : Do you believe these conflicts can entirely eliminate the tradition of Eastern Sufi music ? <p> Simon Broughton : Well , I think these cultures are very resilient . You can say that Syrian music will disappear ... I think the society that has nourished it , is in danger . The multi-cultural society is disappearing . <p> Well , of course , you know , everybody ( except ) the Taliban needs music to survive . And of course , music will survive , in many forms . <p> And here in Bangladesh , a festival like this , seeing Baul music playiing under the banyan tree , I get a sense of the power of these traditions , which is very old . Well , Lalon did n't leave so long ago , it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human history , it 's apparently recent . But the tradition is older . <p> So , of course the politics changes music naturally and I get very interested in the likes of the Afghan music or the likes of Sufi music , where the world of politics and music coincide . That 's an interesting subject for me . Of course sometimes the outcome is not very nice . <p> Senjuti : How popular are Eastern music traditions in Europe ? <p> Simon Broughton : Oh , yes ! The Qawwalis are very popular . If you go to a Qawwali concert in London , you will see half the audience are south-asians . The other half are British and of other European nationalities . It 's a mixed audience . It 's great . People are open to different kinds of music . <p> Senjuti : That is where I get confused sometimes ! I do n't intend to attack you , but when is comes to the Brexit ' question , Britain has shut its door to both immigrants and refugees . And now , Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he also has taken up policies that say -- ' No immigrants , please ! ' So , do you think the US and UK , because of their protectionist policies , will miss out on musical collaborations with other cultures ? <p> Simon Broughton : Yes ... and I will say immediately , I certainly , did n't vote for Brexit . And London also did n't vote . The big cities in Britain , voted to stay . It 's mainly the rural areas that voted to leave . Sadly , it was the small majority that voted to leave . <p> I am very worried about what 's going to happen . Nobody knows what 's going to happen actually . ( About the laws of migration and so on ) . But the people will remain the same I think . <p> South-east Asians wo n't have much to worry about I think .

And it is bad news for all of us . <p> Senjuti : Let 's come back to you again . I think this is your third visit here . How do you find Bangladeshi music different from the other musical styles practiced in India and Pakistan ? <p> Simon Broughton : My favourite thing here is the Baul tradition . I think it 's really unique . In a way it is related to the Sufi music and traditions I know from the other parts of the world . The spiritual line is the same . But the sound is different , the instrumentation is different and of course the language is different too . Actually I would like to add a quote that I love . That is , ' Sufism is like a river , that absorbs the colour of where it 's flowing ' . It 's absolutely true . Talking about the Syrian music in Morocco , in Pakistan and in Turkey ... it takes on the local color . Same can be said about here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peacock head of it as well .

Reuters <h> The Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years on Wednesday , citing confidence in its outlook and a need to look through soft inflation , but said it will wait for more economic data before committing to its next move . <p> The widely expected rate hike makes Canada the first major central bank to follow the Federal Reserve in removing some of the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy after the 2007-2009 financial crisis . <p> Economists said the central bank 's statement suggested at least one more quarter-percentage point rate increase is in store for 2017 , with more likely to follow gradually if growth continues to meet expectations . <p> " I thought the Bank of Canada did a masterful job today ; they raised rates and they stopped short of promising another rate hike this year but they were broadly bullish on the economy which bodes well for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington . <p> The hike brought the bank 's official interest rate to a still-low 0.75 percent and boosted the Canadian dollar to a 10-month high . <p> Years of ultra-low interest rates since the financial crisis spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years , fuelling a housing boom that has recently began to falter . <p> The bank said in its accompanying monetary policy report that activity in the housing sector has abated , largely due to sharp declines in resales in Toronto and surrounding areas . <p> The central bank has repeatedly warned about the vulnerabilities posed by the massive consumer debt but was forced to cut interest rates twice in 2015 as oil prices dropped , sideswiping Canada 's energy-dependent economy . <p> In a decision that emphasized the lag between a rate hike and future inflation , the bank signalled it did not want to commit to a predetermined path of more hikes . <p> " Future adjustments to the target for the overnight rate will be guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook , keeping in mind continued uncertainty and financial system vulnerabilities , " the bank said in a statement . <p> Acknowledging the contradiction in raising rates when inflation is low , the bank said it will analyse short-term price fluctuations " to determine the extent to which it remains appropriate to look through them , " and noted temporary factors like electricity rebates have kept a lid on prices .

These backgrounds range vastly , from differences in family type to living situations to state or country of origin . Because of these differences in students , OSU provides several organizations and programs on campus to assist students in their path towards success in higher education . <p> Human Services Resource Center <p> The HSRC provides students with services that assist them with the effects of hunger , poverty and other basic human needs so that students can work towards their education without such needs standing in their way , according to the Human Services Resource Center 's webpage . <p> The HSRC works to help many different kinds of nontraditional students , including students returning to college after a prolonged absence , students who are parents , military students and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Carmen Wilson , a graduate teaching assistant with the HSRC . <p> One of the programs provided by the HSRC is their textbook lending program , according to Wilson .

" <p> One of the largest problems that tend to hold students in need back from achieving their goals is the belief that they are simply viewed as ordinary students , and that their needs are not acknowledged , according to Whitacre . <p> " All of these barriers to be able to be successful lie in front of this person , those transportation barriers , the technology barriers , even the ability to study in a quiet space , those are all barriers when you 're living in a homeless shelter , " Whitacre said .
