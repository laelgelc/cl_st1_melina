A decade of research shows that a rise in temperature of two degrees Celsius ( 2 ? C ) is a dangerous threshold , particularly for small islands and countries with low-lying coastlines . Yet , the world is heading in that direction with all the potential for the ruin of small islands and the destruction of human habitats on low-lying coastal areas in countries such as Belize and Guyana . <p> Throughout 2015 , the countries of the Caribbean need to scale up their participation , responses and advocacy in every international forum on this issue . The time has come for the appointment of a high-level figure to head-up a permanent team of Caribbean experts , including members of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre , to represent the region with a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heads of government -- should be responsible for several important aspects of this grave problem that threatens the existence of some Caribbean countries and the viability of all of them . <p> The latter point is not an exaggeration . For instance , the heads of government of the 15 Caribbean countries that constitute the Caribbean Community ( Caricom ) and Cuba declared in Havana on December 8 : " Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time , and we express profound alarm that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise globally . We are deeply concerned that all countries , particularly developing countries , are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already experiencing an increase in such impacts , including persistent drought and extreme weather events , sea level rise , coastal erosion and ocean acidification , further threatening food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development . In this regard , we emphasise that adaptation to climate change represents an immediate and urgent global priority . " <p> But , while recognition of the problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures are needed to move declaration to results-oriented action . That 's why a single , strong Caribbean team , headed by a high-level figure , should be given urgent consideration . <p> Among the matters with which such a joint Caribbean team might be entrusted are : <p> * developing a communications strategy for informing the people of the region and the international community of the dangers posed to the area by continuing global warming ; <p> * arguing for the provision of readily available funds to meet the costs of adapting to the effects of climate change , especially when loss and damage could be irreversible and permanent ; <p> * negotiating for international financing to build capacity for resilience to climate change ; <p> * establishing alliances with other countries and regions ( beyond AOSIS , the Alliance of Small Island States ) to argue for cutting emissions and providing financing ; and <p> * robust representation in the Conference of the Parties ( COP ) on climate change . <p> Two of the biggest polluting countries , China and the United States , have now agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , but it must become more than a headline-grabbing public relations exercise . There are still real and troubling doubts . For example , as the outgoing European Union climate chief , Connie Hedegaard , has warned , 2030 is a very late peak year for China -- the later the peak year , the higher emissions would be before that . She also questioned the value of the US 's promise to cut emissions by 26-28 per cent , compared with 2005 levels , by 2025 . She makes the valid point that President Barack Obama will be out of office in 2016 , with no guarantee that the succeeding US administration will honour his commitment . <p> The problems that the Caribbean region faces with climate change are real . But while governments have been attending meetings , making declarations and arguing their case , there has not been enough information within their countries about the extent of the threat that they face . This lack of knowledge and information has led to complacency at home and inadequate representation in the international community . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 to 14 , only seven of the 14 independent Caricom countries were represented at the level of ministers . And , while a single -- and welcome -- statement was made on behalf of the group at a high-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance , the necessary political weight and advocacy was absent . A single statement was good and important , but it would have carried far greater authority and received a much better hearing if it were clear to the other countries that the speaker <p> was a Caribbean-wide representative imbued with the power of heads of government of the entire region . <p> At Lima , the aspirations of Caribbean countries were dashed . According to experts who attended the meeting , there was " no explicit decision that Loss and Damage will be addressed in the new agreement " . Further , current pre-2020 pledges did not limit global warming to below 2 ? C , and there was no specific mention that the new agreement will address loss and damage associated with climate change . Even the elements of a new climate change agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that negotiations should have been completed by the COP in Paris in December 2015 . <p> In the year ahead , there is much work for Caribbean governments to do in the crucial interests of each of their countries . This work will not be done effectively or successfully unless the Caribbean countries , particularly the 15 members of Caricom , speak and act collectively . It is imperative for the Caribbean to have an eminent , strong , well-informed , and articulate political presence at the Paris ministerial meeting . Preceding that meeting the region should be speaking with one voice at the plenary negotiating sessions and in the several groups where policy issues are thrashed out . These include AOSIS , the Latin American and Caribbean Group , and the Group of 77 &amp; China . <p> Caricom has set up national groups and a single regional group on ' reparations for slavery ' headed by an able spokesman in Sir Hilary Beckles . That pattern should now be adopted in relation to climate change . If Caribbean countries are to succeed in a year 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there must be a strong sense of urgency demonstrated by collective action in joint high-level representation . <p> The alternative is to wait until calamity is upon the region . <p> Sir Ronald Sanders is a consultant , senior fellow at London University and former Caribbean diplomat .

@@4665235 <h> Columns <h> Projections for the Jamaican economy in 2015 <h> The Point Is ... <p> As we enter 2015 , by far the most important positive development for the Jamaican economy is the recent collapse in global oil prices . <p> Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi recently discarded OPEC 's decades-old strategy of keeping prices high by limiting oil output and replaced it with a new policy of defending the cartel 's market share , arguing that it is no longer in the interest of OPEC producers to cut their production , whatever the price is . <p> This shift is a direct response to the shale oil revolution in the US which , before the Saudi response on previous trends , had the US as likely to become an oil exporter before the end of the decade . <p> This shift in OPEC policy will not be easily reversible , as it is not just the return of the US to the position of top global oil producer -- in the process satisfying its own demand and becoming a net exporter -- that Saudi Arabia is worried about . More importantly , is the spread of US-tested fracking techniques globally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose economic lifeblood is oil , with the clear consequence that Saudi Arabia 's strategy , as the world 's lowest cost producer " the Central Bank of oil " , is to lower the oil price on a sustainable basis , rendering the further spread of global shale oil production uneconomic . In short , barring a major geopolitical shock , such as war , low oil prices are likely to be sustained in 2015 , and could even fall further . <p> This should have a dramatic positive effect on Jamaica 's economy in several different ways . From a current account sustainability standpoint , due to the huge amount of our overall import bill represented by oil , the fall in oil prices should allow the current account deficit to convincingly fall below five per cent as a percentage of GDP in 2015 , perhaps to as low as three to four per cent of GDP on an annual basis next year . <p> International investors regard economies with current account deficits above five per cent as inherently fragile and subject to shocks such as a disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by so-called " hot " money . The reduction in our current account deficit to a level that can be more than financed by " cold " money , meaning foreign direct investment , even without a foreign direct investment boom in Jamaica , would be seen as a huge reduction in Jamaica 's previously extremely high vulnerability to external shocks . <p> In addition , the direct effect of a reduction in oil prices , combined with its knock-on effects on the supply chain , should lead to a multiple point reduction in the average rate of inflation , as it will reduce the price of gasoline , electricity , and everything in-between . The depressing impact on inflation will be temporary , in the sense that once the oil prices stabilise and the price impact has fully passed through , the benefit will cease . <p> However , the fall in inflation will be extremely timely , as it should ensure that both the year-end and fiscal year inflation targets are met -- even undershot . Moreover , the inflation rate is falling just as the critical public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike much of the contraction in the current account deficit that has occurred to date , which has reflected depressed consumption from a reduction in the average Jamaican 's standard of living , a fall in oil prices is similar to giving everyone in Jamaica a tax cut . In the context of our still very depressed internal domestic demand , with Christmas spending looking even weaker than 2013 ( in real terms ) , this could be just what the doctor ordered for the first quarter of this year . <p> If the pass-through of the cut by Petrojam has not been complete ( as alleged by the PSOJ ) or if the oil price falls significantly further ( it currently seems to have no technical bottom ) , the Jamaican Government would be very wise to reverse the cut in the tax on gas . <p> The reason for this suggestion is simply that underperforming even the tax revenue floor -- which is significantly less than the budgeted tax revenue -- is currently the biggest risk to the performance targets of the IMF programme . Although Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dr No ' of public expenditure by cutting the capital budget to reach the primary surplus requirement of 7.5 per cent of GDP , he can not meet the IMF tax floor requirement by this means . <p> As part of the IMF package of 2010 , an ad valorem ( by value ) tax on gas was imposed at a rate of 15 per cent designed to raise tax revenue of just under one per cent of GDP by the then JLP Government . Later , due to the subsequent sharp rise in global oil prices , it was cut by one-third to 10 per cent as a partial , albeit small , offset to the rise in oil prices . At minimum , this cut needs to be reversed , which one assumes can probably be achieved without increasing gas prices due to clear lags in price reductions . <p> Depending on the figures , further falls in the price of West Texas Intermediate below its current US$55 a barrel needs to be captured through a special energy equalisation tax . In essence , the Government needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset both its current revenue underperformance and the reduction in tax revenues from the fall in oil prices , albeit those are likely to be marginal . <p> Assuming a way can be found to meet the tax revenue targets , and the Government wage negotiations with the public sector unions do n't destroy the credibility of the budget ( the absence of the old back payments in the next budget should allow a nominal increase that does not bust the overall budget ) , then there should be every reason to expect a reasonably stable dollar this year , meaning a relatively low rate of devaluation of around three to four per cent . <p> Both the tourism season and remittances are likely to be better due to a stronger US economy . The main risks are global ; meaning the US dollar rises against most emerging market currencies ( the return of ' King Dollar ' ) , combined with higher domestic US interest rates in the second half of 2015 affecting the availability of international credit . <p> There is a clear risk in 2015 to emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment capital flows to finance large and rising current account and budget deficits , particularly those with lots of international private sector dollar borrowing by their domestic earning local corporates . In short , the global carry trade driven by US Federal Reserve cheap money ( think of the equivalent of Jamaican companies borrowing US to invest in higher-yielding Jamaican currency when there is a sharp rise in the US dollar versus the Jamaican dollar ) is likely to reverse , with the usual potential unintended consequences ( a story for another article ) . <p> In Jamaica 's case , however , in addition to the falling current account deficit , overall private sector borrowing ( internationally or domestically ) is low , the central government is running a balanced budget , so we only need to roll over existing debt , amortisations ( debt repayment ) have in any case been pushed back , and investment by foreigners in our local money and stock markets is negligible , with net foreign investment in our Eurobonds only returning this year after a long period of net selling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as physically demonstrated by the visit of IDB President Moreno just before Christmas , and the slowing of capital flight to a trickle in 2014 , with signs of possible inflows in 2015 ( another reason for a relatively stable Jamaican dollar ) , the so far extremely tepid turnaround of less than one per cent growth in 2014 should accelerate to above two per cent growth in 2015 . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

It is like being emptied of all selfishness and greed . It is being crushed to the point of humilty . <p> Has anyone ever considered why the poor are often selfless and kind ? How many times have you heard of people in the inner city sharing home spaces sleeping on the same bed , sharing the same plate of food ? I once heard of a two separate sets of families that shared a single dwelling space , a one room , in the inner city ; one set would sleep for part of the night then get up and the other would go to sleep for the rest of the night .

" With such a statement as this I would rather be poor than rich . It is not a light thing that when Jesus chose to come to Earth from his father 's glories , he came and made his home among the poor . Yes , he did interact with the rich at times ; and while he did they were converted , but it was primarily with the poor that he was associated . <p> Oftentimes the poor are mocked for being poor , and especially where they chose religious convictions such as conversion to Christianity as their source of hope , they are mocked for living for a " castle in the sky " . But I 'd rather wait for a " castle in the sky " , or whatever it is considered to be , as " the rich man 's wealth is his strong city , " but the poor have hope and among them true humility can be found . <p> How many times can you ask the rich for something and get it . Moreover , will the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even all that they have - never . Yet I can guarantee you that you can find among the poor many who will give not only the very best that they have but all that they have . <p> It is no light thing that when Jesus said of thy widow , " she , of her poverty , hath cast in more than all the others , " because they out of their abundance hath cast in only a little of what they had . Last month , December 2014 , I read on the Internet of a man in the US who lived on the streets , yet when a young woman lost her ATM card he offered her his last US$3 so that she could take a taxi home . Yes , the rich will give , but not their last . <p> Not only that , right here in Jamaica , also in December , we read of a man in Kingston , ' Homeless but positive ' by Gleaner writer Jodi-Ann Gilpin , who could testify , " I am not giving up because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who lives on the street who acknowledges God 's goodness at all times and has decided , in spite of his tribulations , " I have decided that no matter what the circumstances , I will not bow .

This man is a true man of faith , a true son of Abraham , who expresses faith , hope and belief in God , even when he does not see the way how God will provide . This man , Miss Gilpin reported , " is confident that his life will turn around " . <p> Personally speaking , I can say I have been blessed for being poor . Poverty has emptied me .

My rainy day account is to take care of those among us who are currently experiencing days of poverty . The greatest investment anyone can make is to invest in the poor .

Yet the poor will have his last and give it away . <p> I have indeed found the truth , the blessedness of Christ 's statement , " Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven .

@@4680235 <h> Columns <h> Why has the port privatisation awakened a ' toothless ' TUC ? <p> SO , matters concerning the running of Kingston Container Terminal ( KCT ) have now been settled and it has been officially declared and signatures affixed to a deal that will see Terminal Link CMA/CGM take charge of this national asset , on a concession deal , for the next 30 years . <p> The journey to this point has been uncertain , bumpy and untidy , but we have reached this juncture . The Jamaica Observer and more importantly the author of a series of articles on matters concerning the privatisation exercise at the port , Mr Vernon Davidson , must be commended for the excellent journalistic skills and investigative strategies he employed in getting answers and responses from various quarters for the benefit of KCT employees and , by extension , the wider society , at a time when very little was forthcoming . <p> With the dust still not yet completely settled from the rocky privatisation exercise , and with the dreaded reality that some workers at the port will not or may not retain their jobs when the new company takes over in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which represents the workers at KCT , has now awakened from hibernation and entered the fray . <p> It has held representation rights for the workers at KCT since the 1980s , and has not distinguished itself , to say the least . It has become fat and lazy from a lack of activity . <p> To many persons working at KCT , the union is referred to as the ' onion ' because of its natural trait of bringing tears to the eyes of the workers . This ' onion ' became even weaker approaching 2008 when the global recession took effect , and it has lost its way since . For many years leading up to 2008 and beyond , it has been considered : <p> ( a ) A direct ally or arm of management , based on its spineless and reactive stance in negotiations for employment benefits ; <p> ( b ) A weakling in presiding over or participating in negotiations which have seen the erosion of workers ' benefits and standards ; and <p> ( c ) A novice at negotiations . It has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KCT , similar to that given to their counterparts in the industry , primarily those workers at the Shipping Association of Jamaica ( SAJ ) . A case in point is that in 2006 , salary increases were granted to workers at the SAJ for a three-year period to the tune of 11 per cent in the first year and nine per cent respectively for the following two years . The SAJ wisely accepted this offer and paid its workers accordingly . However , the workers at KCT , led by an ill-informed and misguided trade union , rejected the offer and ultimately lost out on that final nine per cent . That is still a feature of their legacy . <p> The TUC is also regarded as very reactive and lacks the necessary competence and skill to lead a progressive workforce . To be on call and to sit in on disciplinary hearings for unionised workers who have run adrift of company standards , and being present to complete a panel on matters of less importance , simply to give the impression of transparency , can not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A major contributing to the parlous state in which the union finds itself is the fact that it keeps selecting persons for staff representation at the local level who simply will not or can not challenge its hierarchy to deliver improved standards . The persons it selects for these roles enter the positions ' given ' and simply fall in line quickly , not wanting to be elbowed aside . <p> With this very poor track record , this union is not only seeking to assert itself but to capitalise on the obvious malaise , high uncertainty and low staff morale now present at KCT . This union , having been toothless and ineffective for years , is now seeking to recruit workers once neglected and sidelined , because the element of fear exists in terms of job loss at the port . <p> With the announcement by the Government and the April 7 signing of the concession deal , this once feeble union has suddenly found some energy . It is now hosting meetings with the staff -- a thing it has not done for years -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected staff members . <p> There are close to 1,000 workers currently at KCT occupying various positions . Of this number , it is safe to say 50 per cent do not have union representation for a number of reasons , including : <p> ( a ) the failure of the union to convince workers of its relevance to them <p> ( b ) the lack of an effective and decisive education programme by the union to bring members into its fold ; and <p> ( c ) its poor track record on many fronts . <p> So , with this very poor record , the union is now seeking to " organise " and recruit members of staff , for what purpose ? Now that the proverbial " deer are running scared " , why is the union seeking to gather them in one place ? Is this a genuine attempt at securing their jobs or is it about enhancing the union 's coffers ? <p> These questions demand serious answers , as they are on the lips of many workers . Some are simply too afraid and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about their own future and have no interest in the union as a body , neither are they interested in speaking out on matters concerning the union . <p> Two meetings were hosted by Professor Gordon Shirley on March 31 and April 1 at different time slots , rightly so , to give first-hand information to the general staff complement as to how the privatisation negotiations went and the final conclusions reached . Professor Shirley was quite thorough and engaging , and gave the staff a clear road map as to what would follow in ensuing months . <p> He made it clear to all in attendance that a feature of the deal reached with Terminal Link CMA/CGM is that all positions would be made redundant and also that most of the staff at the terminal should be maintained in suitable posts when the new managers take over the port . Most does not mean all , and that is quite understandable . <p> Based on the structure that Terminal Link will embrace , some workers may not or will not find a place . Secondly , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port because they may have pending arrangements elsewhere and are simply awaiting their redundancy monies to execute their plans . In addition , others may not be considered for health and disciplinary reasons going forward . <p> The staff at KCT is quite appreciative of all this and fully understands the change that is on the horizon . What they do n't appreciate is the attitude of the union and its posture at this time . Its seemingly unorthodox approach to subtly coerce disorganised or disoriented staff members to join its ranks now , in order to be ' on the right side ' when recruitment starts for Terminal Link , seems highly unethical , to say the least . <p> As a parting shot from its full control and running of the port , and considering that it will still occupy regulatory responsibilities at the port when Terminal Link takes over , I suggest that the Port Authority of Jamaica ( PAJ ) sit down with the union and have words with it regarding these concerns . <p> The PAJ should not abandon the workers at KCT , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , it should stay very close to the entire process , ensuring that fairness and equity are arrived at for all workers , be they unionised or non-unionised . <p> In addition , the Professor Shirley-led PAJ needs to recognise the KCT workers in a more significant way . It needs to acknowledge that the admirable peaceful industrial relations climate at the port is not an offshoot of any great work undertaken or done by the union , but due solely to the calibre of the workforce . <p> To a great degree , thee highly intelligent and mature workers know how to ' ride the tide ' and to ' see the bigger picture ' when called on to do so . These are responsible persons with families who have been shaped and held together by the time spent at KCT . <p> Full credit to all workers at KCT , from HR through to the Engineering Department ; you have held strong and remained calm through salary cuts and freezes . Through recession , smoke and storms , you never once brought the port to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CMA/CGM , feel proud and rest assured that you are about to engage some of the most educated , talented , dedicated and versatile employees to be found anywhere on the planet , and if possible , it is in your interest to retain every single one of them , train and place them in different roles from the ones they now hold , in keeping with your organisation structure . <p> These new investors need to recognise and understand that the workers now at KCT are all eager and willing to be in their employment and that they will give of their very best to ensure not only increased productivity , but healthy profitability for the next 30 years and beyond . <p> Terminal Link CMA/CGM can also rest assured that they will have a workforce capable of understanding and working through issues as they arise . The company should also be mindful that ' RESPECT ' is not just a word in Jamaica , it is a way of life .

With an annual economy of just US$14,500 million ( US$14.5 billion ) and shrinking , that 's over 17 per cent of our income that we steadily and constantly send abroad for something we can provide ourselves for free . That 's exporting almost US$7 million every wretched day non-stop never ending , taking no breaks for Saturdays or Sundays or public holidays .

" Epithelial diseases are like herpes infection and warts , those are the ones that live in the epithelial cells . They are intracellular organisms . They are virulent , meaning that they are very aggressive , and they are intracellular organisms , meaning that they go into the cells .

@@4705230 <h> The myth of man shortage <p> QUITE often we 've heard the clich ? ' man short ' , but that is not necessarily true . Men are not necessarily in short supply ; good men are , and therein lies the problem . Good men are out there looking for good women , and they , too , are having similar challenges like women who can not find what they are looking for in partners . <p> One of the reasons both men and women ca n't seem to find ' the one ' , is that both sometimes want a ' good man ' or a ' good woman ' with certain qualities , but they themselves are not up to scratch . Consequently a woman might find a ' good man ' but she either overlooks him or fails to keep him . <p> Some of the women who are complaining about their inability to find good men are simply not ready . Sometimes she fails to address her issues and shortcomings before seeking that special man , so when he meets her , he 's greeted with an unbalanced situation that he 's not prepared to deal with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ' will do what she needs to do to ensure he is not greeted with stress and drama . Some might say if he 's right for you , nothing will stop him from being with you , but the reality is that nobody wants to start a relationship characterised by stress . <p> Relationships are actually investments and they require work . You will be investing your emotions , time and other resources , and so will the other person . As a result , you might want to think of it as cleaning house to ensure there is room and the right climate for that investment . <p> Once you 've fixed the things that can be a turn-off , your value goes up . At the bargaining table you can sit with confidence knowing that you are a good catch for any good man out there , and yes , they are out there . <p> Here are a few reasons women are finding it more challenging to find good men . <p> 1 . You place yourself in a box <p> Technology has enabled us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be . Geography should therefore not be a restricting factor in finding a good man . Reach outside the box you 're living in and give that man an opportunity to find you . More and more men are looking outside their immediate vicinities for partners , so do your part and use the technology to connect with that good man who is looking for you . <p> 2 . Men are afraid of getting hurt , too <p> Macho as they appear , men want to be loved , appreciated and respected . If they do not think that they will get that from a woman , they may put up an emotional wall as a protection mechanism . So if you find a good man , do n't mess with his head , or the next woman he encounters will suffer . <p> 3 . The gold digger perception is strong <p> Men are finding it more and more difficult to trust women these days . The strong perception is that the majority of women are interested in money and material things . There are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's financial needs , but for others , neediness is a turn-off . So despite not having money for shopping sprees , at least ensure you can pay as many of your bills as possible without depending on a man . When he sees that you are not needy , he will feel safer in approaching you and he might very well give you more than you would have asked for . <p> 4 . Women are bolder and more aggressive in chasing men now <p> Women have become more bold and aggressive in approaching men they are interested in , and the traditional male who sees himself as the ' hunter ' can become wary of such a woman and question her motives . He might even think that you are taking over his role , that is the role of the pursuer , and get turned off . There is nothing wrong with letting a man know you are interested in him , but be measured about how far you go in pursuing him . <p> 5 . Good men do not want to be taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for granted while women spend their time chasing after no-good men who repeatedly mess them up .

@@4705240 @ @ @ @ The brain drain of our health professionals <p> Nursing can increasingly be characterised as a mobile profession . Thousands of nurses migrate each year in search of better pay and working condition , career mobility , professional development , a better quality of life , personal safety , or sometimes just novelty and adventure ( Kingma 2006 ) . <p> The nursing shortage is presently on the political agenda . It is important to look at nurse mobility within the context of the nursing shortage and to consider the paradox of unemployed nurses in our country within the great shortage and to examine the contributory factors on the migration of nurses from our beloved country , Jamaica . <p> Critical nursing shortages in industrialised countries are generating a demand that is fuelling energetic , international recruitment campaigns . Structural adjustments in the developing countries have created severe workforce imbalances , and shortfalls often coexist with large numbers of unemployed health professionals . <p> A nurse 's motivation to migrate is multifactorial - not limited to financial incentives - and barriers exist that discourage or slow the migration process . The migration flows vary in direction and magnitude over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> suffering systems <p> Health-care systems around the world have been suffering in both developed and developing countries . They have been struggling to meet the needs of the population they serve . One of the most challenging problems is that of shortage of health-care professionals , and , in particular , nurses and physicians . <p> The demand for and the size of the global health workforce is expected to grow substantially as a consequence of population and economic growth , combined with demographic and epidemiologic transitions , including ageing . These overall trends are accelerated by the need and the demand for health workers across the globe . However , the magnitude and rate of increase in demand and need for health workers vary from country to country . <p> Demographic factors are also affecting the health workforce . Recent reports point to increasing gaps between projected supply and demand for nurses in high-income countries , primarily because of ageing and increased retirements . <p> According to a report from WHO ( World Health Organization ) , it is estimated that Latin America and the Caribbean will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to North America needing over 10,000 by 2020 . <p> While there has been much discussion on the potential impact of the General Agreement on Trades in Services , negotiations to facilitate the temporary employment of foreign health-care workers have not progressed . Mutual recognition agreements have encouraged nurse migration at the regional level , for example , Protocol II of the Caribbean Community and Common Market , the North American Free Trade Agreement , and Nursing Directives of the European Union , this coupled with the fact that there is reciprocity of the Nursing Council of Jamaica with that of England and Wales . <p> The recruitment of health-care workers from less-developed countries has emerged as one of the main responses of developed countries to the shortage of health-care professionals . Nurses/midwives are increasingly recruited abroad in temporary or permanent positions . This has brought about a brain drain , resulting in less affluent countries being able to provide adequate care for its citizens . <p> Migration of health-care professionals from Jamaica , especially nurses , dates back to the 1950s . It was noted that between 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work abroad . The report at that time stated that there was a shortage of these professionals , which had tangible impact that would compromise the ability of Jamaica to meet their key health-care services , especially in the areas of disease prevention and care . <p> It is well documented that worker migration is a result of the interplay of economic , social , cultural , political and legal forces . <p> These factors are often considered in two categories : supply - push factors , and demand - pull factors . According to Labonte 2007 , these are some of the push/pull factors : <h> PUSH FACTORS <p> * Resource-poor health <p> systems <p> * Low salaries <p> * Deteriorating work <p> environments <p> * Inadequate medicine and equipment <p> * Poor human resource <p> planning <p> * Political tension and upheaval <p> * Security of tenure <p> * Lack of transport <p> * Diminishing social systems ( education , pension , etc ) <h> PULL FACTORS <p> * Available jobs <p> * Good pay <p> * Regular workload <p> * Reasonable conditions of work <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment <p> * Good quality of life <p> * Better social system <p> * Better opportunities <p> Over time , migration patterns are sustained through networks that provide prospective migrants with information about job opportunities in destination countries , as well as various forms of support to help adjustment after migration . <h> RETENTION STRATEGIES <p> What are some of the retention strategies we could use to encourage or retain health personnel in order to minimise the exodus of professionals from moving to the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom ? <p> Retention strategies can either be financial or non-financial . <p> Financial strategies should include : compensation for the additional work hours ; night-duty allowance ; allowance for housing ; allowance for equipment ; and maintenance of equipment ; and a salary top-up .

The election shaping up in Jamaica that will either take place in December or in January has precipitated a scrutiny of the health-care system . The tragedy of the deaths of 19 premature babies who succumbed to bacterial infection at the University Hospital of the West Indies and Cornwall Regional Hospital triggered a barrage of attacks at Dr Fenton Ferguson , the minister of health . <p> The journalists writing for both the Gleaner and the Jamaica Observer demanded the resignation of Dr Ferguson and later demanded the release of the full audit that Dr Ferguson had commissioned on the performance of public hospitals in Jamaica . <p> Not only did the media engage in this feeding of frenzy but the head of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica and the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce called for the " beheading " of Dr Ferguson . Suddenly , the Ministry of Health had become responsible and blamed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jamaica . Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller obliged and Dr Ferguson was reassigned to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security . Mr Horace Dalley was placed on the firing line of the Ministry of Health . <p> In the feeding frenzy , what was lost was a meaningful discourse on the state of health in Jamaica . In some respects , the audit of the system which was commissioned by Dr Fenton Ferguson before the death of the 19 babies draws a vivid picture of the hospital deficits islandwide . <p> From reading the report , the recurring shortcomings encompass all the hospitals . Now , hospitals are managed not solely by the Ministry of Health but by senior staff at the respective hospitals . There are also four regional associations established in yesteryear to oversee and bring some level of coherence to hospitals from a regional perspective . <p> What the audit reveals is the weakness of the structure . The hospitals delivered some level of care , but they seem to run on automatic pilot . The suites where surgeries are performed lack proper lighting systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be desired . <p> The hospital cleaning products were not properly labelled . Bathroom facilities were missing , toilet seats and sanitary napkins were non-existent . The janitorial staff needed training . The schedules for cleaning were not documented and manuals were often in short supply . <p> The public health-care system was grossly under-resourced . The hospitals were built from a previous era and needed <p> much reconstruction . The demands on the system were greater than the capacity to deliver in an effective manner . <p> The emergency rooms were inundated with over 400,000 patients per year . Many sought emergency services for injuries sustained from accidents and from intended fisticuff . An inordinate number of folks were admitted for stabbings and from being hit with blunt objects . About 600 in 2013 were admitted for gunshot wounds but that was surmounted by the domestic squabbles that reflected the dialectics of the sub-culture of violence extant in the society . <p> Despite the seeming chaos of the public health system in 2013 -- 26,666 babies were delivered in public hospitals , 79 per cent by natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that year , there were 17 deaths at birth .

It is also clear that the managerial oversight by the regional associations were not effective . <p> The departure of Dr Fenton Ferguson from the Ministry of Health should not be the end of the dialogue on health-care . This should be the beginning of a plan of action to fix the many deficits pointed out in the August audit .

Remember , as described in this column two weeks ago , most business travel can be accomplished on a regular B-1/B-2 visitor visa . <p> There are certain common business situations , however , that will require special types of business visas . Many companies , for example , need to send executive , managerial or specialised employees to the United States to work for a temporary period of time . This requires an L visa for intracompany transfers . The L visa allows an employee who is in a senior position to work at a US branch , parent , affiliate or subsidiary of their current employer .

Once DHS approves this application , known as a petition , then the employee can apply for the visa in person at the US Embassy in Kingston . As the application process can involve several steps and multiple documents , most businesses that seek an L class visa for their employee will hire an attorney with experience in preparing these documents . <p> L visas do allow for spouses and unmarried minor children to accompany or join the employee in the United States .

O visas are for people who are internationally recognised for their extraordinary ability in their field and P visas are for individuals who are being paid to perform at a high level in their area of expertise . Examples of a P visa might include a concert by a musician , an exhibition by an artist your company employs or an athletic competition . <p> In addition to sports , arts and media , O visas might apply to individuals who are highly skilled in the sciences , education or business fields if they are travelling to provide a specific service for your business that qualifies .

No big deal . " <p> Faced with general public opposition the authors had little expectation of immediately persuading the masses that homosexuality is a good thing .

A large-scale media campaign will be required in order to change the image of gays in America . " <p> Kirk and Pill outlined a six-pronged strategy to desensitise America . I believe we this strategy has been and is being used to desensitise Jamaica today . <p> Step one was to " ... talk about gays and gayness as loudly and as often as possible " . They continued : " The way to benumb raw sensitivities about homosexuality is to have a lot of people talk a great deal about the subject in a neutral or supportive way . Open and frank talk makes the subject seem less furtive , alien , and sinful , more above board . Constant talk builds the impression that public opinion is at least divided on the subject , and that a sizable segment accepts or even practises homosexuality . Even rancorous debates between opponents and defenders serve the purpose of desensitisation so long as " respectable " gays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main thing is to talk about gayness until the issue becomes thoroughly tiresome " . <p> The conversation in Jamaica grew noticeably louder after the University of the West Indies terminated Professor Brendan Bain 's employment as head of the Caribbean HIV Regional Training Network in 2014 . The man and woman on the street felt things had gone too far . Massive public rallies in Half-Way-Tree in 2014 and 2015 , in defence of traditional family , faith and religious freedom , confirmed the correctness of opinion polls that Jamaicans are far away from accepting the practice of homosexuality . However , for the astute , it is clear that lines have been drawn in the media sand and furtive efforts are being made behind the scenes to dismantle institutional opposition to the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender ( LGBT ) agenda . While the talk is not entirely open and frank , there are identifiable voices who have made it their mission to talk about gays and gayness as loudly and as often as possible . <p> While the talk was developing , Kirk and Pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to homosexual behaviour in the early stages of the campaign . " Instead , the imagery of sex should be downplayed , and gay rights should be reduced to an abstract social question as much as possible . First , let the camel get his nose inside the tent ; only later his unsightly derriere ! " <p> The two strategists understood the importance of the visual media , film and television as " the most powerful image-makers in Western civilisation " . They calculated that the average American household watched over seven hours of TV daily . Those hours , they said , " open up a gateway into the private world of straights through which a Trojan horse might be passed . As far as desensitisation is concerned , the medium is the message -- of normalcy . So far , gay Hollywood has provided our best covert weapon in the battle to desensitise the mainstream . Bit by bit over the past 10 years , gay characters and gay themes have been introduced into TV programmes and films ( though often this has been done to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be waged against religion . For Kirk and Pill , " While public opinion is one primary source of mainstream values , religious authority is the other . When conservative churches condemn gays , there are only two things we can do to confound the homophobia of true believers . First , we can use talk to muddy the moral waters . This means publicising support for gays by more moderate churches , raising theological objections of our own about conservative interpretations of biblical teachings , and exposing hatred and inconsistency . Second , we can undermine the moral authority of homophobic churches by portraying them as antiquated backwaters , badly out of step with the times and with the latest findings of psychology . Against the mighty pull of institutional religion one must set the mightier draw of science &amp; public opinion ( the shield and sword of that accursed " secular humanism " ) .

At the very least , Kirk and Pill give us cause to think in the face of obvious attacks against religion and the church in the Jamaican media and elsewhere . <p> The second step was to portray gays as victims , not as aggressive challengers . Kirk and Pill crafted a media campaign to promote the gay victim image using symbols to " enhance the plausibility of victimisation ... sympathetic figures of nice young people , old people , and attractive women were to be featured " . Again , a caution , " It almost goes without saying that groups on the farthest margin of acceptability such as NAMBLA ( that is the North American Man-Boy Love Association ) " must play no part at all in such a campaign : suspected child molesters will never look like victims " . <p> Steps three is titled ' Give protectors a just cause ' . Gays were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that straights would be encouraged to be their protectors . <p> Step four was to ' Make gays look good ' . Gay victims were to be portrayed as ever yman ; not the harbinger of disease at a time when homosexuals were being blamed for the HIV pandemic . <p> Step five was sinister . That was to make the " victimisers " look bad . " To be blunt " , said Kirk and Pill , " they must be vilified " . Professor Bain appears to have been cast by the Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coaltion ( CVCC ) as a victimiser . He gave evidence in a Belizean court case challenging the constitutionality of the buggery laws in that country . He stated , among other things , that men who have sex with men have a higher incidence of HIV infection than other groups . This was an inconvenient truth . Professor Bain 's separation from his job at the University of the West Indies at the instigation of the CVCC was painful , not just for him but for hundreds of thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selflessness of his life 's work . His job at the CHART Network was to train workers in the health sector to care for people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS .

Human rights is now a sexy topic attracting billions of dollars in international donor financing . The ability of civil society and non-governmental organisations to access that money is often linked to their willingness to do LGBT advocacy . <p> Nearly two generations later , Kirk and Pill are acknowledged as important to the success of the LGBT rights movement .

It turned out that he was a con artist , " Andrews said . <p> Both Allen and Andrews , however , noted that they were still willing to give a helping hand to persons who are genuine . <p> " I wo n't be cold . Sometimes the Holy Spirit tells me to give , but if I do n't get that feeling , I move on . I have lots of begging stories , been bitten a few times , so I 'm just careful , " Allen said . <p> " I think , however , that if people actually get dressed every morning with the intention to trick people , it 's a shame , " she continued . <p> For Andrews , he said he will be more cautious . <p> " I would not say I 'm completely against beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being more hesitant , I have to do a heart to heart , " he said . <p> Melissa Haughton , on the other hand , said she is completely turned off and will only give if she believes the situation is dire . <p> " Boy , my first instinct is to say no to the beggars who take it as work . I do n't like it , " she declared . <p> " There are very few situations where I feel in my heart that there is a need and they do n't even have to ask , I will just give . I avoid tricksters , though , " she said .
